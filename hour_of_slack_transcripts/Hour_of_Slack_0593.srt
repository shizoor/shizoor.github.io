1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
I'm sorry for what I'm about to do. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,380
Look, you got a nice good look.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,260
Look, I didn't do anything.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,300
You got a nice good look.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,220
What you did.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,940
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,500
Hey, come on, don't. It's not going to solve anything.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,940
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:33,840
As soon as you turn your back, everything in the universe snaps itself inside out with a hideous sucking motion.

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,980
Oh, listen to that slack, dear friends.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,300
This is it.

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,940
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

13
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,600
Right in your ear.

14
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,600
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

15
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,540
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

16
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:55,880
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

17
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:25,880
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

18
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:55,900
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

19
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,600
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

20
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,580
Yeah, a small day.

21
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,380
I might have a small day tomorrow.

22
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,460
I kind of doubt it.

23
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,100
But it's possible.

24
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,340
Small days.

25
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,940
Who needs them?

26
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,280
Yeah, if it happens, it happens.

27
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,620
Now I don't know where the model is or where the song should end.

28
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,460
But I wonder just how many wars have fought between good friends.

29
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,660
And those who gave the orders, they are not.

30
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,060
The ones to die.

31
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,920
It's Scott and Mac Donald and the likes of you and I.

32
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,540
That's right, dear friends.

33
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,480
You're in big trouble.

34
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,360
It's gonna be tough.

35
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,480
It's gonna be bad.

36
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,100
It's gonna be bad.

37
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,280
Oh.

38
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:39,940
Oh.

39
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,520
Oh.

40
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,920
Oh.

41
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,780
Oh.

42
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,100
Oh.

43
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,160
Oh.

44
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:44,820


45
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,120
Oh.

46
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,200


47
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,320
Oh.

48
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,380
Oh.

49
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:46,400
Oh.

50
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,400


51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,700
Oh.

52
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:47,840
Oh.

53
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,180
Oh.

54
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,180


55
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,180


56
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,180


57
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,180


58
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,180


59
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,180


60
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,180


61
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,980
Don't.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,240
See.

63
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,180
We.

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,720
Be.

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,800
In.

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,480
...

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,360
Let's make it work, sir.

68
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,500
You'll get a much better may tapping noise.

69
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,800
No, I won't!

70
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,700
mannersum a third way

71
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:09,500
Ultimately, what, what know ye of the purity, of the essence, of the прирty.

72
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Excuse me.

73
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,480
Did you say kill me?

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,300
I'm sorry I killed you, Fidgett.

75
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,840
You're very.

76
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:14,840


77
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,680
It's satisfying though.

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,260
Well, of course, I am the supreme being.

79
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,020
I'm not entirely dim.

80
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,140
I don't understand.

81
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,780
Well, you kiddies.

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,300
It's amazing that you boars and ghouls keep coming back for more.

83
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,880
You must be gluttonous for punishment.

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,900
Well, I guess you bloodsuckers enjoy being repulsed.

85
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,860
You're loyal to the gore.

86
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,840
Well, that's good.

87
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,440
We don't want any dead wolves in our fraternity of fright bands.

88
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,760
He's a drunkard.

89
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,220
Listen.

90
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,440
I feel the power of evil coursing through my veins,

91
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,660
spinning every corner of my...

92
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
being with a desire to do wrong.

93
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,200
We're about to start.

94
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,020
Get ready to play.

95
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,060
Follow along,

96
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,140
cause it's a wonderful day.

97
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,580
Welcome to the world.

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,200
It's a wonderful day.

99
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,920
Hi.

100
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,760
Sit up real straight and you'll feel fine.

101
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Sit up straight.

102
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,320
Lift up your chin.

103
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,380
Put a smile on your face.

104
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,060
Lift your chin and smile.

105
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,920
Sit with a smile on your face.

106
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,280
Get outside first.

107
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,780
Phillip Smith Throw an adversity's。

108
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:56,960
Rule number three.

109
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,560
Don't forget when the ball rides the wall,

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,680
you're gonna believe it.

111
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:57,700
The ball once it essentials are place freak.

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:57,960


113
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,660
Go mois sake,

114
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,060
in action.

115
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,760
The sun can see every blow.

116
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:06,760


117
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,260
the hell is that supposed to me you have to do some things and the first thing I

118
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,400
have to do is convince you that it is worth doing these things you have to do

119
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,920
some things the first thing I have to do is convince you that it is worth doing

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,800
these things now I'm gonna start out by convincing you that you have to do some

121
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,740
things and the first thing i have to do is convince you that it is worth doing these things

122
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,360
what the hell is that supposed to mean

123
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,740
now maybe this is just some sort of twisted game for you problem is you're the only one

124
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:51,300
who knows the rules ford's all i'm asking you to do is open your mind and look at this objectively

125
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:06,340
i would just like to say open wide now i'm coming to gobble you up

126
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,080

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,440
i will bust you down to sergeant so fast it'll make your head spin all right one of the two

131
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,680

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,720
you're giving us a chance to talk don't blow it friends give me a chance to to talk to you

133
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,720
actually i have nothing to say i i really want to get back to uh back to my computers they're my

134
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:27,140
only friends my little my big computers and it's a whole other world on the other side of the screen

135
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,560
it does my

136
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:38,620
bidding. I like that world better. They like, they love Bob more there in nerd computer geek land.

137
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:52,080
Actually, friends, I was, I was looking for a rerun to play, but, and I found so many of them

138
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,660
that I decided to just sit down and sort of collage together several reruns, but then I

139
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,500
got this tape from Yetis for Bob, and he had done, that's Reverend Phil there in Milwaukee,

140
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:12,380
had done this amazing collage, and we've got more of Hate for a Pink Planet here, which I'll

141
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:21,980
stick on next, I think, from Reverend Cthulhu. So, I mean, really, we're set. We've got, it's a,

142
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,460
it's a mind trip of a freak out happening subgenius slacky

143
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,640
thing.

144
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:37,760
It's a, it's wild and crazy, man. It's a wacky slack trip. God, why am I talking that? What,

145
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,640
what demon is possessing me to, to, to, it's probably the lack of background music. I don't

146
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,060
know, friends.

147
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:52,660
And that motive is best developed by recognizing the common enemy, and that common enemy is the

148
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,820
peak. I say that common enemy is the peak. When you think you and I are getting together,

149
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,600
it is because we have begun to realize that we have a common enemy, and the only time we'll be

150
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,180
able to come together with a common objective and a common goal is when we first develop a common

151
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,640
motive.

152
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,200
And the only

153
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:24,560
way to focus on that common enemy and the only reason why certain trying to move a party is to get rid of the pink

154
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,460
line between the two.

155
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:34,360
It's a getting all of an order.

156
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,900
Everybody thinks he's got to be with elixir delivery.

157
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,200
No!

158
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,180
We want to be separated from the pain.

159
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,520
In short, we don't want to be segregated by the pain.

160
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,100
We don't want to be integrated with the pain.

161
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,580
No!

162
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,460
We want to be separated from the pain.

163
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,400
Now maybe this is just some sort of twisted game for you.

164
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,560
Problem is, you're the only one who knows the rules.

165
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,460
I'm pressing the play button now.

166
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,440
Go! Tell me where you're on it! Tell me!

167
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,260
Down my throat!

168
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,540
Oh my God!

169
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,780
And now we're about to come to the religious beast, a living creature.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,280
Who?

171
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,420
Well, if they worship the dragon, let that be a bit of a clue, alright?

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,080
I'm ready when you are.

173
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,060
In a moment, we'll learn how that event ended.

174
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,440
Some people...

175
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,380
Some people may be very emotionally distraught.

176
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,300
Other people will be frantically running around trying to do something.

177
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,000
I think someone has been shot!

178
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,220
Ouch!

179
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,200
Oh yeah!

180
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,940
This is the confusion, this is Babel, to those that do not have eyes to see.

181
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,140
I can jump like a frog, I can hop like a bunny.

182
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,600
I can rock on my back, I can roll on my tummy.

183
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,900
But my favorite game for an indoor day is the freeze.

184
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,840
You are about to experience a totally new dimension in sound.

185
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,060
No lesser work than the overthrowing of creation itself.

186
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,680
We will remake man in our image, not his.

187
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,960
Let's not give them that chance

188
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:37,960


189
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:37,960


190
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:39,880
What's that?

191
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,740
Don't be so ...

192
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:44,760
What?

193
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:44,880
Don't do that toose.

194
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,960
Tike me off.

195
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,980
I'm not playin'.

196
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:59,420
Hi, Roman.

197
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,160
above all around you when you wear headphones.

198
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,060
X, X, X.

199
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,420
So, put on your headphones.

200
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,620
You should be hearing me in your right ear.

201
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,240
If not, reverse your headphones.

202
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,800
You should now be hearing me in your left ear.

203
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:23,200
So now, sit back and enjoy a new dimension in sound, the Kunskopf binaural sound experience.

204
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,840
X, X, X, X.

205
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,120
I, effective.

206
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,440
Done, done, continue.

207
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,660
Who are we?

208
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:56,960
I was born a, guava.

209
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,680
What, what, guava?

210
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,180
What?

211
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,400
What?

212
00:14:59,400 --> 00:14:59,400


213
00:14:59,400 --> 00:14:59,400


214
00:14:59,400 --> 00:14:59,400


215
00:14:59,400 --> 00:14:59,400


216
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,220
Why?

217
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,500
That's a good question, Michael Pepe.

218
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,120
Well, you know, dear friends,

219
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,120
it's sort of like this.

220
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,920
Now, children, let's talk about

221
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,760
what makes you so genius, shall we?

222
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,320
Yeah!

223
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah!

224
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,600
But before we do, children, let's get down.

225
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:34,740
Yeah!

226
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,560
Yeah!

227
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,580
Oh.

228
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,240
Usually, children, the Pueblo Wall in New York

229
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,960
preaches in a suit, but he believes that Southerners

230
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,280
know what a preacher looks like,

231
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,320
and I don't have to wear a costume to convince you

232
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,280
that I can preach a word of God.

233
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,220
Yeah!

234
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,320
Yeah!

235
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:49,460
Yeah!

236
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,080
Now, some genius children is obviously

237
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,340
someone who follows Bob.

238
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,800
He's obviously someone who needs slack.

239
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,900
He or she is obviously someone who's

240
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,200
a man of honor, someone who fights a conspiracy.

241
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,860
Yeah!

242
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,180
But what else is a subgenius?

243
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,840
Well, I've been studying on this matter, children.

244
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,540
The first thing you can say about a subgenius is that

245
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,240
subgeniuses are shy egomaniacs, children.

246
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,360
The next thing I think you can safely say about subgeniuses,

247
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,920
and the Pueblo Wall in New York is a subgenius,

248
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,320
is that subgeniuses can dish it out,

249
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,840
but they can't take it.

250
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,200
So, you can be a subgenius in public,

251
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,260
and subgeniuses will be uniformly misanthropic,

252
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,400
like this subgenius here.

253
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,200
Or they'll be uniformly withdrawn and apoclyphic,

254
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,720
like this subgenius here.

255
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,460
They don't like their fellow man or woman,

256
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,780
and they're extremely discriminating.

257
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,280
But at the same time, if you went to one of these subgeniuses

258
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,840
and you said, you're an a**hole,

259
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,800
well, that subgenius would go home and sob into his or her pillow.

260
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,420
His feelings would be so hurt.

261
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,440
Subgeniuses have very thin skin, children,

262
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,060
and believe me, the Pueblo Wall in New York knows where Avi speaks.

263
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,980
But there is one place where we do not have thin skin, children.

264
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,900
There is one place where we have the skin of an armadillo

265
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,500
on top of the skin of an alligator,

266
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,280
on top of the skin of a hippo,

267
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,660
on top of the skin of an elephant.

268
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,480
And do you know where that is, children?

269
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,720
That's when we confront the conspiracy.

270
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,460
When the conspiracy comes, children,

271
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,280
the Pueblo Wall is clad in that bob armor.

272
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,780
Now, children, children, children,

273
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,660
a lot of people, they say to me, day.

274
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,900
They say to me, rip, day.

275
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,700
They say to me, Pueblo Wall, New York City, day.

276
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,020
What is the most efficient and direct method

277
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,600
by which I can confront the conspiracy on one hand

278
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,020
and become a true subgenius on the other?

279
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,500
Children, children, children,

280
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,260
the answer is deceptively simple.

281
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,980
The answer is in front of you, children.

282
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,560
The answer is as near as a feed dog

283
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,360
or a crotch print on those children.

284
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,560
Of course, I'm talking about the book of Nassau, G.S.!

285
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,920
We printed by Simon & Schumer at 9.95

286
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,980
at better bookstores everywhere.

287
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,040
I guarantee you, you will never read every word in it, children.

288
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,660
Now, children, I think you all know

289
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,640
what happened on July 5, 1998.

290
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,440
I think you all know that that's the day

291
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,540
the X-Men come down.

292
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,720
And you know, children, the X-Men,

293
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,500
they're businessmen.

294
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,280
They're simple businessmen,

295
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,740
just like Bob is a businessman.

296
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,260
And all they want, children, is real estate.

297
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,320
They want real estate, children.

298
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,680
And they have a contract for the planet Earth,

299
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,120
the X-Men, and they have the means to repossess it.

300
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,300
Do you know who stands in their way?

301
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,600
Who?

302
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,140
Do you know who stands in their way?

303
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,720
Who?

304
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,540
Say Bob, children.

305
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,120
Who is it that stands in their way?

306
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,300
Who stands in their way?

307
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,700
Who is it that stands in their way?

308
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,720
Bob only stands in their way with your health, children.

309
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,160
Bob only stands in their way when you tithe to Bob

310
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,820
that which is Bob.

311
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,220
Bob only stands in their way when

312
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,720
you buy them a car, the subgenius!

313
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,280
9.95 at better bookstores everywhere.

314
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,600
Or you go to the table, where my will-o-law,

315
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,440
I buy T-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons, badges,

316
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:22,700
and a pair of shoes.

317
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,840
And then you arise, videotaped.

318
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,820
Now, children, a long time ago,

319
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
when the Church of the Subgenius began,

320
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
1998 seemed as far away as your day.

321
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,520
But now, children, it's only ten years hence.

322
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,640
Ten years hence, children.

323
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,080
Ten little years.

324
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,120
And you may, those of you who like to read Nostradamus,

325
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,380
think that plagues are going to be visiting us in those ten years, children.

326
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,980
Drought, fire, war.

327
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,560
But, children, the plagues of the next ten years

328
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,180
will not be externally derived, children.

329
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,400
They will be internally derived.

330
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,300
They'll be the plague of sitting at home

331
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,660
and watching your tape

332
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,100
when you should be making Bob art,

333
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,940
when you should be corresponding with other subgeniuses,

334
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,840
when you should be buying from Bob

335
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,960
and tithing to the sacred P.O. box.

336
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,920
The conspiracy, children, wants to break us apart,

337
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,140
make us function as that all-important consumer unit individual,

338
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,940
and get rid of us.

339
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,880
But there's a man, children,

340
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,960
a man with a pipe.

341
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,960
And he's waiting, children.

342
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,900
He's waiting to save you.

343
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,880
But it's up to you, children, to open your heart to God.

344
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,020
It's up to you, children, to let Bob come in.

345
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,480
It's up to you to see the value in God.

346
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,620
And now, children, in closing,

347
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,240
I'm going to quote from the great subgenius saint Lester Bangs.

348
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,820
I'm going to read you something, children.

349
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,580
This was written upon Elvis' death, children.

350
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,640
So be patient with me and listen to this.

351
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,500
If love is truly going out of fashion forever,

352
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,140
then along with our nurtured indifference to each other

353
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,440
will be a more even contemptuous indifference to each other's objects of worship,

354
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,520
like Bob.

355
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,520
We will continue to fragment in this matter

356
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,420
because solipsism holds all the cards at present.

357
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,120
It is a king whose domain engulfs even Elvis.

358
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,000
But I can guarantee you one thing, children.

359
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,740
We will never agree on anything.

360
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,720
As we agreed on Elvis.

361
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,160
But children, the fact is that just as this church has an infallible pope,

362
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,660
it has a fallible saint.

363
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,420
And in that regard, Lester Bangs was mistaken.

364
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,060
Because there is one thing, one man, one entity

365
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,760
we will agree on as we agreed on Elvis.

366
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,040
And who is that man?

367
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:37,840
Bob!

368
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,760
Who is that man?

369
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,660
Bob!

370
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,660
Who is that man?

371
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,180
Bob!

372
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,960
Who is that man?

373
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,600
Bob!

374
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,160
Children, that man is Bob.

375
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,560
And Bob is there for you.

376
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,700
Bob loves you.

377
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,020
Bob needs you.

378
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,760
Bob wants to help you.

379
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,660
Bob wants to fight the conspiracy.

380
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,860
Bob wants to bring you far.

381
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,440
Bob wants to grant you slack.

382
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,200
That's right.

383
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,440
With the help of the Reverend Ivan Stang.

384
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,480
With the help of Court Holland.

385
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,780
I'm forward, Court.

386
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,720
With the help of the Reverend Sternodocs.

387
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,960
You're going to help me help the Cali Lodge Christmas City First Climbers

388
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,920
help me survive Corral.

389
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,400
Come on, knock this wicked

390
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,120
kitchen out of the tarmac and bring the

391
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:35,480
brought, bringing the

392
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,020
Priest's Ogletedor.

393
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,960
Blah Blah Blah.

394
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,320
And he had to find a way to get this.

395
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,140

399

Yes, dear friends, we were just listening to Pope David N. Meyer

at the New Orleans World Science Fiction Convention in 1987,

401
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,160

416
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm a star

417
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,700
I'm a star

418
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,360
I'm a star

419
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,700
I'm a star

420
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,560
We don't want the end to come

421
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,640
We want to be honest

422
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,720
I'm a star

423
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,480
I'm a star

424
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm a star

425
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,280
I'm a star

426
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,080
I'm a star

427
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,180
I'm a star

428
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,420
I'm a star

429
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,160
I'm a star

430
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,700
Oh, yes.

431
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,620
We want to be separated from the heat.

432
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,260
In short,

433
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,780
we don't want to be segregated

434
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,460
by the heat.

435
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,600
We don't want to be integrated with the pink.

436
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,880
We want to be separated from the pink.

437
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,000
Cast off those crutches and crawl with pride!

438
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,420
Always the one who opposes your rights is the normals.

439
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,420
Normal, blue-eyed, blonde-haired, dance-melon normals.

440
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,680
He puts his club upside your head. He doesn't care whether you're a Methodist or Methodist.

441
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,740
But he does want to know whether or not you're a subgenius.

442
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,100
Because he knows if you're a Methodist or a Methodist, you're going to burn the other sheep.

443
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,300
You're going to sign love your enemy.

444
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,460
You're going to fight for your country.

445
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,440
You're going to pray for them that they're fighting to use you.

446
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,280
So he's not worried about you.

447
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,420
But he knows that you're a subgenius.

448
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,040
You're not going to turn the other sheep.

449
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,340
If you pray for them, you'll pray they kill them.

450
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,920
Or help you to kill them.

451
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,260
That's the only kind of prayer you'll pray.

452
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,320
Always the one who opposes your rights is the normals.

453
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,460
Normal, blue-eyed, blonde-haired, dance-melon normals.

454
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:55,760
Normal, opting out, all being us.

455
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,160
That's the only right that people make you.

456
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,120
If you pray,

457
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,260
Not

458
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:01,920
Or

459
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,440
You need a normal.

460
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,440


461
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,440


462
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,440


463
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,980
in the other team. If you pray for him, you pray that Bob kills him or Bob helps you to kill him.

464
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,280
That's the only kind of prayer you'll pray.

465
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,960
And our day is the freeze.

466
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
They'd say take the hose to all of them.

467
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,500
I might have, but the guilty one came into the room and stood before my desk.

468
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,440
Okay, I did it.

469
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,740
Was he scared?

470
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,740
Oh, terrified.

471
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
Well, then he ought to be thrashed.

472
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,400
No, if he needed a thrashing, I'd have given it to him.

473
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,020
I keep a length of rubber hose on my desk

474
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,420
for when the wind blows.

475
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,720
When that kind of punishment is needed.

476
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,500
If he needs it, you use it.

477
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,080
Well, I will, but let me explain.

478
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,980
In a moment, we'll learn how that event ended.

479
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,400
I don't understand. What happened?

480
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,660
This is a situation unlike any experience by modern man.

481
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,460
Yes, sir.

482
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,140
That's the, uh, 47.

483
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,260
E-I-E-I-O.

484
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,760
We're gonna quack right here and then quack right there.

485
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,680
Folks, you are looking at a real-life drama.

486
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,280
Quack right here, quack right there.

487
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,140
Uh-huh.

488
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,260
I gasped with amazement as I fell back asleep.

489
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,620
E-I-E-I-O.

490
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,380
E-I-E-I-O.

491
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:52,860
E-I-E-I-O.

492
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,820
E-I-E-I-O.

493
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,220
We're all late for work.

494
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,100
Come on, don't confuse people.

495
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,640
I was listening on the radio and probably two people crashed right now as you said that,

496
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,640
thinking, I'm late, I'm late crash.

497
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,420
We talked about doing it.

498
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,740
We talked about doing it.

499
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:06,940
We talked about doing it.

500
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,120
We talked about doing it.

501
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:07,420


502
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:07,420


503
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:07,420


504
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,040
We talked about doing it.

505
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,040


506
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,120
Yeah, maybe.

507
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,640
Maybe.

508
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:09,920
Maybe.

509
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,140
Maybe.

510
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,520
You know.

511
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,420
We'd leap up and bite ourselves in the ass.

512
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Are we not radio?

513
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,040
E-U-radio.

514
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,120
E-U-radio.

515
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,100
Did you say kill me?

516
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,220
E-U-radio.

517
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,500
Yeah!

518
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

519
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,480
Well, anyway, it doesn't matter how I say it.

520
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,060
It's just so...

521
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,240
Let's see you come out of that.

522
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,860
Oh, it's an ugly, ugly situation.

523
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,360
Who's making all that noise?

524
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,800
Who's making all that noise?

525
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,500
Who's making all that noise?

526
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,040
.

527
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,080
Who's making all that noise?

528
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,520
.

529
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,880
I am made entirely out of uncooked beef.

530
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,780
100% first quality top of the line beef.

531
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,740
Let them look, I'm proud of who and what I am.

532
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,480
I am made entirely out of uncooked beef.

533
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,540
I thank God for every day of the week.

534
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,340
I am made entirely out of uncooked beef.

535
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,640
Yes, there's the frap.

536
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,420
There's the frap.

537
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:48,500


538
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,820
There's the frap.

539
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,480
There's the frap.

540
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,500
At least let me have the frap if I can't smoke.

541
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,020
I'm ashamed to stand inside this place.

542
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,820
You say you gotta learn to swallow disappointments in a sad life.

543
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,220
I am so mercifully free of the ravages of intelligence.

544
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,460
No, son.

545
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,100
Robert, we must plan a new world together.

546
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,740
This time we'll start it properly.

547
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,240
And again in Ruth 16.23 we read,

548
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,600
For we shall gain great comfort from this,

549
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,280
that he who shall turn his head from the brightness of the Lord

550
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,940
shall have it loose from his neck.

551
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,100
And since we have time for today,

552
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,740
let's close now the passage from Ezekiel 12.14.

553
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,220
Pfft.

554
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:40,920
Pfft.

555
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,780
Hmm.

556
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,860
Busy, busy, busy.

557
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,740
Want a cup of coffee?

558
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,760
You don't have a bathroom, do you?

559
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,560
Don't pump me.

560
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,040
You know how things go.

561
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,000
Hey, hey.

562
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:52,640
Yippee!

563
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:54,880
Brr.

564
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:55,620
Pfft.

565
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:55,740
Hmm.

566
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,880
Busy, busy, busy.

567
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,780
Want a cup of coffee?

568
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,820
You don't have a bathroom, do you?

569
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,660
Don't pump me.

570
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,900
You know how things go.

571
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,000
Hey, hey.

572
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,260
Yippee!

573
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,020
Brr.

574
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,160
Pfft.

575
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,820
Everybody knows you run round town.

576
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,320
All my friends.

577
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,200
What you doing?

578
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,740
Way back.

579
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,920
Whoa, whoa.

580
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,500
Way up.

581
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,500


582
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,500


583
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,500


584
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,500


585
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,500


586
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,500


587
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,500


588
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,500
Oh, dear friends, that was Michael Pepe.

589
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,800
Okay.

590
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,920
For in those days shall be affliction, that's tribulation,

591
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,480
such as was not from the beginning of the creation.

592
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,720
I've just realized what a sinner I've always been.

593
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,420
By age six, he had made his first million.

594
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,480
Almost biologically.

595
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:54,720
In college, he met and married his first and still his primary wife, Connie,

596
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,800
who is now revered by female subgeni as the blessed anti-virgin.

597
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,600
With Connie's encouragement, the young Dobbs became a salesman of legendary

598
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,420
and almost frightening abilities,

599
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,520
known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

600
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,400
He worked his way up to the very top of the conspiracy ladder

601
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,560
and might have saved him.

602
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,680
But.

603
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,580
Late one night in 1953,

604
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,560
while working on an amateur television of his own design,

605
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,620
an event occurred which was to become a milestone in man's mind path to slack.

606
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,640
He was suddenly seized up in the spirit by the hand of Jehovah One itself,

607
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,860
the cosmic puppeteer of the Old Testament,

608
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,820
the wrathful alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy.

609
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,300
In this time,

610
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:48,960
he was given a timeless moment,

611
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,040
which we call the divine immaculation of the Bob.

612
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,280
Dobbs received the first of countless grain-curdling pronouncements

613
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,660
which form the sacred prescriptures of the church.

614
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,000
He was shown a vision,

615
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,080
a world where all humanity was equally wealthy,

616
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,680
rich beyond imagining,

617
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,460
but without working.

618
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,400
This experience,

619
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,360
combined with his UFO-given sales magic,

620
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,100
led him, inevitably, into the religion,

621
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,420
into the religion field.

622
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,520
He quickly discovered the golden rule embodied in his classic saying,

623
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,900
they'll pay to know what they really think.

624
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,520
The true subgenius can learn to think for himself,

625
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,940
but only Bob can show him how.

626
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:41,420
And so, Bob Dobbs founded his church upon a sandy beach of common sense,

627
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,780
sense of humor,

628
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,600
and dollars and cents.

629
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,300
Let's go over that again.

630
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,000
You say this,

631
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,020
this photograph was taken by one of our secret operatives.

632
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,020
It shows Ivan Stang in a rather compromising position.

633
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,300
I think you'll admit that...

634
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,960
Yes, that's right.

635
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,420
I think you will admit it.

636
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,180
Oh, wrong one.

637
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,460
Wait, let me see that one again.

638
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,880
Well, this should be submitted for your approval.

639
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,340
Aha, yes, this is Reverend Ivan Stang

640
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,820
in a very compromising position...

641
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,860
In a very indiscreet position, wouldn't you say?

642
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,500
...with a goat wearing a Ronald Reagan mask.

643
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,880
Not Mr. Stang.

644
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,080
Not Mr. Stang, but the goat.

645
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,880
And not his member.

646
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,560
I believe it's a calf, a bull calf.

647
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,100
But the goat.

648
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,180
It is a calf.

649
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,160
It's a calf, a golden calf wearing a Ronald Reagan mask.

650
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,660
There's Ivan Stang cow-matching the golden calf.

651
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,200
Now, you see something that is obviously illicit drugs

652
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,800
in a bowl placed below the calf's mouth.

653
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,500
The female calf.

654
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,680
And there, Ivan Stang, in an act of some type of degraded

655
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,020
and depraved propitiation to some hideous god,

656
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,880
some elder god of ancient lore...

657
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,840
You heard it here first on the subdues.

658
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,120
...remes.

659
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,260
Yes, can I say it?

660
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,340
You can.

661
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,080
It's late enough.

662
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,740
That's what he's doing.

663
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,260
He's viciously...

664
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,900
He's committing animal husbandry.

665
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,460
...until six o'clock in an hour and ten minutes.

666
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,260
...animal husbandry without the husband.

667
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,380
Yes, or maybe on the husband, for all we know.

668
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,260
It's a disgusting sight, and this is going to rip the church wide open, just like the

669
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,200
Swaggered Revelations, just like the...

670
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,100
Years ago...

671
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,600
...Baker...

672
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,500
...when the churches were fun and there were scandals and revelations...

673
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,360
...and the sun...

674
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,800
...it was a different world then.

675
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,740
...and the forests...

676
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,160
We enjoyed the show and hope you do too.

677
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,800
Fitting the show into the show hole, scrubbing gently.

678
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,220
...millions of years ago.

679
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,880
Jimmy Swaggered actually called me up last week on the phone.

680
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,880
He goes, Brother Stang, I've got to share something with you.

681
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,000
I have to confess something, because I got caught.

682
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,340
I mean, my conscience caught up with me.

683
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,960
I got a mighty big favor to ask you.

684
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,220
He goes, Reverend Stang, you remember that wild party you and I had with Jim Baker's

685
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,620
wife, Tammy, and those faithful young church secretaries in New Orleans?

686
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,400
And I said, yo, yes, sir.

687
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:07,200
He says, well, I'm ashamed to admit, I didn't invite you to the last one.

688
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,640
And he says, I went by myself.

689
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,040
And Brother Stang, they got pictures of me.

690
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,240
And I said, I know, Brother Swaggered, I have copies of those pictures too.

691
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,780
And I have some that are a lot more revealing.

692
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,320
He says, Brother Stang, that's why I called you.

693
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,340
And he goes, I may be a man of the cloth, but I'm also a man.

694
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,100
And beds are partly made of cloth, aren't they?

695
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,240
So I'm going to have to step down, Reverend Stang, for two years.

696
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,540
And the Lord told me you're the only one who's man enough to replace me.

697
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,380
But before you accept, I want you to think about all them lonely,

698
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,760
widder women out there, divorcees, young, confused church secretaries

699
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,640
that all need personal ministering.

700
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,980
It takes a lot out of you, Reverend Stang.

701
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,020
He said, it ain't easy.

702
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:07,020
It's tough asking people to be more than human and then having to live up to it yourself.

703
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:12,240
And I said, sir, with the power of Bob Dobbs, anything.

704
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,060
Anything is possible.

705
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,740
And Jimmy Swaggart said to me, who's Bob?

706
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:27,480
I said, oh, you know, down here in Texas, Jimmy, everybody's got Bob for part of their nickname.

707
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,180
Billy Bob, Joe Bob, Jesus Bob, you know, Jesus Bob, that's what we call him.

708
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,400
He said, oh, yeah, well, we're going to go on with it then, you see.

709
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,280
Take over my ministry, Reverend Stang.

710
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,080
Changing my ways.

711
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,260
Listen to this.

712
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,940
Listen to this.

713
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,240
Listen to this.

714
00:42:59,340 --> 00:42:59,900
Listen to this.

715
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,400
What I'm going to tell you now may shock some of you, but it's the truth.

716
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,220
I was in the rock music scene.

717
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,000
I was a part of it for years.

718
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,980
I was a musician.

719
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,820
I was a singer.

720
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,220
Singing about what the kids want.

721
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,620
The hip.

722
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,140
Speed and pop.

723
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,260
Sex outside of marriage.

724
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,220
Said old masochistic sexual techniques involving leathers, razors, and spiked heels.

725
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,220
Money.

726
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,220
The stink and the stench and the filth and the rot and the bondage and the darkness.

727
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,420
Sports.

728
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,420
Listen to this.

729
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,900
One of the greatest days of my life.

730
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,420
This particular night I was there with crowd control.

731
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,400
That coliseum was packed to capacity with tens of thousands of people.

732
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,220
Thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands.

733
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,340
The air was heavily laden with marijuana.

734
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,140
And it was so thick, you could get high in just a few places.

735
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,120
You would even get high walking through it.

736
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,280
And the scene was straight out of Banner's Inferno.

737
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,240
It was like animals.

738
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,420
It was like dogs sponsoring this huge.

739
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,980
Stravaganza will be some of the mightiest corporations in the United States of America.

740
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,220
But give my body to this group until it was black and white.

741
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


742
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


743
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


744
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


745
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


746
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


747
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


748
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


749
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


750
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


751
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


752
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


753
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


754
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,220


755
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,140
I mean it.

756
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,760
I'd get down on my hands and knees.

757
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,280
I'd give them anything they wanted.

758
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,240
They're like God.

759
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,020
They're even better than God.

760
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,580
Listen to this.

761
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,100
Listen to this.

762
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,640
To be blunt.

763
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:33,360
You will, after the show is over, you'll go backstage and let these animals do about anything they want to do to you.

764
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,140
So what?

765
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,800
It would be worth it to me.

766
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,040
Listen to this.

767
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,900
Listen to this.

768
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,620
Listen to this.

769
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,120
Listen to this, dear friends.

770
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,720
Listen.

771
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,120
Brother Swigert, what a man.

772
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,660
What a man.

773
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,020
Thanks to Reverend Gordon Truby up there in New York for that special edit.

774
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,580
But you know it's true.

775
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,740
It's all so true.

776
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,480
So true.

777
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,540
You know, the only part I meant to ask Brother Swigert about was the lasers.

778
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,680
When he was talking about leathers, lasers, and spiked heels.

779
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,740
I miss the laser part.

780
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,040
I know what to do with the leather.

781
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,120
I know what to do with the spiked heels.

782
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,860
Oh, I say do that again.

783
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,180
But the lasers, my friend.

784
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:27,440
Now, the only thing I knew what to do with a laser with was to take the front brain out of a bobby so that he'd follow orders correctly.

785
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,320
Yes, dear friends.

786
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:36,140
Well, Brother Swigert will be back in three months or two months.

787
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,000
I forget what it is.

788
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,220
Unless I can beat his record at moral failure and long-term success.

789
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:42,220


790
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:42,220


791
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,760
You know, I'm a big fan of the husband's sexual misconduct.

792
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,460
And I know that there's wives out there praying that their husband's sexual misconduct could be longer term.

793
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,740
About the only slack that I get anymore is worshipping at the holy temple of the Yoni.

794
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:57,900
And...

795
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,120
Oh, my.

796
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,440
Oh, my.

797
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:09,920
Oh, my.

798
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,400
Oh, my.

799
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,420
Oh, my.

800
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:15,420


801
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:15,440
Ahhhhh!

802
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,200
A stroke of chuckle!

803
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:26,840
The 부� unexpected tell a wise story.

804
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,880
I'm in trouble.

805
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,900
Again, when I'm looking at the taste.

806
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:39,060
Two or three times they grab me after calling a wife, and s- dodge me coffee.

807
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,060


808
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,200
ikumir Greater Ill afar, you need to think up possibleyo.

809
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,200


810
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,200


811
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,320
And men and women wearing the clothes of the opposite sex.

812
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,120
It's abomination.

813
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,880
And whosoever do it is abomination.

814
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,120
And there's more people today.

815
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,780
Their minds are perverted.

816
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,180
Their life is perverted.

817
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,700
And they've been given over to a reprobate mind.

818
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,080
So many people today, even people that aren't homosexual,

819
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,740
their minds are perverted.

820
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,220
It's filled with filth.

821
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,420
And it's filled with all the ungodliness and wickedness

822
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,840
that comes from the pit of hell.

823
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,240
And you see it on television.

824
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,460
You see it in the movie houses.

825
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,100
And you see it on the market stand.

826
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,580
Hey, and how about pornography?

827
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,220
In shucks, all you have to do is look around you.

828
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,020
Female body parts are available just about anywhere.

829
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,160
Or pick up some picture books with a free orifice included.

830
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,160
Miracles of Engineering, yours for the plugging.

831
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,920
If you don't mind the smell of vinyl.

832
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:50,700
The End

833
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,040
Now Mama's on the bottom and Papa's on the top.

834
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,720
Baby's in the crib, a-hollin', pour it to her pop-jump.

835
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,880
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

836
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,120
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

837
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,340
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

838
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,480
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

839
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,680
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

840
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,820
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

841
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,440
Yes, my baby knows.

842
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,060
Now sea is sea and land is land.

843
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,420
Can't get my boogie, I can get it by hand.

844
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,400
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

845
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,400


846
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,400


847
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,400


848
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,960
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

849
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,100
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

850
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,440
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

851
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,660
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

852
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,680
Hey, Bubba-ree-bob.

853
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:17,780


854
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,360
Yes, my baby knows.

855
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,620
Bob, in fact, is sex.

856
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:35,420
An all-encompassing sex that is the very in-ness and surrounding-ness of the union of both the limum and the uni.

857
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,540
Get the hell off my back and stop handing me that bullshit!

858
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,480
Hey no thicker.

859
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,640
resources on it

860
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,660
climbed out

861
00:48:47,660 --> 00:49:02,060
You said that so quickly.

862
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,820
What about you?

863
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,640
You got a bad

864
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:05,980
feeling,

865
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,420
baby?

866
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,760
I the power rules.

867
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,740
Yeah, seeت ultimate power in every oùs sword b ada.

868
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:10,980
But the very 수ł димоязийание is complete.

869
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,380
Hey baby knows.

870
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,640
with the accompaniment of the lovely Sterno Kekkenbrunnen.

871
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,580
Now then children, the first rule of the Church of the Subgenius is

872
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,020
the subgenius must have SLIGHT!

873
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,340
What must he have?

874
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,440
Right children, he or she must have SLIGHT!

875
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,940
The second rule of the Church of the Subgenius I think you know children,

876
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,420
and that is that too much is always better than not enough!

877
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,240
Can I get a too much?

878
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,500
What's it always better than?

879
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,380
Thank you children.

880
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,580
The next rule of the Church of the Subgenius

881
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,700
is so universally violated, it is broken so often,

882
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:08,620
so much violence in your face, especially in this convention,

883
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,720
that you can't believe it's a rule at all, but it is children.

884
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,160
The third rule of the Church of the Subgenius is

885
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,940
if you don't have a sense of humor, don't try to be funny!

886
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,900
The next rule of the Church of the Subgenius takes a little bit of explaining,

887
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,060
but I don't mind explaining these things,

888
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,560
but first,

889
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,520
I want to go too far children,

890
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,460
I should point out that the Pope of all New York doesn't practice what he preaches,

891
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,840
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to!

892
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,260
So the first rule of the Church of the Subgenius is

893
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,360
you will pay to know what you really think!

894
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,800
What do we mean by this children?

895
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,820
Well, let's say you want to go see a movie,

896
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,020
and you get your New Yorker in the mail,

897
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,840
and you turn to that Pauline Taylor Terence Rafferty review,

898
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,060
and you read what he or she has to say about it,

899
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,560
well you've paid to know what you really think.

900
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,520
Or let's say you want to go to one of the many lovely bars here in the islands,

901
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,040
and you pick up that free monthly music magazine,

902
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,680
and you read a review there,

903
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,160
before you go with children,

904
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,400
you've paid to know what you really think.

905
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:17,220
And children, when you tithe to buy that which is Bob,

906
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,460
your money,

907
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,240
again, you have paid to know what you really think,

908
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,500
but for once children, you will get value for your dollar.

909
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,220
That's right!

910
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:26,980
That's right!

911
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,540
Now that's the fifth rule of the Church of the Subgenius,

912
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,020
you've heard before tonight,

913
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,800
but it carries repeating,

914
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,940
it's a shameless row around for children,

915
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,000
but I'm not above it.

916
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,560
The fifth rule of the Church of the Subgenius is,

917
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,420
if they can't take a joke!

918
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,740
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,

919
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,120
and the leopard shall lie down with the cute,

920
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,080
and the calf and the young lion,

921
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,380
and fatling together,

922
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,520
and a little child shall leave the house.

923
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,380
And the cow and the bear shall feed.

924
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,380
Their young ones shall lie down together,

925
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,740
and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

926
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,820
And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp,

927
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,940
and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrick's den.

928
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:30,100
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,

929
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,940
for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,

930
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,300
as the waters cover the sea.

931
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,440
Yes, sir.

932
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:38,940
Don't you like me?

933
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,500
Oh, no, I like you.

934
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,640
I like you well enough.

935
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,040
Then why won't you keep me?

936
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,520
You're afraid, aren't you?

937
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,800
I'm not afraid.

938
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,760
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

939
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,320
it's my pleasure to pray to you,

940
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,140
somebody that's for the real people,

941
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,280
the down people,

942
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,900
the whores,

943
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,520
the pimps,

944
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,520
the man that's gonna do the best he can,

945
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,480
the man Dolomite.

946
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,620
Thank you, brothers and sisters

947
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,760
of the Fast Freedom Party

948
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,260
for nominating me, Dolomite, for your president.

949
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,640
I'm not gonna lie to you like the rest of those mothers.

950
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,360
I'm not promising you a chicken in every pot.

951
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,280
I'm not coming to you with no heavy heart.

952
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,080
I'm not promising to make everything perfectly clear.

953
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,720
I'm not promising you a damn thing.

954
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,200
But if I am elected,

955
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,540
I promise to legalize prostitution,

956
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,900
legalize marijuana,

957
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,200
legalize stealing,

958
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,360
legalize stealing,

959
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,540
and any other thing you want to do.

960
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,060
You heard me, and you heard me right.

961
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,660
I'm gonna be running this country

962
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,980
as President Dolomite.

963
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,060
Because I'll have a constitution

964
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,640
to legalize prostitution.

965
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,000
Fantastic things have already happened,

966
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,960
and more are getting ready to happen.

967
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,580
This is because the planet on which you're residing

968
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,900
has entered the space age.

969
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,620
You are a most unusual individual,

970
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,620
and decidedly in the minority.

971
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,700
Oh, another victim of confusion?

972
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:31,580
Decidedly.

973
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,700
I remember I was talking to a little girl the other day

974
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,080
who was in high school,

975
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,500
and she told me she had heard

976
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,360
they taught her all about communism in high school.

977
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,320
And they taught her all about Jesus.

978
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,100
And oh yeah, she knew all about illicit drugs

979
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,520
and how to smoke pot.

980
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,740
She hadn't heard anything about the word of Bob,

981
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,340
or the bleeding head of the World Cup golfer.

982
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,740
It's just disgusting what the sexual chauvinists

983
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,800
have done in our public school.

984
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:03,740
Friends, it is disgusting,

985
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,800
but you, you can break the horrible pattern.

986
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,180
You can learn about Bob

987
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,700
by writing forth a free information.

988
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,040
Information.

989
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,620
Got that pencil ready?

990
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,160
Just ask Bob

991
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:32,380
at post office box 140306

992
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:38,900
in beautiful Dallas, Texas 75214.

993
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:46,860
That's Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

994
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,740
Dallas, Texas 75214.

995
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,280
Dallas, Texas 75214.

996
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:07,080
Or email slack at subgenius.com.

997
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,720
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

998
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:25,140
And I am going to count to three.

999
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,100
And when I count to three,

1000
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,920
I would like you to visualize,

1001
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:34,300
to see those plates filled with those anxieties

1002
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,760
and worries and things,

1003
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,960
knowing that they are going to be lifted off

1004
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,660
and that they are going to be taken care of.

1005
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,120
For they shall see, God.

1006
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,260
Get still.

1007
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,740
Cast off the straitjacket of hyper normality.

1008
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:49,860
Die.

1009
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,020
All of you suffering slackless souls in the radio audience,

1010
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,660
I want you to hear me now.

1011
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,080
The conspiracy is trying to keep the healing powers

1012
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,600
of slack enhancement therapy away from you.

1013
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,960
Tune us in on the radio, die.

1014
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,500
We got charisma, we got style.

1015
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,040
Well, people, we'll make you feel better for a while.

1016
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:14,660
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

1017
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,900
Aborted fetuses that we rescued, huh?

1018
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:20,940
Immortality.

1019
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,240
Oh, come on.

1020
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,200
Well, here they come.

1021
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:26,880
Stay down, here they come.

1022
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,020
Scary little ugly things.

1023
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,220
That's a heliopter.

1024
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,260
I don't understand why our own church sends these things in

1025
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,740
to try to kill us on our own show.

1026
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,780
Well, it's part of the dogma.

1027
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,140
Your own show will try to kill thee.

1028
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,220
If I can't talk, I'll vote.

1029
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,060
How do I know I can't think anymore?

1030
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,580
Because that's the way it is.

1031
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,860
Just trying to remember something.

1032
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,940
Oh, I can't breathe anymore.

1033
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,480
What did you say?

1034
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,320
I can't breathe.

1035
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,400
I don't understand.

1036
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,640
Oh, yeah, I've seen people do that.

1037
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,160
They think they need more.

1038
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,600
You must be thankful.

1039
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,300
As soon as you turn your back,

1040
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,480
everything in the universe snaps itself inside out

1041
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,200
with a hideous sucking motion.

1042
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,820
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible

1043
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,620
is because it is only through the world

1044
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,500
that you know the concept of impossibility.

1045
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,240
You have been led to believe that everyone feels

1046
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,240
he or she may be the only living consciousness.

1047
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,200
But you are in fact the only one for whom this is true.

1048
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,040
The fundamental structure of reality

1049
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,780
is totally transformed every instant.

1050
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,840
But it provides you with a phony memory

1051
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,660
that it has always been the way it is.

1052
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,600
Since you are always the same,

1053
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,760
you are always at the exact center of an infinity.

1054
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:55,920
There is no such thing as movement, location, space, or time.

1055
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,940
You are a row of electrochemical events

1056
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,440
taking place in your cerebrum.

1057
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,380
Nothing has meaning in itself,

1058
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,020
but everything can support any meaning.

1059
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,640
If you could glimpse for even a moment

1060
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,340
the real meaning of existence,

1061
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,600
your brain would be neuroanatomically

1062
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:17,860
destroyed.

1063
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,900
You cannot conceive a thing

1064
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,960
for which you do not have a word.

1065
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,340
Everyone's perception is radically unique,

1066
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,240
but leads them to believe

1067
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,820
it is more or less similar for everyone else.

1068
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,400
You have always been listening to this tape.

1069
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,280
You cannot remember a time before you were born

1070
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,620
because there was no such time,

1071
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,900
nor any other.

1072
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,120
It has always been this moment.

1073
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:55,080
Death could occur inexplicably any second.

1074
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,360
The oddness of the world

1075
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,860
exceeds the imagination by an infinity.

1076
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,980
It has produced this talking about it,

1077
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:05,460
this talker,

1078
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,280
this labeling of it,

1079
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,620
this labeler,

1080
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,760
the concept of labeling,

1081
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,200
the concept of oddness,

1082
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,620
the word oddness.

1083
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,040
The concept of a word,

1084
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,960
the word word,

1085
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,020
the word concept,

1086
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,180
and the concept of a concept.

1087
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,860
Consciousness is not a continuous state,

1088
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,980
but a momentary surfacing for variable periods

1089
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,240
at random points.

1090
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,220
Your next awakening could be 20 years from now.

1091
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,620
Nothing can be proven to be true.

1092
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,900
Because reality is composed of...

1093
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,660
only small moments.

1094
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,500
There is no such thing as an event.
