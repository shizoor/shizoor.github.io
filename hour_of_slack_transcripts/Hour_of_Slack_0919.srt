1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
You probably thought this song was about you.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:12,960
Fruit flies, to tell the truth, because by creating mutant fruit flies with an impaired capacity to suck up the salt,

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:24,040
scientists have now identified several genes, designer genes, that contribute to this crucial sensory system in insects.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,240
Hello? Yeah, we're in here. We're doing the show.

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,620
Designer genes.

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,960
Yes, they're very tiny, but the insects can wear them.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,200
How do they make them that small?

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,820
They have assembly lines in sweatshops.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,620
In foreign countries.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:48,020
Tiny children with extremely good eyesight manufacture the Jordache genes for the Orthoptera, Choleoptera, and Edentia.

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,660
Everybody's welcome in here, all persuasions and ethnic origins.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,280
A customized pair of designer genes for the centipede, which has so many pant legs.

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,240
It causes an entire set of...

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,240
It takes a while to get one of those pair of pants made, I believe.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,460
You know, something they have to concentrate on.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,700
Spend a lot of time. Sometimes it takes several generations to generate.

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,080
...start thinking it seems to hang on...

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,160
At any rate, you see the salt...

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,880
No problem.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,000
...has tested...

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,500
All right.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,400
...the material.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,180
There we go.

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,240
...the iron channel...

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,380
Usually, radio announcements merely recommend a product, but this station provides its clients with a special service.

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,800
The Salt Genius.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Our host...

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,340
...Squatch.

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,760
In the radio studios of Bob, the technicians, the entertainers, the commentators, the administrative personnel...

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,760
...daily unite their efforts in the creation of programs to please and entertain a vast radio public.

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,000
The wide variety of broadcasts include group discussions...

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,900
...political speeches...

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,520
...and comedy.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,260
On this program, frank opinions are expressed in response to their leaders' questioning.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,140
Questions of the day are discussed, and opinions and attitudes freely expressed on issues of the moment.

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,160
For there is keen interest in a radio program that invites personal participation by the public.

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,540
This is independent radio in a democracy.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,600
Thank you to the mission of...

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,440
Your time is fast approaching.

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,480
So they say.

41
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,820
Your cycle has ended.

42
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,960
And those who are in the know will be alive for a shower of riches, wealth, and power.

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,740
Oh boy, sign me up.

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,520
Yee-haw!

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,000
When the prophecies of hundreds of madmen and kooks from time immemorial come to pass.

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,800
And when you join, you'll get two spare car keys as well as credit card keys.

47
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,140
These keys are made especially for your car door.

48
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,820
Many makes and months.

49
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,440
They are as thin as a credit card.

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,860
And they slip neatly into your wife or her bra.

51
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,060
And you never ever get locked out of your vehicle again.

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,660
What kind of a bargain is that?

53
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,340
And only the Church of the Subgenius brings you this astonishing extra.

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:19,480
Which looks hidden like an Easter egg in the vast design of subgenius artifacts.

55
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,280
Subgenius Artifacts.

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,160
And it's a money back guarantee.

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,980
Yee-haw!

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,080
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

59
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,680
And if you order today, you'll get Bub L. Butt.

60
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,540
Not only blows bubbles from his behind, but makes farting noises at the same time.

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,300
He's a one-man entertainment center who will keep everyone amused by his multi-talented tricks.

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:51,260
To activate your farting noise humor, mail Express Activation Card 1138 to flatulencesubgenius.com.

63
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,260


64
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,660
You can take a look at his every move.

65
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,140
And if you want to get a good deal, he's got a free

66
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,140


67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,760
Yes.

68
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:02,620
This is one of four hours of slack that'll culminate in number 99.

69
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,120
All about our friends from out of space and x-day.

70
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,460
I have to do all of these shows at once fast.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,700
And so they might all start out the exact same way.

72
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,180
Because they're all composed of the same four basic parts.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,240


74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,720
each of which, of course, has its own 500 insane, totally new parts.

75
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:33,060
The first of these would be the ancient, and I mean truly ancient,

76
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,640
subgenius media barrage tape number two about UFOs and Bob,

77
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,760
which was assembled in 1981 by the very earliest, most primitive subgenius doctors

78
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,360
working under even more primitive conditions under Bob.

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,380
You will hear or possibly have heard the infant Philodrumon, baby puzzling evidence,

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:03,480
little glass madness, teeny tiny versions of old, long gone dead subgeniuses

81
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,920
such as David Boone and Dr. X.

82
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,060
May they rest in peace.

83
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,540
And even you will hear the teeny tiny baby Reverend Stang, yours truly.

84
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,740
Now the second part of all of these shows will come from,

85
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,340
Reverend Susie the Floozy's barrage edits about X-Day,

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:31,060
when the aliens will come from her show, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse on WREK in Atlanta.

87
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:41,540
Oh yes, nobody can cut and sling like Susie.

88
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,720
And we'll also be hearing live recordings from the most recent actual subgenius,

89
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,180
subgenius worship event, X-Day, 6X-Day this time,

90
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,260
last July's yearly drill for when the saucers will arrive.

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,360
And of course, number four, we'll hear the usual hour of slack bits from ESO Radio and WCSB Cleveland

92
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,300
with Chad Smith and Lonesome Cowboy David,

93
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,220
plus the unusual collages of Fernand and Ande Lee Murr.

94
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,520
Oh yes, and number five, the music of...

95
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,720
So-So Dada.

96
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:17,980
Yeah.

97
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,220
Yeah.

98
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:18,660


99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


100
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


101
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


103
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


104
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


105
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


106
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:18,720


109
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,020
In the background with his X-Day 6 noise opera,

110
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,020
as heard, like so much of this, on alt.binary slack that's placed on the internet.

111
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,820
Oh yeah.

112
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,640
So do the new ones redeem as much of a bobby soul as the old pamphlets?

113
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,480
Oh, more.

114
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,380
The new ones are much more highly compressed and efficient.

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
The new pamphlets can actually extract up to 90%,

116
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,760
99.9% of a bobby's soul in less than nine-tenths of a second.

117
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,240
So the, uh, the definitely, the slack, uh, you can acquire a whole lot more slack faster

118
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,100
and at cheaper cost with the new, more efficient subgenius pamphlets.

119
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:14,080
Yes, even you, those of you who, who have, who can barely discern white from black, day from night,

120
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,440
no, no reflection upon your vision, of course.

121
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,880
It is important to make those distinctions.

122
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,780
Are asking those, those decisions, making those decisions in the help book of Jayner.

123
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,420
Therefore, there is a God.

124
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,160
End of quote.

125
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,880
I said, you're gonna have to get yourself in discernment here

126
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,160
and be able to discern the spirit of God from the spirit of Hinduism.

127
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,520
I said, people in Haiti, I said, when the Holy Ghost hits them, they think it's Buddha.

128
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,240
Because Buddha hits them.

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,720
Like the Holy Ghost.

130
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,240
The Holy Ghost hits them.

131
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,580
Even in America, think that, that when the Holy Ghost hits somebody, it's witchcraft.

132
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,800
Yes, witchcraft.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,600
Those people down, they see demonic visions.

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,520
And the devil uses them.

135
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,620
Buddhism.

136
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,980
And witchcraft.

137
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,740
And the powers of, of the pagan gods.

138
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,420
The powers of the pagan gods produce it.

139
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,700
Lying signs in one's mind.

140
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:18,860
And the powers of the pagan gods are the wonders.

141
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,000
But I want you to know that the pagan gods and their false religions can do what they're doing in the world.

142
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,580
Bless God, what can we do with a true God?

143
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,960
With a true Christ?

144
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,380
With a true Holy Ghost?

145
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,920
We ought to be able to do more than what they're doing.

146
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:32,940
Hallelujah.

147
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,980
How would the God God take the scales off your eyes?

148
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,760
And open your eyes to behold that the Lord's coming is at the door.

149
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,300
And that all that's happening in the world is getting us ready for Jesus Christ to dwell in the fullness.

150
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,460
Of God in the saints.

151
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,680
That we will come forth with revelation and manifestation of the Holy Ghost.

152
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,720
Revealing Christ to the world.

153
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,060
That we will possess in our temples the very fullness of the Spirit.

154
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,960
That we'll be filled with the Spirit.

155
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,500
We'll be filled with it.

156
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,660
We'll have oil in our lamps burning.

157
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,920
That we will not stop until our lives have been complete.

158
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,860
I don't care.

159
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,460
They can talk about me all over Brownwood and Baines and around here.

160
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,400
Call me anything.

161
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
I'm preaching the truth.

162
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,780
They can talk about me and turn on this minister and say this ain't real.

163
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,580
But you let one of them hypocrites come and show where I'm wrong.

164
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,240
And take the Bible and prove that this ain't God.

165
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,420
And this ain't the word of God to the people.

166
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
And I'll leave tomorrow.

167
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,260
Hallelujah.

168
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,280
But I'm not leaving tomorrow.

169
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,540
You say why?

170
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,980
Because there ain't nobody in the state of Texas and the state of Alabama, Florida or anywhere else.

171
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,840
Can take the word of God and prove this is wrong.

172
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,880
They may lie.

173
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
They may kill.

174
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
They may tell all manner of evil.

175
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,520
But they cannot touch this spirit.

176
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
They cannot touch this word.

177
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,360
This is the word of the Holy Ghost.

178
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,920
This is God's promise.

179
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,400
This is God's word.

180
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,620
God's truth to you.

181
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,960
And if you...

182
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,640
God is evil.

183
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,720
God is evil.

184
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,160
God is evil.

185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,680
God is evil.

186
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,180
God is evil.

187
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,500
God is evil.

188
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,660
God is evil.

189
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,220
God is evil.

190
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,060
God is evil.

191
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,100
God is evil.

192
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,580
God says it.

193
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:28,580


194
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,680
One reverse old sh ج.

195
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,820
One change.

196
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,720
It's not even тебяign.

197
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,200
You just be here to see your support.

198
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,760
And you can come see my Whereabouts.

199
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,780
That God is everywhere.

200
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,720
And you help your other self.

201
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,040
And you have strength.

202
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,040


203
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,940
And fill that wake up.

204
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:53,440
They get in there and they say, but the Hades, the Hades and the unseen world and the abode of the lost.

205
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,420
And they said that ain't real.

206
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
And I seen it down there on the seventh level.

207
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,600
And the mystery, the mystery, the mystery, it just tears us apart, the mystery.

208
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,700
And if we can just say, I know that everything will be fine.

209
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,920
We are gone.

210
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,820
We are gone.

211
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:26,720
We are gone.

212
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,080
We are gone.

213
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,720
Ah, yes, dear friends.

214
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,720
Don't you feel that sometimes you just have to let one go.

215
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,360


216
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,860
Friends, remember the old days.

217
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,420
Well, that's where all of that came from.

218
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,300
The old, old, the day, the actual day that they talk about.

219
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:04,680
The day before the computers, before the digital mixing, the day of the cassette deck and the reel to reel splicing take.

220
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:15,320
The days of media barrage number two about UFOs from the year of our ord 19 and 81.

221
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,440
Do not go beyond what we became a senile small girl, middle school years later, actually.

222
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,200
Meanwhile.

223
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,680
Flash, like something out of the twilight show about that.

224
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,820
So my god, what is that?

225
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:32,640
What?

226
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,280
Well, there's my ride.

227
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:37,980
I

228
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:45,880
For sure, you keep practising day won't get you to your one of the light Perhaps you'll smile when you were the star here.

229
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:45,880


230
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,240
Perhaps you could notice that was a classic one my folks about the first or they are

231
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,880
it's going kind of Simulation now.

232
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:46,920


233
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,100
Bob! There's something on the screen!

234
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,220
Yes. It might be him, but the picture isn't very clear.

235
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,420
My God.

236
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,720
Bob, it's coming right at us.

237
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,520
I can't believe it.

238
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,000
Look at those tentacles.

239
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,080
They're coming! From outer space, they're coming!

240
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,320
They're going to enter our atmosphere!

241
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,800
We want the Earth! We want the Earth!

242
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,660
We want the Earth!

243
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,280
Through clear skies, tracking lightly from far down the line.

244
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,100
No fanfare, just a blip on the screen.

245
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,600
No quick conclusions, now everything will be fine.

246
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,780
Short circuit glitch and not what it seems.

247
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,500
The Earth is coming!

248
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500


249
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,440
The Earth is coming!

250
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,880
Uh, hello.

251
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,740
Alien? What do you mean, alien?

252
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,460
What do you mean from another planet?

253
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,400
That's a tricky one, isn't it?

254
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,040
Well, if that's the life, don't let them out.

255
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,140
They're a flying saucer.

256
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,560
We don't want a lot of little green men terrorizing the home counties during Askert Week, do we?

257
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:05,900
Hmm?

258
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,620
Yes, all right. Full emergency.

259
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
You hear the news?

260
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,580
You hear the news?

261
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,560
Aliens are coming to New York!

262
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,840
One night only, $2,000 a ticket.

263
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,460
Yee-haw!

264
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:24,280
We want the alien! We want the alien! We want the alien!

265
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,240
So what are you guys here for? To see flying saucers land? Is that going to happen tonight?

266
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,660
When they arrive, it's going to be the dawn of a whole new civilization.

267
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,480
Space creatures conspiring with the Soviet government already control our thoughts

268
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,900
by sending out electrical currents from the top of the Empire State Building.

269
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,440
And I'm the only one that knows.

270
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,760
If you're alienated, can you still help children?

271
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,520
Oh, sure. Alienation only affects the mind. It has nothing to do with the rest of your life.

272
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,800
We are going to see more and more of these visitors from space.

273
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:59,320
And before too long, the evidence will be in controversial that you will have on your TV screens and on your movie screens.

274
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,660
Concrete evidence that the ships are here and that they are real.

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,540
They're not fantastic things which have been cooked up to make a movie.

276
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,660
I have made telepathic contact for the past eight years

277
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,740
with many space people from the Earth.

278
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,680
I've been in many areas of space, both inside and outside of the solar system.

279
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,180
Well, this device right here is one that we've used to contact the people in the flying saucers.

280
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,640
It receives the messages on a beam of light, and it is in turn translated by this unit

281
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,020
and brought out as intelligible voice speech.

282
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,740
You mean to say you actually receive messages from people in the flying saucers?

283
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,240
That's right.

284
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,840
How about letting me try it, Dick, and see if I can get something on it?

285
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,600
It's in the right place.

286
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
Receiving transmission from galactic headquarters.

287
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,060
Bobby, there's nothing to be frightened of now.

288
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,560
On my planet, all of you will be free men not locked away like animals.

289
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,140
Be free.

290
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,060
Five day on the Atlas.

291
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,440
Is that recording good enough to identify the thing?

292
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,340
Yeah, right.

293
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,760
Hey, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.

294
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,660
From that fateful day when

295
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,660
stinking bits of slime first crawled from the sea and shouted to the cold stars...

296
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,680
I know I'm on the corner!

297
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,380
Our greatest dread has always been the knowledge of our own mortality.

298
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:33,780
But tonight, we shall hurl the gauntlet of science into the frightful face of death itself.

299
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,660
Tonight, we shall ascend...

300
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,680
into the heavens.

301
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,580
We shall mark the earthquake.

302
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,600
We shall command the thunders...

303
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,060
and penetrate...

304
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,520
into the very womb...

305
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,080
of impervious nature...

306
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,180
herself.

307
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,500
God, what?

308
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,520
Enemy spacecraft, the Hatching Hound 44.

309
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,880
Bob?

310
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,140
Well, he's up there.

311
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,200
Lost in space.

312
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,680
Ah, whoops.

313
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,920
I must go home.

314
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,920
Yeah, sure, honey.

315
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
I must leave this planet at once.

316
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,680
Has anyone seen my spaceship?

317
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,960
He's delirious.

318
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,880
Take me to your leader.

319
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,720
It's gonna be okay, honey. Just relax. Everything's fine.

320
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,540
Look, I am not talking to you. I'm talking to him.

321
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,300
Oh.

322
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,740
She's not a woman.

323
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,980
The Terminator.

324
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
You'd better go now, Madge.

325
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,480
I won't go home alone.

326
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,060
Bob will take you.

327
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,540
I don't want to have anything to do with it.

328
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,500
Okay.

329
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,080
What's it for, you people? I was joking!

330
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,660
Don't you know I'm joking here?

331
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,300
Everything all set for the big party?

332
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,760
We're getting there.

333
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,460
I'm gone.

334
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I'll tell you about it.

335
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,360
Susie here still loves the Whopper.

336
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,280
Oh, yeah.

337
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,560
Thanks, Frank.

338
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
So who's all that ointment for?

339
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,280
They've been screwing us for a long time.

340
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,140
Now it's time we screwed them.

341
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:07,880
Okay.

342
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,920
Pat, ready to go?

343
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,440
I'm quite ready. I travel light.

344
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,980
That's a joke.

345
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,860
It's a bad joke.

346
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,260
You humans. There's just no sense of humor.

347
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,660
We're all ready.

348
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,180
Yes, you guys. We're all ready.

349
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,020
He's gonna regret this. I'll show him.

350
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,480
No, don't go. You mustn't go out there.

351
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,540
I can't stand this.

352
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,140
But he's a robot.

353
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,140
He wants to take me back to the ship.

354
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,400
It's your old pal, Bernard.

355
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,080
The fourth alien.

356
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,540
There is no fourth alien.

357
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,040
I'm here. Look, look.

358
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,220
Look at you.

359
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
You don't even look like an alien.

360
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,960
Ambrose, will you get rid of this autograph hunter?

361
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,360
No, don't.

362
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,140
And help me.

363
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,980
You simple-tongued, don't you understand?

364
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,020
I'm the fourth alien.

365
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,300
Take your other picture of the matter off.

366
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,140
No.

367
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,580
No.

00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:54,640

are on patrol for flying saucers.

411
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,800
Cameras installed to photograph them.

412
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,920
Portland, Oregon, the area from which came the first weird reports.

413
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,340
This flying saucer patrol shows how the Air Forces,

414
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,020
while not putting too much stock in the mysterious things in the sky,

415
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,500
are investigating.

416
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,700
The control tower is in touch and on the watch.

417
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,000
So are a whole lot of people these days.

418
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,740
They're seeing flying saucers everywhere.

419
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,120
Blocks of fantastic disks flying through the air.

420
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,620
There. Is there something to it?

421
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,000
Or is it an epidemic of people just seeing things?

422
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,920
Even the goat seems to be looking for the mysterious disks.

423
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,900
And the bear is on the alert.

424
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,180
Or maybe there's a flying saucer with milk.

425
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,960
Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up.

426
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,560
It's an emergency! Maroon alert! Or even for a million!

427
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,800
These are no pinheads.

428
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,260
These are no brains from another planet.

429
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,300
These are no pea brains from beyond.

430
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,140
These are mind suckers.

431
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,340
What is that?

432
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,160
What is that?

433
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,100
Oh, my God.

434
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,860
Haven't any of you seen Invasion of the Body Snatchers?

435
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,560
No.

00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,300


450
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,100
Well, I've been up all night.

451
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,380
I've got a real story for you up to now.

452
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,280
Proof and everything.

453
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,740
The alien have landed among us.

454
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,720
I'm not hot-dogging you.

455
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,060
We've got to start protecting ourselves.

456
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,140
ompestor formation plays

457
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,400
They said protect and you survive.

458
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,580
Outpost man didn't quando!

459
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,100

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,100


461
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,260
8 pounds of over-pressure

462
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,060
wave seemed to

463
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,880
glisten to the wall

464
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,220
they said protect

465
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,800
and you'll survive

466
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,400
took out the radio

467
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,500
and our milkman

468
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,960

470
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,940

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,460

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,060
the bottle spawn

473
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,580
or feel the war

474
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,180

475
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,140
the aliens are here

476
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,980
we're all going to die

477
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,880
the aliens are here

478
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,940

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,080
To be endlessly born

557
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,460
And now

558
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,440
The moment you've been waiting for

559
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,840
The aliens are about to materialize

560
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,380
Before your eyes

561
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,100
They came to us from a far

562
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,260
Distant planet

563
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,100
And now here they are in our midst

564
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,180
I insist

565
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,280
Let's hear it for

566
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,020
The aliens

567
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,200
We're all going to die

568
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,560
Let's kill them

569
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,820
Ooh, you wanna kill him

570
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,440
I don't think that's a wise thing

571
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,340
Not a wise thing to do

572
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,680
Do you really think that you can't even see him?

573
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,360
You will feel him

574
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,400
And if you're dreaming

575
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,100
That you can take him

576
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,080
I don't think that's a very wise thing to do

577
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,240
Ooh, ooh, ooh

578
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,380
Ooh, ooh, ooh

579
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,860
Oh, thank you, Susie the Flusie

580
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,480
The incredibulous Susie the Flusie

581
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,160
Reverend Susie the Flusie

582
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,540
From WREK in Atlanta

583
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,440
In pursuit of her show

584
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,680
Bob Slacktime

585
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,060
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

586
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,180
Funhouse numbers 477

587
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,260
She edited all that

588
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,300
And this wonderfulous material

589
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,220
About X-Day

590
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,980
The coming X-Day

591
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,780
When our beloved alien masters

592
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,180
The men from Planet X

593
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,120
Will sooner or later finally show up

594
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,520
And all that

595
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,140
Ah, yes

596
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,060
Look at the things you see

597
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,360
See how the sky

598
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,720
Is so horrible

599
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,500
It's amazing

600
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,860
And this is

601
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,880
The Amino Acids

602
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,120
Live at

603
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,940
6X Day

604
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,300
I ask that you be consecrated

605
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,340
To the Virgin Mary

606
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,840
My lady

607
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,060
These people can't see or hear you

608
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,680
As we do

609
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,960
Many of them don't believe you appear to us

610
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,320
In October

611
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,180
I will give them a sign

612
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,600
That will make them believe

613
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,800
Just so they're not going to care

614
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,200
Then you come home

615
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,900
And I assure you

616
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,840
I swear

617
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,420
I will be sure

618
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:38,420


619
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:38,460
By what I have lack

620
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,120
I promise

621
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:54,160
That I will never

622
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,160

guitar solo

677
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,260
Obviously, the lesson is leave world domination to the professionals.

678
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,980
Gluing feathers to your ass does not make you a rooster in the hen house.

679
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,620
Detroit, Detroit, oh my God.

680
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,140
Oh, yes, dear friends.

681
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:19,000
Recorded at Winterstar 2003, an event held by Ace of Cleveland.

682
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Cleveland, you can get more information about Ace events like Winterstar and Starwood from www.rosencomet.com.

683
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:39,940
And now, let's go back to Susie the Flusie's final reenactment of the final moments of X-Day.

684
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,820
It's happening.

685
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,160
What?

686
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,520
It's an attack.

687
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,220
Excellent.

688
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,660
Now it's time we scream.

689
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,000


690
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,060
Meanwhile, far below the Earth's surface...

691
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:58,420
Lieutenant Dobbs and I have been training local pilots in Cobras for their own strike forces against the cartel.

692
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,060
Lead, this is Snake 2, entering sector 4079.

693
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,200
Roger.

694
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,580
Who finds the leader of our position?

695
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,560
Wilco, Dobbs.

696
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,100
How's the view up front, buddy?

697
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,040
I'm not crazy about it, man.

698
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,920
I'll be glad when we get out of this canyon.

699
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,420
I was flying wing that day with Captain Tejada.

700
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,980
Lieutenant Dobbs, the other American, was the flight leader in the front.

701
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,380
We're in the middle of a war.

702
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,140
We're entering a sector we've never been before.

703
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,000
The thing of it is, Bob, I got a bad feeling on this one.

704
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,120
I don't think I'm going to make it out.

705
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,960
Get me behind me!

706
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,820
Are you in danger, pastor?

707
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,700
All right, Roger.

708
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,880
Just a little argument with my co-pilot.

709
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,480
Over.

710
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,320
That's great.

711
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,580
Meanwhile...

712
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,300
The units are approaching the station.

713
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,220
They're coming straight at us.

714
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,280
It's a monster!

715
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,460
Nah, it can't be.

716
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:46,880
It is!

717
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:47,640
Ah!

718
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:47,960
Ah!

719
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,340
Ah!

720
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:49,940
Ah!

721
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,960
I have visual.

722
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,060
So, bearing 235, 40 degrees.

723
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,280
What the hell is going on?

724
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:01,880
We're under attack.

725
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,100
Yeah, right.

726
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,360
Hey, Bob is my only hope.

727
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:07,860
Back off.

728
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,820
How can one ordinary man have so many enemies?

729
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,320
Well, of course, that's just the start.

730
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,040
You smack bastard!

731
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,840
Damn!

732
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,200
We were five miles from the objective when we saw the Scorpion attack helicopter.

733
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,500
There he is!

734
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,540
Trying to jump the other way now, Dob.

735
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,460
Dob, move in.

736
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,220
You're 12 o'clock.

737
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,740
Stone, you're on your own.

738
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,500
Take your first shot.

739
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,100
You're the right hand.

740
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:32,680
Fire in.

741
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,500
He's turning over!

742
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,740
Dob, saying a guy likes being taken advantage of.

743
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,600
Breaking formation.

744
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:40,960
Steady.

745
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:41,780
Steady.

746
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:42,880
Stay with him.

747
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,640
Let's jump.

748
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,660
Here you are, Dob.

749
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,480
What I owe you.

750
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,280
With interest.

751
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:47,820
I'm going to get you.

752
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,600
I'm going to get you.

753
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:58,820
Who's Bob?

754
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:58,820


755
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:58,820


756
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:58,820


757
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:58,820


758
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:58,940
Bob!

759
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,260
Trailer.

760
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,360
Check the door.

761
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:03,900
I know where he comes in.

762
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:03,900


763
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:05,760
I know what you're doing, Smаныk.

764
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:05,760


765
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:05,760


766
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:05,760


767
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,320
Dean Strong.

768
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:07,320


769
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:07,660
I've only lost two wins.

770
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,120
MUSIC

771
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You know...

772
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,560
We're better than that alone.

773
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,340
I can't potentially bring Bob home anymore.

774
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,340
But I won't be the only one I know and fail to��� dominate.

775
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,580
What's the last time you were driven out?

776
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:18,580


777
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:18,580


778
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,020
They shot him in the head. You want to make an omelet you got a break

779
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,160
so space travelers come halfway across the universe to this planet and this is

780
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:02,400
how we greet them is it? With rocks and with avocados. You ought to be ashamed of

781
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,320
yourselves. These aren't space monsters with TV aerials stuck on their heads.

782
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:16,120
They haven't come here to zap your planet with their ray guns. These are fellow

783
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:16,880
beings.

784
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,560
Coming here to zap your planet with their ray guns. These are fellow beings.

785
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:25,700
Come in peace. To do a bit of shopping. People of Earth, people of Earth. We should

786
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,280
count ourselves privileged. Yeah, you're privileged to greet these intrepid

787
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,260
pioneers who come so far across the space.

788
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,500
Hey! They took me off! They got my truck!

789
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,800
Oh who would have believed it?

790
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,680
What happens is gonna happen to you and all of you. And it's gonna be worse.

791
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,900
A lot worse. That's great. Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover up.

792
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:03,200
And we're back from X-Day. Well, actually, let's go to the X-Day Drill, the fifth X-Day

793
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,340
Drill and listen to the preaching of Popes Lilith von Frau Mensch.

794
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:16,660
The real enemy where I stand and according to the one true word among the off-worlders.

795
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:23,660
Much off-the-cuff bullshit of J.R. Bob Dobbs is the god damned conspiracy!

796
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,560
Amen!

797
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:31,320
Now, you've heard of them I wonder sometime in between the promises of slack, fraud,

798
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:37,960
sex hurt, alien intervention and all that. But from the way some of you act, I can't

799
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:44,700
help but think that you've fingered the wrong damn conspiracy. See, it's easy to convince

800
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,640
yourself that the conspiracy was made by some of the people who were involved. But that's

801
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:46,640


802
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,640
not the case. The conspiracy has a recognizable face that is referenced by the rich white

803
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:58,380
men with a never-slate thirst for oil or that's run by the media companies or Hollywood or

804
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:04,720
the Jews or Muslims or Freemasonry or the Vatican or the British Crown or by invisible

805
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:11,920
monsters trying to bring forth Armageddon or by fill in the blank. But no! For the real

806
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,640
conspiracy, what we mean by the conspiracy, is the conspiracy of the people who are involved.

807
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:16,640


808
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:16,640


809
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:22,300
The real conspiracy is the forces behind even those conspiracies. The conspiracy that's

810
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:29,640
too dumb to realize it is a conspiracy and so avoids detection even as its slimy tentacles

811
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:37,120
slither into every nook and cranny of everybody's lives. For the conspiracy isn't made up of

812
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:43,380
religions or political groups or even of people. The real conspiracy, when you get down to

813
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,840
it, can be summed up in two words.

814
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,580
Bad Wiring.

815
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:56,680
It's the conspiracy that lurks inside every hairless monkey, regardless of the influence

816
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:03,240
of even yeti genetics, that gives those invisible monsters a shake and makes their followers

817
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:10,000
act like devolved murderous bastards. There are noble impulses in almost every religion,

818
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,940
but by the time that wretched, sneaky conspiracy behavioral programming gets done, it's a

819
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,200
mess.

820
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:23,780
With religion or any good idea, it almost invariably looks like a bum deal to somebody.

821
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:30,900
Because the follower types then get violently zealous and make even the greatest ideas seem

822
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,620
like the work of idiots.

823
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,980
Think about it for a second. What are the most basic programs that people run through

824
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,840
their internal computer every day?

825
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,140
Well, they are EAT! R! B! E!

826
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,220
And they're not just the most basic programs that people run through their internal computer

827
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:46,220


828
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:46,640
Well, they are EAT! R! B! E! And they're not just the most basic programs that people run

829
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:46,740
through their internal computer every day.

830
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,060
They're EATEN!

831
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,200
Dominate or submit!

832
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,940
Understand or be stupid!

833
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,880
Be good or be bad!

834
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,640
And I don't care how enlightened any of you claim to be, if you haven't wrestled with

835
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,060
this basic programming, if you haven't tried to come up with alternatives to these dualities,

836
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:16,640
then you too have become both victim and pawn of the conspiracy that drives all of the people

837
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,580
other conspiracies, whether it's a

838
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,480
conspiracy to defraud millions

839
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,500
of their birthright, or a conspiracy

840
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,700
to put your sleeping roommate's hand

841
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,540
in a bucket of warm water so

842
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,700
he'd pee himself.

843
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,620
This is why I wrote back

844
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,740
in 1992 that the ultimate

845
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,680
conspiracy theory was that

846
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,940
there were over 6

847
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,300
billion conspiracies

848
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,580
on this planet, and even that

849
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,480
number was pitifully low because

850
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,460
I was only including the hairless

851
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:44,920
monkeys.

852
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,940
And let's

853
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,460
face it, even the most

854
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,660
yeti-like among us is

855
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,980
at least 50% hairless

856
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,720
monkey. Nothing to be

857
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,620
ashamed of, really, but it means that

858
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,660
you are a slave

859
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,040
of the conspiracy

860
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,180
no matter what!

861
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,240
Unless!

862
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,820
Unless!

863
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,520
You go back to those dualities

864
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,720
and add some magic mojo

865
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,740
to that mix. Unless you toss a

866
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,720
monkey wrench into the monkey

867
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,740
works, and that monkey

868
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,760
wrench is

869
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,980
slack.

870
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,540
For only slack has

871
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,560
the ability to disclude

872
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,660
itself, and thus giving

873
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,300
you a true option!

874
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,640
Thus, some of us can

875
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,680
indeed find slack even in the most

876
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,900
conspiracy-drenched pursuits

877
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,780
because we can slack off

878
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,720
by not slacking

879
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,220
off! Thanks

880
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,720
to slack, we always have an option

881
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,260
against the conspiracy's own

882
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,380
internalized programming. Eat

883
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,740
or be eaten, or slack

884
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,200
off! Dominate

885
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,440
or submit, or

886
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,520
slack off!

887
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,700
Understand or be stupid,

888
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,320
or slack off!

889
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,180
Be good

890
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,580
or be bad, or

891
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,820
slack off!

892
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,680
God damn it, what will

893
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,460
it take to get through your heads?

894
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,760
Every time that you find

895
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,580
yourself wrestling with the urge to throttle

896
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,280
someone, including yourself,

897
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,780
every time you find

898
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,400
yourself stuck between two equally

899
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,680
grim scenarios, every

900
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,740
time you find yourself indecisive

901
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,300
about what you should do,

902
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,480
I ask you to remember

903
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,460
the option to slack off!

904
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,800
Nay, I demand that you

905
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,260
remember the option to slack off!

906
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,100
I get on my knees

907
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,780
and plead with you!

908
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,640
I beg of you

909
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,720
to remember that you can always

910
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,440
slack off! I pray

911
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,260
and I cry that you never

912
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,240
forget that option, because the

913
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,300
conspiracy will never tell you that

914
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,860
you have the option, ever!

915
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,440
Only J.R. Bob Dodds

916
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,180
will tell you that! Only Bob

917
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,260
has the guts to stand up to their

918
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,380
monkey DNA robot gangster

919
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,840
wetware ball crap,

920
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,000
and step right in it!

921
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,580
And slide into the ground!

922
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,420
And dance upon it!

923
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,900
And then,

924
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,380
and then, until

925
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,280
there's nothing left but a mere

926
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,160
moist spot on the ground, and then,

927
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:14,560
and then, until there's nothing left but a mere

928
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:14,560


929
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,180
and then, until there's nothing left but a mere white as damn feet on the

930
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,240
white as damn feet on the

931
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,660
white as damn feet on the labrum rug of pink poised sensibilities!

932
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:18,660


933
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:18,840


934
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,520
And...

935
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,080
What's that, Pop?

936
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,700
I can slack off now?

937
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,240
Okay, end of rant, everybody. Thank you.

938
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,120
Okay, we have

939
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,220
a rant for Andy.

940
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:34,700
Nice!

941
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,360
Popes Lilith, and now

942
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,760
to take us out,

943
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,800
puzzling evidence, Dr.

944
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,920
Philodrummon and Dr. Howell.

945
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:44,720
Okay.

946
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,760
What do you think, Bob? You wanna do this for a living?

947
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,360
Sure.

948
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,980
So how long has it been?

949
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,840
Let's sit down and have a cup of coffee.

950
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,940
This is a solid at ordinary

951
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,100
temperatures and pressures.

952
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,820
Damn church.

953
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,660
I was born near damn church,

954
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,160
a little village, uh,

955
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,560
simple agricultural...

956
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,140
We ought to live in it.

957
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,000
Now I'm not gonna name any names.

958
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,240
I want a cup of coffee, Bob.

959
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,260
Do you wanna run that by me again?

960
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,220
More coffee.

961
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,860
Will you have one lump or two?

962
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,720
Damn good cup of coffee, Bob.

963
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,280
Thanks.

964
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,860
This is a joke.

965
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,240
I like it.

966
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:19,680
Am I right?

967
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,060
Yeah, it is. It's a show. It's just a joke.

968
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,900
You sure as hell got that right.

969
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,940
Thank you.

970
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,020
How did that happen, Bob?

971
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,280
Work, hard work, concentration, and extreme effort

972
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,440
brought to fruition those things

973
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,720
predicted in the before life

974
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,680
and in the prescriptures.

975
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,200
Are you alright?

976
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,500
No, it's gonna be a real pleasure

977
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,800
working with you again, Bob.

978
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,320
Okay, it's countdown.

979
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,840
Countdown to the end of the show.

980
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,280
I'm sure I told you.

981
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,860
Kevin is Bob's best man.

982
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,200
At which time we will place

983
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,300
the fissionable materials

984
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,820
and the weapons of mass destruction

985
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,100
into the secret location

986
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,920
underneath the flower bed

987
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,480
where they just,

988
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,120
they won't think about

989
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,280
digging up the roses

990
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:06,800
to find them.

991
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,780
Yeah, it's countdown now.

992
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,680
Just moments away.

993
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,400
In addition, this material alone

994
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,180
will all fold it up

995
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,240
and stuff back in the box

996
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,200
until next week

997
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,080
to provide the appropriate chemical

998
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,720
or radiological

999
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,420
or preventable weapon making.

1000
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,260
It's a collar.

1001
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:19,880
Yeah, it's a collar.

1002
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,820
The show doesn't smell like that

1003
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:22,320
with a different color.

1004
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,120
The breath of the show

1005
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,400
smells like that.

1006
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:25,700
All right, get Bob.

1007
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:25,960
Get Bob.

1008
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,220
We're not back in an hour.

1009
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,320
We'll reschedule the rehearsal

1010
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,080
for first of June.

1011
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,780
Okay, all right, fine, fine, fine.

1012
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

1013
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,520
It's time to go down, Mr. Blaney.

1014
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,460
It's over.

1015
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,360
Well, Hal, I don't wanna come

1016
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,900
to rehearsal tomorrow morning.

1017
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,820
I'd really rather do something else.

1018
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,380
I'm not gonna do anything.

1019
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:40,380


1020
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:40,380


1021
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,300
What do you mean you messed up

1022
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,240
the whole ordeal?

1023
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:42,960
What?

1024
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:42,960


1025
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,720
No, the show's over.

1026
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,620
It's over.

1027
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,880
The show's over, yeah.

1028
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,460
I'm sorry.

1029
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,040
No, it's over.

1030
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,500
Well, actually, that's all she wrote.

1031
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,160
X.9.3 minutes.

1032
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:51,480
His brain is donated

1033
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,520
to a medical facility

1034
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,540
researching the criminal mind.

1035
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,020
Since he had massive head injuries,

1036
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,340
I've used a brain from your workplace

1037
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,360
as a replacement.

1038
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,300
So basically, I turned Carl into Skeeter

1039
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:01,940
Wayne Dobbs,

1040
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,540
and Skeeter turned out to be pretty bad,

1041
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,420
so I have to kill him again.

1042
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1043
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,720
Wayne Dobbs

1044
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,420
was killed yesterday

1045
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,360
by the owner of a gas station

1046
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:10,360


1047
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:10,360


1048
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:10,360


1049
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:10,360


1050
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:10,940
and a catering truck.

1051
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,380
The victim was wanted by the state police

1052
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,640
in connection of two teenage girls.

1053
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,320
Murder?

1054
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,600
He dug himself out of the grave.

1055
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,180
Oh, no.

1056
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,220
Hector, did you drop the Dobbs specimen?

1057
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,440
Oh, great.

1058
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,440
A bad brain and no time to get a new one.

1059
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,460
Don't forget, if I get fired,

1060
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,480
you get fired, Hector.

1061
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,300
I'm going to get fired.

1062
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:43,680
Oh, boy.

1063
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,320
Look what I got here, Bob.

1064
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,700
Friends, you're listening to

1065
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,480

More information about

is at www.subgenius.com.

1070
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,260
Praise Bob.

1071
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,100
Hell's Satan!

1072
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,840
Don't sing any nettoche!

1073
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,880

1074
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,640
I spotted Bob!

1075
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,340
I spotted Bob!
