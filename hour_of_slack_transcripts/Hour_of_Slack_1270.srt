1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
From NPR News in Washington, I'm under direction of an independent administrator.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,600
The Justice Department says it has pee.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,700
Senior Obama administration officials want to keep the pee.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,500
Tom Pirelli says the department finished pee remains this weekend.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,900
The Justice Department continues to investigate whether pee broke the disaster.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,200
Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen has resumed drilling a pee well that's slated to intercept the end of this week.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,620
Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen says...

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,320
President Obama says people can rest along the Gulf Coast.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,400
We're excited that fish can go back to work. In fact, we had some yesterday.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,020
President speaking as he welcomed taking a break.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,420
But House Republican Leader John Boehner says...

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,640
Demanding and asking the question, where are the American people?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,460
Boehner told NBC the way to stimulate the economy is by cutting hiring this morning.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,420
Oscar-winning actress Patricia Neal is aimed at preventing...

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,020
tens of thousands of public school teachers and state and local government workers from NPR News in Washington.

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,300
Is this thing on? It is, huh?

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,920
It is on, and so are you.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,060
You can scoot it over closer to your face if you want.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,520
Oh, how many times have I fallen for that one?

20
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,600
How many times have you fallen for that one?

21
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,240
Too many. I'm starting to wear a pillow on my ass.

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,120
Helps on the landings.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,640
Well, we have a great deal of material to go over today.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,980
Some of the old tried and truisms need to be tried out once more.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,620
Hashed out and beaten against the rocks and left out to dry.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,240
Are you leaving too, Susie?

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,300
No, no, I'm not fleeing. I'm redistributing my wealth.

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,180
All right, well, let's have an even distribution of that.

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,560
I brought enough for the whole class.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,460
Bounteous booty and begin our introductory religious lesson of instruction.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,460
Welcome to the third 13X Day live hour of slack.

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,620
Which will sound really different the next time you hear it.

33
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,280
Well, yes, it will be specially augmented, but what about the background?

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,780
Do we have that today? Background?

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,820
Oh, background music?

36
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,680
Yeah, the background music track. There it is.

37
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,160
All right, now you see it.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,700
It's a wonderful party.

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,540
It's wacky.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
Yeah, we're all having a great time.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,320
It's the unending cocktail hour here at X Day 2010,

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,620
the 13th X Day of beautiful summer weather here at the Brushwood Campground

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,940
where things are getting out of control.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,720
Whoa, it's wacky, wild, goofy, wiggly.

45
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,040
I've never been in control in Brushwood. That's what's so wonderful about it.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,260
Let us not disabuse the unenlightened of their long-cherished, if pathetic, beliefs.

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,120
Of course, control, unillusion, superimposed over the hideous, indifferent face of the universe.

48
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,240
But we live by such illusions. At least I know I do.

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,740
That's how you pull the wool over your own eyes.

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,260
Yes, with the realization that although you can never truly know unless all the factors are considered,

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,880
you also can never know all the factors.

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,220
So you just have to guess at it.

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,900
Yes.

54
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,680
Make a good guess.

55
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,420
And right then, and I tell you.

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,780
That's them again.

57
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,000
I wish there was someone to help me get out of this.

58
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,360
Yeah.

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,860
And I said, he goes, I'm still eating it.

60
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,540
Give us a little bit of, give us, give us some, some, a little bit more about this.

61
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,240
Sounds simple.

62
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,100
Yeah, so.

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,480
Thank God, it was good.

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,480


65
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,480


66
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,480


67
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,480


68
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,480


69
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,480


70
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,480


71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:11,840
They can't.

72
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,060
He can barely walk.

73
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,560
Are you a peon?

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,260
Well, in other words, the show has been canceled.

75
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,900
You have no sympathy for the blind audience .

76
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,660
Well, it's traditional that we have no sympathy for the blind audience.

77
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:25,780
Well, that's true though.

78
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:25,860
Obviously.

79
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:25,860


80
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:25,880
We have no sympathy for the blind audience.

81
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:25,880


82
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,780
audience. They don't expect us to.

83
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,980
That's true. I can barely stand

84
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,760
to listen to your show. You have so little

85
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,200
sympathy.

86
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,640
It takes me like three days

87
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,780
to edit one of those two-hour shows.

88
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,160
I can't listen to it when I'm listening to it.

89
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,640
Just for that one minute. I have to take the

90
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
headphones off while I'm doing it.

91
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,520
Your shows are really hard to masturbate to,

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,840
Stang. It's really rude.

93
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,880
Oh, you mean Stang's

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,340
show is hard to masturbate to.

95
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,540
I'm glad you made that clear.

96
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,020
Well, we're hoping to change that.

97
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,180
I always choke the chicken to Dr. Hall

98
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,320
and Philo, though.

99
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,420
They always make me get my nut

100
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,020
and curl my toes.

101
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,400
Well, I told you about

102
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,420
masturbating Sean.

103
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,320
God masturbated himself to death listening

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,540
to our show.

105
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,840
My show has more masturbators than yours does.

106
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,780
I can't help it.

107
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,180
I don't know.

108
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,700
We have higher quality masturbators, though.

109
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,980
Well, our brains are out. Yours are still alive.

110
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,180
The highest quality. The most lovely.

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
We've tested our masturbators.

112
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,580
We've tested our masturbators through opinion research firms

113
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,880
and have found that

114
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,820
their knowledge

115
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,220
is in-depth.

116
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,320
They know exactly what they like,

117
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,260
what they want.

118
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,760
Now, do you know

119
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,400
which person they masturbate

120
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,200
to the most?

121
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,700
I know.

122
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,820
I'm sure each of you guys knows exactly

123
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,480
which is the most popular.

124
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,920
Yes.

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,940
They only masturbate to me in prison.

126
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,100
Nothing?

127
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,860
It's a moot?

128
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,840
No point in arguing with such geniuses.

129
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,020
We're just talking in a historical fashion.

130
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,840
I will not eat.

131
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:00,800
Hallelujah.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,200
Here's the secret.

133
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,440
I no longer live.

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,640
Metamorphosis.

135
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,780
Hi.

136
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,900
All right.

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Come on.

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,060
And, um,

139
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,800
so, you know, I, I,

140
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,780
I...

141
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,400
Messing around with the girls.

142
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,580
Get our girls pregnant.

143
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,040
Yeah.

144
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,360
Uh, uh, amen?

145
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,520
Amen.

146
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,920
Amen.

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,940
And thanks, Reverend Heart Ignition.

148
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,420
Friends, aside from the Lemur cuts at the beginning,

149
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,000
all of the collages in this 1,270th hour

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,660
of Slack R. By Heart Ignition.

151
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,440
So glad to have him back in the saddle.

152
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,400
Now, before I get caught up in the spirit,

153
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,380
I need to announce two upcoming events.

154
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,560
One, August 27th through 28th,

155
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,880
the Devotional or Devo Convention.

156
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,280
At the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland.

157
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,860
I will be preaching there.

158
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,640
And there'll be a whole lot more.

159
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,320
And October 9th,

160
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,580
the biggest subgenius event of the year,

161
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,780
aside from X Day,

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,200
a New York City Devival.

163
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,680
Yes, a huge, uh, show in Astoria, Queens, actually.

164
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,920
At a place called Wonderland something.

165
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,380
Uh, that's October 9th.

166
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,100
They'll be preaching by yours truly.

167
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,360
Uh, Pope Black.

168
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,580
Uh, I bet Dr. Legume will be there.

169
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,100
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

170
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,340
Priestess Pisces.

171
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,860
Susan Flusy might be there.

172
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,420
Who knows?

173
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh, and music by Fat Free.

174
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,500
And, uh, Two Beans.

175
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,720
And who, anyway.

176
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,700
If you, uh, can,

177
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,640
check out subgenius.com,

178
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,740
the events button, and you will see.

179
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,760
Uh, now, you know, friends, uh,

180
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,940
I like to edit these shows down

181
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,340
so that nothing lasts longer than

182
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,100
three or four minutes tops.

183
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,780
Uh, well, except for the live blabber shows

184
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,900
where we're in the studio,

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,680
because we need to whip one out fast

186
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,620
and get caught up.

187
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,100
Well, this one is sort of like that.

188
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,400
At 13X Day, we did a couple of hours a day

189
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,120
of rambling live shows on stage,

190
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,940
as well as hours and hours of preaching

191
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,000
and live music.

192
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,260
But I'm finding myself hard-pressed to edit it.

193
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,320
And one reason is that some of it is insipid drivel.

194
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,860
And it's hard work making that sound like a silk purse.

195
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,060
But I came upon one stretch of recordings

196
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,140
that I feel should, despite its sow's ear nature,

197
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,420
be left more or less uncut.

198
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,620
Uh, one morning at 13X Day,

199
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,040
uh, July 3rd,

200
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,600
Dr. Howell, Reverend Susie the Floozy,

201
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,100
Dr. Philodrummon, and I started doing show

202
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,680
in front of many patient individuals.

203
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,760
And, well, most of it was insipid drivel, too.

204
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,780
Maybe we needed more coffee.

205
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,680
In fact, you'll hear us get more coffee.

206
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,540
But after a little while,

207
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,580
lonesome cowboy Dave showed up,

208
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,880
and that's where it turned into

209
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,060
a old-timer, subgenius, fundamentalist,

210
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,940
back-to-the-pamphlet, classic-inspired

211
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,320
insipid drivel.

212
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,600
Because suddenly here you had almost all the key

213
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,680
subgenius radio show blabbermouths

214
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,140
of our 30-year history

215
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,680
all in one place at one picnic table.

216
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,380
Well, puzzling evidence and Phineas Narco were missing,

217
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,500
and lies and your broke friend are big sissies,

218
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,880
but here at one picnic table

219
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,580
on a little rascals-looking stage,

220
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,480
you had Reverend Susie the Floozy,

221
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,080
veteran of hundreds of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse shows

222
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,420
on WREK in Atlanta,

223
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,500
who incidentally did not wear her shirt

224
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
for some of this presentation.

225
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,060
You had me and lonesome cowboy Dave

226
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,380
from Hour of Slack in WCSB Cleveland,

227
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,260
and you had Dr. Howell from the Puzzling Evidence Show

228
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,540
and the Ask Dr. Howell Shows in Berkeley and San Francisco

229
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,480
with his co-star and actor,

230
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,280
actual first and only overman

231
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,980
and co-sub-founder of the Church of the Subgenius,

232
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,840
lead singer of the Swingin' Love Corpses,

233
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,440
webmaster of QuiveringBrain.com,

234
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,160
director of the Subgenius Film Festivals,

235
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,580
and close personal friend of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,

236
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,580
Dr. Philo Drummond.

237
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,360
All those people in one place.

238
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,700
Now we'll also hear some music and sermons

239
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,640
by Reverend Skull and Reverend D. Lister,

240
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,480
but first let us now to the uncut

241
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,400
and unfettered, skinner-breaking master recording itself

242
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,600
from 13X Day.

243
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,600
I was going to point out a theory that I have,

244
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,120
or really it's just an observation,

245
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,980
and friends, this is not a value judgment,

246
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,280
about monster fans versus comics fans.

247
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,500
Sometimes it's the same thing,

248
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,380
but I'm more of a monster fan.

249
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,800
Now I've noticed the primary image

250
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,600
that goes with monster movies and books

251
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,280
is a great big ugly,

252
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,180
ugly guy carrying a pretty girl

253
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,280
wearing very little clothing.

254
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,280
Carry on monster.

255
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,120
Whereas the primary image for comic book fans

256
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,360
is two men in tights grappling with each other.

257
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,200
Hitting each other.

258
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,020
Like I say, I'm not making a value judgment,

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,580
but I'm a monster fan.

260
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,480
Did anybody watch Octoman the other night?

261
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,420
Sure enough, he picks up the girl

262
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,360
and starts plodding along with her

263
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,660
for a long, long time.

264
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,640
You know, you gotta have that.

265
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,120
The carry.

266
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,200
It was so dark.

267
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,080
The Creature from the Black Lagoon.

268
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,660
It was a very dark movie.

269
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,080
Not even the same species.

270
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,660
But when he sees Julie Adams,

271
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,200
he has to pick her up and just carry her along.

272
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,700
Who wouldn't?

273
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,660
Yeah, well I would, but...

274
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,800
Well, I think your observation

275
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,780
about men grappling...

276
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,500
Didn't you say you met Julie Adams?

277
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,400
Is that turning you on, Dr. Drummond?

278
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,440
Well, I have to...

279
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,560
It just seems so odd

280
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,800
that you would make that observation.

281
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,880
Men grappling versus monsters fondly.

282
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,100
I never noticed it before.

283
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,800
Do you know how I was talked into meeting you

284
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,580
for the first time, Dr. Drummond?

285
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,840
This is historic.

286
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,120
My sister-in-law said...

287
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,480
You mean you had to be talked into it?

288
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,860
...that I knew in Austin

289
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,920
had moved to Dallas, staying,

290
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,960
and you should go see these folks

291
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,700
because you'd really hit it off with this guy.

292
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,640
And I said, I hate everybody.

293
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
I don't want friends.

294
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,900
And she said, well, this guy's different.

295
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,520
Now, she goes,

296
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,260
he's into comic books

297
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,380
and Captain Beefheart.

298
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,980
Now, that describes every subgenius.

299
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,660
But at the time,

300
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,860
I didn't know anybody else.

301
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,600
I knew lots of people who liked comic books

302
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,660
and lots of people who liked Captain Beefheart.

303
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,940
But not both.

304
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,540
It was the crossover that made that...

305
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,300
It was that foreign index key

306
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,580
that made it easily retrievable

307
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,760
by that one odd character in the crowd

308
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,300
that there's a whole bunch of here.

309
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,180
I went over to your house in Dallas,

310
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,500
and then he showed me

311
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,200
what was even better than the comic books,

312
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,520
his collection of kook pamphlets.

313
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,680
And that was when I knew

314
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,960
that Philo and I were true Yeti mates.

315
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,760
Because, you know, Captain Beefheart

316
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,700
and comic books

317
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,380
and a big collection of Jack Chick comics,

318
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,500
now you're talking.

319
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,640
Chick tracts attract chicks.

320
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,720
So it wasn't long before

321
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
we were cranking out kook pamphlets

322
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,200
and horrible music.

323
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,380
And bad comics.

324
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:27,840
Yeah.

325
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,460
Yeah.

326
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,120
That's great.

327
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,200
Which is the church.

328
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,960
We learned from the great.

329
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,740
The greatest.

330
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,360
And of course,

331
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,640
Philo introduced me to Bob.

332
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,180
I did not know anything about it,

333
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,720
but he had been recruited before anybody else.

334
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,640
Isn't that incredible, ladies and gentlemen?

335
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,880
Can't avoid that guy.

336
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Captain Beefheart helped bring us together.

337
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,300
Yeah.

338
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,360
Now, I heard that Bob kidnapped Philo

339
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,460
when he was a young boy

340
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,540
from a W.T. Grant's restroom

341
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,320
and like kept him in Tucson

342
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,540
and raped him for 20 years.

343
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,680
It's amazing the stories you hear

344
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,760
about people's childhoods.

345
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,420
I heard it was a Woolworth's restroom.

346
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,040
And that's why he walks that way?

347
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,100
I heard that it was a wolf.

348
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,300
He was a wolf cub in those days.

349
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,280
Hey, look, there's...

350
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,120
Oh, my God!

351
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,460
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

353
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,700
So here he is.

354
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,400
Oh, look, he's not so lonesome after all.

355
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,980
We thought we were going to have to get ragtime Cowboy Joe.

356
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,600
Hey, I can tell he's been wrestling.

357
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,520
He's got that Band-Aid across his forehead

358
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,860
where he bladed himself so he'd bleed,

359
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,800
you know, for the show.

360
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,240
You're going to peel that Band-Aid off later

361
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,600
and bleed for everybody, right?

362
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,860
Boy, there's a bunch of old people up here now.

363
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,460
That's right.

364
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,320
Hey, now I got this little half-erect mic.

365
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,440
Here, buddy.

366
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


367
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


368
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


369
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


370
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


371
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


372
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


373
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


374
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


375
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


376
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,440


377
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,680
I'm going to take a mic again.

378
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,760
How'd this happen?

379
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,660
It's only half-erect, I think.

380
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:49,840
Yeah.

381
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,680
What's BFC stand for?

382
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,800
What's that banging against the table?

383
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,540
Suzy will show you how to work that thing.

384
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,740
I can't believe it says,

385
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,660
I never made that connection before.

386
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,780
There are no connections here now.

387
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,000
BFC.

388
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,700
Yeah.

389
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,140
Dave, can I get your cup of coffee?

390
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,720
Surely.

391
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,240
Okay.

392
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,660
We got it.

393
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,300
And the lard to put in it.

394
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,240
Oh.

395
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,740
Ah.

396
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,680
Ah.

397
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,180
Ah.

398
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,360
Ah.

399
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,420
Ah.

400
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,420


401
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,420


402
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,420


403
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,420


404
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,420


405
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,420


406
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,420


407
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm not used to that.

408
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,560
Did everyone have their beans and lard this morning?

409
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,780
Did you?

410
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,160
So we've been waiting for you.

411
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,520
You had your beans and lard this morning?

412
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,000
I love you so much.

413
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,760
Did you have your beans and lard this morning?

414
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:41,300
Mrs. Mammy Whistle, you there with the unguentine hair, did you have too much this morning?

415
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,060
Too much.

416
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,920
That's your old fella.

417
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,180
Thanks, Pap.

418
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,500
Happy?

419
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,640
All right.

420
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,460
Creaming your coffee?

421
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,180
So just the new guys get coffee?

422
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,180
You got a little rope clusters if you need those.

423
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,560
What about those of us that have been here before?

424
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,360
Do we get coffee?

425
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,300
See nuts.

426
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,960
I have.

427
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,760
Do we get any coffee?

428
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,180
You can sure get it.

429
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,360
Yeah.

430
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,440
You can go over there and get that.

431
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,880
Where is it?

432
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,620
I'll get you coffee.

433
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,660
From the coffee service.

434
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,520
Actually.

435
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,460
It's right back there.

436
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,300
I'll get you coffee.

437
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,120
I'm going to squat down here.

438
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,740
That's in keeping.

439
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,620
Let's have the woman serve the coffee.

440
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,160
Nothing to do with that.

441
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,160


442
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,160


443
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,160


444
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,180
I don't need any cream in my coffee this time.

445
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,980
There's no coffee.

446
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,660
Don't want no sugar in your pudding.

447
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,540
Hey, guess what?

448
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,540
There's no coffee.

449
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,960
It was all a sham, a mockery.

450
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,020
This is filled with dark colored mucus, man.

451
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,520
Just drink it.

452
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,480
No, I see it.

453
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,340
Coffee.

454
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,900
Drink up.

455
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,700
You look like a professional wrestler, Dave.

456
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,180
You look like a professional wrestler.

457
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,280
You've got cups.

458
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,840
You can pretend like you're drinking coffee.

459
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,800
You've got the bandaid on your forehead.

460
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,420
You know?

461
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,520
Like you're getting ready to take it off during the match, you know, when somebody

462
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,700
gives you a chair shot.

463
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,500
Well, we're going to have coffee, and we're going to have a lot of things, and I don't

464
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,300
think we need to quarrel over coffee.

465
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,560
And we certainly don't need to talk about the trevination scar here, which was a poor

466
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,820
attempt.

467
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:03,920
No, thanks.

468
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,580
I won't use the cream.

469
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,060
I won't need the cream right now.

470
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,960
You know, lonesome cowboy Dave, I appreciate your scar.

471
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,260
No, no.

472
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,920
It's perfectly fine.

473
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,400
But I have to say, it must pale besides the cream.

474
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,440
It's a great scar of legume, which has been on display for the past couple of days.

475
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,920
But it's a fine, righteous scar.

476
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,060
Where is legume?

477
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,320
Is he here?

478
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,100
He's back there, that scarred bastard.

479
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,120
Saw him earlier.

480
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:23,860
There he is.

481
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,220
Yeah.

482
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,260
Man.

483
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,560
Has he shown his scar yet?

484
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,280
He has shown it.

485
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,680
He's been showing that scar.

486
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,360
I'll show it to you, by appointment only.

487
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,780
His butt crack goes all the way up the back of his spine, up over his head, down the nose,

488
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,660
across the lips, and down the front again, and he's got a camel toe.

489
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,340
That was one hell of a surgery.

490
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,280
You've got a zipper.

491
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,220
You need a camel toe.

492
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,060
He's got two camel toes now.

493
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,760
I think they just chainsawed him down, froze him first, and kind of .

494
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,900
I see him back there, looking up here.

495
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,680
Look, he's nodding his head.

496
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,600
He's not happy.

497
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,480
He died five times, and they didn't bring him back.

498
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,820
He doesn't like this particular conjecture, this angle, this tangent.

499
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,940
Not while he's drooling like that.

500
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,460
Cowards die many times before their deaths.

501
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,800
Although I saw his eyebrows go up that time.

502
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,740
The valiant never tasted death but once.

503
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,500
Dr. LeGim had his operation.

504
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,700
He was cut in half vertically.

505
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,660
Yeah.

506
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,440
He was cut.

507
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,500
He was bifurcated.

508
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,700
That was the only way to get that deep down inside.

509
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:22,640
Yeah.

510
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,060
That reminds me of that old Justin Wilson joke.

511
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,600
Remember?

512
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:33,500
He said they had a car wreck, and he asked his wife after the wreck, he said,

513
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,620
Honey, is you hurt?

514
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:41,100
She said, Oh, I'm cut from all the way up here to all the way back here.

515
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,940
And he said, I know, but is you hurt?

516
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,980
Justin Wilson.

517
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,660
You had to pee there.

518
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,720
Yeah, you had to pee there.

519
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,840
He was no Bill Hicks.

520
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,040
You had to have been him.

521
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,740
You're supposed to finish it with I guarantee.

522
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,920
I guarantee.

523
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,740
That's apparently where everybody knew they were supposed to be.

524
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,220
They said you were a pair of pants as well.

525
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,640
They hadn't laughed up to that point.

526
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,480
That's when they would laugh.

527
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,700
That's pink humor.

528
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,380
Nothing funny.

529
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:06,860
I guarantee.

530
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,360
But as soon as the catchphrase comes up, they know they're supposed to robotically

531
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,700
laugh.

532
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,080
That was funny.

533
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,080


534
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,080


535
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,080


536
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,080


537
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,080


538
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,080


539
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,080


540
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,580
I think that's during that time of double entendre, you couldn't really say that stuff.

541
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,520
You had to layer it on real heavy.

542
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,180
The days of sociopaths and double dildos.

543
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,940
Man, that was...

544
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,980
You get like Jeb and Cousin Easy doing the golf game where it's like, okay, you grabbed

545
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,360
your putter and...

546
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,460
Yeah, that guy that painted the pictures, but they were totally...

547
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
But it was for women that were painting in the nude.

548
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,180
Or men.

549
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,400
Painting men and women in the nude.

550
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,860
I painted in the nude a lot.

551
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,840
All those rocks I did.

552
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,120
Oh yeah, I got one of those rocks.

553
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,440
I painted those rocks naked.

554
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,020
I got a rock with a pipe on it.

555
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,280
And used to leave the studio doors wide open so everyone could see.

556
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,680
It's not a place of veneration.

557
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,880
Well, you painted those rocks?

558
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,180
I thought those were the angel turds.

559
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,500
Well, I shat them out first and then I painted them.

560
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,140
Don't worry.

561
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,320
I thought the angels shat them out already painted.

562
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,220
It's stagecraft.

563
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,720
The artwork was stagecraft.

564
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,520
I'm sorry to disabuse you.

565
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,900
I wanted to abuse you.

566
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,760
It was an angle, not an angel.

567
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,540
It was misplaced.

568
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


569
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


570
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


571
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


572
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


573
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


574
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,300
I'm going to find out what's supposed to be going on right now.

575
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,640
Well, we already had Biceys read the schedule.

576
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,200
You'll have to catch up.

577
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,820
Pay more attention.

578
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,060
You missed the naked stuff.

579
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,980
I got here late.

580
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,360
I didn't mean to get here late.

581
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,160
There was a lot of naked stuff.

582
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,020
It was great naked stuff.

583
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,240
Could it be replayed in front of us right now?

584
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,000
No, it could not because we do not photograph it.

585
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,880
That's part of the law there.

586
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,760
The girls won't take their clothes off if they know their grandma is going to be able

587
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,000
to see it on the internet tomorrow.

588
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,560
We have to take mental pictures.

589
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,580
Back before grandma was on the internet, oh, they'd show off their titties to every boy

590
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,260
with the camera.

591
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,840
But then granny got on America Online and immediately looked up subgenius.com.

592
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,320
I'm going to see what my little granddaughter televangelist has been up to.

593
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:01,960
See, the show's gotten better already.

594
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,120
Grandma's not a natural blonde.

595
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,120
See, that's all it takes to improve the show.

596
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,140
Oh, my God.

597
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,860
There's my little granddaughter televangelist.

598
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,200
Mom, I've got a great idea.

599
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,200


600
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,200


601
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,200


602
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,200


603
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,200


604
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,580
I was the presidential wrestling naked on a giant American flag.

605
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,460
With Janer.

606
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,060
With all you boys.

607
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,220
Yeah, with Janer.

608
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,460
Sexy on the American flag, sex through the windowpane.

609
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,640
Janer was given his chance.

610
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,300
I know what, Joss.

611
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,840
Lots of chances.

612
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,100
What was this about not snapping pictures?

613
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,780
Well, you know.

614
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,540
Yesterday, yesterday we lied and told the radio audience we were all naked, but this time

615
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,200
we're not lying.

616
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,980
We're not all naked.

617
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,240
Is there a neo-Nazi rally for peace tonight?

618
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,600
You know what I mean?

619
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,320
Brotherhood.

620
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,900
A rally? A neo-Nazi rally

621
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,080
for peace and brotherhood. A political demonstration

622
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,660
here at Brushwood?

623
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,280
I think we're beyond petty

624
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,440
human politics.

625
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,260
No one here is a Whig

626
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,360
or anything like that.

627
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,360
That's correct. We've left it all behind.

628
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,980
We've flipped the Whigs.

629
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,520
We've left the Federalist tissue

630
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,180
paper in the toilet where it belongs.

631
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,260
It's time to join the

632
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,900
ex-humanite party.

633
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,160
The ex-humanites shall

634
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,660
rise from the ashes.

635
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,580
And believe me, you're all a bunch of

636
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,420
ashes from what I can see right now.

637
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,600
If we're even thinking of it.

638
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,220
Yeah, well, I'm like a phoenix rising

639
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,200
from the ashes.

640
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,460
It ends a physical body. It has raised

641
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,480
the spiritual body.

642
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,500
And there is no such

643
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,340
thing. And staying reached

644
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,340
for his nuts. Ensure uncertain hope

645
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,340
of resurrection.

646
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,020
The day after tomorrow.

647
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,320
I wanted

648
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,760
more nuts. The love.

649
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,740
It's one more.

650
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,900
Would you think of it, Dr. Howell?

651
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,160
It's always propounded as to be the day after tomorrow.

652
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,860
When will the world end?

653
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,940
When will this new thing come about?

654
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,260
When will we all be lifted up into some sort of

655
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,360
potty chair? Some giant

656
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,460
fuzzy potty chair made out of

657
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,240
strange musicians?

658
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,640
We have a date and a time.

659
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,480
A date and a time.

660
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,400
Here comes the candy.

661
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,520
Candy for Mandy.

662
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,300
Candy for Mandy.

663
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,400
Lovely, sugary.

664
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,620
Candy.

665
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,560
There's peanuts on the microphone.

666
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,900
There's butterscotch. And there's chewy

667
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,920
nougat. There's blisters on the

668
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
bare butt. What's the point of

669
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,660
this? Oh, well, it's X-Day.

670
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,920
There's a weird cackling sound coming from the bushes.

671
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,940
What illegal piece of candy shall I

672
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:24,940


673
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,400
I warm up the getses by putting them between my boobs

674
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,100
first. What the hell is this?

675
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,520
Even on Halloween, I never saw.

676
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,440
It's got a

677
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,320
creamy center, which is disgusting.

678
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,660
It does. I generally steer clear

679
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,960
of those. You can poke your tongue.

680
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,440
But I just gotta try it.

681
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,620
Getses. Go out and give it

682
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,780
your best try right now.

683
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,200
I always have to tongue pork these.

684
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,200
I think, I think.

685
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,040
Therefore, I stink.

686
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,500
How obvious. You're drinking coffee.

687
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,640
You could have candy and coffee like they have

688
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,480
in Amsterdam. You're smarties.

689
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,200
These will make you smarter.

690
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,100
Brain candy.

691
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,520
Those are rabbit pellets.

692
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,980
Then you line it.

693
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,520
Put the lemon head in there.

694
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,340
It's sort of like a

695
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,880
Tootsie Roll that ran into an Oreo

696
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,340
at high speed for later.

697
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,640
But is there an anadol?

698
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,760
Wow.

699
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,720
It's another thing I hate. When you radio DJs get on

700
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,600
and start talking about how yummy the food

701
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,640
is that you're eating.

702
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,440
And the poor radio listeners, all they have to eat

703
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,820
is that sound coming out.

704
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,620
What's the part of our show that you like, Reverend?

705
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,160
Yeah, tell us something good that we do.

706
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,660
Tell us something that you like about it.

707
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,720
Why all this bitching about other radio shows?

708
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,040
The silent parts, right?

709
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,720
I'm the mean one. I have to talk.

710
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,040
There's gotta be something.

711
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,380
I mean, if you were recommending our show to somebody,

712
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,000
what would it be?

713
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,140
We were taking a breath, right?

714
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,080
I would say that listening to the

715
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,920
puzzling evidence show is like walking

716
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,960
through a dream.

717
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,080
A world in which you were at the

718
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,920
party of the most clever,

719
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,880
spontaneous surrealists.

720
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,920
To compete, it's like...

721
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,820
You could ever imagine.

722
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,300
It's like attacking an evil monster

723
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,900
with a tiny little sausage.

724
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,320
It's like...

725
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,320


726
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,320


727
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,000
This can't be done, but you valiantly try.

728
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,680
You hold that sausage aloft and you...

729
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,640
And then layer on some

730
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,980
unlistenable pop music.

731
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,940
Japanese pop.

732
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,460
I'm sorry.

733
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,500
You certainly are.

734
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,820
What do you think?

735
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,640
There's a phone call coming in?

736
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
Is Washington calling?

737
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,920
Has Washington called yet?

738
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,520
When are we gonna have to

739
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,560
start getting entertaining?

740
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,640
I'm not sure.

741
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:38,640


742
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,800
We're not sure.

743
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:39,800


744
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:39,800


745
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:39,800


746
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,760
It's been the last three hours,

747
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,160
hasn't it?

748
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,320
Well, we got the background picture

749
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,760
and we got the background music.

750
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,060
The band wants their microphones back.

751
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,520
I'll put my shirt back on

752
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,120
and we can begin.

753
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,020
The band wants their microphones back.

754
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,260
Who wants to fumigate them this time?

755
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,400
Has anyone in the listless audience

756
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,120
spouted one of these unusual tumors lately?

757
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,420
I mean, just out of the clear blue,

758
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,900
it just pops out real hard

759
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,620
and it points at different radio frequencies.

760
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,120
Does anybody know?

761
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,860
I got one.

762
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,500
I had that once.

763
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,680
It's more like a three more.

764
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,460
I had that once.

765
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,100
I can cut it out with a big knife.

766
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,820
I can help you out with that

767
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,620
if you need some help.

768
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,360
Can't you just bite the head off it

769
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,180
and sploot it?

770
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,700
We do a biopsy.

771
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,420
You look like you've got the shangs for it.

772
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,180
Could you give it a try?

773
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,040
We do it just like a biopsy,

774
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,620
but we forego all the scientific part of it.

775
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,540
How did you stumble over that?

776
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,320
I had no idea.

777
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,520
We'll be right back.

778
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,940
Bob.

779
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,520
Well, thank you.

780
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,520
Boggles my mind.

781
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,100
D. Lister.

782
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,460
I don't know about the rest of you,

783
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,480
but I have been out there

784
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,120
in the world of the pinks and the normals

785
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,660
preaching the word of Bob.

786
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,600
Praise Bob!

787
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,940
And the most frequent question that I am asked is,

788
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,720
how can I get slack?

789
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,220
If you have to ask,

790
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,320
then you cannot get slack.

791
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,640
Because slack is not something

792
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,520
that you can strive to attain.

793
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,220
Am I right?

794
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,620
Slack is something that comes to you

795
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,580
when you least expect it.

796
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,160
And if you are asking for it,

797
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,520
then you will never get it.

798
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,860
It's kind of like sex in that way, isn't it?

799
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,580
Well, those of you who have not experienced sex yet,

800
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,600
I guess can't really answer that question.

801
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:35,780
Sorry.

802
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,200
But anyways,

803
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,840
the slack that I have been experiencing here

804
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,740
has been the best slack that I have had.

805
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,960
But yet, I'm sure there's better slack out there.

806
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,440
Am I right?

807
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,500
Yes.

808
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,120
Yes.

809
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,460
Yes.

810
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,140
There can be.

811
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,060
Because there's always better slack

812
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,360
than what you have had.

813
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,400
Because there's no limit

814
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,500
to the quality of the slack

815
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,600
that you can experience.

816
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,860
No limits.

817
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,580
No limits.

818
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:10,740
No limits.

819
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,640
Because if there was a cap

820
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,060
on the slack quality,

821
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,860
then once you achieve

822
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,540
the limit of slack,

823
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,620
then what else would there be to live for?

824
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,120
There wouldn't be nothing.

825
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,680
Exactly, brother.

826
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,380
Until the fucking exes get here,

827
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,760
which we hope they will do

828
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,000
in less than 36 hours,

829
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,860
then we must strive

830
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,840
to

831
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,020
not care about our slack.

832
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,020
And that's how we will get our slack.

833
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,800
But also,

834
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,740
the people that are out there,

835
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,640
that are here,

836
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
that are just wandering around,

837
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,160
milling around,

838
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,380
just doing whatever the fuck they want,

839
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,040
that is slackful.

840
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,780
I will admit that is slackful.

841
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,600
However,

842
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,340
there should also be

843
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,900
some helping out with everything.

844
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,840
Right?

845
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,540
Volunteering.

846
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,620
Is volunteering a good thing, Pisces?

847
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,440
It certainly is.

848
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,140
Is that good slack from volunteering?

849
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,800
There is a definite slack reward

850
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,360
for volunteering, yes.

851
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,680
If you give away that slack,

852
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,600
you'll get it back.

853
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,220
Thank you.

854
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,880
If you didn't hear that,

855
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,180
if you give the slack,

856
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,520
you get it back.

857
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,740
You can help out in many ways.

858
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,100
Pick up trash that you see.

859
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,620
That will give you slack.

860
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,140
Help at the bridge desk

861
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,820
or the slack desk.

862
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,260
Slack shack.

863
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,100
Swag shack, whatever.

864
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,480
That gives you slack.

865
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,020
But,

866
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,540
as Reverend Sex Mortis said,

867
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,940
the most important thing

868
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,660
is to not fuck

869
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,940
with anyone else's slack!

870
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,080
Because fucking with someone else's slack

871
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,500
is the anti-slack!

872
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,360
And nobody wants the anti-slack.

873
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,380
No!

874
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,500
Whoo!

875
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,060


876
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,880
Praise to you, Lister!

877
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,860
Thank you, robot!

878
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,720
Whoo!

879
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,680
Dave, I noticed that you're wearing a bandage

880
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,220
over your third nostril.

881
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,620
I told you that,

882
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,360
and I told the listless audience,

883
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,380
that that was a kind of a poor attempt.

884
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,380
He's got a scar.

885
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,860
He was lancing a boil.

886
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,940
To treponate my third eye.

887
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,320
Oh, I thought that had already been done.

888
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,280
Oh, valiant.

889
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,300
You're a do-it-yourself third eye treponation?

890
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,320
Well, after the miscalculations

891
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,880
on the first 14 tries,

892
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,860
I suppose something had to be done.

893
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,700
I mean, people say I fidget with it too much.

894
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,620
But how can you fidget with a tumor?

895
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,400
It's not a fun thing to fidget with.

896
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,360
Fidget is like a tool tool.

897
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,740
They're often hard to reach.

898
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,620
Yeah, that's what it is.

899
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,440
It's a horn stub.

900
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,000
Yes, it's a horn.

901
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,180
An antler root.

902
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,820
It is growing and growing.

903
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,680
Growing daily.

904
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,060
And by the time 5 a.m. in the morning,

905
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,960
on the 5th, it's 4 a.m.,

906
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,100
some a.m. in the morning,

907
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,500
this antler will bloom like a giant rose bush.

908
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,740
I think it would be cool to have an antler sprouting from your head.

909
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,020
I wanted a giant penis to sprout from my head

910
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,980
because I knew it would be a symbol of masculine power.

911
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,580
People don't, don't, don't, don't ever...

912
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,480
It could make you very popular too.

913
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,740
It could pop you right up there.

914
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,980
Yeah, you'd be like on the top level of popularity

915
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,620
with a huge penis sprouting from your forehead.

916
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,360
If it was a small one, you'd have to join the many minions of underachievers.

917
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,660
If it was a small one, you'd just be apologizing for it all the time.

918
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,940
Oh, I thought you were just going to say you would be a politician.

919
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,320
Well, you don't need that to be a politician.

920
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,980
A little dickhead.

921
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,580
They've proven that you don't really need anything.

922
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,340
Actually, these special glasses Bob sells you,

923
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,420
you can't see the penis.

924
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,560
The penis is sprouting out of the politician's head.

925
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,600
It's like they live, but not too badly.

926
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,560
I've actually been to the halls of Congress

927
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,240
and they have a water fountain there that says power on it.

928
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,180
And you just sip on it and it just makes you really powerful.

929
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,560
That's the one of the cherry whites only.

930
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,140
And it makes you know everything and know a lot better, more.

931
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,640
Is that the one of the cherubim urinating on everyone's head?

932
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,920
They will at your request.

933
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,880
It's just populous underneath and they're urinating.

934
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,760
I'm going to go off of this water fountain.

935
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,540
Did you drink some?

936
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,180
No, I'm not allowed.

937
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,020
I'm not an elected official, so I don't get a chance to.

938
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,260
I'm just one of the pleads.

939
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,620
He's an erected unofficial.

940
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,400
That was behind Rocknar's campaign.

941
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,160
He hoped, if elected, to taste that Perian Spring.

942
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,600
I told him he wouldn't be able to resist it.

943
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,040
Well, he wouldn't be able to resist the money anyway.

944
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,960
One sip and you have to go back.

945
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,480
It's like the most addictive liquid.

946
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,320
It's more than liquid crack.

947
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,740
A real Ponce de Leon.

948
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,240
It's like liquid crack heroin.

949
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,400
It is a fountain of juice.

950
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,260
It tastes good and smells good, too.

951
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,620
Well, you're making me thirsty, as you described before.

952
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,220
One sip and you become twice as thirsty as you were when you first drank it.

953
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,780
Political waters.

954
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,820
So deep, so murky.

955
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,480
The water of Bob.

956
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,860
The water of Bob.

957
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,660
But it's worth it because you're so much smarter after that.

958
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,580
The yellow water of Bob.

959
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,480
And you know so much more than everyone and so much better than everyone.

960
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,740
Say, for instance, you had to perform an instant...

961
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,600
And you know then that it's true.

962
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,420
You are better than everyone.

963
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,420
And this trickles down onto your feet.

964
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,220
It only trickles down into the one individual who's actually sipping of the special sauce.

965
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,020
Bob's pee, I mean water, can trickle up.

966
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,720
It's more like blood dripping from an abused rectum.

967
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,320
It's a special water fountain.

968
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,600
You can only get it in these few areas, you know.

969
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,160
You have to go.

970
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,620
There's a bunch of old guys standing in line waiting to drink on it again.

971
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,100
Yes, step right up, señor.

972
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,080
This is the water of youth.

973
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,820
The fountain you have dreamed of for so long.

974
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,100
There's vendors that service the line while you're in it.

975
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,340
Only one cup per pasenor.

976
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,820
You know there's guys selling hot dogs and drinks and stuff while you're waiting in line to sip on that.

977
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,640
Yeah, but those aren't real people or not people.

978
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,740
They're vendors.

979
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,880
They're vendors.

980
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,520
Yeah.

981
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,740
They're psycho-cyborgic vendors.

982
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,520
They look like people and have all the irritating qualities...

983
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,960
Psycho-cyborgic?

984
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,260
Cyborg-vendor?

985
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,940
Cyborg-nation.

986
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,920
Too much onions, not enough.

987
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,720
Unlicensed vendors.

988
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,500
Get away from me.

989
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,460
Screw off.

990
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:39,860
Die, die, die.

991
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:47,820
That's the way it was back in the year 1395, when Grandpapi fell out of this hole right

992
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:53,620
here, and when he did, he brought back many secrets, one of which is...

993
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,600
But in today's modern world...

994
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:00,720
Sure.

995
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,280
It's all tied up with a bureaucratic tangle of regulatory structure,

996
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:13,480
making it impossible to put up a taco stand without trespassing on somebody's copyright or legal liability.

997
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,860
Code 60.

998
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,920
I don't have tacos.

999
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,680
And one half.

1000
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,640
No hot dogs beyond the wiener wagon fringed around the pail.

1001
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,860
What is going to cut through all the red tape?

1002
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:35,060
What Alexandrian sword will cleave the Gordian tangle caused by busybodies, goo-goos, and nosy parkers?

1003
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:40,820
Well, I think that the key word in your statement of solution would be sword.

1004
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,940
It takes a sword to cut through that knot.

1005
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,700
That was Alexander's solution.

1006
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,660
Hey, Reverend Suds, how's the coverage on the CD recordings?

1007
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,120
That was...

1008
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,800
Okay, so in a few minutes we'll need to shut up long enough to flip the CD.

1009
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,820
I love that new quick-moving technology.

1010
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,020
Subgenius is 72, humans 16.

1011
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,860
That was the score last night.

1012
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,800
Then if you take a look again at what happened,

1013
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,520
there have been a lot of discrepancies in the film and the footage.

1014
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,940
Number one here, the first thing, it was a bad call as J.R. Bob Dobbs emerged from the bushes

1015
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,600
and ripped...

1016
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,060
One of the very, very hapless, unlikely first-time submitters to the cause

1017
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,700
tore his head neatly off his shoulders and then ate the neck juice.

1018
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,400
But you said that was J. Nor Bob Dobbs, not J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1019
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,540
J. Nor B. Bob.

1020
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,100
J. Nor Bob Dobbs.

1021
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,400
May.

1022
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,360
I never heard one.

1023
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,440
Where was that one?

1024
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,300
He's going a little bit far with that one.

1025
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,760
That one is implied by the Church of the Subgenior, if you don't think about it for a moment.

1026
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,840
Because according to the doctrine of the...

1027
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,140
According to the Church of the Subgenior, everyone is a member,

1028
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,620
and that would include Bob Dobbs.

1029
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,720
He would be Sergeant J. Nor Dobbs.

1030
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,900
Even members of the Church of Don?

1031
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,140
Yes.

1032
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,620
The only one who can't be a member of the Church of the Subgenior is, of course, J. Nor.

1033
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,640
The Church of...

1034
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,000
According to the rules created by Nenslow,

1035
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,900
Ascended Nen Master, or as some call him, Sergeant J. Nor Nenslow.

1036
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,000
Assassinated Nen Master Nenslow.

1037
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,720
All members of the Church...

1038
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:29,120
The Church of the Subgenior are allowed to address each other as Sarge, Sarge,

1039
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,420
and take the name Sergeant J. Nor, followed by your actual name.

1040
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,060
Can they say Ma'am?

1041
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,500
Captain?

1042
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,680
I mean...

1043
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:36,960
Yes.

1044
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,660
Sarge J. Nor.

1045
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,720
Sarge J. Nor.

1046
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:38,720


1047
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm a Sarge.

1048
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,020
I drink some of this brackish water that's...

1049
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,600
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments about...

1050
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,840
He's the most non-joiner of non-joiners.

1051
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,060
Hey, but if we're talking about J. Nor, that means I can't use it on my show.

1052
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,620
We're talking about Nenslow.

1053
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,680
How come there's been so much talk...

1054
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,400
We're talking about J. Nor this time, which is all unusable.

1055
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,820
I'm talking about Nenslow.

1056
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,120
Well, we can dig it.

1057
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,600
Because it makes us feel free to say the unusable.

1058
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,660
To say the unspeakable.

1059
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,880
What we're not usually allowed to talk about or even mention.

1060
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,420
The unbroadcastable.

1061
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,500
But it's X-Day.

1062
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,560
The uneditable.

1063
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,100
And you can always...

1064
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,360
Should we survive X-Day in some way, you could always put...

1065
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,680
Pork slap.

1066
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,420
Who has an instrumental version of Shaft?

1067
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,580
I should have one taped to my leg.

1068
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,560
We could also use the oblique channel.

1069
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,560
And we could just refer to it as...

1070
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,780
Im-her-it-is.

1071
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,720
Non-joiner.

1072
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,680
You could bleep it out.

1073
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,800
Weep?

1074
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,120
Bleep it out.

1075
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,780
Weep.

1076
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,880
Weep and bleep.

1077
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,720
That's the cry of the unused radio man.

1078
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,260
Bleep that ye may not weep.

1079
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,840
Can you see with those eyes crossed that bleep?

1080
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,180
What the bleep do we know?

1081
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,280
God, what's that?

1082
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,520
An irritating...

1083
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,780
Most horrible movie.

1084
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,240
Yeah.

1085
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,620
Not just...

1086
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:54,660
Not just...

1087
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,640
You irritated me.

1088
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,820
I just wanted to stab the screen with a big knife.

1089
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,140
I wanted...

1090
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,740
Four minutes until we have to shut up long enough for Potter and Ostril to change the high-speed duplicator.

1091
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,380
Yes, four minutes.

1092
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,360
Jane or Jane or Jane or Jane.

1093
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,720
And then it's two minutes of...

1094
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,200
That's when everybody gets really, really funny.

1095
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,820
As soon as they know the recorder's off.

1096
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,620
As sure as nothing is happening.

1097
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,640
Yes, we haven't been saying much.

1098
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,860
The little laugh-o-meter has been down to below zero.

1099
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,500
For quite a while now.

1100
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,400
I think we ought to just get very, very quiet and pretend.

1101
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,220
Ladies and gentlemen.

1102
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,340
For the past ten years, we heard nothing about...

1103
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,360
On TV except about...

1104
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,080
We're Americans.

1105
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,060
Right?

1106
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,580
And we're the biggest...

1107
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,400
We're the toughest nation in the world.

1108
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,380
Fuck today, man.

1109
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,660
We're a bunch of pussies.

1110
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,300
You go to some place and you get lousy service.

1111
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
And you say, I'll show them.

1112
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,420
I'll fill up this little 4x8 car that goes to somebody in the corporate office.

1113
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,580
We need to take a fucking clue from some other country.

1114
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,660
You know, I was reading the paper about five years ago.

1115
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
In Argentina, a bunch of passengers were stranded at the airport.

1116
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,540
You know how they have to do it to you?

1117
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,700
Know what they do to you?

1118
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,580
You know how they do it to you?

1119
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,140
You leave you at the airport with no plane?

1120
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,160
They burn down the fucking airport!

1121
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,220
That's how they do it!

1122
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,840
Fuck that five-minute thing!

1123
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,460
4x8 car!

1124
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,940
You burn down the fucking restaurant!

1125
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,120
You don't like that steak?

1126
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,720
Fucking Americans.

1127
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,120
How many Americans does it take to change a light bulb?

1128
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,180
16!

1129
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:41,900
That's right.

1130
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,520
You need two of them to complain because the light bulb burned out.

1131
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,240
You need two of them to blame the government.

1132
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,660
You need three of them to hire illegal aliens.

1133
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,480
You need three of them to blame Obama for the change of the light bulb.

1134
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,520
The change of the light bulb because they're too fucking fat and lazy to do it themselves.

1135
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,100
You need another two to go on Fox News and blame Obama.

1136
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,860
How many is that?

1137
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,260
All else counts.

1138
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,640
Well, you need the rest of them.

1139
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,540
The rest of them got to complain because the illegal aliens took the job,

1140
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,880
even though they would never stoop as low to change a light bulb.

1141
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,080
They need the rest of them.

1142
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,880
They said they have to change the light bulb unless they get like a secret no-big contract.

1143
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,780
No big contract.

1144
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:23,820
No big contract.

1145
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:23,820


1146
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,140
No big contract.

1147
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,480
No big contract.

1148
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,080
But they will change the light bulb with that.

1149
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,160
That's why we're fucking pussies.

1150
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,840
I'm sick of it.

1151
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,480
You know what?

1152
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,680
The conspiracy has been bullshitting us since I was a little kid.

1153
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,580
Because when I was a kid in first grade,

1154
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,480
he used to show all these movies what the future is going to be like.

1155
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,560
Yeah, the future is going to be perfect.

1156
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,080
We're going to have flying cars.

1157
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,800
We're going to have flying cars.

1158
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,380
We're going to have talking dogs that go,

1159
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,240
what will it work?

1160
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,100
We're going to have houses on the moon.

1161
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,740
Well, I'll tell you what.

1162
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,920
I'm looking around.

1163
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,420
I ain't got no fucking flying car yet.

1164
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,760
Motherfucker.

1165
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,580
I want my fucking flying car.

1166
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,940
Fuck the conspiracy.

1167
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,540
I want my fucking flying car.

1168
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,160
I want it now.

1169
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,660
Last night I heard a prominent subgenius angry

1170
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,800
because he hadn't received his flyer.

1171
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,340
He's flying car.

1172
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,160
He's flying car?

1173
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,220
He's flying car.

1174
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,420
Yeah, it was Reverend Skull.

1175
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,100
Reverend Skull was complaining about not getting his flying car.

1176
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,260
That was an unusual rant for you.

1177
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,200
That was not your normal sermon.

1178
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,380
There were a lot more vocabulary words in it.

1179
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,100
I can see your...

1180
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,360
In English.

1181
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,380
I kind of feel the same way about the whole flying car thing, though.

1182
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
I wish I had one.

1183
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,260
I was really impressed by the ranting last night.

1184
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,680
But I did hear that they're kind of like still in the way.

1185
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,500
They say through the FCC on that issue are the F...

1186
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,820
Not the FCC, the FAA.

1187
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,460
FAA.

1188
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,100
They did build flying cars, but they had to stop manufacturing them

1189
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,500
because no one can use them

1190
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,520
because the moment your flying car takes off,

1191
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,860
it becomes an aircraft and you have to file a flight plan

1192
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,480
and you're in another level of...

1193
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,720
But now we have the Internet.

1194
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,100
So you instantly file a templatized flight plan on the Internet

1195
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,680
and that takes care of the government paperwork.

1196
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,800
And also there are plenty of sebaceous cysts

1197
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,660
and lots of chronic...

1198
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,360
And there are tons in the hallway.

1199
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,460
So you need to get the invisibility thing worked out

1200
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,180
and then it all becomes a moot point.

1201
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,760
The flying cars they came up with were good, too.

1202
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,940
Hugh Hefner bought one.

1203
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,060
They have a cruising range of 300 miles.

1204
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,760
They fly.

1205
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,780
They do everything you think,

1206
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,540
except they're totally illegal to use.

1207
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,300
But that's what I was saying.

1208
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,580
The FAA has just recently...

1209
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,380
Belly dances.

1210
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,120
...come up with some standards...

1211
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,100
Jeez, falling from the sky like it was some kind of...

1212
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,720
I don't know what's happening.

1213
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,800
We're going to have to wrap it up for a few minutes here.

1214
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,460
Okay, we have to wrap it up.

1215
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:53,660
We're going to wrap it up.

1216
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,380
While the radio runabout turns over.

1217
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,920
And so we leave you with the beautiful sounds of recorded music.

1218
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,080
We'll be back in two shakes of a fish's tail

1219
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,920
ere the Leviathan can swim a league.

1220
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:11,840
Wow.

1221
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,080
That's pretty good.

1222
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,840
What is happening here?

1223
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,740
What has happened to your nose?

1224
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,000
He has just returned to life.

1225
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,740
What happened, Love?

1226
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,780
Honey, they know.

1227
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:38,860
All right, just just shut up.

1228
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:38,860


1229
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,800
What happened that night?

1230
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,500
honouring the

1231
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:43,500


1232
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,120
Oh, my God.

1233
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,120


1234
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,120


1235
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,120


1236
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,820
A beautiful one in the middle of more than seven years

1237
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,500
than later on.

1238
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,500


1239
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,500


1240
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,500


1241
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,500


1242
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,380
I think you can't.

1243
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:53,660
I don't even know what's happening.

1244
00:44:53,660 --> 00:45:06,380
I swear I saw a figure walking across that field with the glowing fish instead of.

1245
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:12,720
I just fell to my knees and I kneeled and there he was.

1246
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,360
I knew that smiling grin and there he was.

1247
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,520
Bob's come back home to us again I said.

1248
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,620
Bob's come back home to us again.

1249
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,560
But something sinister was afoot.

1250
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,160
There was this coldness in my soul.

1251
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,340
I was in a daze.

1252
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,040
I was still taking the run.

1253
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:58,800
And I wasn't 100% sure of what was to happen or be.

1254
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,300
But that wasn't Bob.

1255
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,900
And he was coming right for me.

1256
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:33,360
And I knew right away what I had found.

1257
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,020
The Antifog was on Rushwood's Ground.

1258
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,280
The Antifog was on Rushwood's Ground.

1259
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,460
The Antifog was on Rushwood's Ground.

1260
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,960
The Antifog was on Rushwood's Ground.

1261
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,940
I'll tell you one of my favorite stories.

1262
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,860
I don't put jeans on.

1263
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,540
Come on, look at me and get radical.

1264
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,140
If you want to do that, that's fine, but I don't.

1265
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,500
We're going to stop you, Bob.

1266
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,980
All right.

1267
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:06,560
Woo!

1268
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,300
Okay.

1269
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,380
Bob, come on.

1270
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,140
Kill Bob!

1271
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,760
You're looking at me like you didn't get it.

1272
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:19,620
We get that a lot, friends, and we got that cut from Heart Ignition.

1273
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:26,140
Before that was Priestess Pisces and Six-Fisted Tales of Connie at 13X Day Thursday night,

1274
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,900
making it all up as they went along, as is this music in the background.

1275
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:36,440
Six-Fisted Tales that night included Reverend Angry Larry, Reverend Suds Peshaw,

1276
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,280
Reverend Phil, Senator Speck, Dr. Philo Drummond, and Reverend Bunny Day.

1277
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,800
Stang just drained a gallon out of that thing.

1278
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:51,220
That's because he's going to turn that useless water into powerful coffee.

1279
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,040
But damn.

1280
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,180
Powerful coffee will be produced out of that water.

1281
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,960
Stuff just floating in the water.

1282
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:57,940
Yeah.

1283
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,220
Animalcules.

1284
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,320
Animalcules?

1285
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,560
Foraminifera.

1286
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:03,720
Foraminifera.

1287
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,520
Gyroscopa.

1288
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,420
Tiny diatoms, spider squids, ding futzers, and whirligigs.

1289
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,560
Gynaecoli.

1290
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,100
Nyah!

1291
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,880
Only microns in diameter.

1292
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,200
Frostbitten fleas.

1293
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,680
Hard-bitten fleas.

1294
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,060
Arguments with hard-bitten floozies.

1295
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,520
This is X-Day Radio.

1296
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,020
That's right.

1297
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:37,140
The legend burned across the land, blazing like a burning brand or whatever, for X-Day.

1298
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,820
Doctor, how long has the legend gone on?

1299
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,740
Well, as long as there's...

1300
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,640
There were brave, hardy sons of the soil, hacking and chopping their way westward through the great American landscape.

1301
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,000
Chopping Indians and eating fires.

1302
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,840
This was a wonderful time in our country.

1303
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:57,940
And they just...

1304
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,980
They've landed here again for your listless pleasures.

1305
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,720
Yes, they built general stores and subtleries, laid railroads down across the prairies.

1306
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,920
Conestoga.

1307
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,040
Hewed down Indians and hacked open waterfalls.

1308
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,060
And built the great American slag heap.

1309
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,980
Dug up the gold.

1310
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,800
Argued with the acoustics of the soundboard.

1311
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,100
Ran the phonies.

1312
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,260
Look out, there's Copal and Tungsten.

1313
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,420
I don't believe it, he's gonna drain more.

1314
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,780
Recreated humanity in a little tiny drop of water.

1315
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,640
Water.

1316
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,400
Imagine.

1317
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:32,860
Or don't.

1318
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,640
Just where universes are in that drop of water.

1319
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,460
The source of all life.

1320
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,500
Of strange little one-celled organisms.

1321
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,800
Everybody knows what is real.

1322
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,540
Flagellates.

1323
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:45,960
Fossils.

1324
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,580
I have d-

1325
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,420
Rotifers.

1326
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:47,980
I have d-

1327
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,140
Rotifers.

1328
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,340
You can do smelly.

1329
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,320
I have das kuhn-de-vasser.

1330
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:50,680
You can do smelly.

1331
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:50,680


1332
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:50,680


1333
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:50,900
Uh.

1334
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,820
Das kuhn-de-vasser.

1335
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,340
So those, uh, rotifers were washed out of the, uh, coffee urn.

1336
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,300
In any case, it's-

1337
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:57,680
Kuhn-de-vasser.

1338
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:57,780


1339
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,940
Going to get warm for them in a few minutes.

1340
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,400
Maybe I can get a bottle of the kuhn-fasser.

1341
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,900
And then they'll be ready to drink.

1342
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,080
You see, uh, sterilization, pasteurization, that does work.

1343
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,840
Thank you.

1344
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,420
You can scour the little buggers out of there.

1345
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,400
Ask me, Lois Pasteur.

1346
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,680
I was the one who invented this shit.

1347
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,640
Really, I was.

1348
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,140
And they sneered at Louis Pasteur.

1349
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,460
They snickered at the snicker bar.

1350
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,460
They sneered and snickered.

1351
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,280
If there are these little bugs, why can we not see them?

1352
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,700
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm.

1353
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,920
Why cannot we argue with them, on for say?

1354
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,420
I think the little bugs are in your mind, monsieur, between your eyes.

1355
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:37,740
Look!

1356
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,880
One of them is wearing a punching bag and a blow horn.

1357
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,220
And a tiny derby hat.

1358
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:43,800
A tiny derby?

1359
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,460
With a little umbrella.

1360
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,700
And he's waving it at us, can't you see?

1361
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,600
Wave back, quickly! Quickly! He-

1362
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,840
Too late, he died. His life cycle was too short.

1363
00:50:52,840 --> 00:51:00,360
The only way to prolong the life cycle would be to pump more rotif-rotif-rotif-rotif-rotif back into the water.

1364
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,640
Pack him in amber.

1365
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,480
It's- look!

1366
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,340
The tiny vial of urine.

1367
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,000
Let the evil nymph find its own power.

1368
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,060
Of Dobbs's urine.

1369
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,040
It's all the rotif-rotif-rotif-rotif-rotif we need.

1370
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:19,620
So, Herr Van Leeuwenhoek was startled to see, looking through his experimental microscope, the tiny waving dobs inside each sperm.

1371
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,340
Now we have to change to the Dutch accent.

1372
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,120
And then he had to provide more sample and more and more sample.

1373
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,060
And he kept pumping that sample out.

1374
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,140
Yeah, you've seen those little- those old-

1375
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,300
I can do this all day.

1376
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,440
Especially when there's no connective tissue in your brain. That's the most important part.

1377
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,260
Just let it slide slickly around, from hemisphere to hemisphere.

1378
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,060
Just slopping back and forth.

1379
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:58,980
Yes, your brain is like a washing machine, and the agitator inside disturbing its contents is Bob.

1380
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,200
It's the pipe. It's going around and around and agitator action up and down.

1381
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,800
Making that chugging noise. No one else can hear that. That is you.

1382
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:13,440
Yes, well, now I can hear it, but that's like an illustration of what it's like.

1383
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,340
Makes it hard to sit on it during the spin cycle.

1384
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,000
Oh, the spin cycle. You vibrate. You go to pieces all over. Um, I don't know.

1385
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,780
I did it. I evened the slate.

1386
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,220
How I didn't bust myself all to hell is beyond me.

1387
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:36,120
On Saturday mornings, I'd stand on our front porch, and as the kids came by, I'd beat up, up, and cuss.

1388
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,260
I pulled a grenade out and threw it.

1389
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,200
Bodies. More than a dozen horses had been killed.

1390
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,500
God. Dead horses. Chunks of beef.

1391
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,680
At least it wasn't me.

1392
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,040
Incontinental drift.

1393
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,900
Do you have that?

1394
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,960
Incontinental drift, yeah.

1395
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,240
Yeah, but what...

1396
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,880
It's a chronic problem.

1397
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,020
That's why we have this event outdoors.

1398
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,460
Some planets and life forms.

1399
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,680
So much of us have these leakage issues.

1400
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,320
We got it.

1401
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:09,920
Is anybody here...

1402
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,640
Dispersal.

1403
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:16,120
Dispersal. Arguments with wigs. These are all things we have to watch for.

1404
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,880
We have to stay on the steadfast. And on the... what is it? The standfast?

1405
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,520
We have to stand fast.

1406
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,300
You know that...

1407
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,760
Against these things, and for them too, if they're necessary.

1408
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,660
It says, stand fast for what you believe in.

1409
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,060
Very good. Very good.

1410
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,640
And sit down on your own stool.

1411
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,900
Now, the world is scheduled to end the day after tomorrow, right?

1412
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:35,680
But...

1413
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:42,740
I've read some end of the world paranoid stuff about that oil zit, the Mother Earth zit, the oil volcano.

1414
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,740
But what's the point?

1415
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:51,220
It was so paranoid that to read this guy's rants, you'd think that, eh, it's going to be close call...

1416
00:53:51,220 --> 00:54:02,780
Close tie between the exes getting here in a day and a half, or whether the waves of oil will be splashing over this far inland and submerge brushwood.

1417
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,400
Wow.

1418
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,080
You know, the concept of...

1419
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,360
It's a lot of oil.

1420
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,460
Well, we do know how much oil is in there.

1421
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,800
Well, what if there's more oil down there than there is of water and oceans?

1422
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,780
It could be that the whole...

1423
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,120
It fills up everything. It's the end of the world.

1424
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,240
Hey, maybe we have some oil.

1425
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,900
We know the whole Earth is filled with oil, and that's just where it's squirting out now.

1426
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,460
Maybe we could work out a deal with blood for oil. I heard that was a thing.

1427
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,320
But there's no blood that's in there.

1428
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,360
I'd rather see waves of blood.

1429
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,800
It's just a big bucket, a big barrel of oil.

1430
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,380
That would be really cool.

1431
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:43,620
We could work out a deal of buns for oil. Or no, wait, I'm sorry. It could possibly mean the end of the world in a very, very short period of time.

1432
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,680
Somebody said they had stuffed up that leak.

1433
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,100
That was legume-y.

1434
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,120
Legume said they got a wedding band over it or something, right?

1435
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,600
No, it was some cork and some Kraft cheese.

1436
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,100
He did say they put a wedding band over it.

1437
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:06,140
So they were married, and in a short time moved to Bingen, Ten Springs.

1438
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,520
There they lived for approximately 23 seconds before the insecticide.

1439
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:18,960
Actually, speaking of that particular problem, it's not just like one hole that needs to be plugged up anyway.

1440
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:24,180
The entire bottom there is porous, and it's under mud. It's under loose mud.

1441
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,960
It's hard to tell what the bottom is.

1442
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:29,600
It could be coming up in many different ways.

1443
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:36,400
And messing it, shaking it around may open it up more so that more oil rises up.

1444
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,380
I lost track of things. You're not talking about me, are you?

1445
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:48,460
Don't forget, you know, where the plate tectonics, where the plates are separating, there's actual magma coming out of the earth.

1446
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,040
Yeah.

1447
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,500
You've got to plug that stuff up, too.

1448
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,100
That's right.

1449
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,480
Because magma's not good for anybody.

1450
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,540
You've got to clean your plates.

1451
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,180
Everybody I know who's ever gotten magma on them has died from it.

1452
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:57,840
I know.

1453
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,380
It's highly poisonous.

1454
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,140
Forget all those stupid Hollywood movies.

1455
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,180
We're worrying about oil.

1456
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,440
Where they almost fall into the volcano.

1457
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,820
There's magma coming out.

1458
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,640
Oh, I almost got the lava that's right there on me.

1459
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,400
He'd be cooked. He'd be flash cooked before he could say that sentence.

1460
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,760
From rock that's heated to glowing heat, it's right there.

1461
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,480
It doesn't matter if you don't get any on you.

1462
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,940
Right. You can drink crude oil and live for a few hours, but if you drink magma, you're going to die almost instantly.

1463
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,540
The earth is just going to kill you anyway. Somehow or another, you're going to die.

1464
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:38,840
We live by sufferance on the thin skin around the dangerous, toxic, molten interior of the earth.

1465
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,920
Yeah, we're worrying about all this microscopic stuff.

1466
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,160
One might worry about it in some way.

1467
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,720
What about that asteroid that's supposed to hit here and like...

1468
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,180
That's loose pieces of the solar system that haven't been sorted out yet.

1469
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,140
That's the day after tomorrow, after we leave. See?

1470
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,820
There's an asteroid that's going to be hitting the earth.

1471
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,600
That's the large insulting sock from an asteroid.

1472
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,040
We'll be gone and we'll be looking back thinking, ah, we made it just in time.

1473
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:07,080
Boy, how ironic that the world ended when that asteroid was going to take care of it all anyway.

1474
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:16,620
I think the delay was for that reason, so that we could have more gleeful satisfaction of knowing that everything we were leaving behind...

1475
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,040
...is being destroyed by a giant asteroid.

1476
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,620
It's not as if there was only a fixed amount of glee to go around.

1477
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,700
Right, and you can engender so much more glee by imagining each and every catastrophe.

1478
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:34,020
Start and give them like numbers and then put little letters like A, how it expands, like there's the Gulf oil spill.

1479
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,380
There's the potential...

1480
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,240
Eleven zeros at the end of it.

1481
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,320
There's 2012, there's X-Day, and there's so many of them.

1482
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,400
Yeah, if you put enough numbers there, it becomes meaningless anyway.

1483
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,600
Well, there are many possible ways.

1484
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,480
There are multiple instant deaths that we could all suffer.

1485
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:53,100
For example, gamma ray bursts could occur.

1486
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,500
Gamma ray is very bad.

1487
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,020
That would be it for everyone.

1488
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,860
Don't forget, radon gas in your basement is just leaking out.

1489
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,740
You don't even know it.

1490
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,400
You're sleeping down there in front of the football game.

1491
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,820
Leaky basements doomed the dinosaurs.

1492
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,480
You're sniffing up radon gas.

1493
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,820
Your own self-inflicted flatulence?

1494
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,740
Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya. Lunch meat.

1495
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,400
Flatulence.

1496
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,220
Bad.

1497
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,540
Barbecue. Et cetera, et cetera.

1498
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,260
Barbecue.

1499
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:16,600


1500
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,260
Rashes, particularly around the butt.

1501
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,480
That's just wrong.

1502
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,540
Thank you for your program.

1503
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,140
Yucks.

1504
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,780
Your own self-inflicted flatulence?

1505
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,600
So many people are dying from their own self-inflicted flatulence.

1506
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,980
I heard about a guy who fell asleep inside his sleeping bag, and his farts killed him.

1507
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,840
He had...

1508
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,460
He suffered from...

1509
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,360
The lighter was leaking as well.

1510
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,740
All those garlic and jalapeno sandwiches...

1511
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,880
It's not the flatulence itself, it's that it displaces all the air.

1512
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,260
He died of fatal self-Dutch ovening?

1513
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,620
Yeah, Dutch ovening.

1514
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,880
It sounds more like a burrito, doesn't it?

1515
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,560
A double Dutch oven.

1516
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,480
Rolled up in the...

1517
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,640
The pig in the blanket.

1518
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,320
That's another reason you should not smoke in bed.

1519
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,920
You have a cigarette lit.

1520
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:57,800
I can't live without that.

1521
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,960
Well, Philo, you're just handing me your rules, man.

1522
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,120
I don't like all your rules.

1523
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,440
I don't want to smoke in bed if I want to.

1524
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,380
I want to smoke in bed, yeah.

1525
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,660
That's all smoke in bed.

1526
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,880
So, do you smoke before sex?

1527
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,080
Or during sex?

1528
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,160
Or after sex?

1529
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:08,940
I don't know.

1530
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,800
I never looked.

1531
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:10,480
Ah.

1532
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:12,980
Weep, weep.

1533
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,240
Oh, that's a good one.

1534
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:15,240


1535
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:15,240


1536
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,060
Drink up and tip your waitress.

1537
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,420
Our next show's at 2.

1538
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,760
Actually, Susie, our next show is next week.

1539
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:29,880
Of course, our last thousand shows are archived at subgenius.com, where you can learn everything

1540
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,260
about the Church of the Subgenius and our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1541
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,980
That's subgenius.com.

1542
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,700
Our award-winning books and old CDs and videos are all still in print.

1543
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,560
Can you believe it?

1544
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,220
You can also find links to lots of great shows.

1545
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,720
Lots of freebies of all kinds.

1546
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,620
That's subgenius.com.

1547
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,380
This has been the Hour of Slack.

1548
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,020
Praise Bob.
