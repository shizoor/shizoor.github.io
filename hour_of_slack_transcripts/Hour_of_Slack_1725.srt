1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:09,260
I do wish we could chat longer but I'm having an old friend for dinner.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,940
Getting vegetables every day?

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,040
You know I can't make that promise.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,000
The Self Genius Power of Swagging!

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,200
Shut that dog up!

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,280
I bid you welcome.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,280
What do you believe in, huh?

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,900
What do you believe in?

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,660
I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,380
a stranger.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,620
Give a man a free house and he'll bust out the windows, put his family on food stamps.

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,560
Now he's a big spender, no food on the table and the bills ain't paid cause he's spending on cigarettes and PGA.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,240
They'll turn us all into beggars cause they're easier to please.

14
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,140
They're feeding our people that government cheese.

15
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:35,120
Give a man free food and he'll figure out a way to steal more than he can eat cause he doesn't have to pay.

16
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,200
Give a woman free kids and you'll find them in the dirt.

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,180
Learning how to carry on the family line of work.

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,240
It's the man in the White House, the man under the steeple, passing out drugs to the American people.

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,380
I don't believe in anything.

20
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,180
Not a word.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,180
Nothing is free.

22
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,160
They're feeding our people that government cheese.

23
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,460
Government!

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,320
Cheese government.

25
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,240
Cheese government.

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,540
Get out!

27
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,860
Declined.

28
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:21,820
Ball.

29
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,820
Declined.

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,080
Ball.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,240
Ball down baby.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,240
Declined and ball.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,780
I said ball way down there.

34
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,340
Declined and ball.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,260
Come on ball down little mama.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,340
Declined and ball.

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,360
Oh decline and fall.

38
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,100
Give a man a free ticket on a dead end ride.

39
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,100
And you'll climb in the back even though

40
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,380
nobody's driving too goddamn lazy to crawl out of the wreck.

41
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,280
And he'll ride a while he waits up for the welfare check.

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,880
Gone to hell in a handbag.

43
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,280
Can't you see?

44
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,320
I ain't gonna eat no government cheese.

45
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,360
No government cheese.

46
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,320
No government cheese.

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,280
No government cheese.

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,460
No another government cheese.

49
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,380
No government cheese.

50
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,900
Can't you see?

51
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,340
Without government cheese no government cheese.

52
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,420


53
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,420


54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,620
No government cheese.

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,920
You'll have no government cheese anymore.

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,580
With government cheese.

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:30,580


58
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,460
With government cheese.

59
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:31,460


60
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,100
with government cheese.

61
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,060
With world commerce,

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:51,280
I keepbusiness.

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:59,040
season yours truly reverend ivan stang from 11x day punctuated by some new music from this year's

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:08,760
devotional cover album as you will soon see well we're still uh counting down to three o'clock but

65
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,060
we have much more to impart here with our live broadcast from beautiful brushwood new york

66
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,840
on the day before x day rest assured your money is safe

67
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:42,060
and i thought my jokes were bad so so friends don't be a well we want you to be a bobby when

68
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,500
it's time to be a bobby when you first get into bob

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,960
and

70
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,040
and

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,040


72
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:56,500
A bright apple-cheeked little lad, a beaming Bobby, first springing up and rushing about to tell everyone the news of Bob.

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,620
But the old, creaky, tired, and sagging subgeniuses have heard it all.

74
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:11,840
And they are apt to be a mite grumpy when interrupted from their lawful pursuits with this early, due-fresh Bobby stuff.

75
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,180
But then there's the next phase where you really decide that it's stupid.

76
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,740
And you've outgrown it.

77
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,500
And I don't know why I sent those people so much money.

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
And they're rude to me.

79
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:33,380
I posted my hilarious comedy thing on alt.slack and the only ones that even responded made fun of me.

80
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,440
How dare they?

81
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,760
Mockers.

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,280
How dare they?

83
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,600
So there's always that phase.

84
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,000
And that one also.

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,600
Always.

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,620
They always come back.

87
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,480
Invariably.

88
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,580
I've seen them drift so, so far away.

89
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,500
There was a subgenius who, he became a Christian missionary and went to work for Ted Turner.

90
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,640
And yet he returned to the fold in the end.

91
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,260
He knew where the real slack was.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,120
So we don't worry.

93
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,940
We're not insecure.

94
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,440
Bob's not an insecure God like so many others that demand lip service.

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,820
Bob says, go ahead and kill me.

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,440
Throw my picture down on the ground and pee on it if that's what it takes to free you from my mind control.

97
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,580
Because he doesn't care about your mind.

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
He doesn't care about your soul.

99
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,540
He cares about the same thing that you most care about.

100
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,900
Your checkbook.

101
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,380
That's right.

102
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,300
Your bank account.

103
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,100
What's in your purse.

104
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,340
Because that's what's real, friends.

105
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,820
All this frippery and foo for all about heaven and hell.

106
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:41,820


107
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:41,820


108
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:41,820


109
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,700
And so forth.

110
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,520
It doesn't matter if you ain't got the scratch.

111
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,940
For old scratch.

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,560
And now that the dollar is devalued, does Dobbs have a preference?

113
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,440
Does he say he prefers Euros or the Japanese Yen?

114
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:56,680
No.

115
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,360
As the great preacher, Reverend Carter LeBlanc pointed out last time,

116
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,000
so what if the dollar has lost some value compared to those other countries' money?

117
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,800
That's just, we did that so we can sell that.

118
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,860
We can sell them more shit.

119
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,540
Ah.

120
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,500
If the dollar gets weak next to the damn Euro,

121
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,900
that just means they're going to be buying more crap from us.

122
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,120
I was concerned because I...

123
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,260
It's a circle of life.

124
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,120
It's like when a cat has its little kittens and then devours two of them.

125
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,680
The great chain of being.

126
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,160
I was really worried, Stang, because I saw you had gotten involved in Water Bear Futures

127
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,100
and I thought maybe you were a prize of some secret investment plan.

128
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:40,900
Oh sure.

129
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,940
But I'm not worried about it.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,060
That stuff goes up and down, up and down.

131
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,560
How are the water bears doing?

132
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,920
Great.

133
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,100
Oh good, good.

134
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,260
There's always going to be a need for water bears because they're a part of nature.

135
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,840
You know, the most important creatures on this planet are really the worms.

136
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,800
Yeah.

137
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:05,100
They keep, as far as living animals go, without them the grass would not grow.

138
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,800
True.

139
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,860
As it was finally figured out by the scientists of alt-slot,

140
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,220
dirt is mostly shit and shit is mostly corpses.

141
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,420
Well that's the difference.

142
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,860
When you realize that, it kind of takes you down a notch just a bit.

143
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,620
And plants.

144
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,640
And at the same time it does bring up the truth of the circle of life.

145
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,740
As you die and go to the ground and become worm food, then you somehow, another person arises

146
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,780
and gives their money to Bob.

147
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,900
Bob will always have customers.

148
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,920
If every life form on the surface of the earth was wiped out, there still remain those heat

149
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,780
vent worms at the bottom of the deepest trenches that live off of no oxygen at all but just

150
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,960
heat and sulfuric fumes.

151
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,200
More than that, there's the underground life.

152
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,380
Eventually, their descendants will be building cities, polluting the air, wiping out all

153
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,760
other creatures and causing great extinctions and buying something.

154
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,500
And then there's the subgenius memberships.

155
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,040
Because that can never end.

156
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,000
That is the part of the cycle that cannot end.

157
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:25,860
Life could end almost, but only in so much as there was still enough to buy salvation

158
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,240
from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

159
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:37,640
The biomass of the subsurface life exceeds in weight, could it be weighed, the biomass

160
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,740
of all life on the surface.

161
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,100
Including oceanic life.

162
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,580
That's right.

163
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,520
Those worms and microbes outweigh everything bigger than them.

164
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,440
Because there's so much more of them.

165
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,760
That's a lot more souls to save.

166
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:28,540
I wonder what happens if I fill this suis that has no space.

167
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:28,540


168
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:28,780
True.

169
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:37,760
Who does the ca-

170
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:39,740


171
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,900
I know you really got a problem.

172
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,900
A nasty kind of reflection.

173
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,340
A dangerous sort of destruction.

174
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,380
It makes it difficult.

175
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,460
Makes it hard to reach.

176
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,040
Takes it all away from what you had in mind.

177
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,260
Here's to you.

180
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,000
I know you really got a problem.

181
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,020
A nervous kind of distraction.

182
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,580
A mild sort of reaction.

183
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,940
A nasty sort of contraction.

184
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,400
You never get no satisfaction.

185
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,540
Yeah.

186
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:37,840
Yeah.

187
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,540
There's a big black hole that you seem to be missing.

188
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,680
And it's driving you to destruction.

189
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,380
But it doesn't seem to stop you in the least.

190
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,760
A heartless obsession that you're rolling on back.

191
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,400
Week after week.

192
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,280
Week after week.

193
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,780
Day after day.

194
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,740
Day after day.

195
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,400
Hour after hour.

196
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,680
Hour after hour.

197
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,840
From where you came.

198
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,560
From all of the same.

199
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,220
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,400
From so long ago.

201
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,420
One oven came.

202
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:17,420


203
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,580
One day, losing sight of the hell.

204
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,800
Yay, yeah.

205
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:23,800


206
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,060
It's been two weeks.

207
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,060


208
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,120
I've already lost my piff.

209
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,420
Shit's being great, man.

210
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,420


211
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,420


212
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,420


213
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,420


214
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,340
Occupant did that doing truth.

215
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,720
You've got a problem from the latest

216
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,640
not necessarily beautiful, but mutated out of them,

217
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,120
estado palabras de reverendo

218
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,900
callus wilders,

219
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:37,520


220
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:45,060
occupant has been with the church and Devo for over 20 years, I guess,

221
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,640
as has the great writer Robert Anton Wilson.

222
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,920
Heard here in this interview from right where you are sitting now,

223
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,960
a CD from maybelogic.com.

224
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,140
What do you perceive as the greatest threat to our freedom?

225
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,480
The stupidity of the population.

226
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,260
As Schiller said, against stupidity the gods themselves contend in vain.

227
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,820
Do you feel that the American population is more stupid in some way than any other population?

228
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,600
Well, in lots of ways.

229
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:33,620
In Europe, the owners, the capitalists, the entrepreneurs, the managers,

230
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,120
they all believe...

231
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,980
They believe the more intelligent the workers, the better their work will be.

232
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,820
So they believe in giving good educations even to the working class.

233
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,340
In this country, the capitalists seem to believe the stupider the population is,

234
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,880
the easier it is to manipulate them.

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,820
So why waste time by trying to educate them?

236
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,600
And there's been a deliberate dumbing down since the 60s.

237
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,340
Every decade I see more college graduates who don't seem to know...

238
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,220
They not only don't know anything, they don't even suspect anything.

239
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,000
Fortunately, Internet is working in the opposite direction.

240
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,120
I wanted to ask you about that.

241
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,140
You know, many people claim that technology is going to, you know,

242
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,860
especially the Internet and computers are going to be used to enslave us in some horrible way.

243
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,120
And you hear an equal number of people arguing just the opposite,

244
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,960
that it's bringing about all these new types of freedom or new vistas of freedom.

245
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
How do you feel about that?

246
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,480
Well, to take it by a curious path, when I was working on my historical novels,

247
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,120
my wife used to say, you know, I'm going to be a writer.

248
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,180
And she used to collect old encyclopedias.

249
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,140
Every time she was in a bookstore that had a set of old encyclopedias, she'd buy it.

250
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,240
So we had about eight different sets of encyclopedias in the house.

251
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,180
So every time I wanted to look up a historical detail,

252
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,880
I'd look it up in three or four of the encyclopedias.

253
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,160
And always it took, it didn't take as much as three.

254
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,660
Usually only two I'd find a disagreement.

255
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,120
If I went through all eight encyclopedias, I'd find eight different...

256
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,420
Like when did, how old was Mozart when he wrote his first symphony?

257
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,100
He was either seven or eight, depending on the age.

258
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,780
Depending on which encyclopedia you look in.

259
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,100
How tall was the Bastille?

260
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,500
90 feet, 100 feet, or 120 feet, according to three encyclopedias I consulted.

261
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,280
This is what provoked me to what I call Wilson's 22nd Law.

262
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,000
Certitude belongs exclusively to those who only own one encyclopedia.

263
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,120
If you own more than one, you begin to encounter a certain amount of doubt

264
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,080
and uncertainty about things in general.

265
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,020
More and more people are doing research on Internet.

266
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,100
I wrote an article a few months ago.

267
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,780
In which I didn't open a single book.

268
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,900
All the research I had to do I did on the web, on the world.

269
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,860
Everything I wanted was on the world wide web.

270
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,720
That certainly wasn't true ten years ago when I first got online.

271
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,020
I did a whole article without once leaving the computer.

272
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,760
Everything I wanted to look up I just go to the world wide web and I could find it pretty fast.

273
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,820
So more and more people are doing research on the web.

274
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,140
And the one thing you find out when you do research on the web is what?

275
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,280
You find out if you own eight encyclopedias.

276
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,420
Which is, there's no one reliable source.

277
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,700
There are a dozen different sources.

278
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,060
All claiming to be reliable.

279
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,260
And then you've got to use your own ingenious mind and your own talent for analysis and skepticism.

280
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,160
Which one of these guys really sounds like he might know what he's talking about?

281
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,160
Which one should I bet on?

282
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,600
Whose source is every act of perception should be regarded as a gamble?

283
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,840
And from the experiments I've done and the experiments I've led in my workshops and seminars,

284
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,980
that has become overwhelmingly obvious and true to me.

285
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,680
Every perception is a gamble.

286
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,600
Just think you're walking down the street in a big city.

287
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,540
You see a face half a block away.

288
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,300
You think it's a friend of yours.

289
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,020
You get a little closer, it's a total stranger.

290
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,960
All perception operates on gambles.

291
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,100
You pick up a few details, you fill in the rest.

292
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,780
And if the guy never comes any closer, you're not sure that you saw an old friend or somebody who just looked a little bit like an old friend.

293
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,760
How does that relate directly to our political freedom though?

294
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,680
The main trouble with Marxist parties is they think,

295
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,580
we think that Das Kapital has all the answers in it.

296
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:14,780
The major problem with the United States is that about 50% of the population at least thinks the Bible has all the answers in it.

297
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,040
And then there are libertarians who think Ludwig von Mises has all the answers.

298
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,420
Except for the ones who think Ayn Rand has all the answers.

299
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:30,400
If you think there's one book that has the answers, you're never going to really discover anything and you're never going to think an original thought.

300
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,700
If you find out there's 12 books with different answers,

301
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,900
you're almost forced to start thinking.

302
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,480
So I feel the Internet is forcing more and more people to do something they've never done in their lives before,

303
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,740
which is try to make an independent judgment, how to judge between alternatives.

304
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,600
The Rainmaker came to town

305
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,040
And the people got what they wanted

306
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,200
The Rainmaker came to town

307
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,520
And everybody got what they need

308
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,840
Hey, hey, hey!

309
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,340
Well, the people wanted power

310
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,440
And reputation galore

311
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,960
So they became a bunch of bullies

312
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,680
In the assorted world

313
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,100
And they sailed around the global block

314
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,400
Looking for some heads to knock

315
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,220
And most of them came home heroes

316
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,160
Heroes in a box

317
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,080
And the Rainmaker came to town

318
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,420
And the people got what they wanted

319
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,680
The Rainmaker came to town

320
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,880
And everybody got what they need

321
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,680
The Rainmaker came to town

322
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:03,680


323
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:03,940
And everybody got what they needed

324
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,060
The Rainmaker came to town

325
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,540
While the waves were 강ing

326
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:07,540


327
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:07,540


328
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:07,560
And they got what they wanted

329
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:07,560


330
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:07,560


331
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,640
Cats and dogs and buckets

332
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,560
And the Rainmaker sailed away

333
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,420
On the flood of relief

334
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,480
Hey, hey, hey!

335
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,840
Well, the people wanted beauty

336
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,100
Beauty and prettiness and all

337
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,640
So they stretched and they dressed and they made up

338
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,540
And put mirrors on every wall

339
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,280
Till they all went blind from ice cream

340
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,160
From the thing they wanted most

341
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,360
Now everybody's so isolated

342
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,960
A good-looking bunch of ghosts

343
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,760
And the rainmaker came to town

344
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,180
And the people got what they wanted

345
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,360
The rainmaker came to town

346
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,500
And everybody got what they need

347
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,000
The rain came falling down

348
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,380
Cats and dogs and buckets

349
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,240
And the rainmaker sailed away

350
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,160
On a flood of relief

351
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,160
Hey, hey, hey

352
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,640
Well, the women just wanted their food too

353
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,320
Cheap instant potatoes and rubber meat

354
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,300
The kids just wanted to watch TV

355
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,160
Now the girls can't spell and the boys can't read

356
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,140
The men just wanted a steady job

357
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,700
Now they got to pay the union mob

358
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,800
And everybody wanted to be free

359
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,280
Laws and rules should keep it that way

360
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,420
Hey, hey, hey

361
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,800
Hey, hey, hey

362
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,880
Well, everybody wants to be happy

363
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,120
Everybody wants to be warm

364
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,900
And be loved and liked and wanted

365
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,920
And have some kind of home

366
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,380
But getting it is work

367
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,560
And keeping it is tough

368
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,560
But destroying it's the easy bit

369
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,160
We all got the magic touch

370
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,620
And the rainmaker came to town

371
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:20,620


372
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:20,620


373
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:20,620


374
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,080
And the rainmaker came to town

375
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,440
And the people got what they wanted

376
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,620
The rainmaker came to town

377
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,760
And everybody got what they need

378
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,300
The rain came falling down

379
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,600
Cats and dogs and buckets

380
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,620
And the rainmaker sailed away

381
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,420
On a flood of relief

382
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,700
A flood of relief

383
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,620
Now sail away at your ghostly pace

384
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:50,620


385
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:50,620


386
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:50,620


387
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:50,620


388
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:50,620


389
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:50,620


390
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,260
Sail away, sail away

391
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:01,960
And the Rainmaker came to town

392
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,680
The Rainmakers, from their first album with Bob Walkenhorst on singing and guitar,

393
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,440
kind of timely for election time in the USA,

394
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,200
there is a rainmakers.com.

395
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,240
But now, back to the subgenius church X Day stage for July 4th, 2008,

396
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,640
with Dr. Hal Robbins and music by yours truly.

397
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,360
Why would you do that to me, Bob?

398
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:47,600
Absolutely, whichever one tithed the most.

399
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,340
And then?

400
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,880
Then there are those 11 herbs and spices, too.

401
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,380
It's the old, old story of which one means the most to Bob.

402
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,540
The little old lady who only had a quarter left her dame,

403
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
but yet she put it in the collection plate.

404
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,480
Or the Mr. Moneybags, who could easily spend a million dollars and never miss it.

405
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,040
And he only gives Bob 10,000.

406
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,340
I think we know who Bob loves the most.

407
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,880
The one who makes good eatin'.

408
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,100
The fuck that little old bitch.

409
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,680
Yeah.

410
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Not that dried up old thing, but the fleshy capitalist is a far better subject for the grill.

411
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,580
He takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it.

412
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,940
He turns to me and he says, why so serious?

413
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,300
He comes at me with the knife.

414
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,920
Why so serious?

415
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,960
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

416
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,660
I'm not gonna lie.

417
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:47,660


418
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,140
Let's put a smile on that face.

419
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,980
And why so serious?

420
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,720
Listen to them.

421
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,020
Children of the night.

422
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,060
What music they make.

423
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:24,020
And now, United Front Ministries presents Dial a Story with Aunt Bertha.

424
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,400
This week's episode, Billy and Timmy Go to Hell.

425
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,820
Good evening, boys and girls.

426
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,600
Once upon a time.

427
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,940
In fact, it was last Sunday evening.

428
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,920
Gee, Billy, I don't think we should have taken that LSD.

429
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,480
Don't sweat it, men.

430
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,020
It'll be cool.

431
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,380
I'm scared.

432
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,660
Don't be scared. You'll have to get it.

433
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,260
I have a bad trip.

434
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,380
Bad trip?

435
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,060
You didn't say anything about a bad trip.

436
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,240
Just don't think about it.

437
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,240
Oh, what if Aunt Bertha catches us?

438
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,000
I don't think that Jesus would...

439
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,640
Oh, forget about that old Jesus.

440
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,500
What's happening, Billy?

441
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,380
Oh, boy, I can taste colors.

442
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,780
Oh.

443
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,480
Look at the trail.

444
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,420
I'm scared.

445
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,400
I think we should go.

446
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,020
I'm scared.

447
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,080
Billy, where are we?

448
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,620
I don't know, Timmy.

449
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,900
It looks like a big cave.

450
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,240
And it smells like charcoal.

451
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,160
I can't see through all the smoke.

452
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,640
We're in hell.

453
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,980
I know we're in hell.

454
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,280
We're gonna be thrown into the lake of fire and beaten up by scorpions and bugs.

455
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,160
And earwigs and horrible leaves and chickens.

456
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,900
And hell, I know it.

457
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,320
I don't know, Timmy.

458
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,460
I think it's just one of them hell hallucinations.

459
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,000
It sure is real, though.

460
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,580
Oh, look.

461
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,960
Billy, it's Satan.

462
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,780
I'll bake your bones to make my bread.

463
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
Run, Billy, run.

464
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,260
And so Billy and Timmy ran to and fro throughout the whole lake.

465
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,500
They went on a long, horrid netherworld pursued by the Horned One.

466
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,080
To Long Sugar!

467
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,680
Hey, wait, wait.

468
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,520
I don't want to be cast into the pit of foppers and spiders and horrible leeches and-

469
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,440
I have you now, Timmy.

470
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,400
I'm going to torture you for a thousand years, and then I'm going to throw you into the burning

471
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
pit of fiery scorpions.

472
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:46,240
But, but, I have tried to study the Bible for many hours.

473
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,820
I... oh, don't torture me!

474
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,220
Ow! Ow!

475
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,640
You should have thought of that before you decided to disobey Jesus.

476
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,600
Aunt Bertha!

477
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,040
That's right, Timmy. It was I, Aunt Bertha, who prayed and prayed for you to be delivered from that horrible drug.

478
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,180
We're sorry, Aunt Bertha.

479
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
We thought Satan was after us.

480
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,440
But it was only you.

481
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,420
And Jesus.

482
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,620
We'll never take psychedelic drugs again.

483
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,700
See that you don't.

484
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Yeah, I'm having a flashback.

485
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,400
Me too.

486
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:39,420
And so, Billy and Timmy prayed and cleansed their bodies with holy water and studied the Bible until the wee hours, until they slept the sleep of the angels.

487
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,320
I hope you liked this story, boys and girls.

488
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,400
If you would like to make a donation,

489
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:50,500
to the Aunt Bertha KFJC Radio Ministries,

490
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,260
get on your phone right now and call

491
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:58,420
650-941-6800.

492
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,620
That's 650-941-6800.

493
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,840
Call with your pledge now.

494
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,720
Operators are standing by.

495
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,280
That number again is

496
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,400
650-941-6800.

497
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,160
941-6800.

498
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,180
Goodbye now.

499
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,320
Goodbye.

500
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,380
And shoot us out great branches.

501
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:37,560
Aunt Bertha, Dr. Hal and Phineas Narco from NationalCynical.com.

502
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,440
And now back to the X Day Live.

503
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,100
One starred night Prince Lucifer arose,

504
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,220
Tired of his dark dominions,

505
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,360
Swung the fiend above the rolling ball,

506
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,380
In cloud parts screened,

507
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,560
Where sinners hugged their specter of repose.

508
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,440
Poor prey for his hot fit of pride were those,

509
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,600
And now upon his western wing he leans,

510
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,740
Now his huge bulk o'er Afric's sands careens,

511
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:19,900
Now the black planet shadowed Arctic snows.

512
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,240
Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars,

513
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,680
With memory of the old revolt from awe,

514
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,980
He rose to middle height,

515
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,100
And at the stars, which are the brain of heaven,

516
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,340
He paused and sank.

517
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,240
Around the ancient track marched,

518
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,960
Rank on rank,

519
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,620
The armies of unalterable law.

520
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,360
Flies? Flies? Poor puny things.

521
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,540
Who wants to eat flies?

522
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,180
You do, ya loony.

523
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,680
Not when I can get nice fat spiders.

524
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,440
Here is a question, Dr. Hal.

525
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,940
It was written, scratched into the paper with the fellow's keys,

526
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,040
And the question is this.

527
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,060
Where are the pens?

528
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,740
Proving once again that this is not a fake subgenius show.

529
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,300
This is the real thing.

530
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,240
When we hand out stuff for you to write on.

531
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,920
There are markers all along right over there.

532
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,900
The question is which pens do you mean?

533
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,240
The Sharpie pens or the pens to write these answers with?

534
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,240
You might have to share.

535
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,960
It's a question of faith.

536
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,340
You might have to share among one another.

537
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,300
If your neighbor has a pen,

538
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,540
You must borrow it from your neighbor.

539
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,960
That's simply the way it is.

540
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,320
The pens that people draw with, Princess Wee says,

541
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,400
Are pens that people could also write with.

542
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,520
It's a concept. Multitasking, we call it.

543
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,280
You may have noticed that we leave poster board and pens and things laying around.

544
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,100
We try to encourage you subgeniuses to,

545
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,460
Spew it on out, man.

546
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,680
We want to try to encourage your artistic essence.

547
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,700
We want it to germinate and grow.

548
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,620
Well, I see you've accumulated some questions.

549
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,720
So now we're going to begin the Ask Dr. Hal thing.

550
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,600
And probably conclude it very quickly.

551
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,340
But let's have those questions and see if they can help us along our sinusoidal subgenius path.

552
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,880
That farting Bob.

553
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,320
Is still irritating my idea of good audio.

554
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,620
Oh, well, I'll move it farther away.

555
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,200
Hold on. Here, you can answer. Here's our first question.

556
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,820
Could Bob's pipe be considered a yoni slash lingam?

557
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,940
That's a very good question.

558
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:05,840
Could Bob's pipe be considered a yoni slash lingam?

559
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,880
Well, it is unlikely to be both.

560
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,920
But with Bob, all things are possible.

561
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:21,600
So aggressively used, Bob's pipe is then the lingam.

562
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Passively used, Bob's pipe is the yoni.

563
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:35,780
However, one must make sure that it is not glowing to red heat when given this secondary application.

564
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,880
All right. I'm glad to know that.

565
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,940
Because I had really stayed awake at night wondering.

566
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,660
This question, what is the key, the musical key, of Bob's sails pitch?

567
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,700
Ah, that's very interesting.

568
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,360
Well, you know, Bob does have a mellifluous voice.

569
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,660
Which assists him at being the saint of sails.

570
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,620
The most average pitch is, of course, middle C on the piano.

571
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,740
And this is Bob's standard tone as we interpret it.

572
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:28,040
But on those special occasions, he can soar into a lilting soprano or sink down below a soothing baritone into a rumbling and authoritative bass.

573
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,540
Here's one you'll like, Dr. Howell.

574
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,260
Okay.

575
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,600
Since dinosauria shares some traits of reptiles and dinosaurs,

576
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,960
I ask, right before you get devoured by the hungry T-Rex,

577
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,100
do you have to face his mighty throbbing hemi-penis?

578
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,040
That would be a confused dinosaur, I think.

579
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,180
Dinosaurs know the difference between food and a sexual object.

580
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,620
Unlike some subgeniuses I might name.

581
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,260
Subgeniuses have larger brains and larger and more developed plays.

582
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,220
They have a more

583
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:16,260
we should celebrate our differences, even where we differ from the noble dinosauria.

584
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:26,480
But if you did have to face the throbbing hemi-penis of a rampant Tyrannosaurus Rex,

585
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:33,000
it would only be a brief moment before the merging of alimentation.

586
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,180
The

587
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:50,360
T-Rex

588
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,960
is a

589
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,120
superhuman

590
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,440
dinosaur.

591
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,780
It's a

592
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,580
superhuman

593
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,560
dinosaur.

594
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,020
It's a

595
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,320
superhuman

596
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,800
dinosaur.

597
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,140
It's a

598
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
superhuman

599
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,360


600
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,780
It's a superhuman

601
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:06,780


602
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,140
A dish.

603
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,500
It's

604
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,440
It's awij Duin.

605
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,660
T워 call

606
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,040
T Nasıl

607
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,040


608
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,120
A

609
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,120


610
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,480
and gets in deep with the sharks.

611
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,060
Hey.

612
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,200
One day they carve her face.

613
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,980
We have no money for surgeries.

614
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,700
She can't take it.

615
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,800
I just want to see her smile again.

616
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:48,980
Huh?

617
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,460
I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.

618
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:53,740
So,

619
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,080
I stick a razor in my mouth

620
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,160
and do this

621
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,340
to myself.

622
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,200
And you know what?

623
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,340
She can't stand the sight of me.

624
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,540
She leaves.

625
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,420
Now I see the funny side.

626
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,680
Now I'm always smiling.

627
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,200
Here's another one.

628
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,500
This is one I'm sure many of you have wondered.

629
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,580
Who would win in a fight?

630
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,200
Bob or Shatner?

631
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,200
Boy, you know, this is so much like the actual questions.

632
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,180
Questions.

633
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,780
I get that.

634
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,960
Who would win in a fight?

635
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,260
Popeye or Superman?

636
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,240
You know, that sort of thing.

637
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,500
In this case, who would win in a fight?

638
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,720
Bob or Shatner?

639
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,800
Bob and Shatner could go at it.

640
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,760
And Bob might be down,

641
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,400
but he would ultimately get up.

642
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,680
But Shatner would just be ultimately exhausted.

643
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,160
Shatner is only mortal.

644
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,540
And doesn't really give 100% these days.

645
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,840
The way he used to.

646
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,640
I know you all know the way he used to.

647
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,180
But,

648
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,620
you know, he's only frail, mortal flesh.

649
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,760
And besides, he's got everything he wants.

650
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,320
But if you want to see a real Shatfest,

651
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,900
you've got to go to watch The Intruder,

652
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,600
that Roger Corman movie.

653
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,220
The only good movie that Roger Corman ever made,

654
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,380
the only one that ever lost money,

655
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,060
features William Shatner

656
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,780
as an evil, racist agitator

657
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,480
who comes into a small southern town

658
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,080
and works them up into lynching,

659
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,340
and other atrocities.

660
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,500
And to film this,

661
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,380
they went to an actual southern town

662
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,500
full of racists,

663
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,080
and got them all riled up.

664
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,440
It's a terrifying and wonderful film,

665
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
and in the middle of it,

666
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,980
you see Shatner

667
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,480
acting his scary heart out.

668
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,800
Now that young Shatner

669
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,700
might give Bob more time

670
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,100
on the field of battle.

671
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,820
But I think the fact that we're all here

672
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,580
shows that we all know

673
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,700
Bob will ultimately prevail.

674
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,980
Right, they had the fight, Bob won.

675
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:13,300
Now this one I've even heard asked at X Day before.

676
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,980
It's a very common one.

677
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,540
All right.

678
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,340
Is there anything that Dobbs cannot sell?

679
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,960
Hmm, anything that Dobbs cannot sell.

680
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,380
Is there anything that Dobbs cannot sell?

681
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,620
I don't think there's anything that Dobbs

682
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,840
cannot sell,

683
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
but there are things that he

684
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,960
characteristically does not sell.

685
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,240
You know, there is only a certain amount of inventory,

686
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,460
and until one is blessed with infinite time,

687
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,800
one doesn't get to go through all the stock,

688
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,760
particularly the out-of-sale items in the back room,

689
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,300
the shop-worn items.

690
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,420
These you can sell,

691
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,680
but why bother when you can entice them in,

692
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:01,680


693
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,320
and when you can't?

694
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,620
So, I'm going to go ahead and read the first part.

695
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:04,680
The first part is,

696
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:04,720


697
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:04,720


698
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,840
Bob's special talents of salesmanship

699
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,200
have always made his meat and drink, so to speak.

700
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,960
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs,

701
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,240
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs,

702
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,640
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs,

703
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,220
this will be disturbing.

704
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,800
I have a statement.

705
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,400
I am bisexual, a cross-dresser, a homosexual, in action.

706
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,580
Bath houses, massage parlors, mortuaries.

707
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,140
The sexual confusion that...

708
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,220
Hold still for this. Admit it!

709
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,580
In a restroom, a transgender movement...

710
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,220
...can go into the girls' restrooms?

711
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,520
Is that what that means?

712
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,760
Well, it has to be.

713
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,580
Somewhere, spreading, leaking.

714
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,560
I am with that.

715
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,720
Stand up next to the movement!

716
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,840
Go stand up next to the mountain and jump it down.

717
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,700
I'm up above and down.

718
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,980
I stand up next to the mountain and jump it down.

719
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,880
Gonna jump it down with my hands.

720
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

721
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,480
Hello. Welcome to eternal sodomy.

722
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,960
Clean, sexual, strange flesh.

723
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,480
Lust for one another.

724
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,060
Sodomy is sexual passions.

725
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,860
Men with men.

726
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,240
Women with women.

727
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,480
Sexual burning.

728
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,980
And lust for one another.

729
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,800
Sexual sodomy.

730
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,820
Practicing homosexuals.

731
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,600
Of homosexual sodomite lesbian practices.

732
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,900
Did you notice?

733
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,160
Homosexuals will inherit the kingdom of dog women.

734
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,880
People can come out if you want to.

735
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,960
As is the well-eaves of the...

736
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,440
Well-eaves.

737
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,300
Nass-o-dash-tet.

738
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,780
Gar-ro-gar-ro-gar-ro-dash-tet.

739
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,340
Collages by Norrell Treff.

740
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,160
When not by Fernanda Nandi-Lemur.

741
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,360
The booty-chop cut up there was by earth, wind, and fire.

742
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,220
But now we go to the 11X Day drill and ask Dr. Howell.

743
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,420
Dr. Howell, this is a two-part question,

744
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,760
or two questions from Reverend Xanatos.

745
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,880
I can stand the push of your two questions.

746
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,080
Question number one.

747
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,260
Why is the sky?

748
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,300
Hmm.

749
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,800
Well, that's a good one.

750
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,220
Yes?

751
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,220
Why is the sky?

752
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,420
Why do we have to have a sky?

753
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,400
Why is there a sky instead of no sky?

754
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,520
Why do we not have the icy embrace of outer space?

755
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,280
Instead of this atmosphere with its confusing clouds and winds

756
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,040
and meteorology?

757
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,120
Well, it's all linked together.

758
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:57,940
We have a moon.

759
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
The moon makes tides.

760
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,700
The tides...

761
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:01,660
The tides...

762
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:01,660


763
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,940
The tides cause the waters of the earth to move.

764
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,300
Our moon is exceptionally large.

765
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,180
Without our disproportionately large moon,

766
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,780
we might have a static system.

767
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,680
The elements of the atmosphere might congeal or escape off

768
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,840
into space.

769
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,780
We have a sky, but that sky, as permanent as it seems,

770
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,100
is like everything else, a transient phenomena.

771
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,620
They say there's no such thing

772
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,660
as permanent phenomena.

773
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,380
There's no such thing as perpetual motion.

774
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,640
And there isn't.

775
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,520
But you can push the envelope until, for our purposes,

776
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,040
it's almost the same thing.

777
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,920
The sun eternally falling toward the earth in that regard

778
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,360
is a perpetual motion machine.

779
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,100
Of course, it's getting energy from outside itself.

780
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,860
Without the sky, there would be no protection

781
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,260
from the deadly cosmic rays, which are sleeting

782
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,360
through everything, and our soil would simply be lifeless,

783
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:07,200
like the moon and large parts of the so-called planet Mars.

784
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:13,220
But you know, folks, it is the organic which creates soil.

785
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,680
It is the presence of shit and death which makes the soil

786
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,460
as fecund as it is.

787
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,380
And you can start growing in regolith if you have the elements

788
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,200
of it, because when you do so, you're changing regolith,

789
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,000
which is a very big force for the earth to move and fall

790
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,440
into the soil.

791
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,060
There will come a time when our sky is not what it is now.

792
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Unfortunately, this time is coming very rapidly.

793
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,240
The entire earth is going to be closed down.

794
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,680
I don't think anyone is going to get out of it.

795
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,040
It's not just x-day, too.

796
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,740
If x-day doesn't happen, the world will end anyway.

797
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:03,420
Anyway, the oceans are going and when the oceans go we don't have the phytoplankton

798
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:09,580
and our sky or what we have left of it will be quite different.

799
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:16,520
You know the oceans are being carbonated as if the oceans were a large soft drink because

800
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,840
of the carbon emissions that are being pumped into the atmosphere these days.

801
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:30,240
And this means that calcareous creatures with shells will not be able to form those shells.

802
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,960
Not just coral reefs.

803
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:38,220
All that's going to be living in the oceans in a very short time is bacteria and jellyfish.

804
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:45,220
And if you think this won't affect Earth's blanket of atmosphere, you've got another thing coming.

805
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:51,780
Well, there's another part of this question which is why does the conspiracy value

806
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,100
cleanliness so much?

807
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,540
Well, it was John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist faith, who said cleanliness is next to godliness.

808
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:09,080
And sure enough it is true because God being ex-organic does not need to be scrubbed or cleaned.

809
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:17,960
But on the other hand, as I have pointed out, cleanliness is next to the lunar rock, to lifelessness,

810
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,940
to the immortal monument.

811
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,780
And so, cleanliness is the last of the questions that I've been given.

812
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:34,160
Is there a way for us to consciously alter the luck plane?

813
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,460
I believe it's alter, affect, I'm sorry, affect the luck plane.

814
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,700
Yes.

815
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,780
That's my answer, yes.

816
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,960
There is a way to alter the luck plane.

817
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,520
First of all,

818
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,440
it's a feeling.

819
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,440
It's an instinctive feeling.

820
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:04,860
Like if you're surfing the luck plane, you have to be somewhat cognizant of the sinusoidal nature of luck itself.

821
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,560
These things do not travel in straight lines but in waves.

822
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:15,360
For example, whenever I see a penny, I always bend over and pick it up.

823
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:21,180
You may be familiar with these studies by time and energy efficient yuppies

824
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:27,280
who figure their time is so valuable that it is a waste of their time to bend over and pick up a penny.

825
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,340
So they let it lie.

826
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,640
Well, what about a nickel?

827
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,040
What about a half dollar?

828
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:40,700
I find that if you avoid these pennies, you might be avoiding the fractal tail of a large sum of money

829
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:47,360
which will come your way if you only grasp the end of it and firmly pull it towards you.

830
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,480
If you don't believe you're going to have luck, in other words,

831
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,480
your luck will, or lack of it, will substantiate this belief.

832
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:02,040
Every time I find a nickel, pretty soon I make pretty good financial score.

833
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:08,540
And on those few occasions when I've found $20 bills, and there are such occasions,

834
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,180
I have not avoided picking them up.

835
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:17,520
And lo, soon after that I've gotten good jobs, large checks,

836
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,460
and have been able to devote myself to personal success.

837
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:20,460


838
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,100
I'm not a professional slack.

839
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:34,980
Dr. Hell, a subgenius just brought me a question with what looks to me to be a tawdry bribe.

840
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,740
What are you saying?

841
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,680
Let me show you.

842
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,720
Oh, this is no bribe.

843
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,200
This is simply some money for me and a perfect illustration of what I was saying.

844
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,160
And here it is, the question.

845
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,460
My son, who is now a bachelor,

846
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,000
now 20,

847
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:55,320
is still afraid to come to X Day.

848
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,540
But his 15-year-old sister,

849
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,180
what's to be here?

850
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,080
What?

851
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,280
What's to be here?

852
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,580
It must mean wants.

853
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,660
Yes, it's written wants.

854
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,740
What do I do?

855
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,380
Well, what you do is you satisfy the spirit of the yearning proto-subgenius,

856
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:23,840
and let that child who wishes to come to X Day come to X Day.

857
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,780
Because who knows when it will be too late to come to X Day.

858
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,180
Too late to board the vessel.

859
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,760
Too late for everything.

860
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:40,800
And then in those last minutes before you frizzle and fry in the Holocaust at the end of time,

861
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,580
there will be the added torment of reproaching yourself

862
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,300
for not acting when you should.

863
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,780
And like the old cat in the adage,

864
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,280
waiting too long.

865
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,400
It's just Bob is what it is.

866
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,280
It's just, it's literally Bob.

867
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,120
Lingering at the tattered fringe of your consciousness,

868
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,340
flooding your awareness with bold new waves of sound,

869
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,380
sweeping you inexorably toward grand new vistas of being.

870
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,520
The National Cynical Network.

871
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,240
The National Cynical Network.

872
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,700
Now that's one movie of Steven Spielberg's that he didn't re-edit.

873
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,820
There have been no special editions of any...

874
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,100
Steven Spielberg?

875
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,480
Steven Spielberg.

876
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,900
There have been no special editions of those movies.

877
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,640
It's odd.

878
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,880
He's done everything else.

879
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,140
Listen to it.

880
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,260
Why?

881
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,040
Why?

882
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:48,920
Why?

883
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,060
Why, why?

884
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,140
Why?

885
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,740
In a way...

886
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:58,800
Why Amy, what so chance have you?

887
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,200
I don't know.

888
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,540
Why?

889
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:00,740
Because something doesn't work.

890
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:00,740


891
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,060
Are you crazy?

892
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,360
What you see at that moment is the perceived message of a shitload of people

893
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:09,940
out of their minds denke shots at those things.

894
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,380
He has...

895
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:11,980
It's beautiful.

896
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,420
Don't look at the reverb machine, Marion.

897
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,680
Don't look at the reverb machine.

898
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,160
It's beautiful.

899
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,720
It's beautiful.

900
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,280
Keep your eyes shut, Marion.

901
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,040
No.

902
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,100
It's beautiful.

903
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,680
He keeps saying it's beautiful and then he blasts himself with white noise.

904
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,600
It's beautiful.

905
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,360
Well, I don't see what's so beautiful about it.

906
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,720
I'll open it.

907
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,760
Yes, Raiders of the Lost Boombox coming to a theater near you.

908
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:04,980
Boombox?

909
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,780
It's beautiful.

910
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,080
I'm going to blow up the Sony.

911
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,460
Sony, Rene.

912
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,820
Don't do that.

913
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,320
Blow it back to God.

914
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,220
Don't do that.

915
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:16,900
Don't do that.

916
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:17,480
Don't do that.

917
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:18,240
Don't do that.

918
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,540
Phineas Norco and company from NationalSynical.com.

919
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,540
And now back to the cleanliness of Dr. Howe.

920
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,460
So there was one question you missed here.

921
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,820
That was the second one for me.

922
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,000
Nope.

923
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,680
I got it.

924
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,220
Oh, the cleanliness.

925
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:37,780
Cleanliness.

926
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,600
Cleanliness.

927
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:38,960
Yes.

928
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,020
The sine qua non.

929
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:40,760
Cleanliness.

930
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,180
Cleanliness is an illusion.

931
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,660
One cannot be clean.

932
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,880
One can only remove minor excrustations from the surface.

933
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:56,420
Inside, it's all dirt from the standpoint of robots and crystalline formations.

934
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,040
All salt, stink, and fluids.

935
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,860
But we have to embrace that portion of ourselves.

936
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,880
Weren't there some aliens that referred to the humans as...

937
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,460
Ugly.

938
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,180
Squirming bags of unfulfilled appetites?

939
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:14,480
No.

940
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:20,700
Ugly bags of water held up by white sticks.

941
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,500
Sure.

942
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,960
Well, that's their prejudice, you know.

943
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,100
To us, maybe they're the monster.

944
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,220
I suspect they are.

945
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,340
I suspect they're the typical unthinkable things.

946
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:40,080
Either bone-dry monsters from another world, which is where you get that prejudice against human squishiness.

947
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,060
So...

948
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:47,280
Or gas-based creatures like those in the clouds of Jupiter.

949
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,000
Those stink.

950
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,220
God, they stink to high heaven.

951
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:51,500
To me.

952
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:51,500


953
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:51,500


954
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,380
But humans are extremely well-suited for this universe.

955
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,220
I'm going to risk a little bit of bad luck and point out something here.

956
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,940
That humans are right in the middle of the possible size anything can have in the universe.

957
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,000
They are right at the point between...

958
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,580
Micro-smallness and unthinkable hugeness.

959
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,900
They're among the largest creatures on the planet Earth.

960
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,300
All the animals larger than people you can write on a single sheet of paper.

961
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,740
The ones that are smaller take volumes to list.

962
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,660
And then if you go on out through the nebulas and gas clouds and galaxies,

963
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,120
you find that as you approach the super-large,

964
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,760
you're also doing it from the middle point.

965
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,700
The golden mean.

966
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,120
Yes, those humans are placed there.

967
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,520
Here's one last question.

968
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,120
Oh, a last question.

969
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,800
Well, I thought they were all...

970
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,780
It's a one-word question.

971
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,660
You may have seen it before.

972
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,500
Ah, yes. Oh, yes. I get this one a lot.

973
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,900
And this question is, why?

974
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,860
That's an interesting question.

975
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,000
It's a good question.

976
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,260
It has also been phrased as, why is there anything?

977
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,100
Why is there a universe at all?

978
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,740
Why is there something and not nothing?

979
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,100
And many people go on and on with,

980
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:18,380
what a wonderful miracle is that there's something and not nothing.

981
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,100
Underpinning this attitude is a proto-theological attitude.

982
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,720
Even a proto-Christian attitude,

983
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,220
that there should be something devoid of contingency,

984
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,460
is not that remarkable.

985
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,860
And so, to the question, why?

986
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,900
My answer is now, and is always,

987
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,720
because.

988
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,700
Accept it. Get used to it.

989
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:48,960
You can deny it, but you who deny are part of the fabric,

990
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,960
part of the Baroque complexity,

991
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,340
and you might as well put your back into it.

992
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,480
Thank you very much.

993
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,540
Ah-huh!

994
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,300
A Hing Set.

995
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:06,180
Dr. Howell from the 11th X Day Drill Live Tapes.

1000
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:27,080
But let's clock out now with the Transistors doing this classic by Deebo.

1001
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,960
We'll see you next time.

1002
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,400
It's a beautiful world we live in

1003
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,080
A sweet romantic place

1004
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,220
Beautiful people everywhere

1005
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,880
The way they show their care

1006
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,080
Makes me want to say

1007
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,420
It's a beautiful world

1008
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,420
It's a beautiful world

1009
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,420
It's a beautiful world

1010
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,560
For you

1011
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,780
For you

1012
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,520
For you

1013
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,360
It's a wonderful time to be here

1014
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,880
It's nice to be alive

1015
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:06,860
It's a wonderful time to be here

1016
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:06,860


1017
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,140
Wonderful people everywhere

1018
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,860
The way they come, their hair

1019
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,080
Makes me want to say

1020
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,380
It's a wonderful place

1021
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,400
It's a wonderful place

1022
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,380
It's a wonderful place

1023
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,580
For you

1024
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,680
For you

1025
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,560
For you

1026
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,900
, girl

1027
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,960
All you number of bravos

1028
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,660
My new pizzeria

1029
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,900
All you number of bravos

1030
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,600
Enjoy our problems

1031
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,160
Gypsy

1032
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,600
Today is a mountain

1033
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:57,440
But I'm not going away

1034
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,220
I'm tired of your clumsiness

1035
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,180
Have you heard me make a song?

1036
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,020
ec

1037
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,240
Beautiful people everywhere

1038
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,840
The way they show they care

1039
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,100
Makes me want to say

1040
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,400
It's a beautiful world

1041
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,400
It's a beautiful world

1042
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,580
It's a beautiful world

1043
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,560
For you

1044
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,640
For you

1045
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,580
For you

1046
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,520
It's not for me

1047
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,500
Not me

1048
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,400
Not for me

1049
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,480
Not for me

1050
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,500
Not for me

1051
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,260
Not for me

1052
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,440
Not me

1053
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,580
It's just not for me

1054
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:23,860
But , yeah

1055
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:29,720
If you believe it

1056
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,680
It's just hard to get

1057
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:30,840
Hoje

1058
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:30,840


1059
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm slime

1060
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,000


1061
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,540
If I could get your head up and down

1062
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:31,560
Just like I said

1063
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,560
Thank you.
