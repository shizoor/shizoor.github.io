Hello, hello, how are you?
One minute.
Hello, hello, my mom's one-on-one utilities.
Hello, hello, likely from a toxic force of the ball.
Hello, hello, thank you.
Teaching a parakeet to talk is fun,
but the old method took too much time and patience.
This record is specially designed to teach any healthy, normal parakeet to talk
by using...
The subgenius power of...
And now we behold the miracle of Bob Park.
Once the headquarters of the Knight's Topler,
where the people of London gather again to praise Bob,
or merely enjoy the perversions of Bob,
standing upright completely bowed out.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Wally?
Yeah?
Coursing around with girls.
Girls?
Well, sure.
They start foaming at the mouth.
Boy, that sounds neat.
Uh-huh.
What's up?
Hey, look!
The subgenius power of...
Yeah.
I say it's great.
Supposed to be the biggest in the whole world.
First it starts real slow.
Yeah.
Then it goes faster and faster.
And everybody starts yelling and screaming.
Supposed to scare the socks off you.
And they even got this guy in a white coat standing around in case anybody faints.
It sounds pretty neat, all right.
Well, see ya.
Okay, bye.
So long, fellas.
What's the matter with me?
I'll tell you what's wrong with you.
Dad cut off his knees.
He was sick for three days.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Don't tell me something like that.
I just had supper.
Praise Bob!
Bob!
Bob's...
Name!
I know.
Well,
You know.
I know.
Yeah!
You know.
I know.
Well, don't you know?
I know.
Why, that'd be like, you know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.

I don't know why the wind blows.
I don't know why the wind blows.
I don't know.


Really, you know, you can't explain the sea, I only know that something's wrong and current

And I wonder what it can be.
So, here in my heart, I'm waiting for my little rosemary...
And you'll end up running a flavored...














And as I wonder where you are
I'm blue as I can be
Someone's knocking on my door
I hear a voice call my name
Your girl has just been run over
By a great big steamroller
To this I reply
With tears in my eyes
I'm taking a shower now
Just slide her under the door

Stangville in Texas, in Stang County.
And he's
the unspoken mayor of Stangville
actually.
I heard from those speed
He preaches that the
Methodist Church
the most ludicrous
and horrendous parts of the Bible
and then starts asking people whether
they really, you know, how do they know
there really was a Jesus?
What a horrible man
to break through some lady's heart.
Well, you know, the funny thing is
they keep coming back
for more. Oh, Captain Stang
you know more about this?
She goes, no, well, Captain
Stang, you know more about the Bible than
any of our regular preachers
and what you have to say is just so
it has me thinking. It really gets
me to thinking sometimes and you know
it actually makes my faith stronger.
Unfortunately, that's the problem, Stang.
You have seeded all these women.
You're making people's faces stronger
by seeding them.
I've always wanted to spunk in the face
of
you.
Of trouble,
shall we say, in the form
of a red-headed Mormon
babe who is in for
it if we ever get our hands
on her. Part Indian and part
refugee. I'm sorry, it's this
Devo, it's the unreleased Devo music
in the background that had made me say that.
When the way you said, I don't
know your attitude, the way you say unreleased,
it sounds like it's a bowel movement or something, right?
Is that what you got out? Yeah.
Unreleased. You have to
Did I say that? No, you have to say it more like
yet to be released. I don't know.
Well, if I didn't say that and pick up on it, dude.
Okay.
Dave, I have some American
Indian related music that I think you're
going to love to just hear.
One is a song called Octopus
Woman by Dick
Kent, which
has me puzzled because I can't think which
tribe was dealing with octopi.
But you'll see what I
mean when you hear the song, and that's followed by
a rendition of a song about Mighty Mouse
by the Black Lodge
Singers. Get out of here.
The Black Lodge Singers do a thing
by Mighty Mouse? No, we've
played Mighty Mouse on this show.
That's what you told me, Dave.
No, this one is Mickey
Mouse, but first we have to listen to
a commercial. Do you push the caffeine drink
alarm in the morning? Do you drink more than
one caffeine drink during the day?
Do you feel like you need a caffeine drink
in the daytime? It's because you're
tossing an old-fashioned Swedish
soft yet supportive gravity defying
weightless certified amazing caffeine.
drink developed by NASA at night.
You deserve a good
caffeine drink, and that's just what you'll
get with the good caffeine system.
And now I don't sleep at all.
You'll never get the good
night's sleep. I can wake him up or
disturb him. Try that with a metal
spring. Look how the caffeine drink doesn't
tip over as Kelly moves billions of
uncomfortable metal springs.
So call now, and we'll rush
you this free sample of the amazing
unheard-of 20-year limited warranty.
Free. So call
13013 now.
So call 13013
now. That's 13013.
Bob.
Okay, here's
Octopus Woman by
Dick Kent.
What happened
at Fort Bragg
on the beach
of the sea?
An octopus
woman
reached out and grabbed
for me.
Octopus
woman, please let
me go. Octopus
woman,
please
let me go.
The
octopus
woman
lives out in
the sea.
She found her
a darling.
The day
she captured me.
Octopus
woman, please
let me go.
Octopus woman,
please
let me go.
It's very pretty music.
Octopus woman.
I should not have gone fishing.
So he could be maybe...
Down by that old Fort Bragg.
Fort Bragg on the ocean.
Fort Bragg? Well, Fort Bragg is on the ocean, isn't it?
No, Campo G.
Where's Fort Bragg?
That's not in Oklahoma.
He said that green-eyed octopus hag, and yet
he had her.
This isn't a bland prairie squid.
This is a half-woman, half-octopus
Lovecraftian thing.
Lovecraftian.
That's what it is. It's kind of like
the Shadow over Innsmouth.
The trot Fort Bragg.
Near Innsmouth,
Massachusetts, where...
Octopus's
children.
The octopus hunt
was quite a...
Quite a thing. Thousands of people
competing for various...
Was it a film of prairie squid?
She just had five more octopus
children. She's had hundreds.
She's had thousands.
She's like the goat with a thousand titties.
Yeah.
And orange.
That's a real goat, right?
Orange.
Dick can't...
I think he's speaking metaphorically of perhaps
white culture or European culture
if he's a VV corporate state.
Oh, man. Can't you believe in magic, dude?
Okay, well, okay. He's having a nightmare.
And the beauty of the octopus people.
Oh, phew.
As you say, the beautiful bureaucracy.
The mer-octomites.
Okay, here, listen to this.
The famous bird of death!
Yeah!
They are always
fantastic!
They are always fantastic!
They are all movie stars
at Disneyland!
Yeah!
Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse,
Pluto 2!
Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse,
Pluto 2!

They are always fantastic!
Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse,
and Pluto 2.
They're all movie stars
at Disneyland.
I think that might be perhaps
the Sistine Chapel to me.
This...
Hello?
Well-ha.
You know, I mean, jeez.
How else could you say it now?
I'm certainly not going to say,
here I come to send you
without, you know,
some zoom!
Right.
I mean, I wouldn't.
At least if I wasn't, you know,
throwing my own feathers.
Dave, are you sick?
I'm sick of life.
I'm sick of this
rare earth that we're forced
to tread daily.
I'm sick of the smell
of my own uterus
as I stumble blindly
from one garbage tiller.
Oh, my God.

into another, barking at the chickens
and making noises and causing...
Turtles!
See, they can keep...
That is shocking.
Eyes out, open.
That is absolutely shocking.
See, I heard the time he had taken a cigarette
and put it in his mouth and then, like,
pulled on his finger and then the other finger
and then the cigarette.
And then the mouth exploded?
Or the cigarette?
I don't know.
Well, how could you not know?
You said you were there.
I don't know.
You said you were there.
You must have seen what happened.
I was just only listening.
I didn't really see.
The last time somebody smoked Bob Fingers
while he was trying to pull his pipe,
they exploded in his own head.
There was no problem after that.
They cleaned it up pretty good.
Bob was dead.
For a while, as he was trapped
wrapped in...
Plastic.
For a while, as usual.
The muslin shrouded body of Bob J.R., J.R., J.J., J.R., J.R., J.R., Bob Dobbs
spring bought here to the muslistic orientum.
There's thousands of people out there.
Why?
None of them want to see this miscreants.
They are crying because apparently they've been overcharged for parking.
Now some of them are holding signs saying,
Bring Bob back.
Why?
The three B's of occult ritualism.
I want to scratch his back.
Some of them wanting to perforce his organs
or perhaps move into other realms of his body.
The orifices have been sealed shut by the Monsignor himself
under a three-year plan also agreed to by the United Snakes of...
I'm sorry, the United Nations Secretary himself.
I'll take a message.
I'll take this, please.
It's been a tough delay, but some of the toughest stay.
Who killed Bob?
Bob.
Who killed him?
It is what we must find out.
And those responsible for Bob's death must be brought to justice.
Yes, bring them to justice.
We all loved Bob.
Everyone in town loved Bob.
There wasn't a kid in town...
The little woodchopper woman to the big quilting man.
What was there not to love?
I think it doesn't stink because of him.
It's not my...
It's not my problems.
He's...
He's created all of mine.
Someday he'll come back.
It was our barber, our bloodletter, our leecher, and our salesman.
A feces slinger.
And what a barbecue ape.
Oh, what a feces slinger.
What a man, woman, anything.
I wanted...
But...
But...
Look, he's back.
Now...
Now we must kill him.
Yes, kill Bob.
All right.
I'm Prettier, I just killed Bob.
We've got these guys.
Yep.
I'm Pet me, that was lucky.

Broke the head on us, died from the 같은 on.

We had all kinds of ineffable suspense trap through the whole�
The one who's prepared books...


oppne blah stuff.
Uhh!
I did it.
You were covering tape with me before.
No.
Tennessee. I know it's a Texas, probably Tennessee. This is Fool Me Once. Shame on you. Shame on you.
It's Fool Me, Can't Get Fooled Again.
Fool Me, Can't Get Fooled Again. Shame on, Shame on, Shame on, Shame on. Fool Me What? Armageddon!
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Fool me once, I'm a ganker.
Fool me, can't just fool again.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
But I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil.
So you look here now.
Now.
Got the rippy rhyme being blow.
Being blow.
Get the line straight, man.
Dapper, man.
You're dapper like peanut butter on the pan.
Yeah, man, that shit is good.
Come on, W.
Get the line straight.
You're disgracing my home state.
Shame on you.
Cut out, Hank.
In Nashville, the president tried to keep up the pressure.
Shame on you.
Ready?
In Nashville, the president tried to keep up the pressure.
He ain't doing a fucking thing.
It's just shame on you.
In Nashville, the president tried to keep up the pressure.
Shame on you.
Now, this is Dean Martin.
Fool me, we can't get fooled again.
And Jerry Lewis with him.
We will save the world, you cunt.
Fucker.
I pushed a cardboard cube.
His rectum had slipped.
The ragged, our durable end, he explained.
As usual, Kinky shouted out, Armageddon!
My cue.
He didn't have enough.
In Nashville, the president tried to retrieve Raggett, but he wouldn't come out again.
So I peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.
Shame on you.
At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next.
There's an old...
...saying in Tennessee.
I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee.
This says, fool me once.
Igniting Mr. Tomaszewski's hair and severely f***ing his face.
Shame on you.
It also set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers, which in turn ignited a larger bucket of gas.
Yeah!
Yeah!

If you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're.

If you're, if you're, if you're, if you're.
If you're, if you're, if you're.
If you're, if you're, if you're.
If you're.
Fool me, we can't get fooled again.
See how it is?
That's the line of the show right here.
Don't make a shit.
That was the ornamental thing.
The Work Shoppe Radiophonic is the name of the group that did that fool me once thing.
Work Shoppe.
Spelled W-O-R-K-E.
Shoppe.
S-H-O-P-P-E.
Radiophonics.
Phonic.
Phonic with a K.
That was a lovely, simply lovely piece.
I enjoyed the voting.
What is this horrible thing?
George.
Backforce image against the contrast with the sitcom audience.
I loved it.
Oops.
Me too.
It was a beautiful exercise in futility.
I remember I think it was 1997.
We took all the victims down to the river before we drowned them.
And we made each one of them pray to Jesus.
We laughed until our shoes filled up.
Then we went back and counted our money.
And counted yours. Remember that?
Oh, yes.
Yes, you had the...
What's it?
What kind of damn money did you have?
I can't remember.
It was red and had funny queens on it and things.
And people with elephants and strange eyes.
I remember it so much better.
Yes, but it was beautiful money.
Then we drowned all the...
We drowned all the victims.
And went back and had a sandwich.
Remember that?
Yes, right along with the meals.
Yes.
I remember.
It's great running this planet.
I enjoy the making the money as we can count
and taking the victims down to the river.
That doesn't solve my prostate problem, so...
I've noticed that.
It's the size of a 400-pound watermelon now.
Do they make you drink that stuff for yours?
I have to carry it in a small cabin device
that has a little motor on the side.
And I can make it go low,
low,
high,
or in between,
which is the speed I choose.
Yes, in between is best.
But it doesn't help drowning the victims
or counting the money.
No.
No.
No.
Loving the feeling of submission to me.
Loving the feeling of submission to me.
Loving the feeling of submission to me.
Loving the feeling of submission to me.
Loving the feeling of submission to me.


The state is your third nostril.
Not some image of the past or future.
The state.
The state.
The state is your third nostril.
Can you smell it yet?
I'm loving the feeling.
I smell so obedient.
I love it.
I love the smell.
I feel like I could do anything I am was told.
I feel like I could do anything I am was told.
Tell me something.
Make me do something.
You can do anything that you want as of this moment.
Old lady and old man, yes.
Because you have entered the church of the subgenius.
I'm not going to put them on, mister.
Get back.
Come one, come all.
Come on in.
You too.
You can be like the freaks.
Look at the freaks.
Look at their insane eyes.
Hear the insane things they have to say to you.
Here at the church of the subgenius.
The zealous shall not be permitted past level four.
The overzealous shall not be allowed to play with the commode.
And those who have passed level five will be forced to evacuate the body.
Where's the evacuation chamber?
I think it's down there.
We just lost two people when we came here.
And they said they want to see it.
There's a long line.
I'm not going there, but that's where it is.
There's a long line there.
Nobody will vacate the evacuation chambers, man.
You get lost in that line.
We're all on evacuation.
Vacation.
I keep walking this way for a year.
Who can help us?
Who can help us to find the place, the final place where we can let loose, where we can achieve achievingness?
Your movements, your eye movements, your body's relaxation continues.
Just hold it up and down.
Was that for that potato?
Was that for that potato?
No.
What?
I thought he was here.
I thought he was here.
You know, this Marshall music reminds me of the days way, way back when.
Notice this tooling scar?
I got this from that chair pop.
Oh my God.
Look what he did to me.
Disgusting.
We were both students together at and went to the right cellar and smoked.
And then he said it to me.
What's your name about my mother?
She was short of lip and long on tooth and I laughed and then he kicked me in the groin.
And so we do it.
He won.
Well, you know, boys will be boys.
Yes, they will.
But what about, what about becoming men and stopping this?
It's gone on too long.
Well, I know.
It rips daily.
Look, it's still oozing now.
I hate bubs.
Bubs will be bubs.
What?










And bubs will be bubs.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
One person blowing himself and smacking his head.
If only, if only Bob would truly return.
What?
Oh no.
It's a, wait, wait, you guys, the president's coming.
Cool it, cool it, man.
It's Rick, it's President Stang.
President Stang is coming.
Oh my God.
Shh, shh, shh.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.












Oh man.
I'm so nervous.
God, that guy's ugly.
I wonder what he looks like underneath that microphone.
Oh man, you can smell him walking by.
Just keep, keep.
He's sweating.
Don't, don't look.
Oh man.
What is that?
It, it smells like there's a decaying turkey.
Is that a woman with him?
No, that's, yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, no, no, don't look.
Keep your eyes down on the ground.
Keep, keep looking at your shoes, man.
He's looking at me now.
He's like, oh my God.
Shh.
Yes, my children.
I'm sorry.


You have gathered unto me and I shall lead you to the new way, the way of the new Bob
who speaks only through me.
Yes, from now on in the Church of the Subgenius you may only achieve achievingness and slackdomness
by hiding from that J.R.
Bob Dobbs and sending all your money to me, the new Dobbs, Reverend Ivan Stang.
Forget the, that old talk, that slackdom.
But you got to get this done.
That's silly.
Silly superstition.
I'll try.
You must put your nose to the grindstone now, my children.
I got to get my shoes on.
I got to get my shoes on.
Relent.
Daddy, watch this.
Secret, I got to go.
Stop slacking off and get a second job.
Yes.
That's the new Church policy.
What is it?
Is there some sort of dissidence?
Why, we're happy to hear.
Are there, pardon me, kids.
Was I hearing some sort of a dissidence?
We certainly would love to hear from any, anyone who seems to have a critique of the
new regime.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Paying attention, sir.
The new election of the subgenius.
I didn't do it.
Yes, I think we'll call it that.
We'll change the name of the whole organization.
It was silly before.
No one likes religious crap.
We like what you want.
And no one cared about Bob.
He was old fashioned.
We need a cool new savior.
Like me, yes.
That would do.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
That would be, that would be.
Reverend Darth Stang.
That would be beautiful.
That would be beautiful.

I am the future king of all the subgeniuses and owner of all the copyrights and gender's
wills to trademarks.
As onerous as anyone has ever been.
Yes, I shall own slack.
I shall own the very slack itself of every individual subgenius.
I will define slack for them.
Bob, that fool, he didn't know how to make money.
Salesman of the gods with kind of a pathetic, pitiful idiot.
Did he take me for a fool?

A subgenius?
Nay, for I, Reverend Stang, am the first subgenius.
Genius!
No one can ever stop me now.
You die.
Guards, seize him.
Ow.
Ow.
Oh, Christ.
What is happening?
I'm beating a big guard.
That is good.
My guards are beating this silly old man.












And they're making shoes out of meat and pants and hats and hair chests.
Wait, wait, what's going on?
The old man, he's casting off his rotten clothes and his bad smell.
He's standing up straight.
A pipe has sprung out of his mouth.
Why, that's not so simple, old man.
But J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.
Oh, my God.
He has come to take revenge.
Revenge against I who would usurp his great church.
Oh, no, Bob.
No, Bob, no, please.
They're biting the arm, Bob.
No, Bob, please.
No, Bob.
No, Bob, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was just kidding.
It was on part of the set.
It's all right, Bob.
Please.
You will.
Yes.
Oh, no.
Do you have any of the dog eat downers?
Do you have any of the pills for this damn dog?
He's beat on my leg.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I...
Mr. Cornhusker, I hate to interrupt your dream time now, but you're a...
I'm sorry, Bob.













You've exceeded the limits.
You've gone three points over and I'm afraid the credit roll is a Danish.
You know what I'm saying?
Let's take a hike.
Pal, you.
Hey, Longshorthair, whatever your name is.
Let's go.
Time's up.
You've used up your dream time.
These guys get in here, they can't get out.
Look at what's happening to his feet.
Oh, my God.
He must have been in here for a year.
Oh, man.
He has not been using the facilities they've been using.
Jesus Christ.
We'll have to get somebody.
Can you get these Z's over here?
Can you get a couple Z's to clean this mess up?
Oh, man.
The guy had a stag dream there.
He thought he was king of the universe or something and he's been here a while.
No, no.
He's gone on the floor for crying out loud.
We need something to get rid of the smell and de-bacterialize the place somehow.
I mean, crying out loud.











He's on the console and now he's drooling over there.
That started it.
Poor thing.
Man, this is stuck right on here.
I have to put this on.
Oh, man.
I've got to go to the bathroom.
When they see Lincoln's ghost just running around, they're going to see George Washington
and other presidents.
Aren't we a wild house?
This year they're watching from their house.
Let me get my glasses.










home above.
They're watching all
the
messes going round.
There's
gonna be a
friend of old
Gaddafi
that is found
in our White House.
Gaddafi's
going to flare
up his ugly face
again. And with
what he does, his people
are gonna hold him down.
So he won't
cause havoc
to their land again.
Havoc.
There's gonna be some
changes made
when all the lights begin
to go out and blackouts come
from all around.
All the governments
are gonna have a
visit from the
Ahabonessah.
Ahabonessah.
Friends,
I should explain that this song
by Fran
Baskerville, as in
Hound of Thee.
Fran Baskerville
in this song called Lincoln's Ghost
is doing psychic predicting,
I believe. She's a psychic.
She's telling us what's going to happen
in, well, I think it's the
future of the 80s.
Now, you said this
was one of those time traveler
CDs or those tapes that were sent.
Well, she can see
the future somehow. Spirits tell
her the future. But this is a woman
from the actual future.
From the sound
of the music, I would say yes.
But her predictions
for the 90s turned out not to
be correct.
This was done in the
80s, I think. Well, which stringy 90s
are we talking about? You know, all the string
theories, like string theory edition. I'm a
hologram and I'm actually Jesus in another
dimension. There's 12 of me.
You know, like Pew, Paul, Larry, Moe
and so forth. The multiple reality,
multiple nostril theory.
Well, we've all, you know, we've tried to tap
in and what's happened, you know, we've been losing
precious water, gouging it,
you know. The next thing you know, we'll be
having lovely, we'll be heaving
lovely water.
I had an operation so I could
get to it easier. I had them
ream out the hole bigger so I could get
to the gold.
How did that affect?
It worked great.
It's not banging against the cyst on your bundle?
I talk better now. I say
things better.
This is a bigger
echo chamber. Because
the cyst is gone or the cyst is
like just changed in shape like an amphitheater
or something? Oh, I'm not talking. I had, I kept
it. I had them keep the cyst.
Well, just so long as it doesn't keep you, if you
know what I mean. I mean, you keep on
trying to keep that thing alive
on its own. How do you know it's not
actually controlling your mind instead of
you controlling the cyst on
your bung holes? Don't
knock it until you've tried it. That's all
I can say, man. Oh, by the way, here
we've got some recordings coming up.
Elvis in a box!
Elvis in a box, man! This guy
played at the Foundry in, uh, at
the Devival in England.
This is Elvis in a box.
On Elvis's birthday. It is Elvis.
He's in a box. He's a, um,
an Indian Elvis, I believe.
A Bollywood Elvis.
Listen.
You couldn't see Elvis
because he was in a box. He sounds pretty good
from inside that box.
Finally, at the end of the show, he did
come out of the box. This is the song
when he removed the box.
It was
Bollywood Elvis.
He did a little dance here.
I liked the little kind of hieroglyphic
hand moves and stuff like that.
He's a friend of Reverend Error.
That's a falsification.
There is no
Reverend Error.
I could be wrong, but I think it was Reverend Error.
It's a magnification of a falsitude called an error.
See, Elvis loves Bob now.
Elvis in a box loves him like
Windaloo. There's no tomorrow
talking about that.
Somehow.
Rainbow!
What I want to ask you was he spicy or mild?
Spicy.
He was spicy.
He's a very spicy Elvis.
Did it take long to come out of the box?
Did he have to be refrigerated?
He sprang from the box like the wisdom sprang from Krishna's brow.
Oh!
And like this music springs from Bollywood.
Lika, lika, lika.
Lika, lika, lika.
Lika, lika, lika.
Lika, lika, lika.
Lika, lika, lika.
Lika, lika, lika.
You get a lot of mileage on it.
Laka, laka, laka, bosh!
Rump a bosh.
Rump a bosh, rump a bosh.
Rump a bosh, rump a bosh, rump a bosh.
I would say, defying this cat, I would say,
Papa Dumb, you know what I'm saying?
Papa Dumb.
Papa could be smarter, do his thang,
but no, Papa Dumb.
Papa Dumb, man.
Papa one dumb, was back
pulling this kind of thang.
Well, isn't dumb, though, a value judgment?
Not among the dumb.
It's more of a thang.
worthy symbol of praise,
perhaps a eunuch's way
of letting himself out of the crisis.
But you know, Papa Doom
is even better.
He is a bang-bang drummer.
He's more delicious.
And he is quite a dentist, too.
Yes, I know, a dandy dentist.
Falsa Doom was also a fine drummer.
That was the uncle,
and he implanted the decay in the teeth,
and the cousin, or nephew,
and both, would remove the teeth
and the decay.
Just like we are removing the decay.
No, I thought we were the decay.
Well, that can be true, too.
That is our only way to attack the conspiracy,
you see, is we are the decay.
We're the yeast, the mold, the termite.
We're the bleeding rock.
We're the pop in the Papa Doom.
We're the bloody, slimy rock.
We're the Papa Dumb.
We're the rust to the conspiracy's iron cage.
We're the little poopy handle
on the back of the caboose.
We're the elf people
that have no future and no limbs.
Ah, but...
But because of that,
we are free little elves.
We don't need arms or legs
or tree trunks or branches.
We can just be
because we have slack.
The subgenius is not something
that must get slack.
The subgenius is one who already has slack.
It is whether you are able
to recognize
the slack you already have.
Friends,
and I know that you're a winner
because you listened to this.
I did.

I'm looking for radio ministry.
I'm looking for slack.
He's won the whole prize, hasn't he?
It looks like the carrot's coming down
and there it goes.
Oh, wow.
What a lucky man.
Oh, look, the color's big now.
Looks like he's going to go all the way.
They're going to probably take him
into another dimension entirely.
And there's the strings.
They're all dropping down like a fishnet.
Oh, boy.
Well, there's nothing else for us to say
other than, oh, what a lucky man he was.
And friends, you too can be
lucky as lonesome here
and as loathsome as lonesome
if you want to know more
about Church of the Subgenius.
Yes, that would prove your luck
if you wanted to know.
If you actually learn anything,
I'm not sure what that would say,
but why don't you try your luck?
Friends, give Lady Luck a look out
and join us.
Pull back your lever
and start banging and banging
on that old...
If you need to know,
and you do,
then check out www.subgenius.com.
Subgenius is spelled without an O,
by the way, for you.
Subgenius.
I'd like to ask each and every one
of my friends out there.
I had a...
Well, he was in the service with me.
I was on Guackle Canal,
Bukitville,
and...
Well, to make a long story start,
I know that it's my dime you've got there,
so I won't go on too far.
But anyway,
I won't call him a Jap
because that's not a real name.
He was a member of the enemy,
so he...
Well, anyway,
the hair was growing on the inside,
and we took him back
to where we all was there,
and we interrogated him,
and he said it was Bob Dobbs.
Now, if you don't...
I swear, I swear on a stack of snakes,
that's the name he gave.
Now, here he was,
a member of the 3rd Imperial,
what you call it,
Sapper Battalion,
or whatever they call themselves,
and he had the pipe right there
tattooed on his titties.
And we were going to take the samurai short
and shoot him,
but the commandant said,
we've got to interrogate him some more.
What are we supposed to do?
Well, there wasn't enough estrogen to go around,
because...
From PR News in Washington,
I'm nursing the first of three pregnant women
pulled out of the mud in Washington.
Just the first of three that released gas Thursday.
Rescue workers thrust head-on
on the flashy public PR news.
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles
could trigger PR news in remote Washington.
And now...
That guy is good, whoever does that.
Wait a minute, which button am I pushing here?
Who does that? That guy is good.
You're pushing my buttons, man.
What's that guy's name?
Don't be pushing my buttons, okay?
The guy who does the NPR thing, you know?
That's pretty good.
That was Limerland Fernando.
That guy's funny.
Yeah, he's a funny,
he's a pretty funny kind of guy.
He's an old cutter.
He's an old...
An old cutter.
He's a yuck cutter.
You know, I have to cut the yucks out of this show
for the public radio airwaves.
When we do the edited shows,
the ones on the internet,
you leave the yucks in there,
but you gotta take the yucks out
and the yits.
We call it yuck cutting and yit cutting.
Cutting the yucks and yits out of the shows,
you know, for the nice people
and the nice broadcast stations.
Some of them are nice.
In America,
the broadcast stations in the Canadias,
they don't care about the yits and the yucks.
They don't have the same problems up there.
Nah.
They ain't got much of nothing up there.



Yeah, actually.
Not like here, for crying out loud.
Yeah.
We got a lot of everything here.
You gotta take the nits,
the yucks,
the yucks and the yucks out,
and you gotta take those little,
you know,
squat sounds they got in there, too.
Yeah.
You know, for crying out loud,
it takes you three afternoons
to add it to one show.
I gotta turn every squat backwards.
They go,
ta-quack,
wah,
ta-quack,
ta-quack,
wah.
And, you know,
that's got more humor value,
maybe,
to some of these creeps out there,
but, you know,
the average person that's gonna listen
is gonna turn right off.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
This show sucks.
This show's full of fish.
That's your problem, right?
That's why, you know,
I want you to be on, uh...
I say cuff him
if they can't take a joke.
The Dumpy Cummel Show
or something like that.
Oh, no, he can't travel.
You know, the open house,
you know,
the next thing you know,
he's bleeding all over the floor.
Cuff that stuff.
Cuff him, cuff him, you know.
Cuff him.
Cuff him.
That's a bunch of fish.
Yeah, a bunch of fish.
What is it?
The fish thing.
I always forgot that.
You know, like,
I remember Maury Henders
and a couple of those guys
who come in, you know,
and they start talking
to the, uh, you know,
the fish.
I don't know about the fish,
but, uh...
What the hell was it, you know?
You smoked...
The few drink in there
have fish cuff in it.
A fish coffin?
I didn't know they had coffins
for a gosh darn fish.
There you go.
See, I would have had
to cut the gosh.
Didn't you?
I have to cut the gosh
and make it just say,
dang.
How long does that take?
Three hours.
That's to go straight.
Three hours.
Just for each time you say,
gosh dang,
I gotta cut the gosh
and make it...
Yeah, gosling tapes in me.
I go through
a yard of gosling tapes.
I'm cutting one,
one yit out of this show.
One freaking yit.
One yit.
And you gotta say freaking
instead of yucking.
Because, you know,
because you don't want to yuck.
How many days is that?
Oh, for crying out loud.
The last time I,
I forgot to pull a yuck.
Yeah, it was like a...
I think this is one of the most
highbrow shows I have ever had.
It's the most,
it's cuffed up.
It's the most cuffed up thing
I ever heard.
It's wonderfully highbrow.
It's very, very much.
It's very, very much.


It's the dementia.
You know,
and the worst thing...
You ain't like a bad
vacuum cleaner.
For this one,
I gotta,
for the internet shows,
I gotta go and turn them
all backwards
to make them into cuss words again.
And so then the next thing you know,
you get arguments from your pope,
you know,
your lobsang rampa,
your Dalai Lama,
hey,
back words,
you know,
hey, right, right, right.
Get that enough profanity
in my internet copy.
Like I'm a stylist,
you know.
When Bob's let me down,
I ain't get no slack from Bob.
Yeah, they know,
they know.
Hey,
no,
yeah.
Hey, Bob.
Last time they got slapped
by me,
of course.
They didn't get no slack
off of no Bob.
Bob,
well,
I know,
it's Jesus.
It didn't have
any disciples named.
Don't be...
He did have one named Jim.
And he had one named Bob.
Yes.
And one named Tom.
Jesus' disciple Bob.
The Fisher of Wallets,
friends.
And like Jesus,
he could walk on the water.
But unlike Jesus,
he could also fly.
Yes,
the child Bob could fly.
We've covered this
in previous lessons.
We have spoken,
he could fly underwater,
as a matter of fact.
He could,
yes,
he could fly
through outer space.
And perhaps Bob came from space,
but that's to be decided
by scholars, friends.
Because it's only up to us
to worship Bob.
We owe him not,
not just fear,
but awe.
But I think it is
empathizing
and, you know,
it's so natural
to present
some of the childhood stories
of Bob
and saying the wonderment
of his village folk.
He could see
that Bob was flying
through the water,
that he was passing urine
and mustard
through thousands
of octopus-like orifices.
And I'm telling you right now,
as long as I'm on this television
telling you,
that's the way...
Bob can fly right into your life,
too, friends.
Bob can fly right in,
right up you,
up your pant leg.
He'll sneak right up there
and tickle you.
Because he was a child
that had wings like a dove.
Wings like an eagle.
So beautiful.
Nostrils, all three,
like a hockey thing.
He could spurn magnificent ideas
and put his face into the fire
and come back
just as red as that pumpkin.
That's your dad out there.
The father of...
The father of...
The father of...
Bob's...
We...
We hate...
Hate, hate, hate.
And...
Hate!
We love hate.
And friends,
we hate to leave.
And we hate love!
And we love hate.
We hate to leave,
but we must.
We hate to leave.
And somehow,
the show must come to an end.
And I guess this must be it.
Or almost here.
You've got to think of the past
and the future of the show
and the mo...
We could just fade it out.
This isn't really ending music.
That's like an illusion fading in.
I'm like, oh, where it comes...
This show's full of shit.
That's your problem.
That's why, you know...
I say fuck them
if they can't take a joke.
The Jumpy Cummles show
or something like that.
Oh, no, he can't travel.
You know, the open house,
you know, the next thing you know,
he's bleeding all over the floor.
Fuck that stuff.
Fuck them, fuck them, you know.
That's a...
That's a bunch of shit.
Yeah, a bunch of shit.
What...
What is it?
Shit.
I always forgot that.
You know, like,
I remember Maury Henders
and a couple of those guys
who come in, you know,
and they start talking
and they, you know,
the shift and then...
I don't know about the shift.
What the hell was he?
I think this is one of the most
highbrow shows I've ever had.
It's the most...
It's fucked up.
It's the most fucked up thing I ever heard.
It's fucked...
