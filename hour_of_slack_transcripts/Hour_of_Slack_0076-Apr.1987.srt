1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
I'm trying to make believe I'm you, oh, trying to think

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,620
Just a stranger on the outside looking in

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,320
People say that life is fun, but I don't know why

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:26,180
As far as I can tell, life sucks, life sucks, life sucks

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,620
Then they die

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,100
Within the last 12 hours, we have received a number of unconfirmed reports from throughout the nation

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,560
that may or may not be connected with this strange phenomenon.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,500
Bob?

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,460
I'm sick and tired of the rats

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,440
But the shit don't wait

11
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,220
Like!

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,320
Bob, removed

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,640
WÃ¼rwe

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,840
Knows

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,320
Yes, you know

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,740
Yes, I understand

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,080
Yeah, awesome

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,600
Good judgment!

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,200
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

20
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,540
We will control the vertical.

21
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,380
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

22
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,880
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of swag.

23
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,700
Chris Bob, help me somebody.

24
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,780
The church of the subgenius.

25
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,900
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed,

26
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,000
ragged functions,

27
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,200
quality audio visual techniques,

28
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,480
exacerbated and complicated by the church of the subgenius.

30
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,100
Oh, Dr. Sperbach.

31
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:09,540
She said, cutting her own legs off in what was to be the foment of a startlingly trend among the so-called punk detail-a-hensia.

32
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,220
It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

33
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,720
Enjoy life like Bob.

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,900
Get the head, you satan.

35
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,440
Do not be afraid.

36
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,140
I am not here to harm you.

37
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,480
I know you want to destroy me.

38
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,280
But listen, please listen.

39
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,740
I only want to help you.

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,460
I've chosen you.

41
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my work now.

42
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,080
They don't love you, Bob.

43
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,480
They don't love you like I do.

44
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,940
They don't love you like I do.

45
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,300
They don't love you like I do.

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,140
They don't love you like I do.

47
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,040
They don't love you like I do.

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,500
They don't love you like I do.

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:04:00,020
Dear friends, you may call 823-7490 for a complete explanation of the Church of the Subgenius in under two minutes.

50
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,640
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

51
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,820
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

52
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,280
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

53
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:23,060
It's not just the child zombies that murder their mediocrity parents and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

54
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:33,060
It's not just those starry old vecks on the park benches with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

55
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,740
It's not just the anesthesiologist for needy.

56
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,080
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,400
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

58
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,320
It's not just the broken headlight, snapped antenna, and human excrement on your car hood.

59
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,080
It's not just that the old ways were best.

60
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,320
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

61
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,580
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

62
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,060
It's not just the war.

63
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,060


64
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,060


65
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,540
It's not just the wide-screen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.

66
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,040
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

67
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,440
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,580
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland nun entity son of a b-

69
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,460
who thinks workers are property.

70
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,040
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

71
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,360
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

72
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,620
It's not just some

73
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,520
with a pipe and a

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,180
eating I know more than you do dog grin all over his homogenized face.

75
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:06,200
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made.

76
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,620
It's not just the doorway to doom.

77
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,060
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

78
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,060


79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,340
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha beta max.

80
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,300
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

81
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,060
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum show.

82
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,120
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

83
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,380
He's the grandest thing yet and don't you forget.

84
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,780
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus?

85
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,580
You'll need to rise precious early, you sinner, there if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

86
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,700
Not off.

87
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,040
He's got cough mixture with a lot of shit.

88
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,040


89
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,400
I'll punch on it for you, my friend.

90
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,880
In his back pocket. Just you try it.

91
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,580
Thanks to G. Gordon Gordon for that one and this is Reverend Cleve Duncan.

92
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,460
Well, there once was a man

93
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,060
The world's greatest salesman

94
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,380
And he had to pass the pain

95
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,740
To get the shackles from my feet

96
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,000
Ah, yeah, but now he's gone

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,320
A martyr for the cause Bob is my own

98
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,820
And he's comin' again

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,960
Who knew that the first shot

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,540
Was gonna be the last shot

101
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,400
But he's got a hard drivin' pipe

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,640
The gas smoke all through the night

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,400
And although he may be hurtin'

104
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,980
The universe is still a-

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,540
He's gonna keep on squirtin' Bob's and Bob's own

106
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
And he's comin' again

107
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,580
Ah-ho!

108
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,620
Oh, yes, dear friends, we're gonna build that spirit back up.

109
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,960
And we're gonna build the spurt back up, too.

110
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,720
Now, you know, spurt and spirit sound the same for a reason.

111
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,480
They're both from the same root word, dear friends, and what a root it is.

112
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,560
What a root it is.

113
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,280
I want you to get out there and plant those roots, children.

114
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,180
Oh, yeah!

115
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,940
Bob is my loadin'.

116
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,780
He's comin' again.

117
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,360
Look!

118
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,280
He can save us from the men in black

119
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,720
With just a shot from his mighty sack

120
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,980
If only he could make it back

121
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,900
From the land of the dead

122
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,060
But until that happy day

123
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,580
We can only drink and say

124
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,000
Bob is my loadin'

125
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,080
And he's comin' again

126
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,100
I know he can make it

127
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,040
Without him, we can't take it

128
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,280
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

129
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,100
To the big boys and the whims

130
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,320
Until the day that he comes back

131
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,040
It'll be a world without sack Bob's and Bob's own

132
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,200
And he's comin' again

133
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,780
I just got to

134
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,420
I just got to

135
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,000
I just got to

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,820
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

137
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,220
Dear friends, I've got a short sermon to do here.

138
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,820
And this is mostly...

139
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,620
This is going to be mostly for those of you

140
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,200
who have been regular listeners of the show.

141
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,520
And the rest of you probably ought to just go away.

142
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,800
Go to the bathroom for about five, ten minutes.

143
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,120
Then come back for more horrible tape.

144
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,460
Well, I got a letter here, friends.

145
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,420
A letter from Sister Mandy.

146
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,120
And I'm going to read this letter here.

147
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,860
It's pertinent.

148
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,860
She says,

149
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,240
I hope the show pulls in what was promised.

150
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,580
It would be a cryin' shame if you had to die again.

151
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,900
But then again, what was this,

152
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,180
this, this,

153
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,520
this excretive deleted

154
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,000
coming out of my radio last hour of slack?

155
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,960
Actually, she's talking about two hours of slack ago.

156
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,600
Two weeks ago.

157
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,640
I can't believe you would rag on native Texans

158
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,660
because they're not as rowdy as some chowderhead Yankees.

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,760
Now, dear friends, let me intercede here

160
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,720
and say that it's not y'all's lack of rowdiness at all,

161
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,160
but the lack of airplane tickets that you would provide

162
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
to get other subgenius preachers down here for a ride.

163
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,000
But Sister Mandy continues,

164
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,700
Now, I don't know if you are a real Texan or just a transplant.

165
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,820
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,900
I know I don't sound like I was raised in North Richland Hills and Fort Worth.

167
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,040
But maybe you like cold winters, she says,

168
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,020
in the way they say pepechfawm and clam chowda.

169
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,940
Maybe now we women of Texas aren't good enough

170
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,000
for old Reverend Ivan Stang anymore.

171
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,780
Is that it, huh?

172
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,260
Well, no comment there.

173
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,660
But Texans are Bob's chosen.

174
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,280
It's always been that way,

175
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,920
but that's why it's so disappointing that they don't act like it.

176
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,700
I certainly do.

177
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,800
Mandy continues,

178
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,520
I don't know.

179
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,500
I can't believe that the subgeniuses of Dallas

180
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,040
don't have the, say, cojones

181
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,120
to manage to put together a butt-kicking, glass-grinding,

182
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,540
splendiferous-type de-vival.

183
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,300
And friends, it's not the cojones that's needed,

184
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,280
but the energy and the know-how,

185
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,060
the art scam expertise.

186
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,340
She goes,

187
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,380
I'd be willing to give myself in every way possible to help,

188
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,560
although I'm a prisoner of the conspiracy's so-called educational system.

189
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,100
Irving, oh, I think, school, yeah.

190
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,900
I want to help when I can.

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,820
You know, as well as I, that Dallas is capable of it.

192
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,500
So cram this Boston BS and save your evil fluids for Dallas.

193
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,560
But friends, is Dallas capable?

194
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,940
For instance, the most high-buck disco club in Dallas,

195
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,040
Mistral, couldn't handle the technical demands of one extra.

196
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,040


197
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,780
VHS tape deck, which you operate in your own home.

198
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,880
She goes,

199
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,420
Yeah, I realize that your rant was meant to inflame,

200
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,060
but all it did was, well, I can't say this, but anger people.

201
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,540
And friends, I know that's true,

202
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,380
and it's because I delivered it poorly.

203
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,660
She says,

204
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,860
I know you can do better than that,

205
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,360
and that's true, when I've had enough sleep.

206
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,420
Do something, I can't read the something to them if they can't take a joke.

207
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Do more than anger them.

208
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,420
Challenge us.

209
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,440
And friends, some did take it as a challenge,

210
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,960
which is how it was meant to be.

211
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,760
She says,

212
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,500
Dallas loves stupid.

213
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Look at some of our swinging singles meat lockers.

214
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,140
Have a national devival or something.

215
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,500
Aim for Dallas's cojones and threaten to have them kicked by San Francisco or something.

216
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,160
Make yourself the most hated man in Dallas,

217
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,060
for without hate there is no love,

218
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,200
and without love there is no Bob.

219
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,800
Bob equals hate equals love.

220
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,700
Did you say that, or was it me?

221
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,900
It was me, Mandy.

222
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,700
I don't remember, but do it, Stang.

223
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,460
I know you can.

224
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,660
Well, you know, when I've had enough sleep and had a little bit of slack,

225
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,180
usually, oh, what did that mean?

226
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,860
The music stopped all of a sudden.

227
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,900
But it's true, I couldn't agree with you more about that after Boston hour of slack,

228
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,840
because after I'd finally gotten to bed and slept for 13 hours,

229
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,800
I listened to that tape of the show and went,

230
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,760
oh my God, I sound almost drunk.

231
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,420
But keep in mind that stupidity is certainly no sin in this church,

232
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,260
and I was just plain burned out, tired.

233
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,520
Tired, friends.

234
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,160
And on top of that, I was being facetious.

235
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,000
But I just wasn't being facetious well, so it came off the wrong way.

236
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,260
Now, you know, when you go for four hours of sleep a night, it happens.

237
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,540
You don't get the slack.

238
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,720
But then when I got to Boston, my buddies, Doctors for Bob and I, did get slack,

239
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,300
although it was partly slack through overwork, which is an unusual form of slack.

240
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,420
But many of us emergentiles have to get slack that way,

241
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,540
as opposed to you rewardian type subgeniuses, who I envy, by the way.

242
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,660
But number one, you've got to remember that by definition,

243
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,460
a subgenius preacher has not only the right, but the obligation, dear friends,

244
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,720
to make severe and even tragic mistakes.

245
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:26,260
Now, look at the rival cults, some of your local Christian denominations, let's say,

246
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,860
that preach total goodness and perfection.

247
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,400
They live, friends, in a false religion.

248
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,800
They live in a false, dangerous fantasy world.

249
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,640
And when they show their humanity, as Jim and Tammy Baker did,

250
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,380
oh, they're castigated by their people.

251
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,280
They're fired off their jobs.

252
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,340
And they sure look stupid.

253
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,920
They make Christianity look even stupider to the average American,

254
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,340
which is okay with me.

255
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,780
But in their smug, self-deluding pride, friends,

256
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,360
they set goals that are not only impossible, but actually ridiculously unnecessary.

257
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,360
And when they can't attain those goals, then they just get more fanatical

258
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,760
and can't admit that they couldn't cut what they set up for themselves.

259
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,240
And their people are so strung out between constant states of false happiness or guilt.

260
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,420
I don't know.

261
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,000
We now know that Jim and Tammy, for all those years, were actually only acting happy.

262
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,340
But living that lie just compounded their misery.

263
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,280
And millions of people do this.

264
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,500
They do this to themselves because they think God is as ignorant, intolerant, and insecure as they are.

265
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,760
But then that's their idea of wisdom and goodness, I guess.

266
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,180
Hiding their real feelings.

267
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,980
Living a lie.

268
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,920
Deliberately short-circuiting their instincts.

269
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,940
Pretending.

270
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,760
That's what they do.

271
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,900
They're pretending, friends.

272
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Now, you can accuse the subgeniuses of pretending.

273
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,220
But, you know, in a way, they pretend much, much worse than we do.

274
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,840
So, when I come on the air and sound like a vindictive jerk,

275
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,000
remember that at least I'm being honest.

276
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,460
If I'm beat, worn out, I don't take speed like Tammy Baker to pretend that I've got superhuman energy.

277
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,320
I act like I feel.

278
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:18,460
I prove beyond a doubt that I can be just as overextended, overwrought, insensitive, and incoherent as any of you.

279
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,880
And yet, even with all these personality flaws, weaknesses, and staccato speech patterns,

280
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,080
yet I know that Bob gives me an excuse.

281
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,360
He doesn't need to forgive me because...

282
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,620
I didn't do anything evil.

283
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,080
I screwed up.

284
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,760
And Bob...

285
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,520
Bob loves me for that.

286
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,420
It's the power to fail, friends.

287
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,060
It's the power that the subgenius popes have and these rival popes can't ever have.

288
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:44,940
And...

289
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,620
The irony, friends.

290
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,200
The irony.

291
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,760
It's like with the pledge drives.

292
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,240
The Hour of Slack listeners are 50% paid up right now.

293
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,260
Probably more by now.

294
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,940
But yet...

295
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,360
Now, those gospel folks, they pledged and pledged.

296
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,120
They pledged and pledged because they were so full of faith.

297
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:09,420
And only 10%, at best, in some cases 6%, bothered to fulfill the commitment.

298
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,580
Because in Christianity, pretending and promising is good enough.

299
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,640
And that's what faith means, friends.

300
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,980
It means you've decided to be satisfied no matter what.

301
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,740
Because you're going to pretend everything's okay.

302
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,600
Oh, it's God's will.

303
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,800
So therefore, you don't have to do anything about it.

304
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,460
Leave it.

305
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,980
Leave it to God, dear friends.

306
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,180
Grace through faith, not works.

307
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,920
Jesus said, be like children.

308
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,140
And, you know, Tammy can't go to bed with her husband without taking off...

309
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,180
Without keeping her fake eyelashes, her bat-wing size fake eyelashes on.

310
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,300
I read that in the paper today.

311
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,840
That's how you keep your husband.

312
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,340
Wear makeup to bed.

313
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,980
Pretending, friends.

314
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,640
Yeah, they're like children, all right.

315
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,380
But they're like seventh grade children.

316
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,580
Cruel, gossiping liars and bullies.

317
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,340
That roam in cliques and packs looking for weak, unsuspecting minority victims.

318
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,160
Oh, they have faith, all right.

319
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,640
Faith that any nasty thing they do didn't count if God forgave it in their head.

320
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,340
And if you're having the kind of fun they can't experience, then you must...

321
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,180
That must be sin.

322
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,600
Because in their eyes, friends, slack is the ultimate sin.

323
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,560
The devil hates slack, too.

324
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:26,100
And when you look at the basic beliefs and behavior of a lot of these fundamentalist Christians,

325
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,680
they have a lot in common with the devil, friends.

326
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,160
A whole lot more in common with the devil than Jesus.

327
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,460
Now, subgenius is rationalized, too.

328
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:40,600
But our rationalization is so absurd that it allows us, the slack, to remember that it's just a rationalization.

329
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,240
And there's still work to do.

330
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,520
Praise Bob.

331
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,760
Oh, God.

332
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,200
Here's this Tammy Baker interview.

333
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:56,080
Yes, she rarely goes to bed without her makeup, swears by her false eyelashes, and wears different wigs for her husband, Jesus.

334
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,300
Jim.

335
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,380
And that still wasn't good enough, was it?

336
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,620
No, Jessica...

337
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,760
Jessica Hahn, she didn't have to change wigs every night.

338
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,740
Jim very seldom seen me without makeup and hardly ever in my life without my eyelashes.

339
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,520
I think every woman ought to wear eyelashes.

340
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,380
Yeah, I think natural-born eyelashes are kind of good, too.

341
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,400
They keep the water out of your eyes.

342
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,400
The sweat.

343
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,520
If you're inhuman enough to sweat, unlike Miss Tammy...

344
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,540
Um...

345
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,580
Oh, God.

346
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,760
Well, I've got more of that rant to go on.

347
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
In the meantime, until then...

348
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:43,360
And let me tell you, friends, it's not just the swelling coffers of the elder bankers.

349
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:52,840
It's not just the truncated attention spans of the conspiracy glorbs scrambling to get that ever-elusive status symbol.

350
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,060
It's not just the vapid shells of the chicken-like...

351
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,300
...chicken-like models posing on cue.

352
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,880
It's not just the puppet rock idols playing into the hands of the hell-spawned image consultants.

353
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,560
It's not just the cannibal zombies gorging themselves on self-interest.

354
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,760
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual sludge.

355
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,140
It's not just the mellow morons stuck in a time zone from the good old days, man.

356
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,220
It's not just the aerobic airheads working themselves into a cardiac arrest.

357
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,960
It's not just the talentless pinks hooked into a groove devoid of style-less.

358
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,360
It's not just the fuzzy dice brains rampaging like the Visigoths.

359
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,720
It's not just the misguided gummy space creatures.

360
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,460
It's not just the oppression of the raging slabs of the lame leftists.

361
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,860
It's not just the frothy mouths of the reactionaries.

362
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,540
It's not just the blank food tubes slamming their craniums against the walls of their own creation.

363
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,340
It's not just the empty youth culture borrowing from the ABC computerized format of possible personas.

364
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,380
It's that and a whole lot more.

365
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,040
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

366
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,400
And thank you, Cecilia.

367
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,220
Let's join us now, shall we?

368
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,060
Yes, join us at the ankles and hips.

369
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,740
Thank you.

370
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,880
Now we're ready to hop off to our special sky ride.

371
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,780
The Japanese...

372
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,520
Don't you wish you were with us?

373
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,320
Well, send in your money and maybe someday you can.

374
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,320
No, really, we're a fun crowd.

375
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,440
You'd like us to move in next door to you.

376
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,660
To you, we'd be indistinguishable from the others you might see in your town.

377
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,180
Oh, maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eye or a smile or a leer on our lips,

378
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,440
but otherwise we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchpail.

379
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,160
A good, solid, honest, cream-colored working man,

380
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,640
ready to move in next to you and send the property values soaring.

381
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,800
How about it, America? Get in step.

382
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,460
Well, let's try now, huh?

383
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,540
For a typewritten transcript of this show, you'd have to be...

384
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,700
What's going on? I feel so sneaky!

385
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,320
Disobedient to parents, a subgenius.

386
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,260
Steals, a subgenius.

387
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,760
Lies, a subgenius.

388
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,620
Hater of God, a subgenius.

389
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,020
Whisperer.

390
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,320
A subgenius.

391
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,500
Whoremonger.

392
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,620
A subgenius.

393
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,520
Envious.

394
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,060
A subgenius.

395
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,980
Pride.

396
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,640
A subgenius.

397
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,940
A backbiter.

398
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,360
A subgenius.

399
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,900
A deceitful person.

400
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,120
A subgenius.

401
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,740
A hypocrite.

402
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,860
A subgenius.

403
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,260
Unmerciful.

404
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,640
A subplenius.

405
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,200
A false accuser.

406
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,280
A subpenius.

407
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,420
Well, I guess that about wraps it up. That's your typical subgenius now.

408
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,540
Monk, I don't need Dobbs. There's nothing wrong with me.

409
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,580
I'll make it my way.

410
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,920
Oh, good.

411
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,240
I must have been insane.

412
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,140
What can I say? I'm lost without Dobbs.

413
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,860
Without Bob, I'm guilty.

414
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,280
Guilty.

415
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,680
Be not deceived.

416
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,560
Dobbs is not mocked, though whosoever a man soeth.

417
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,520
Him also shall he reap.

418
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,420
Who is my shepherd? I shall not want.

419
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,320
That's right, dear friends. That's right.

420
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,300
Uh, thank you, Reverend Howe.

421
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,100
This is Jester Jackson of the Rainbow Coalition.

422
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,200
It concerns me that the American people have been lied to.

423
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,940
Lied to about the secret war in Central America.

424
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,600
Lied to about your support for racist South Africa.

425
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,860
Our government should be funding cities and housing the homeless,

426
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,720
not supporting fascism and waging illegal wars.

427
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,160
Join me in a march on Saturday, April 25th, in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.

428
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,420
Help forge a new direction for justice and peace in Central America and Southern Africa.

429
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,980
March in a big way and in big numbers on April 25th.

430
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,660
I hate that old conspiracy as much as it hates me.

431
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,380
But me and Bob will get them.

432
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,180
Just you wait and see.

433
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,860
For as long as they have run things, they have turned them into...

434
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,120
Bob?

435
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,820
The time has come to get them back. Here's how I look at it.

436
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,840
That conspiracy is nasty and they take it for their patsies.

437
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,220
But we know that they are just a bunch of queers.

438
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,520
And when we defeat them, we'll be free.

439
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,360
We'll kill them and we'll eat them.

440
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,800
And then we'll go and get ourselves some beers.

441
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,320
Now Bob has come to fight them.

442
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,680
That's how we know we'll win.

443
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,380
And we know to serve them is our only sin.

444
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
We won't have long to wait now.

445
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,260
The end is coming soon.

446
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,160
We'll march happy toward the future, cause we did what we must do.

447
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,680
Underwater vacations.

448
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,040
Bob will rule all the nations.

449
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,780
We'll be farming vegetation out on Mars.

450
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,420
Cause we killed them and we ate them.

451
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,780
Said, boy, we sure did hate them.

452
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,280
And then we made the rounds of all the bars.

453
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,860
Thank you, Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

454
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,600
Great stuff.

455
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,360
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?

456
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,340
You're going to make fun of religion stuff, right?

457
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,940
We never make fun of religion.

458
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,100
You must understand we're making money off religion, but not fun of religion.

459
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,980
No. No. No. No fun.

460
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,200
We hope to erase the slack area in this part of the country.

461
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,600
And hopefully we'll...

462
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,520
Yeah, sorry.

463
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,440
Really now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks or do you have...

464
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,340
Mr. Willis, isn't it a fact, really, that...

465
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,820
that you've invented this whole thing,

466
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,420
that you've thought up all these little gimmicks,

467
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,120
and you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people by getting money out of them?

468
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,740
People who believe in you and your silly preachings?

469
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,260
No, it isn't, Joe.

470
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,860
The Illuminati will be unmasked.

471
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,180
And the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with that.

472
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,260
Bob is going to see that the whole conspiracy, the Illuminati, the trilaterals, the...

473
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,520
you name it.

474
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,140
The guys that drive up and down the streets selling ice cream.

475
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,020
That whole...

476
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,760
All of that will be exposed.

477
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,680
That's what America needs.

478
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,320
To have their brains washed.

479
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,180
Clean out all that filth and all that garbage and all that fear

480
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,340
and all that sickness and perversion and all that junk that comes from the pit of hell.

481
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,020
...radio announcer and many friends of the rail land.

482
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,900
It's the old-fashioned healing broadcast coming direct from the auditorium here in Dallas.

483
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,940
This is a special night tonight.

484
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,060
This is oil night.

485
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,400
Would you love to have a heart like God?

486
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,400
Come out and be anointed with this miracle oil

487
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,620
that God has let me use for quite a few years now.

488
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,120
And we're giving it out.

489
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,700
Come and join the hundreds of people.

490
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,640
Bring that bottle and get some of this miracle oil that's absolutely raised the dead.

491
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,060
That's performed some of the greatest miracles.

492
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,760
You name it.

493
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,200
It's performed every known miracle that's happening.

494
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,580
But look, it's...

495
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,300
No, Hal, look out!

496
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,520
You clumsy fool!

497
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
What have you done?

498
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,380
The show is ruined!

499
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,240
Ruined!

500
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,560
Goodbye for all of us here.

501
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,780
This is Puzzle Inn. It's the love of your tracks.

502
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,500
Reverend Hal and Reverend Irv.

503
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,120
We tried.

504
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,960
Saying it's too late.

505
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,680
And we tried.

506
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,920
Goodbye, folks. I don't know how it works!

507
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,900
The whole thing's ridiculous.

508
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:34,660
The U.S. Customs Service is waging war on drug smugglers, and you can help.

509
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,580
If you see any unusual activity involving private boats or planes that might be connected to drug smuggling,

510
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,280
call the U.S. Customs Service.

511
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,440
24 hours a day, toll free, at 1-800-BE-ALERT.

512
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:53,660
You can remain anonymous, and you could receive a cash reward if your information leads to the arrest and prosecution of drug smugglers.

513
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,540
Help stop drug smuggling.

514
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,960
Call 1-800-BE-ALERT.

515
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,460
I can't believe they gave me that cart to play on this show, honest to God.

516
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,920
Well, if you want to get...

517
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,320
If you want to be damned by Bob...

518
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,340
...you're better off going to the police.

519
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:31,360
Now, let's talk about another man who's been spiritually trying to control you.

520
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,040
Do you think that freedom for this great society, this great planet, is voting?

521
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,280
Say no.

522
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:39,840
No!

523
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,080
Didn't they get to vote in Haiti? Say yes.

524
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,440
Didn't they get to vote in the Philippines?

525
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,860
Don't they get to vote in Poland? Say yes.

526
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,880
So did they get to vote?

527
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,160
You think they're going to plug out labor when there's only one man in the East? Say no.

528
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,520
But the rest of the world perceives as freedom as consumer goods.

529
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,640
More specifically, American consumer goods.

530
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,540
And children, we're drowning in consumer goods.

531
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,120
We're drowning in them.

532
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,980
But children, when you hear the 501 blues and your heart stings,

533
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,740
when you see Spud McKenzie, then high concept is getting inside of you, children.

534
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,880
It's getting inside of you. Now I know you're all artists, you're all hip, you're all aware.

535
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,740
You're a bunch of deconstructing thieves. I know that, children.

536
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,600
I know you can sit there and watch those ads and you can say,

537
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,840
Look at that jump cut. Look at that computer animation.

538
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,460
Look at that keyboard.

539
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,900
And you think by deconstructing it, you kept the message from getting into you.

540
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,740
But I'm going to tell you something, children. I'm right here to tell you that.

541
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,760
We are not that sort.

542
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,100
That's right, children. We're not that goddamn sort.

543
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,720
We are not able to resist those messages.

544
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,100
They get inside of us. They work it up.

545
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,660
And before you know it, you're another mind-death-dude.

546
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,060
I'll the conspiracy. I'm going to give you another example, children.

547
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,340
They say that in the NFL, between steroids and weightlifting,

548
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:16,360
football players can run so big and so fast that the human body can no longer sustain the impact they generate.

549
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,740
And the same thing is true by analyzing, by identifying metaphor.

550
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,840
In the world of advertising, the images they generate are so slick, we can no longer resist.

551
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,560
We cannot retain our will. We cannot make a specific judgment.

552
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,660
We cannot simply act the way I say. That's right, children. We're not that goddamn sort.

553
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,240
We are not able to resist those messages.

554
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,620
They get inside of us. They work it up.

555
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,160
And before you know it, you're another mind-death-dude.

556
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,520
I'll the conspiracy. I'm going to give you another example, children.

557
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,820
They say that in the NFL, between steroids and weightlifting,

558
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:58,800
football players can run so big and so fast that the human body can no longer sustain the impact they generate.

559
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,220
And the same thing is true by analyzing, by identifying metaphor.

560
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,040
In the world of advertising, the images they generate are so slick, we can no longer sustain the impact they generate.

561
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,300
They are so slick, we can no longer resist.

562
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,000
We cannot retain our will. We cannot make a specific judgment.

563
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,320
We cannot simply act the way I say. That's right, children.

564
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,360
Oh, boy. I have to cut in here.

565
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,940
Oh, that was Pope David Meyer two weeks ago in Boston, Massachusetts.

566
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,200
Pretty soon I ought to have a better recording of that, all the rants from there.

567
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,640
Janer was there, a whole bunch of good stuff.

568
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,860
Anyway, I had to cut in because the Will of Doves just got a call from someone who said that they had,

569
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,000
called the Cult Awareness group.

570
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,320
There's a group here in Dallas called Cult Awareness,

571
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,940
and had called them up just to see what they would say about the Church of the Subgenius.

572
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:52,120
And they told, the funny thing is that I, when they first opened, I called them up and said,

573
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,700
Yeah, I'm kind of concerned about these insane cults myself,

574
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,940
and I thought I'd send you some of our material so you could, you know, you can refer people to us.

575
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,840
And they apparently said,

576
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:04,840


577
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,960
Well, they didn't like the material I sent. I'd never heard from them since then.

578
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,200
But they're now telling people, whatever you do, stay away from those guys.

579
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,780
That subgenius guy, man, that's the worst, I guess.

580
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,980
And especially what, keep your kids away from them?

581
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:23,480
Especially keep your kids away from the Church of the Subgenius because of the sexually explicit material.

582
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,300
Now see, y'all that only listen to the radio show, you don't know what,

583
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,280
you don't know what you're missing.

584
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,840
And who don't order the tapes.

585
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,440
But I can't advertise that stuff.

586
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:47,000
And all you can really do is write for information from P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214

587
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,580
for more information about Church of the Subgenius.

588
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,280
And for that sexually explicit material, which you don't get for free, by the way.

589
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,020
Not like, I mean, you get this radio show for free and get our information for free.

590
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,900
And it's not very sexually explicit.

591
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:12,800
But like I say, you, those of you who've been putting off writing to P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas 75214,

592
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,480
fine, I don't care.

593
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,440
Honestly, I really don't.

594
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,680
I always end up getting the last laugh, dear friends.

595
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,660
I have total confidence that that will continue to be true.

596
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,940
So, you know, I can't tell you what the deal is with the money.

597
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,600
But...

598
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,900
Gotta get some money.

599
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:37,340
That dirty, perky, shark-backed, black-and-wharton, filibuster-bottom, perky-oomah...

600
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,440
Only we know what we don't know.

601
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,960
And when we do know it, we shall find out later just exactly what it was that we didn't know.

602
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:56,780
But in the meantime, we shall experiment further and delve into the deeper recesses of the human mind

603
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,860
to find out exactly what causes this...

604
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,520
device not to function properly.

605
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,300
Could it be a malfunction of the foot gland?

606
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,080
Or the nose gland?

607
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:15,800
Yes, possibly you did not know that the nose and the feet are true glands of the human body.

608
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:22,100
And only after permanent foot and nose glandscaping

609
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,160
can you know how to make your feet smell and your nose run.

610
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,980
Which would mean...

611
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,840
possibly...

612
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,880
that you were...

613
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,980
backwards...

614
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,740
or...

615
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,240
built upside down.

616
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,100
But...

617
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,220
you'll delve further into that...

618
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,840
at the end of the broadcast...

619
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,660
when you and I cannot hear each other.

620
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,640
Oh, that was Dr. Philo Drummond, dear friends.

621
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,920
And we can get into this too.

622
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,800
This psychoneurotic mastosurgery.

623
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:58,640
The techniques of which has been developed by the many great doctors who have come over

624
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,800
to Dobbs and...

625
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,280
from...

626
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,760
from many of the other religious cults around the world.

627
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,660
I ain't been the same since I had my frontal lobotomy.

628
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,860
And it's...

629
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:12,300
we've got Europeans and Lithuanians and ice doctors and the big doctors and the doctors

630
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,280
of the trees and the tree-walking brain socket doctors.

631
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,900
We've got a song about doctors.

632
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,020
And here...

633
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,340
hyperclites...

634
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,560
here it is.

635
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,040
Dr. Philo Drummond.

636
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,240
Dr. Philo Drummond.

637
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,300
Dr. Philo Drummond.

638
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,400
Dr. Philo Drummond.

639
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,700
Dr. Philo Drummond.

640
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,740


641
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,380
Dr. Philo Drummond.

642
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,320
Dr. Philo Drummond.

643
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,780
Dr. Philo Drummond.

644
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,340
Dr. Philo Drummond.

645
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,240
Dr. Philo Drummond.

646
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,820
Dr. Philo Drummond.

647
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,260
Dr. Philo Drummond.

648
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,060
Dr. Philo Drummond.

649
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,060


650
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,400
Dr. Philo, philosophy, man.

651
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,400


652
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,400


653
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,400


654
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,860
Mm-hmm, yeah.

655
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,300
Oh, you know what that is?

656
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,020
Oh!

657
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,720
Textbooks!

658
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


659
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,300
Words?

660
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:50,760
Yeah, quotes are dr.

661
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,260
Philo Drummond.

662
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,380
You calling for them?

663
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,040
Yeah, Dr. Philo Drummond.

664
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,040


665
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,040


666
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,040


667
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,020
Well, there's a line down here.

668
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,520
It's from...

669
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,940
Some of you are going to get mad at me.

670
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,920
Jesus ain't in the church.

671
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,580
Don't turn the radio off. Keep it on.

672
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,620
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state is Antichrist.

673
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,100
But I'm telling you that preparations are being made.

674
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,620
And that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

675
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,660
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

676
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:37,880
There will be a day not in the too far distant future in which Antichrist will be revealed.

677
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,060
And the mark of the beast will be introduced.

678
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:46,360
And people will have a number in their hand and in their forehead.

679
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,260
They'll be given a computerized number, if you please,

680
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,600
that will entitle them to do business in this world.

681
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,000
And with Antichrist, you can starve.

682
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,540
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

683
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,100
Boy, you aren't kidding.

684
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,420
And that's the way I've felt for quite a while.

685
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,580
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

686
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,400
Ah, you bet, honey.

687
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,300
That's what we're going to try to do.

688
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,220
I have never flown a city before.

689
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,880
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

690
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,640
I think they'll pass the $10 bridge when they come.

691
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,900
The original concept was that throughout history,

692
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,980
all great geniuses had somebody at their side that was kind of steering them.

693
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,800
You know what I mean?

694
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,080
So you say that person is a subgenius.

695
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,960
That was the subgenius. He was the guy that was really...

696
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,460
He was making sure the genius was used to his proper potential.

697
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,100
Right.

698
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,120
And for the right reasons.

699
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,300
That's why the name is misleading, you know.

700
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:02,440
Now, I want you to hear a little of the service where the Holy Spirit was using me with the gift of discernment.

701
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,620
I was ministering in the Spirit.

702
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,500
God was showing me things about people I didn't know, I'd never seen before, but the Lord was talking to me.

703
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,440
God was talking, and I was walking.

704
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,380
Listen to a little of this right now.

705
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,160
And you have come to the end of your rope.

706
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,540
You don't know which way to turn.

707
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,620
Give me money!

708
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,800
It's starting to affect your nerves.

709
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,280
Give me my money!

710
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,540
And sleepless nights.

711
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:25,600


712
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,820
I want to kill my husband.

713
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,980
I want to kill my husband.

714
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,580
I want to kill my husband.

715
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,100
That's right.

716
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,480
That's right.

717
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,340
Please save my life.

718
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,580
Save my life!

719
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,960
Ha ha!

720
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:47,700


721
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,720
Ha ha!

722
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,620
Ha ha!

723
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,760
The future of your usefulness to us brought to you in living simulbursts.

This is so background.

750
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,680
This information is true, but it was incorporate bhajna dressed in a anti-traumatic clothes before the fact of the redemptionaby.

751
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,180
I'm super skeptical that I don't have to sue You that with a problem.

752
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,820
General I'm from small rev.

753
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:28,860
As mentioned before, however foolish it may sound, the subgenius foot doubles as a gland, and a very complex gland at that.

754
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,600
Don't you want to be treated the way you need to be treated?

755
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:39,660
It treats you the way you need to be treated by intuiting the world around you so subtly that you rarely notice its machinations.

756
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:48,020
It was discovered by Dr. Philo Drummond, and he best explained its functioning in this excerpt from his daily radio show, On the Road,

757
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,140
so named because it is simply recorded in a car.

758
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,720
Or money.

759
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,180
Self-worth.

760
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,360
Or money.

761
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,280
To love people because they need it.

762
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,800
Or their money.

763
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,180
I believe it's something God puts in us.

764
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,580
Or what else does God put in us? I wish he'd give us some money, huh?

765
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,060
Yeah, I want some money.

766
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,420
Oh, we could truly know nothing only.

767
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,000
Reinforcing the powers of the mind.

768
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,100
The brain and foot gland is a small secondary brain at the base of the subgenius spine.

769
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,980
The mighty stegosaurus also possessed this organ, which made it tweet like a bird.

770
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,880
It helped it direct the reproductive and eliminative systems that are so important to us.

771
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,360
Another gland unknown to normals is the peen gland in the brain,

772
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:44,920
which regulates the eight separate stages or character generations through which the subgenius personality evolves during an average day.

773
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,560
Literally eight different personalities.

774
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,540
Each have control at the jessie helm of behavior at varying intervals.

775
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,960
We each contain eight people in our corrugated, rugated subconsciousness.

776
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,900
The actual average human has but four.

777
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,660
Good, bad, bland, and asleep.

778
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,860
The last thought by some scholars to overpower the others for up to 18 hours a day.

779
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:16,120
These different personalities account for the compartmentalization of the subgenius brain into eight distinct units or efficiencies in the descending order of control.

780
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,980
First the left brain.

781
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:24,680
The peen brain, which controls paranoia, anal compulsion, overwork, trying too hard, and thinking too much.

782
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,060
Then the north brain.

783
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,520
The make brain or take brain.

784
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,840
It handles jobs and money.

785
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,940
The south brain.

786
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:36,060
The fake brain or talk brain, which covers the gray and limbic areas of speech, writing, and lying.

787
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,560
Then the hind brain.

788
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,720
The me brain.

789
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,320
The pivotal center brain.

790
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,900
The private you rides piggyback on the lord and is infected by drugs or religion.

791
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,340
Bob comes in on this channel.

792
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,900
Then the forebrain.

793
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:53,080
The sane brain, which covers love, friendship, traditional family values called by some the tame brain.

794
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,320
The inner brain, or sex brain, is self-explanatory.

795
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:06,020
Finally, the right brain, or lame brain, or more brain, depending on your orientation, intuitive, art, music, drug, addiction.

796
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,700
And the eighth brain, the outer brain, is a pseudo-physical shell.

797
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,960
Incasing not only the other brains, but the entire brain.

798
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:17,960


799
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:25,800
body. This diffuse brain, larger but far less controllable than the others, is the nental life.

800
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:34,740
The nental life represents fully half of our brain power, but because it is so independent from us,

801
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,360
we can rarely make use of it. Occasionally, a subgenius comes along whose nental life is

802
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:47,520
incorporated into his thinking processes. Such less subgeniuses were Da Vinci, Einstein, and

803
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,280
Curly Howard. For most of us, however, the nental life is a separate entity, a semi-conscious

804
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,600
ghost twin which mindlessly follows the physical vessel about, but remains dormant throughout

805
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,680
most of our lives.

806
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:37,320
Something's pretty clear. Every one's a Bolivian here. And there's almost nothing to fear.

807
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:45,060
Because we got everything we want right here.

808
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,160
We got great big heaping buckets of Bolivian here.

809
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:59,440
And Bob Don brought us here.

810
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,280
Yeah, we're singing a praise to Bob.

811
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,580
Because he's done the math.

812
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,480
He's done the math.

813
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,180
Because I'm slopped up and silly, like a rip-headed slob.

814
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:33,780
And all I got to thank is Bob and Ivan Stagg.

815
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,820
And all I got to thank is Bob and Dr. Do.

816
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,800
And all I got to thank is Bob and everybody.

817
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,680
You can trust me.

818
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,800
I'm Dr. Ivan Stagg.

819
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,240
And I'm prepared to take your money and give you back your slot.

820
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,640
So you can believe in me.

821
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,240
I'm Ivan Stagg.

822
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,980
I never lie.

823
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,160
And I'm always right.

824
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,000
It extends throughout the universe.

825
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,420
It has to do with the universe.

826
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,500
It has to do with glass.

827
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,180
It has to do with the greatest.

828
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,140
It has to do with the public evidence.

829
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,780
It has to do with the Gelligan's Island.

830
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,460
It has to do with the Gelligan's Island.

831
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,680
It has to do with the doctor.

832
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,040
It has to do with Gary Eckler.

833
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,420
It has to do with the 10-minute luck plane.

834
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,380
It has to do with the Oglala cast over for me.

835
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,960
It has to do with the Gelligan's Island.

836
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,600
It has to do with the Gelligan's Island.

837
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,080
Oh, yes.

838
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,920
Yes, yes, dear friends.

839
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,600
Well, we're coming down, getting sort of close to the end of the hour there.

840
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,180
And I'm going to continue talking about the aspects of preachers going crazy.

841
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,660
On the radio, specifically here on the Hour of Slack, a couple of weeks ago.

842
00:46:51,840 --> 00:47:00,020
Now, you have to understand, friends, that being a jerk, that's my outlet for artistic, I mean, religious expression.

843
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:11,180
After all, most preachers utilize the techniques of presumptuousness, orneriness, corniness, and a sort of posed intolerance.

844
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,180
And I also use stupidity and especially cantankerousness.

845
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:25,940
I can't really, you know, I can't relax unless I'm being cantankerous and inflicting my personal bile and spleen on others.

846
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,480
It's hate, dear friends.

847
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,020
And you wouldn't interfere with my right to hate to do my own thing, now would you?

848
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,040
This is a free country.

849
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,280
And besides, how can you, since I'm the one that's transmitting and you're only receiving?

850
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,240
Only receiving, friends.

851
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,900
Does that insult you, like last time?

852
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,440
Well, good.

853
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,700
That shows that I'm succeeding in doing.

854
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:53,780
Bob's assignment of getting you to stop letting the conspiracy, or even subgenius preachers, push you around.

855
00:47:54,060 --> 00:48:01,940
This obscure church would be the next Inquisition, where I'm not constantly training you through applied obnoxiousness

856
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:07,160
to be in a continuous state of not merely defensiveness, but outright rebellion.

857
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,820
And if you let me get any more abusive, I'll have to kill you.

858
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,120
Because you'll deserve it.

859
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,400
It's like, I'm like an anti-role model.

860
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,660
That's what most subgenius...

861
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,040
Also,

862
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,440
Most subgeniuses should be anti-role models.

863
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:25,640
Besides, how dare you criticize the judgments meted out by King Stang?

864
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:32,100
You mock my total disregard for the broadcast niceties.

865
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,740
Oh, but have you thought about your soul?

866
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,280
Have you even got a girlfriend yet, huh?

867
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,280
Oh, my jibes have but barely begun.

868
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:46,180
I could rant a paragraph to you that would have every one of you listeners jumping off a high bridge

869
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,140
to escape the mocking truth wielded by my tongue.

870
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,200
Or Jane's.

871
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,380
Now, I didn't start out this way, nay.

872
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,760
I was a gentle man at one time.

873
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,520
But I've undergone teasings by the blackest minds of our generation.

874
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,480
If I can take it from the likes of Lies and G. Gordon Gordon,

875
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,920
then you'd best urinate in fear at the thought of what I could dish out to you on the radio.

876
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,120
To the innocent and guilty alike.

877
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,960
For, as my mentor, Dr. Drummond, told me,

878
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,820
none are so blind as those who have no eyes.

879
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,820
He who dares to mock King Stang and rouse him from his torpid reveries and clairvoyant visions

880
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:29,880
hath played out but the first move in a galactic game

881
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,560
on which hinges the very fate of this physical universe itself.

882
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,260
Congratulations, dear friends.

883
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,120
You've now entered kindergarten in the School of Terror.

884
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,020
Oh, don't worry. It won't kill you.

885
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,620
Indeed, it'll actually help you to keep your intelligence from decreasing.

886
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,240
At the same pace as your peers.

887
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,580
But, uh, but at what cost, dear listener?

888
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,080
At what cost?

889
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,500
At what cost?

890
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,260
Oh, I'm well aware of all your plans to assassinate me.

891
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,400
Oh, surprise you, nay.

892
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,880
Yes, I can see far, far more than you think.

893
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,340
More than you could ever imagine in your wildest LSD dreams.

894
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,780
Fine! Go ahead! Kill me!

895
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,360
You would-be Judases and Luthers!

896
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,760
Make your...

897
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,800
Your blindingly imbecilic move!

898
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:23,220
Your mere human attempt to wrest controls from the claws of this...

899
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,720
Stang demon you hallucinate!

900
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,120
Death would be but a step up in my ascension to ultimate power!

901
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,500
Next to Bob, of course.

902
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,080
And have you not guessed that certain contingency plans have been laid?

903
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,560
Thinketh you not of the children of the Stang?

904
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,720
Oh, I've read my Frank Herbert closely.

905
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,780
The Atreides conspiracy is but a high school prank!

906
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,480
Compared to the all-reaching arms of the Stang octopus.

907
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:56,080
Oh, your science fiction has ill-prepared you for the next generation of the Stang Ones.

908
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:01,460
What to your undiscerning ears is but a lively boy of seven and a sweet little girl of six

909
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:07,240
have undergone since birth certain forbidden training regimens which will render all your weapons,

910
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:12,620
all your propaganda, and all your mental hexes impotent! Utterly impotent!

911
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,760
Kill Stang One and...

912
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:21,320
The Emperor Xandar is unchained and at that point you can kiss your world, your human society,

913
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,280
your innocent subgenius church goodbye forever.

914
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:30,120
Or perhaps if by some accident of God the Emperor Xandar were eliminated,

915
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,760
oh, then you would face the Tev one.

916
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,900
And do you think they're my only offspring?

917
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,000
Have you fools never watched a Star Wars movie?

918
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:42,920
Just as Darth Vader's son Luke was kept from knowing of his own sister's existence,

919
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,700
do you think that...

920
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,840
that, um, I, the Darth Vader of Dallas, have shown all my cards?

921
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,880
Oh, no indeed, dear friends, no indeedy, I say.

922
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,580
But you'll see.

923
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,880
Well, stay tuned for, uh, Ron Lindsey.

924
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:09,160
You've been listening to King Stang, ultimate stud groupie attractor and mystic psychic power monger,

925
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,960
the very left brain of Dobbs, the chosen bringer, dear friends of terror,

926
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:20,960
and lawsuits, owner of the trademark of God on Earth, slayer of would-be scribe ship usurpers,

927
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,420
subjector of all bobbies, decider of degrees of fame of subgenius mortals,

928
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:32,140
second chosen of the fishers of wallets, biggest-organed and sexiest-voiced entrapper of radio groupies,

929
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,900
subduer of hecklers, butt-splitter of moonies, exploiter of comedic idiot savants,

930
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,060
master of the sardonic over-the-cute, violator of postal...

931
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,060
Oh, forget it.

932
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,800
Anyway, okay, okay.

933
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,580
Don't rush me. Stop, stop, stop.

934
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,420
Sister Chris asked me to come down here for an experiment.

935
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,660
She asked me to listen to the Church of the Subgenius cassette and, and...

936
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,300
I don't know, she said something like she wanted a normal reaction.

937
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,160
Well, that didn't sound normal to me.

938
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,060
At least it won't sound like a church.

939
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,800
I mean, aren't churches supposed to be quiet and not really boring?

940
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,920
I mean, I could hardly understand what went on there.

941
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,380
I mean, was it meant to be funny or what?

942
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,580
I mean, come on. Tell me. Is it serious?

943
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,300
Like, you know, do you have to...

944
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,420
Are they telling you to stop listening to Top 40,

945
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,720
give up things like watching Dynasty or eating Haagen-Dazs

946
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,620
or maybe shopping at home from an Esprit catalog?

947
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,060
What? Huh?

948
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,580
What are you trying to say? What is this note?

949
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:35,860
Listen, stupid, stop babbling or I'll ship you to Dallas with a sign saying,

950
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,260
U.S. Grade A conspiracy dupe across your forehead.

951
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,080
Hey, I don't know what that means,

952
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,780
but, but I don't like your attitude.

953
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,740
Okay? I mean, like, just, you, you asked me to come here and I mean,

954
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,660
why did you even ask me, what?

955
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,480
Just, just sit over there, okay?

956
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,120
You try and experiment down here and it just doesn't work.

957
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:08,480
You, you try to bring an opposing viewpoint, somewhat of a rebuttal and, uh,

958
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,220
you never can tell.

959
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:13,000
This is Sister Chris here. It's 1233.

960
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,980
It's not 1233. It's two minutes till midnight.

961
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,600
Four minutes till something like that.

962
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:28,460
And this is K-N-O-N 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

963
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,920
And you cannot leave either.

964
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,340
No, we're here.

965
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,780
Woof, woof.

966
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,080
No, we're here.

967
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,860
The Muslim film presents Ben Franklin,

968
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,500
Hero for Hopping.

969
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:51,300
I wanted the woods and the Indians to sleep with me.

970
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,640
But I was afraid of the cold and made them sleep outside.

971
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:01,480
So I never felt the touch of a warm, naked Indian or,

972
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,360
or in a cold, naked forest.

973
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,640
Ben Franklin,

974
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,240
the only president of the United States,

975
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,420
who was never president of the United States.

976
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,520
Was he an early drug user?

977
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:18,960
Let's see.

978
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,120
He wrote of it in Poor Dick's Conspiracy in 1761,

979
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,440
while still an apprentice book baker in colonial Philadelphia.

980
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,560
So, I betook me to the Hashfire Inn for a secret caucus of the hotheads,

981
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,180
rebellious libertines all, lusting for life and liberty.

982
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,040
The real George Washington brought the hemp,

983
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,840
and all the evening gators.

984
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,080
We quickly proceeded to get slain of the angels,

985
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,700
and young Tom Everson goodly stretched by the hemp,

986
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,700
which smoked us all like Boston's scrot.

987
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,200
What a fetid fervor of freedom.

988
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,780
I say, let's have a revolution.

989
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,740
Sam the tax collector.

990
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,020
To which Big Ben replied,

991
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,160
Fine Sam, then we can invite over a bunch of immigrants and make cars.

992
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,240
Yes, 1761,

993
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,220
Hemp kindled the fires of American history.

994
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,060
Never give me clockwork films.

995
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,800
And old toilet books.

996
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,260
And old toilet history.

997
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,480
And old toilet books.

998
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,480
And old toilet history.

999
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,360
Oh, yes dear friends,

1000
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,880
you've been listening to the Hour of Slack radio ministry

1001
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,020
produced by the Church of the Subgenius.

1002
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,680
As I said, this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1003
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,380
Stay tuned for Down Memory Lane with Ron Lindsey.

1004
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,720
And this is your host,

1005
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:52,820
King,

1006
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,040
Pope,

1007
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:54,680
Killer,

1008
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,400
Reverend Ivan Stang,

1009
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,120
arbiter of hipness

1010
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,420
down-putter of talk show hosts

1011
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,920
and my mighty glibness

1012
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,180
son of the king of bull shatterers

1013
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,640
he who hath been copied

1014
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,280
by David Byrne and Garrison Keillor

1015
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,360
payer of royalty checks

1016
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,880
to type running buddies

1017
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,780
contract signer of all paying subgenius projects

1018
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,000
president of the corporation of all Dobbs PR

1019
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,600
48% owner of the Janer tongue

1020
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,740
first interpreter of the dogma

1021
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,720
enrager of pinks and lesser subgeniuses alike

1022
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,220
living embodiment of hate slack under Dobbs

1023
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,680
keeper of the original Dobbs image

1024
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,780
carrot dangler of long promised magazines

1025
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:41,920
and returner of compliments

1026
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,180
you faithless

the

1043
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:42,160
Oh yes, dear friends, this is Li Weijing, a Chinese subgenius, and you are listening

1044
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,360
to the Hour of Slack.

1045
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,700
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

1046
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,260
He is a Chinese, just like in America.

1047
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,680
People need Slack.

1048
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,000
In Chinese, we call Slack, Lu Tianpang.

1049
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,460
But it must be true Slack, not the bad Slack of the conspiracy.

1050
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,520
Boy, will you look at that guy's swag.

1051
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,360
Help me somebody.

1052
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,520
Thank you, Li Weijing.

1053
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,180
Yes, my friends, we have the great Ivan Stang here tonight.

1054
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:23,740
Ivan Stang himself, the grand auditor and chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith, who

1055
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,280
has every subject.

1056
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,960
His name is on his special basement computer, and he's here tonight to make the hour and

1057
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,100
a half of Slack seem like, well, like forever.

1058
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:39,080
Ah, yes, dear friends, so good to be here.

1059
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,360
Say it, Ivan, say it.

1060
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:40,780
Feeling the power.

1061
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:41,900
Hit it.

1062
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:45,520
In this hideous, hideous place.

1063
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,120
Bob lives, friends.

1064
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,240
Bob lives.

1065
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,680
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

1066
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,440
He ain't dead.

1067
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,400
Oh, what is this?

1068
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,280
I should know.

1069
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,940
I'm the guy that has to read sooner.

1070
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,420
Later, all the mail that comes to that T.O. box that you probably thought was just made

1071
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:00,740
up.

1072
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:06,220
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff

1073
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:12,000
and management of this radio station, the other staff, the relations and spouses of

1074
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,940
the staff and management, or the staff of this staff and the staff.

1075
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,940
That's really true, Al, but he doesn't know that it's all over the place these days.

1076
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,300
He's dragged out of the Victoria Theater with these eyes.

1077
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:24,900
These.

1078
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,560
Deadlights looked on Bob and the light was drifting from them forever.

1079
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:37,260
There's, there's saint of sale corpses dotting the landscape all the way from Little Rock

1080
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,160
to Berkeley here.

1081
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,760
I don't know what the big deal is.

1082
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,960
I mean, that just because, just because there's a Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily,

1083
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,400
I mean, can Bob really die?

1084
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:54,160
I'd say yes, Ivan, and I think you better grow up and face the, face the sick truth

1085
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,200
that this Bobby is.

1086
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:55,380


1087
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,320
This isn't necessarily everything that you say he is.

1088
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,140
Putrescent.
