1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,900
Ah, yes, dear friends, the ancient rerun that we're about to play may be the greatest Hour

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,100
of Slack episode of all time.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,780
And what a coincidence, or is it?

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:26,820
Last week's show, number 1768, was a rerun of 468, and tonight's show, 1769, is a rerun

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,680
of number 69, from late 1986 or early 87, pretty early in our career.

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,120
This may be of interest to collectors, because number 69 is one of the few episodes that

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,520
never made it into our online archive of ancient shows at subgenius.com, and the master wasn't

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,380
among my collection, at least not where I've been able to find it yet.

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,880
Luckily, an old listener told me he had recorded a copy off the air in Dallas and could share

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,140
it.

11
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,200
Praise Jim Rassfeld.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,680
The very, very beginning has another coincidence, but it involves such a convoluted long story

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,200
it'll have to wait for another time.

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,100
Here, then, is Hour of Slack number 69.

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,460
See you tonight.

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,180
...by Bee Bumble and the Stingers.

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,900
Ni Ni Na Na Nu Nu by Dickie Doo and the Don'ts.

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,480
What a...

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,680
Ni Ni Na Na Nu Nu?

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,900
Yep, I'm afraid so.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,260
By Dickie Doo and the Don'ts?

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:27,700
Indeed.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,640
Ha!

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Ha!

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,080
Your genitals.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,100
Look with your closed eyes at your genitals.

27
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,740
And say to your genitals,

28
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,060
In your mind, relax.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,880
Start level three trance learning state on.

30
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,280
We are controlling transmission.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,000
It will signal your subconscious mind, flashing a message.

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:05,800
...

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,340
...

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,880
...

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,220
...

36
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:09,580
...

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,620


38
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,620


39
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,620


40
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,620


41
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,620


42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,620


43
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,700
...

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:10,700


45
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:10,780
...

46
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:10,780


47
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:10,820
...

48
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,820


49
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,820


50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,820


51
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,820


52
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,820


53
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,820


54
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,820


55
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,040
...

56
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,040


57
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,040


58
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,040


59
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,040


60
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,320
...

61
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,820
...

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,880
...

63
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:20,880


64
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:20,880


65
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:20,880


66
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,520
...

67
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,800
...

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,240
...

69
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,280
...

70
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,280


71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,280


72
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,300
...

73
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


74
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


75
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


76
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


77
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


78
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


79
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


80
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


81
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


82
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


83
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,300


84
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,440
Praise Bob.

85
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,360
The fates have brought you into possession of a subgenius instructional video barrage tape.

86
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,680
Prepare yourself.

87
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:41,080
You are about to be remade into a new being through forbidden knowledge previously kept secret for centuries by the jealous priesthoods of many religions.

88
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,480
Caution, improper viewing techniques may lead in some persons to dependency, seizures, cranial fits,

89
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:56,180
priapic conditions, micturitions, sternutations, subtle glandular mutations, and in some territories, legal arrest.

90
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:33,800
I always take their hand and shove it right down my pants.

91
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,960
Ah, yes.

92
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,060
Then I cinch up my belt with my hands.

93
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,660
Real tight.

94
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,700
And I'm ready to go.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
Baby, baby.

96
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,940
Baby, baby.

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,380
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty.

98
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,360
Dirty little girl, dirty little boy.

99
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,400
I am not a little scrub, scrub, scrub to your clean, clean, clean, clean.

100
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,280
Get that filthy animal out of here.

101
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,440
Um, there are...

102
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,060
Unfortunately enough...

103
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,640
From 1998 when the world is sold or not sold, depending on how Bob swings the deal,

104
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,660
there is going to be two conflicting alien forces hitting at the same time.

105
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,600
Plus Jehovah One, the alien space god corpse from the corporate sin galaxy,

106
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:35,060
who posed as a deity back in the Old Testament, and he has great saucer stories,

107
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,720
the book of Exodus, I have people should check out.

108
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,000
But, yeah.

109
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:49,500
Yeah, I think that there are many people listening right now that need this book and they know that you need the book of the subgenius.

110
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,420
The people that need it will understand it, too.

111
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:59,740
I feel that is true because I went in to get the book from a distributor here in Houston.

112
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,020
And she said, have you tried to read this thing?

113
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,280
And I said, yes, I have.

114
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,800
And she said, can you understand it?

115
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,520
And I said, no, I can't.

116
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,100
But that's the essence of it.

117
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:11,780
Exactly.

118
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Part of Bob's message is that we must stop trying.

119
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
You must learn to give up.

120
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:27,000
Slack lies not in striving for slack, but in giving up on false slack, the false slack of the conspiracy.

121
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,220
And, of course, some people, they hear that term conspiracy and they think, oh, these guys must be some kind of coobs.

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,620
And to a certain extent, we want that word to carry that connotation.

123
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,800
Because the coobs are right.

124
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,260
Oh, yes, dear friends.

125
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,400
The coobs are right.

126
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

127
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:57,660
And many of you may not know exactly what's going on here, but this is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,340
Hour of slack, dear friends.

129
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,260
I'm in Dallas, Texas, and it looks like tonight I've only got the use of one tape deck.

130
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,080
You know what that means?

131
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:20,120
That means we've got to flip these unsuspected records into the thing in order to do these smooth, smooth radio DJ type transitions like that.

132
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,480
I'm in Dallas, Texas, and it looks like tonight I've only got the use of one tape deck.

133
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,480


134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,480


135
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,060
I've got a tape deck.

136
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,140
Oh, yeah, boy, now he's gone.

137
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,720
A martyr for the cause, for the fallow.

138
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,100
And he's coming again.

139
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,280
Who knew that the first shot was gonna be the last shot?

140
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,480
But he's got a hard drive.

141
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,100
He's got a hard drive.

142
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,240
He's got a hard drive.

143
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,460
The gas won't go through the night

144
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,840
And although he may be hurt

145
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,600
The universe will keep on squirting

146
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,620
All the stars, no

147
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,920
And it's coming again

148
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:35,260
Oh yes, dear friends,

149
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,360
this is the subgenius radio ministry,

150
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,660
Our Slack.

151
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,120
You're listening to Slackmaster Cleave

152
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,380
and the Spurious Jive

153
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,080
doing that great old-fashioned hymn,

154
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,420
Bob Is My Load,

155
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,280
and it's coming again.

156
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,220
Friends, it's going to be a loose show.

157
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,860
Loose? Oh yeah, yeah.

158
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,560
But that's okay.

159
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,580
It's a challenge.

160
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,280
He can tell from the many who laugh

161
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,660
With just a shot from his mighty staff

162
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,280
If only he could make it back

163
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,200
From the land of the dead

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,500
But until that happy day

165
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,140
We can only drink and say

166
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,220
Bob Is My Load

167
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,980
And it's coming again

168
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
I know he can make it

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,040
With the help we can take it

170
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,220
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

171
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,460
To the pink boys and the whims

172
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,600
Until the day that he comes back

173
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,320
It'll be a world without slack

174
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,260
Bob Is My Load

175
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,820
And it's coming again

176
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,340
Bob Is My Load

177
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,280
Bob Is My Load

178
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,100
Bob Is My Load

179
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:00,700
Bob Is My Load

180
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,140
Bob Is My Load

181
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,060
Bob Is My Load

182
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,120
And it's coming again

183
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,860
We don't want the answers to call us

184
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,220
And we need Bob to be honest

185
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,180
Bob Is My Load

186
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,380
Bob Is My Load

187
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,180
Bob Is My Load

188
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
And it's coming again

189
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,180
Great God Almighty

190
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,800
Holy, Holy

191
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,680
Help me somebody

192
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,600
Oh, Bobby

193
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,560
Bobby's gonna be here

194
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,020
Sooner or later

195
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,320
Oh, oh

196
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,480
What are they laughing at?

197
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,540
Well, dear friends

198
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,740
Oh, yes, like I said

199
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,220
It's gonna be a slackful, slackful

200
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,420
When you'll be able to hear me flip these cassettes

201
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,960
Hear this little

202
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,660
That's a cassette right there

203
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,520
It's got all the word of Bob on it

204
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,000
Just like holograms

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,960
You can fit thousands and thousands of years' worth

206
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,000
Of information onto these things

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,500
Oh, wait a minute

208
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:01,960
I think we're

209
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,640
Yeah, that's right, that's right

210
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,180
11-59

211
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,600
No, it's 11-08, dear friends

212
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,760
Loop out

213
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,040
Cabin light on

214
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,400
Energy

215
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,240
Stimulus

216
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,880
Feeder out

217
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,700
Dream monitor out

218
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,840
Okay, now that you've got your dream monitors out, dear friends

219
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,760
I want you all to call the Willa Dobbs here

220
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,800
At 823-7490

221
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,040
If you have any questions

222
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,860
I'm sure you don't

223
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,700
I'm sure you've been reading your book of the subgenius

224
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,440
Religiously

225
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,980
And I do mean it that way

226
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,800
I'm sure that you've been listening to the Hour of Slack

227
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
Almost your entire life

228
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,000
So, you know, I don't think you would need any extra assistance here

229
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,040
But if you do, please do call

230
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,900
1-800-9500

231
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,440
Yeah, or

232
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,720
9500

233
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,560
Either one

234
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,240
And friends, for one hour

235
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,740
You have got in front of you right now

236
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,620
One hour of that precious slack

237
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,120
The slack

238
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,360
That you've been needing so bad

239
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,160
And you know

240
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,680
You know you needs it, friends

241
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,820
You knows you wants it

242
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,980
You got to

243
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,760
Got to have it

244
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,540
96

245
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,920
95

246
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,380
Now, buddy

247
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,000
I know it's been a long haul for you

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,680
The system should be running some figures now

249
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,360
And the vitals

250
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,760
90

251
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,380
If you're still in the green

252
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,180
We'll do the memory test

253
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,940
87

254
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,580
And restore it a con to you, Cap

255
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
86

256
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,140
85

257
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,520
84

258
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,120
And take 51

259
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,420
83

260
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,640
84

261
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,220
Okay

262
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,160
We're ten-eight

263
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,380
And the number is 180

264
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,220
And the letter is G

265
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,500
There's no other possibility

266
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,740
And all you slimy fruitcakes in San Francisco

267
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:02,740


268
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,980
Are going to find out

269
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,720
How to get to 180

270
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,200
And the letter G

271
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,120
I repeat

272
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,020
There is no other possibility

273
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,660
There is no other possi-

274
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,700
The number is 180

275
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,540
And the letter is G

276
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480
The first thing you have to do

277
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
To get over to 180

278
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,720
And the letter G

279
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,940
Is to get into your vehicle

280
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,720
And you're going to have to get over to 180

281
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:32,720


282
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,560
And head east

283
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,840
I repeat

284
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,720
You have to head east

285
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,160
Over the bridge

286
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,340
But before you get onto the bridge

287
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,140
Around one big turn

288
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,000
You'll come up to the place

289
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,220
Where the sex chemicals burned up

290
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,520
I repeat

291
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,340
Where the sex chemicals burned up

292
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,000
And what he's talking about friends

293
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,300
He's talking about the subgenius foundation

294
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,700
Cause we had to burn up those sex chemicals

295
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,940
To save your soul

296
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,780
You understand what I'm saying?

297
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,420
No, no, no

298
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,520
You don't?

299
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,380
Friends there's no other possibility

300
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,160
On your way to 180 and the letter G

301
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,400
This is negative land that you're hearing right now

302
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,040
But I'm going to switch over here to

303
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,740
How Time Flies by David Austin

304
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,100
And now, and now, in

305
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,500
And now we're on the

306
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,060
Hello Mark

307
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,140
You are A-OK

308
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,860
Punch up

309
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,900
B-M-F

310
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,760
You're fine, no problem

311
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,520
Perform

312
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,580
Basic manual function

313
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,220
Perform, yes

314
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,460
Well I'm a radio announcer

315
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,740
I'm a host

316
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,220
You are A-OK

317
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm A-OK

318
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,380
Not to voice

319
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,060
Operatism

320
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,460
On the hour of slack

321
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,740
That's a subgenius church show dear friends

322
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,320
It seems that a lot of people have been

323
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,200
Rolling tape

324
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,460
Tuning in on Sunday nights

325
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,940
Who don't know anything about the church of the subgenius

326
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,380
And you think I'm going to tell you over the air?

327
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,240
Forget it

328
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,480
You can call the Will-O-Dob

329
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,940
So at 823-955-FINITE

330
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,780
Or 899-025-SERVICE

331
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,220
And in the meantime we'll go to this lovely song here

332
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,340
By, we don't even know his name

333
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,380
We used to call him Doug number three

334
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,040
There's so many Dougs in the church

335
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,320
An old drinking song

336
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,620
An old drinking song

337
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,700
Roughly recorded but beautiful and stirring nonetheless

338
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,260
Forgive me

339
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,760
I want to die for God

340
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:34,480
I want to die in holy, holy thrills

341
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,020
The faint voice and the normal spirit

342
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,540
If we have to, if we have to

343
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,900
God will give things and die

344
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,080
And we'll all come back over

345
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,740
And we'll all come back over

346
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,360
And we'll all come back over

347
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,240
And we'll all come back over

348
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,400
Turn around

349
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,660
Pray the gods

350
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,640
Pray that we'll all together

351
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,680
Here in the church

352
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,660
We are nothing

353
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,600
We are nothing

354
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,480
Letтрas

355
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,100
The church may be

356
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,880
The church may be

357
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:36,580
If we can make them die, and we'll all come back over men, we'll all come out over men.

358
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,580
If we don't come out over men, we'll be no reason why.

359
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,820
Our wives, gizms, they will fall beneath our laser blades.

360
00:15:49,820 --> 00:16:03,620
And we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men in victory parade.

361
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,720
It's so sad.

362
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,060
It's so sad.

363
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,960
It's so sad.

364
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,980
The rest of y'all is funny Bob stuff.

365
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,420
The funny stuff being the show.

366
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,320
Just listen to me, me, me, me, me.

367
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,100
It makes me feel like I don't know if I ever really did believe in Bob.

368
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,280
You know, the word cult derives from the Latin colo, to worship.

369
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,620
Now, we tend to use the word in our looser sense, applying it to almost any sort of organization.

370
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,740
Yet, in its best sense, it should be reserved for the naming of strange and weird religious sects.

371
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,480
Normally, when we speak of cults, we think of odd foreign religious societies.

372
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:27,760
Such as the leopard men of Central Africa, the death-dealing pygmies of the Congo, or the Haitian voodoo groups.

373
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,240
But there are hundreds of odd cultist societies in our own country.

374
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,300
Most recently, the snake worshippers of certain obscure sections of our country have occupied the news.

375
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,120
By no means are these all.

376
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,920
But recently, investigators of the unusual uncovered one of the strangest of all cults in California.

377
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,700
It was called the Left Coast Church of the Subgenius.

378
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,780
No, you didn't.

379
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,340
Yes, I did.

380
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,560
An apostate group which contradicted each other constantly.

381
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,400
They rose in the morning to trumpets and drums.

382
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,300
I've been having trouble with my apostate, too, lately.

383
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:02,980
Yeah.

384
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,900
You gotta put...

385
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,140
Itches.

386
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,040
You gotta keep a stick of broccoli in your butt, too.

387
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,880
See Jerry Lewis as the playful proctologist.

388
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,860
That's right, Lewis.

389
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,340
Doctors for Bob.

390
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,980
Everything...

391
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,080
Exploding softly.

392
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,220
Doctors for Bob.

393
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,020
That's a myth.

394
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,520
Oh, Bob, why'd you let that pickup run over my wife?

395
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,040
These are questions which are difficult to answer.

396
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,940
Speaking of Doctors for Bob...

397
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,180
During the Roman Empire, seven million years ago,

398
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,600
enormous chunks of cheese floated down from primordial glaciers.

399
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,020
And friends, you can, too.

400
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,120
Yes, just like...

401
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,840
If you'll just reach down your own throat, grab hold of that abnormality gland,

402
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,960
yank it out.

403
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,620
Give it a good look and say,

404
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,080
say, here's a listener.

405
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,880
Then put the pitiful, bloody object in a box and mail it to Bob.

406
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,480
Or call 848-45-FUSH-NURL right now.

407
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,980
No, you can't call that number, that 828-FUSH-NURL-405.

408
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,960
That's ridiculous, because...

409
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
I mean, what, like, you want answers?

410
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,600
Answers?

411
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,820
You may wish to God you'd never ask, dear friend.

412
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,820
Oh, you'll get your answers, all right.

413
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,820
But Dobsian Hermeticism all too fully explains man's...

414
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,680
place and purpose on this earth plane,

415
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,180
this hierarchy of universal cruelties.

416
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,780
Of course, probably the least answerable question in history,

417
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,020
here answered to be, dear friends, is,

418
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,080
why are we here?

419
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,900
Why do we have such a huge capacity for pleasure and confusion?

420
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,460
Just so we'll keep breeding fast enough

421
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,560
for some mindless, long-range, perpetual motion mutation?

422
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,400
Oh, if only it were so, dear friends, if only it were that simple.

423
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,720
What set everything going in the first place before the Big Bang?

424
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,640
Oh, this question terrifies the water out of us if we really grasp it.

425
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:10,140
Oh, we instinctively grab for some pose, some cause, crutch, drug, or religion,

426
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,760
even another person that would let us ignore this hideous mystery,

427
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,700
that would create alibis for our failure to find a purpose,

428
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:18,800
and that would make us feel like we're in a world of chaos.

429
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,660
Although there are some who frankly don't give a hoot,

430
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,380
and those are the lucky ones, dear friends,

431
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:30,960
because the concept of infinity is so hard to get viscerally

432
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,240
that when we look up at the night sky, dear friends,

433
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,700
we tend to actually think of the stars merely as randomly separated,

434
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,000
inexplicably backlit holes punched in some huge backdrop

435
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,120
about a mile away from us.

436
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,500
And yet, every now and then, we actually get a feel,

437
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,500
for the distances and the times involved.

438
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,400
And glimpsing that fact of eternity becomes real scary

439
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:05,960
if you really get a solid grip on that insolid abject nothingness of God's brain.

440
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,360
God's brain, dear friends.

441
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,720
What scares you is that you might actually be God,

442
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,360
and you might wake up,

443
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,500
and all those fragile physical laws might come crashing down around you,

444
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,420
and you might be able to see the spiderweb framework of all reality.

445
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,380
Even your friends' thoughts might be erased like some precious

446
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,160
but stupidly unlabeled cassette tape like this one here,

447
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,340
never to be recaptured again.

448
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,100
In fact, the idea is so scary that the goal of most religions, dear friends,

449
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,700
is to preserve and elaborate on that concept of the stars as a big painted backdrop.

450
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,180
They make infinity a prop,

451
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,860
so you don't have to think about the scary part.

452
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,640
And this religion, the Church of the Subgenius,

453
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,180
is indeed about that scary part.

454
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,240
The part you can't think about.

455
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,720
You can grasp it only through direct knowledge,

456
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,540
seeing, one might say, the nature of slack.

457
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,700
Because without slack, there can be no infinity, and vice versa.

458
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,660
Good Lord, you say, but it exists only inside our heads, after all.

459
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,820
This veil of illusion isn't real, for God's sake.

460
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,840
At least not until somebody says,

461
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,640
somebody slams the outside of the head with a truncheon.

462
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,200
Then you could probably call it fairly real.

463
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,740
This is Sister Cress you're about to hear,

464
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,820
not from this station, but from another subgenius radio show.

465
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,880
That's right.

466
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,800
Oh, listen to that.

467
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,860
Oh, yeah.

468
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,300
I told you.

469
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,960
This is WFMUFM.

470
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,100
The scary part and the sexy part.

471
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,660
You just heard a half hour of...

472
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,360
This is KMOR.

473
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,860
...an hour of slack from...

474
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,640
...the Subgenius Foundation.

475
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,820
I think you start to assess life.

476
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,440
Which you can get lots-o information

477
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,860
by writing and sending at least one dollar

478
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,340
of conspiracy Federal Reserve currency

479
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,780
to the Subgenius Foundation,

480
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,060
post office box 140...

481
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,060
But don't send a dollar to us.

482
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,800
Dallas, Texas 75214.

483
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,540
Send that dollar to KMOR.

484
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,920
Please send it to us.

485
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,480
We'll just give it to KMOR.

486
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,840
Approximately a half hour of the Subgenius tape

487
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,580
is featured here on WFMUFM East Orange.

488
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,980
But you get a whole hour here on...

489
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,480
Sister Cress.

490
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,360
...in Dallas, Texas.

491
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,180
Here.

492
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,480
And children, you want to know

493
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,860
what the biggest abomination there is

494
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,620
in this sick and perverted world?

495
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,480
It's not homosexuality, cross-dressing,

496
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,460
or any other supposed perversion.

497
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,780
No, my children.

498
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,980
The truly biggest abomination

499
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,420
is the conspiracy dupes

500
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,140
who call themselves feminists.

501
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,200
They're the ones who foist their ideas

502
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,700
of what women should be doing,

503
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,620
thinking, and feeling.

504
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,760
They have the gall to preach

505
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,180
that women should be in positions of

506
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,460
quote-unquote power in the government

507
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,980
and other organizations of the conspiracy.

508
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,800
Let me tell you that no uber woman

509
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,840
in her right or left brain

510
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,760
would want to have any kind of power.

511
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,960
She would want to have anything to do

512
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,040
with ruling a world that's heading down the sewer

513
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,040
in a motorboat steered by a drunken child actor.

514
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,420
Feminist conspiracy also wants to censor free speech

515
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,660
in what they call pornography and exploitation.

516
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,040
Those midget brains don't realize

517
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,120
that they're being used as distractions

518
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,940
by the conspiracy.

519
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,740
Distractions from the real porn

520
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,380
of mediocrity and slack piracy.

521
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,560
These are the true, true...

522
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,060
...

523
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,160
...

524
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,620
...

525
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,380
...

526
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,820
True crimes against the state.

527
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,780
Conspiracy-dupe females don't realize this,

528
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,780
and they think with blinders on.

529
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,460
True subgenius uber women

530
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,640
don't pay the conspiracy-fashions any mind.

531
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,780
We know that magazines like Vogue and Cosmo and the like

532
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,260
push the conspiracy concepts of feminninity,

533
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,340
which is controlled by the old,

534
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,680
trilateralist, fogies

535
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,120
and their young, whiz-boy offspring.

536
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,920
But we don't lower ourselves

537
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,240
to a state of angst-filled frenzy,

538
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,040
let alone join a group that is comparable to some

539
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,500
to a myopic cockroach that attempts to challenge a professional exterminator.

540
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,580
Subgenii are not joiners,

541
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,200
and uberwomen are the most notorious lone she-wolves of the non-type.

542
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,400
We don't follow anyone.

543
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,620
Not even Bob.

544
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,540
Praise Connie!

545
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,700
Je-

546
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:10,000
Hello there.

547
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,960
This is Simon from The Cure.

548
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,640
Hello, Dallas, Texas.

549
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,240
This is Jerry Dale McFadden.

550
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,480
Howdy, this is Bob Walkenhorst of the Rainmakers.

551
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,820
K-N-O-N, the voice of the people.

552
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, it sure is K-N-O-N, the voice of the people, folks.

553
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,320
And, uh, you know, it's funny.

554
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,240
Once again, we're getting all these dang blabbit calls

555
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,900
from people that have never heard.

556
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,680
I can't believe that there's people on this planet

557
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,460
that have never heard of the Church of the Subgenius.

558
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,400
Don't know anything.

559
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,560
Don't know anything about it.

560
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,980
They go, now, wait a minute.

561
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,880
Are you guys serious?

562
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,180
This couldn't be for real.

563
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,160
Because they figure it's too good to be true.

564
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,760
Don't you?

565
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,980
That's what you're thinking.

566
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:54,860
Yeah.

567
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,220
Well, if you just call in one more time,

568
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,560
18-

569
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,640
Well, I know I'm from here.

570
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,540
Talk to the Will-O-Dobs,

571
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,840
and, uh, get a little information.

572
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,960
Find out, you know, what you'll get

573
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,360
when you write for information.

574
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,680
But you don't want to hear any more about that.

575
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,020
Anybody listening down there?

576
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,840
I've got a terrible backache here.

577
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,800
That's right, Mark.

578
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,760
Now, on the Red Channel,

579
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,920
read the system you're vital.

580
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,760
Mark.

581
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,660
Mark.

582
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,820
Mark T.

583
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,600
Captain.

584
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,180
Signs of Life.

585
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,780
Green.

586
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,920
Elapsed time of sleep in 24-hour units.

587
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,820
Yes, the listeners are just finally waking up.

588
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,780
And finally we find out just...

589
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,080
Let's listen to this little piece of, uh,

590
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,620
recorded music.

591
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,240
This is recorded material from Ken Nordean,

592
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,640
the incredible, brilliant Ken Nordean.

593
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,900
Got a minute?

594
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,500
I'm sure you do.

595
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,620
I'd like to talk about, um,

596
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,560
the movers and shakers.

597
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,140
Yeah, go ahead.

598
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,420
Yeah.

599
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,480
The movers and shakers.

600
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,500
Ha, ha.

601
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,860
Those people

602
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,200
who more than anybody else

603
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,980
have ever been.

604
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:12,700
Yeah.

605
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,600
Yeah.

606
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


607
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


608
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


609
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


610
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


611
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


612
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


613
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


614
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


615
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


616
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


617
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


618
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


619
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


620
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


621
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


622
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


623
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


624
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


625
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


626
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,600


627
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,300
Determine what's gonna happen.

628
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,960
The movers.

629
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,500
The movers.

630
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:18,600


631
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,660
And shakers.

632
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,700
Shakers.

633
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,760
Yeah.

634
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,860
Who get things done.

635
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,600
The movers.

636
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,980
Who call the shots.

637
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,980
The shakers.

638
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,980
Who make a big difference.

639
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,260
The movers.

640
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,560
The power to control.

641
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,860
The movers.

642
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,220
Shakers.

643
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,120
They got boss power.

644
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,180
Yeah.

645
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,360
They're the movers.

646
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,600
They got the power.

647
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:43,600


648
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
They determine policy.

649
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,400
They're the shakers.

650
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,300
They got a good deal of respect.

651
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,580
They're the movers.

652
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,240
Yeah.

653
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,540
They're the shadow behind the scenes.

654
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,700
They're the shakers.

655
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,280
They got the power.

656
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,400
Yeah.

657
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,580
They're the movers.

658
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,040
To raise major amounts of money.

659
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,260
Yeah.

660
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,200
They're the shakers.

661
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,060
They can select.

662
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,220
They're the movers.

663
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,400
What will be put before the largest audience.

664
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:13,580


665
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,380
They're the shakers.

666
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,180
Oh, significant social and financial power.

667
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,120
Yeah.

668
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,740
They're the movers.

669
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,160
Yeah.

670
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,780
The theater.

671
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,740
Yeah.

672
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,800
They're the shakers.

673
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,320
Yeah.

674
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,100
Pop music.

675
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,140
They're the movers.

676
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,320
The movies.

677
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,260
They're the shakers.

678
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,780
Classical music.

679
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,640
They're the movers.

680
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,720
They're the movers and shakers.

681
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,720
Yeah.

682
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,780
They're the shakers.

683
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,220
They're the shakers.

684
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,220


685
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,220


686
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,220


687
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,220


688
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,220


689
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,220


690
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,620
Those who wield influence.

691
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,820
They're the movers.

692
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,480
What you see and hear.

693
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,440
You.

694
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:50,820
No otherwise, they hear.

695
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,740
They're the shakers.

696
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,560
They're the movers and shakers.

697
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,680
They're the movers.

698
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,780
Movers.

699
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,000
Shakers.

700
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,320
Am I brand new?

701
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:02,860
ool.

702
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,760
Shakers.

703
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,760


704
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,920
They're the shapers.

705
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,400
Ladies and gentlemen, the movers and shakers.

706
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,700
I am a shaker.

707
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:12,700


708
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
They're the shakers.

709
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,180
I used to be a mover.

710
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,480
But I became a shaker.

711
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,220
The movers and shakers.

712
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,960
You can't move without shakers.

713
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,400
The movers and shakers.

714
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:36,220
Any shakedown is necessary before anything moves anywhere.

715
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,440
The movers and shakers.

716
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,500
So the shaker goes out and gets the money.

717
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,420
The movers and shakers.

718
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,480
The real money.

719
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,440
The movers and shakers.

720
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,120
You don't think these big movies are made with pennies?

721
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,240
The movers and shakers.

722
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,740
They cost millions and millions of dollars.

723
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,800
The movers and shakers.

724
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
There's a lot of money involved.

725
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,380
Yeah.

726
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,560
You take a big symphony.

727
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,360
You don't think a big symphony lives on peanuts?

728
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,020
The movers and shakers.

729
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,360
They don't play that beautiful music with nothing.

730
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,180
The movers and shakers.

731
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,020
It takes money.

732
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,560
The movers and shakers.

733
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,800
So the shaker goes out.

734
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:26,120
Shakes a few of those shackles out of the people's pockets so we can favor these things.

735
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,200
The movers and shakers.

736
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,700
They give it to the mover.

737
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,140
The movers and shakers.

738
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,500
And the mover makes things move.

739
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,520
The movers and shakers.

740
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,560
The movers and shakers.

741
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,480
The movers and shakers.

742
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:41,480


743
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:41,480


744
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,680
The movers and shakers.

745
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,440
Without the movers and shakers.

746
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
The movers and shakers.

747
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,720
What would these artists do?

748
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,740
The movers and shakers.

749
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,160
What good is an artist?

750
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,540
If he doesn't have a mover or a shaker on his side?

751
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,900
The movers and shakers.

752
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:09,100
Now if you are an artist, you need a good shaker, get in touch with me.

753
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,220
I know all the movers and shakers.

754
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,960
But you got to have a good shaker to begin with.

755
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,520
What it's all about.

756
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,420
Moving, shaking.

757
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,420
Got to get into it.

758
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,340
Moving, shaking.

759
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,300
What it's all about.

760
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,660
Movers and shakers.

761
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,620
Movers and shakers.

762
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,640
Movers and shakers.

763
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,780
Movers and shakers.

764
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,560
Movers and shakers.

765
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,720
Oh, you got to find out what it's all about, dear friends.

766
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,780
And that beautiful, beautiful song there was by Ken Nordine.

767
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,220
That's it.

768
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,020
Triple Talk by Ken Nordine.

769
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,380
And friends, you're still calling in once again.

770
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,240
You're still calling in to find out just what's going on.

771
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,080
Oh dear listener, a querent into the profundities of the moment.

772
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:15,640
of this twisted randomness that we so stupidly call reality?

773
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,700
You ask us over and over on the phone,

774
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,040
is this some kind of joke?

775
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,440
Oh, friend, if you thought this church was a joke,

776
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,960
then you will by God never get the punchline.

777
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,480
And this could be the greatest joke ever told, dear friends,

778
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,580
if Earth, if this planet can make it to the punchline.

779
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,180
We're the first to admit that on a good night,

780
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,400
maybe not tonight, maybe not a scary night like tonight,

781
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:50,860
we deliver a lot more laughs and yucks per listening dollar

782
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,820
than Scientology or the Unification Church

783
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,020
or any other religious group except possibly the Southern Baptists.

784
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,720
But, you know, as funny as they are,

785
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,880
they're there for brain death, and we're against brain death.

786
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,840
That would theoretically, friends,

787
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,400
put a bounty on our heads, except that we trend the thin...

788
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,220
We tread, we tread, friends, that thin, tight wire of the jokes,

789
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:20,560
just enough not to so far have been covertly killed or bought.

790
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,460
My God, friend, look what they did to our predecessors.

791
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,680
Anyone who kept a straight face.

792
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,400
No, this ain't no joke, friend, no parody.

793
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,380
Only the foulness of your programming

794
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,820
keeps you from believing that we have thousands of minutes

795
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,020
to make a show about the subgenius.

796
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,020


797
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,380
which we do in the Church of the Subgenius,

798
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,740
that we have nationwide revivals,

799
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,920
radio shows in different cities and so on,

800
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,840
but we do, and not only are we not kidding,

801
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,080
but we'll even, shall we say, tick you off.

802
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,280
Because that's our job, dear friend, our calling,

803
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,140
our mission for Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

804
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,140
and we're going to shock the hell out of every man, woman and child

805
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,740
on Bear Creek if we have to.

806
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,460
It's a big job, and we only have until 1998 to do it.

807
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,920
But, uh, friends, you want to know

808
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,460
what the Church of the Subgenius is,

809
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,440
and there ain't no description.

810
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,900
Words don't suffice.

811
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,580
One must see.

812
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,160
We let you see a little at a time

813
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,420
until you're led gradually to total clarity.

814
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,540
This is the Nameless Mission,

815
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,300
as Puzzling Evidence called it, friends,

816
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,780
because the true mission is always nameless.

817
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,480
To name it is to doom it, to alert the enemy.

818
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,500
Just don't buy your doomsday theories.

819
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,440
Well, you better buy them.

820
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,620
We are in worse shape, uh, from the point of view

821
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,880
of our military preparedness than we were on the 8th of December, 1941,

822
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,440
the day after the Pearl Harbor attack.

823
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,260
The Russians got the definite advantage of us right now.

824
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
We need to show more strength.

825
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,540
We gotta catch up or get ahead of them or we're dead meat.

826
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,160
Exactly as Noah getting under the ark triggered the deluge

827
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,620
that destroyed the earth in his day,

828
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,500
and that it's very highly possible that when this all takes place,

829
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,420
that a great cataclysmic, uh, disaster will come.

830
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:05,420


831
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,120
And that a cataclysmic judgment will do that very thing.

832
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,100
And we do not know that it wouldn't happen in 1982,

833
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,360
for we don't know what day it'll happen.

834
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,620
This article was referring, as I said,

835
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,680
to the nine planets in our solar system,

836
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,480
Mercury, Earth, Mars, Uranus, Pluto, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and Neptune,

837
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,540
uh, when these are scheduled to be perfectly aligned in 1982,

838
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,540
that these things perhaps could happen.

839
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,980
Many scientists with varying ideas of what could happen

840
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,420
have expressed their views that huge solar flares will take place, results, and the future.

841
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,420


842
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,420


843
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,420


844
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,420


845
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,420


846
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,420


847
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,420


848
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,420


849
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,880
And they also said that there should be a great deal more

850
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:35,880


851
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,700
uh, that could be disruptions in the television and radio communication,

852
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,240
and a great deal more.

853
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,020
I see that I'm not gonna have much time to go into this anymore today,

854
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,780
and so I'm gonna carry it through tomorrow

855
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,820
and try to bring it to a more clear climax,

856
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,700
but may I tell you that all of these are warnings to us

857
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,780
to repent of our sins and to get ready for the coming of the Lord,

858
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,300
for we can see great and drastic things that are gonna take place on the earth

859
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,020
when Jesus comes and the judgments of God

860
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,400
are being poured out upon a Christ-rejected planet.

861
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:10,300
world. Well, after we come through here and we purify through this plant here, it takes out some

862
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,500
of the chemicals in the mud out of it. But you can't drink. We can't drink it. Nowhere in the

863
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,160
world you can drink it unless you hold your nose.

864
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,500
It'll also tell you about the prelude to Armageddon and also some of the strange events that have been

865
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:47,780
forecast for 1982. Some of the things that are coming in these last days. You know, the future is a

866
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:54,640
magnetic place. Each year, a hundred billion are born into it. Why, it seems all roads lead to tomorrow.

867
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Why, just looking at the future is enchanting. Prowse along conveyor belts where awe-inspiring

868
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,400
holograms are as much a part of the experience as they are the future.

869
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,280
The future is the experience of every man as were the real trees, mountains, and sunsets of the dark past.

870
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,300
It's thrilling to wander amidst these realistic 3D images and you'll certainly feel at home since the

871
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,780
leaders here have chosen the architecture of the mediocratons of the middle class ages as the most

872
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:29,680
relaxing and appeasing of all art forms. It could be the old world charm of suburbs and franchises

873
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,120
or power plants and office buildings which might suddenly change to lovely forests and

874
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,400
homes.

875
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,520
But wherever you go, you're still amidst the clean, ever-changing holograms of the future.

876
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,740
Made possible by the amazing hologram projectors and the careful planning of the

877
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:54,060
folks behind the scenes. And it won't put a dent in your budget since holograms are produced in economical black and white.

878
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,200
You might even get to see a rare hologram eclipse when your real surroundings become enjoyably apparent.

879
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,400
We are already in critical difficult days. Please, let us know if you have any questions.

880
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,780
We've got a lot of things to tell you.

881
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:15,960
If you don't move, dear friends, don't go anywhere. Yes, because you're stuck here listening to what's going on.

882
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,620
And, oh, we've got a dastardly, evil future coming up.

883
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:28,260
If you don't get right with Bob, see, that's what this is all about. You've got to get right with J.R. Bob Dobson.

884
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:35,400
And if you don't, you are doomed, doomed and damned forever, dear friends, because the church of the church of the church is doomed.

885
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,880
the subgenius is Bob's church. As the million-legged church crawls around inside your cranium,

886
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:47,800
there's one point that we'll keep coming back to, one anchor, the very point of the church,

887
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:54,300
and that point is Bob, friends. Bob is, was, and ever shall be world without end.

888
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:02,300
Oh, friends, Bob is the Kama Sutra, the id, the light that glows in the heart and mind of every

889
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:13,220
free-thinking subgenius, and friends, Bob is a man, and Bob is slack. Bob is you, and Bob is me,

890
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:21,320
dear friends. Bob is slack, and slack is what you want. Slack is what you need. With the fullness

891
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,020
of slack, dear friends, a change will come into your life. Slackness will enter your life,

892
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:32,120
as the Pope of New York once preached. Slackness will make you see. Slackness will set you

893
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,280
free.

894
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,820
Free, dear friends. Slackness is. Slackness lives. Slackness waits for you, and yes, send $20.

895
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:46,100
With electronic bait, man is nuclear efficient, and the fish on his line is bigger in his mind

896
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:52,980
than the reality of the reel he has to reel it in. You shouldn't have bit, fish.

897
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:11,240
The one that got away is the catch of the day. You shouldn't have bit, fish.

898
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:20,260
You took the bait, it's too late to pray. Now over you, they say the grace. Lord, bless the fish.

899
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,320
Oh, you can't even be sure you're seeing any of it.

900
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,440
Miles, you and I are scientific men. You can understand the wonder of what's happened.

901
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,560
I just think, less than a month ago, Santa Mera was like any other town. People with nothing but

902
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:00,200
problems. Then out of the sky came a solution. Seeds drifting through space for years took root

903
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,280
in a farmer's field. From the bottom of the river, the seeds of the river flowed through the river.

904
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:02,280


905
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,600
From the seeds came pods, which have the power to reproduce themselves in the exact likeness of

906
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:15,440
any form of life. Your new bodies are growing in there. They're taking you over, cell for cell,

907
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:24,060
atom for atom. There's no pain. Suddenly, while you're asleep, they'll absorb your minds,

908
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:31,520
your memories, and you're reborn into an untroubled world where everyone's the same.

909
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:41,160
Exactly. What a world. We're not the last humans left. They'll destroy you.

910
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,300
Tomorrow, you won't want them to. Tomorrow, you'll be one of us.

911
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,620
I don't want any part of it. You're forgetting something, Miles.

912
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,000
What's that? You have no choice.

913
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:59,940
No. And our children will live, Mr. Beale.

914
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:15,860
To see that perfect world in which there's no war or famine or oppression or brutality.

915
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:26,540
One vast and ecumenical holding company for whom all men will work to serve a common profit

916
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,660
in which all men will hold a share of stock.

917
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:39,940
All necessities provided. All anxieties tranquilized.

918
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,020
All boredom amused.

919
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,020
The chemical.

920
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,280
moments just like these.

921
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:54,920
казado

922
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,840
All the vandals watching

923
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,760
We watch him back

924
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,700
We see right through his disguise

925
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,880
He tries to scare us with angry words

926
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,680
But we all know that they're lies

927
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,680
The world is waiting

928
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,740
Just see the fear in their eyes

929
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,380
The world is watching

930
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,580
And so's in every mood

931
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,480
Is it forgetting or the end?

932
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,400
Just like the chess game

933
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,080
But so intense

934
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,860
That I just don't understand

935
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,160
Anticipation

936
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,860
It's not too big to pretend

937
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,600
And now it's 1984

938
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,740
And now it's 1984

939
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,060
White top but we've been here before

940
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,380
White top it's 1984

941
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,020
White top but we've been here before

942
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,560
Here before

943
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,780
They're gonna scream me

944
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,820
But we don't care

945
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,480
Cause he's got nothing to say

946
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,460
And now they're gonna scream me

947
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,240
Cause he's got nothing to say

948
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,920
And now they're gonna scream me

949
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,200
Cause he's got nothing to say

950
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,040
We didn't mean any harm

951
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,940
We just wanna go

952
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,640
And now they're gonna scream me

953
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,700
Now don't sort

954
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,680
This is a warning

955
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,840
Danger, danger you poor devils

956
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,520
Things are more mixed up than you ever dreamed

957
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,640
What was up is down

958
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,120
The priorities are all screwy

959
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,280
You're fretting if your hair looks okay

960
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,740
While some new kind of bladder cancer is coming up

961
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,100
And it's bursting out the front of your designer jeans

962
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,900
Yes this is bad talk

963
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,120
Nobody will listen to anything else

964
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,720
You won't look at TV unless body parts or cars are jiggling or crashing on it

965
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,780
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it

966
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,900
You haven't used your other senses since you were five

967
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,660
And you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing

968
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,640
Until someone much bigger, much stronger

969
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,500
And much, much more self-assured makes you stop

970
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,640
And you'll thank him for it

971
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,920
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight

972
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,100
You'll realize that he stopped you from doing the wrong thing

973
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,620
Good God

974
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,340
What in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this world coming to?

975
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,820
People itch, people gripe

976
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,760
This is a sign of the end times

977
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,520
That's a sign of the end times

978
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,340
When you should all be hollering

979
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,240
It's all a sign of the end times

980
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,400
Two months ago the observatory

981
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,560
Issued a press statement that the world was coming to an end

982
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,860
Now that's the same story the cult of the book of revelations had been preaching

983
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,120
Now when a scientist backs that up it's new

984
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,180
Our conclusions have nothing to do with the cult

985
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,100
Well today we deal with Bible prophecy

986
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,440
We have two free features we want you to write for right away

987
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,500
I wish my mommy did not smoke

988
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,180
How you can have the miracle you need in August of 1982

989
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,480
There may be a book of revelations

990
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,860
That reflux in the fighting between the Arabs and the Jews

991
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,780
That will be a temporary peace

992
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,120
But the word of God tells us

993
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,460
We can expect nothing but trouble and turmoil in the Middle East

994
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,620
Until our Lord returns to be the Prince of Peace

995
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,740
Bob

996
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:55,460
It's been known for some time that the fossil record contains several very pronounced mass extinctions

997
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,300
When large numbers of quite unrelated species

998
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:03,240
From all kinds of habitats appear to die out during a relatively short period

999
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,160
What they're saying is that you have say an asteroid about 10 kilometers across

1000
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,160
Impacting on the earth at a speed of about 40 kilometers a second

1001
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:20,320
And the energy involved in such a collision is equivalent to some unimaginable quantity

1002
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,220
Such as I think it's about 100 million megaton atomic bombs

1003
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,780
It's that sort of size of explosion

1004
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,740
Did you hear?

1005
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,040
Did you hear what he was saying?

1006
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,900
Did you hear what he was saying?

1007
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,520
If you can't get slack for yourself friend

1008
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,680
You sure as hell ain't gonna be able to give it to somebody else

1009
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,240
And that's just what they have you trying to do

1010
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,400
They

1011
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,100
The conspiracy

1012
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,440
Those who are trying to pull the wool over your eyes

1013
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,420
You can't think

1014
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,120
Everything's going wrong

1015
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,320
You're so tired

1016
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,660
The kids are driving you crazy

1017
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:07,400
Your spouse lost another job and is drinking again

1018
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,640
You're supposed to have an operation and you don't know where the money's gonna come from

1019
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,160
It just doesn't seem worth it anymore

1020
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,480
There's no one to talk to

1021
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,520
You don't know if you can hold up under all this

1022
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,860
You're not sure if you want to

1023
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,040
You're ashamed of the things you haven't done

1024
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,280
And you keep thinking about those pills

1025
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,420
Put a dog in a cage friend and he'll run away

1026
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,120
He'll run in circles

1027
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,600
Put a man in a cage and he'll run for president

1028
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,700
And it's the same thing

1029
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,820
It's the conspiracy dear friends

1030
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,140
And you can help fight the conspiracy

1031
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,340
By giving your money to KNON

1032
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,340
Yeah money that's what it comes down to every time

1033
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,620
And I could say something about money in the church of the subgenius

1034
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,540
But this is a public, public supported station

1035
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,780
And we don't want to

1036
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,160
We don't want to get into that totally

1037
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,540
But friends you know it's

1038
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,740
Church of the subgenius a joke

1039
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,060
Funny, funny, funny

1040
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,860
Ha ha ha ha ha

1041
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,060
Well I think it's time to

1042
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,680
Well I think it's time to stop for a while

1043
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,700
Because my headache's getting bad

1044
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,920
I'll put you another song on here okay?

1045
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:08,540
Alright

1046
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:20,080
One, two, three, four

1047
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,960
No lights

1048
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,660
No people

1049
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,220
No speak

1050
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,120
No people

1051
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,820
No cars

1052
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,520
No people

1053
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
No food

1054
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,000
No people

1055
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:53,580
Stop

1056
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,860
Shut

1057
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,720
Grinding holes

1058
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,060
Everything's coming to a grinding halt

1059
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,720
No sound

1060
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,320
No people

1061
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,040
No clocks

1062
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,720
No people

1063
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,460
No fine

1064
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:23,740
Behind

1065
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,240
No people

1066
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,460
Because there.

1067
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:28,640


1068
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,980
Cause I love you

1069
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:30,980


1070
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,440
No people

1071
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,960
Because I'm not

1072
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:33,960


1073
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:33,980


1074
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:33,980


1075
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:33,980


1076
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:33,980


1077
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,800
Shots

1078
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,400
Grinding holes

1079
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,540
Everything's coming to a grinding halt

1080
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:43,860
Ok

1081
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,160
Everything's coming to a grinding halt

1082
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,560
Ok

1083
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,020
This is how I his

1084
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:49,820
Mostly

1085
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:49,840
So

1086
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:49,920
Uh

1087
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,440
guitar solo

1088
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,840
Slow down

1089
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,600
Slow down

1090
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,780
Slow down

1091
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,840
Oh yeah

1092
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,180
I have no idea who sent that piece of music

1093
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,500
Everything's coming to a

1094
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,220
Everything's coming to a

1095
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,920
That's what it's coming to

1096
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,100
A grinding halt friends

1097
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,100
And that tape ran out

1098
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,720
I don't know who

1099
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,440
I don't know who did

1100
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:47,580
I don't know who did

1101
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:47,580


1102
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,580
That was sent to us from

1103
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,900
The Green Hell

1104
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,980
That's what we call

1105
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,540
The Dobstown 2 outpost in Malaysia

1106
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,420
Deep, deep in Malaysia

1107
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,600
Yes, you know

1108
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,020
You've heard of Jonestown

1109
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,780
In our own sick sort of

1110
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,740
Cosmic joke humor

1111
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,240
We decided to name our jungle encampment

1112
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:10,980
Dobstown

1113
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,560
And you think I'm kidding

1114
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,380
When I say there's a subgenius encampment

1115
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,460
In the jungles of Brazil

1116
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,460
Oh yeah

1117
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:17,920
Yeah

1118
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,120
Yeah

1119
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,600
Well there's more going on

1120
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,200
In that one little silly campground

1121
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,380
Than you've got going on

1122
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,920
In the whole city of Dallas

1123
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,480
When it comes

1124
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,580
And friends you can get more information on that

1125
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,300
If you just write to the number

1126
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,400
I'll give again at the end of the broadcast

1127
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,660
And once right now

1128
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,940
Got that pencil ready

1129
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,260
It's Bob dear friends

1130
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,780
J.R. Bob Dobbs

1131
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,420
Church of the subgenius

1132
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,280
At P.O. Box

1133
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,520
807

1134
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,060
Glen Rose, Texas

1135
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:46,680
76043

1136
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,460
Wild Ice

1137
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,600
Wild Ice

1138
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,980
And several of you

1139
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,220
Have called in and said

1140
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,440
I want to hear more Devo

1141
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,900
I want to hear more Captain Beefheart

1142
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,180
Well

1143
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,480
Well the thing is

1144
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,260
Devo and Captain Beefheart

1145
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,020
Are great

1146
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,600
But they were left

1147
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,440
A little bit

1148
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,920
I don't know

1149
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,940
You can't say that

1150
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,200
Nobody

1151
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,440
People of the world

1152
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:17,440


1153
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,180
Of that stature

1154
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,180
Don't get left behind

1155
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:19,720
Dear friends

1156
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,840
But you owe it

1157
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,580
To both

1158
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,840
To the spirit

1159
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,220
Represented by Devo

1160
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,300
And Captain Beefheart

1161
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:27,660
Both

1162
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,720
To pay attention

1163
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,640
To this tape

1164
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,480
I'm about to play

1165
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,820
By an Arkansas band

1166
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,160
Called Doctors for Bob

1167
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,020
Now you may think

1168
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:34,980
Oh well they're from

1169
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,000
They're from around here

1170
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,420
They can't be as cool

1171
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,640
As Devo

1172
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,520
Because they're from

1173
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,360
California

1174
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,420
Although they're actually

1175
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,120
From Akron

1176
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,000
Or Captain Beefheart

1177
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,420
Oh man

1178
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,740
He's got an album out

1179
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,580
He must be cool

1180
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,720
Doctors for Bob

1181
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,620
Don't have an album out

1182
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,860
They can't be cool

1183
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,420
No one who doesn't

1184
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,700
Have an album out

1185
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,540
Could possibly be cool

1186
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,140
You say

1187
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,000
Listen

1188
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,060
Listen to my tale then

1189
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,120
But why

1190
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,760
Why will you call me mad

1191
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,160
Could a madman

1192
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:07,860
Have written songs

1193
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,720
Such as these

1194
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,920
I think not

1195
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,360
I'm not mad

1196
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,100
I'm merely an ordinary person

1197
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:15,860
Seeking life

1198
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,260
Liberty

1199
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:16,560
And peace

1200
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,520
In the pursuit of happiness

1201
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,260
If my pursuit of happiness

1202
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,160
Includes machine gunning

1203
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,900
127 innocent children

1204
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,080
If that's mad

1205
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,720
Go ahead

1206
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,600
Lock me up

1207
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,600
Just because I enjoy

1208
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,440
Washing my face

1209
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,700
In the blood of infants

1210
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,100
Is that any reason

1211
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,040
To lock me up

1212
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,000
I think not

1213
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,280
I've even got

1214
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,040
A piece of paper

1215
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,220
That says my mind

1216
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:43,940
Is still okay

1217
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,500
Hell I bet that guy

1218
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,380
Down at the employment

1219
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:46,920
Agency

1220
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,320
Wouldn't give me a job

1221
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,400
Just cause I've been

1222
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,500
Locked up one time

1223
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,300
Bet he ain't got

1224
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:51,900
Those papers

1225
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,600
Says his mind

1226
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,340
Is still okay

1227
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,440
Hell

1228
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,160
But I tried to tell them

1229
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,260
It was not me

1230
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,220
It was the green energy demons

1231
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,960
But they merely laughed at me

1232
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,920
But now those

1233
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,460
Green energy demons

1234
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,060
Are ruling

1235
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,400
The planet

1236
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,380
They're not laughing

1237
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,380
And fighting so hard

1238
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,200
Now are they

1239
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,220
But that wasn't

1240
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,040
Nearly as bad

1241
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,960
As that time they

1242
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,540
Shocked the living

1243
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,980
Gee out of me

1244
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,400
I tried to explain

1245
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,300
It was not me

1246
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,680
It was the brain

1247
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,960
The brain of Arnold Palmer

1248
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,900
Which was controlling

1249
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,600
My mind

1250
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,720
Via laser beam

1251
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,700
Via the FBI

1252
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,020
Via the CIA

1253
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,740
Via the Communist Party

1254
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,980
Via satellite

1255
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,480
It was the demon

1256
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,380
The demon

1257
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,240
That forced me

1258
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,080
To do the deed

1259
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,700
But that wasn't nearly

1260
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,240
Dot dot dot

1261
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,240
But I

1262
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:41,960
It wasn't

1263
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,360
I'm not insane

1264
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,280
I'm more sane

1265
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:45,960
Than son of a bitch

1266
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:45,960


1267
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,280
Than son of Sam

1268
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,540
And Charles Manson

1269
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,160
Put together

1270
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,280
How many people

1271
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,160
Must I kill

1272
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,480
To prove I'm not insane

1273
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,920
But that wasn't

1274
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,860
Nearly as bad

1275
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,900
As that time they

1276
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,000
Shocked the living

1277
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,600
Gee out of me

1278
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,500
Well I didn't mind

1279
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,080
When they shocked

1280
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,480
The living

1281
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,500
Pee out of me

1282
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,360
In fact I kind of enjoyed it

1283
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:09,880
When they shocked

1284
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,360
The living

1285
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,520
Zee out of me

1286
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,500
I mean that time

1287
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,920
They ran over my face

1288
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,320
With a

1289
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,360
Pick up truck

1290
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,620
Oh yeah that was fun

1291
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,600
That time they cut me in half

1292
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,660
With barbed wire

1293
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,180
And then peeled a bandaid

1294
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:22,720
Off my

1295
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,080
My amputated arm

1296
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,740
Oh yeah that was fun

1297
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,940
That time they skinned me alive

1298
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,820
Then called me dirty names

1299
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,040
Woo ha

1300
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,420
That was a big ol' cocaine party

1301
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,480
That one time

1302
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,700
They converted my entire body

1303
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,500
Into a wall of membrane

1304
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,220
Whose only purpose

1305
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,440
Was to feel pain

1306
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,180
No that time they

1307
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,400
Converted my entire body

1308
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,500
Into a wall of membrane

1309
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,340
Attached to a human brain

1310
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,700
Whose only purpose

1311
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,880
Was to feel pain

1312
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:53,880
And then applied the flame

1313
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,060
Oh yeah that was fun

1314
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,480
That time they converted

1315
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,500
Every cell in my body

1316
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,900
To the same nerve endings

1317
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,360
Found in male testicles

1318
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,160
Enlarged each cell

1319
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,860
To the size of a sun

1320
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,980
And then inserted huge

1321
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,380
Sun sized dentist drills

1322
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,720
Into each of these

1323
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:20,380
Sun sized male testicle cells

1324
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,760
Woo ha

1325
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,540
That was the time of my life

1326
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,600
Compared to that time they

1327
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,660
Shocked the living

1328
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,300
Gee out of me

1329
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,680
Oh yes dear friends

1330
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,100
That's Doctors for Bob

1331
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,700
From Little Rock, Arkansas

1332
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,600
This song goes on and on and on

1333
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,180
But unfortunately cannot play

1334
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,820
The entire song

1335
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,220
Because it becomes

1336
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,380
A frontal lobotomy

1337
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:46,820
I'm okay

1338
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,300
You're a frontal lobotomy
