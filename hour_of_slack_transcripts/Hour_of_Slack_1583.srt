1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:21,540
4, 3, 2, 1.

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:21,960
1.

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,760
God is eating itself.

4
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,460
And we're the digestive enzymes.

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,280
We're here to taste.

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,120
Lick up, lick up, lick up, lick up.

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,220
That which is spilled before us.

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,400
Nothing more.

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,300
Just to turn one molecule into another.

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,380
Air to warmer air.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,860
Switch some bonds around.

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,040
God is eating itself.

13
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,460
And we are merely one of many enzymes.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,300
Yes.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,700
We work through shit.

16
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,460
We work through trees.

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
We work through urine.

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,580
And oh my lord, we work through peas.

19
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,120
We breathe it in.

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,160
We breathe it out.

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,700
There you go.

22
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,620
God is eating itself.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:08,440
And we are the digestive enzymes or the

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,440


25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,440


26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,440


27
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,940
Here we go.

28
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,140
Well...

29
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,280
Oh, is this off?

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,480
X-Day, brought to you by cigarettes.

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:58,880
Yay!

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,300
Get used to it.

33
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,380
X-Day, brought to you by madness.

34
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,880
Get used to it.

35
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,900
I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed.

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,340
Why?

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,700
Well, just taking on that typical mad scientist role.

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,260
I'm not a mad scientist.

39
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm, you know, mildly frustrated.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,340
Things could be, you know...

41
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,180
Eh.

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,340
We could use much more eh.

43
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,080
And more madness.

44
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,860
X-Day 19. Eh.

45
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,840
Buy your t-shirts now!

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,620
I'll sign them for you.

47
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,580
For $20.

48
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,120
Is everybody having fun looking at their phones?

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,840
You're missing out.

50
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,640
All the funds on the phone.

Baby Bear broke it.

55
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,180
I didn't do anything!

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,500
It's Baby Bear.

57
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,040
I know that shrill.

58
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,740
What was that, Baby Bear?

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,880
What?

60
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,560
What did you say?

61
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,620
I didn't do anything.

62
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,620
She didn't break it.

63
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,380
Yeah, right.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,220
I fixed it!

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, right.

66
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,900
That's what happened.

67
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,280
I believe her.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,820
X-Day, brought to you by internet.

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
Don't you put the dumb thing here.

70
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,560
Here, make fun of me.

71
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,520
Which dumb thing are you referring to?

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


73
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


75
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


79
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


81
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


83
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


84
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,520


85
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,880
All of this!

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,980
All of this!

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,620
How many subgeniuses does it take to light a cigarette?

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,360
Fill out your answer on your web form.

89
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,360
And vote for the best one.

90
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,620
To vote for Princess Wee, dial 1-800-411-321-1010-320.

91
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,260
Enter code 4479.

92
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,840
Charges will apply.

93
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm terrified.

94
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,520
I'm terrified.

95
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,520


96
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,520


97
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,140
I'm basing the entire subgenius text messaging system out of the Philippines.

98
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,000
So we're making all the money on the text messages going back out.

99
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,740
It's going to be great.

100
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,280
Wow.

101
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,300
Yes, dear friends.

102
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,520
And you guessed right.

103
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,140
We're finally playing some of this stuff recorded at 19X Day.

104
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,040
Last July.

105
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,580
When the world again failed to end.

106
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,080
But we did have a great party.

107
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,180
And I've got some, actually some randomly selected clips.

108
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:11,500
I haven't even really begun to tear into the, there's two video cameras, two audio recorders worth of everything.

109
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,120
And among all that stuff, there's some great things.

110
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,940
The first thing we heard tonight, that was Reverend Nugget ranting.

111
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,020
Yes.

112
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,320
Monday night at Caffeina's.

113
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,560
When the guitar work was by Reverend, well, Angry Lord Larry and Reverend Rock God.

114
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,240
Or maybe he's Lord Rock God.

115
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,600
They're all lords nowadays.

116
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:42,960
We heard a little bit of, oh, spouting around there with Reverend Fox, spelled F-A-U-X.

117
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:50,300
And Princess Wee and Baby Bear and Fidjuli and a bunch of those people from the Thorazine Urine Pod Crust.

118
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,540
There will be more of that in weeks and hours to come.

119
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:05,320
But now, well, our friend St. Andrew the Impaled, who has written and performed so many great songs at X Day, has a singing partner now.

120
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,500
The beautiful Reverend Amy M. Hum.

121
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,740
And here they are together.

122
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,280
Like I said, I wrote a bunch of songs, including this one.

123
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,020
It's called Half of the Beer.

124
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,740
Half of the Beer.

125
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Oh, is that what we're doing?

126
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,800
Yeah, you want to do Half of the Beer?

127
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,920
Yeah, I mean.

128
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,140
Oh, no, we should do the other one first.

129
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,040
No, it's okay.

130
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
We can do, yeah, let's do Half of the Beer.

131
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:29,700
Okay.

132
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,500
The other one requires you to play the ukulele.

133
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,240
It's okay.

134
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,140
It's fine.

135
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,700
All right.

136
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,540
I don't mean to bring you down, but I hate you.

137
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,280
And I can't live without you.

138
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,980
I can't live with you one more minute.

139
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,720
You cause nothing but strife since I made you my wife.

140
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,740
It's my life and I don't want you in it.

141
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,940
Don't think I'm at all put out.

142
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,900
Cause you're stupid.

143
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,560
And you can't even hold down a job.

144
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,260
Thought I was getting a man when I gave you a kiss.

145
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,860
I gave you my ham instead.

146
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,300
All I got was robbed.

147
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,880
Well, go on, get your things and go.

148
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,240
Just leave me half of the beer.

149
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,280
Then get your ass up out of here.

150
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,080
And oh, take the cat.

151
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,140
The cat?

152
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,520
I thought you liked the cat.

153
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,580
No.

154
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,120
No?

155
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,100
No.

156
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,100


157
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,100


158
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,100


159
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,160
Then why do we have a cat?

160
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,520
Fuck.

161
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,940
I'm really not quite sure why you'd think I'd be leaving.

162
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,700
After all, this is my place too.

163
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
Though I somewhat agree that someone has to leave.

164
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,120
That someone I believe should be you.

165
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,240
If you think I leave my place.

166
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,240


167
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,240


168
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,240


169
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,500
Then you're crazy.

170
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,240
Just look how my fingers are worn.

171
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:33,920
I did all this work while some lazy jerk just sat around all day watching porn.

172
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,740
So go on get your things and go.

173
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,180
Just leave me half of the beer.

174
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,200
Then get your ass up out of here.

175
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,780
Oh, that was really nice.

176
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,120
I mean, that was a really nice harmony.

177
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,600
Well, thank you.

178
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,260
I mean, you sing the notes right, so it makes it easy.

179
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,100
I still recall the day you first snookered me.

180
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,400
You got me with that lovely voice.

181
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,200
And for some reason you seemed like the girl of my dreams.

182
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,800
And really, I had no choice.

183
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,540
Well, it wasn't that easy for me.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,960
Cause you write songs.

185
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,120
The kind that get stuck in your head.

186
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,640
And it might seem absurd.

187
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,640
But the way you write words was enough to get me in your bed.

188
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,220
We both know we've been through months.

189
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,320
And it seems a mistake to waste it all.

190
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,340
Sometimes I miss your touch.

191
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,660
We were good at such.

192
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:06,360
If you recall, do you think that we could?

193
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,800
No, I don't think we should.

194
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,740
But it was epic.

195
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,100
Till it grew.

196
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,240
Grew septic.

197
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,260
I got bored.

198
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,800
And you often snore.

199
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,040
Wait, what?

200
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,180
I don't snore.

201
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,340
Oh, you snore.

202
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,420
Yeah.

203
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,400
So go on, get your things and go.

204
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,700
Just leave me half of the beer.

205
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,700
Then get your ass up out of here.

206
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,420
Cause this shit is done.

207
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,080
Yeah, go on, get your things and go.

208
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,420
Just leave me half of the beer.

209
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,260
Then get your ass up out of here.

210
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,120
Cause you are no fun.

211
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,080
Yeah, go on, get your things and go.

212
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,440
Just leave me half of the beer.

213
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,420
Then get your ass up out of here.

214
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,620
I'm seeing someone.

215
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,540
Wait, what?

216
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,680
Yeah, it's Bob, what the?

217
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,760
Uh.

218
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,600
Hey, you wanna trade mic so you can play the mic on that?

219
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:10,840
What?

220
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,260
Get under there already but I can'tester.

221
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,260


222
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,080
This is a mufti rock in Hawaii.

223
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,660
Oh, Blaine, is Biraz de Raya shining?

224
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:30,660


225
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:30,660


226
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:30,660


227
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:30,660


228
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:30,660


229
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:30,720
Always cold to look at you woe was fit the fuck out of fashion.

230
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:30,720


231
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,220
I like it because now I have the voice part.

232
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,220


233
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,720
Now this is me but I got suffers on my Monday.

234
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,160
Discord.

235
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,280
Discord.

236
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,640
your hand is not in the air.

237
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,460
Put your hand in the air.

238
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,820
Put your hand in the air.

239
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,440
And put your hand in the air.

240
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,480
Now on your hand, you will notice that you have some extremities.

241
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,660
I have five.

242
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,200
You may have a different number than me.

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:22,400
But let's see what happens when I take this one away.

244
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,000
That's how many nights I will have spent at X Day.

245
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,860
If I take one more away,

246
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:55,200
I have the amount of times I took a trip into town for supplies for X Day.

247
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,860
If I take one more away,

248
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,400
I have the amount of times I smoked out of a froth pipe covered with habanero pepper juice.

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,660
Yes!

250
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,400
And if I take more away

251
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,580
this number is also

252
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,280
the amount of times

253
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,260
I have seriously injured myself while at X day

254
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,260
with this gaping leg–vagina

255
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,300
and the burn on my hand.

256
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,600
TMительно

257
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:20,240
Not to mention the stress and pain for the last two days of sleeping on the cold hard

258
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:20,980
ground.

259
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,900
Kind of gets to you.

260
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,180
But if I take one more away.

261
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,940
This is how many.

262
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,540
This is exactly how many.

263
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,080
How many.

264
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,360
How many.

265
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,780
How many.

266
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:02,380
Right here is the amount of days until the end of the world.

267
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,980
I can count to this many.

268
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,960
And that's as high as I need to go.

269
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,480
I'm not just your average squeaky voice.

270
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,300
Shit faced.

271
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,240
Mother fucker.

272
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,640
From a buckle underneath the Bible belt.

273
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,660
No, it's not easy living on America's Wang.

274
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,940
It's not easy being on the sun spot.

275
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:47,980
On the dick of the country that the entire world knows is constantly waving around.

276
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,460
It's not easy dealing with hundreds of dicks all over the place.

277
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,160
110 degree heat with 5,000 percent humidity

278
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:08,960
It's not worth the pain and isolation of suffering at the hands of the conspiracy

279
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
But that's okay

280
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,440
Because it's just this many days until the end of the world

281
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,380
I

282
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,500
Registration is still open if you have not yet paid

283
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,440
And if you have paid

284
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,780
Pay again

285
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,040
It's worth it. I really

286
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,440
love

287
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:01,240
It you get a genuine feeling at the bottom of your heart every time you open up your wallet for Bob

288
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,080
Give until it hurts

289
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,700
Give until it really hurts

290
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,180
Give until you have only one thing left to give

291
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,220
And then get that too

292
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,500
Tonight

293
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,940
ismus

294
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,340
What's happening

295
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,360
apter

296
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:50,960
In speech

297
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,420
In a time of panic

298
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:14,720
Reverend Dr. Lord of Anger, Larence, has misplaced a mystical elixir which imbibes him with the

299
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,440
power to remove the souls from people who have not yet paid $35.

300
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:35,880
Dr. Hal has a notebook which contains the names of people that will not survive X-Day.

301
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,180
Ferg has a bag of froth.

302
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,100
That's gonna make it past X-Day.

303
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,060
Spike!

304
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,300
Well, he ran out of the whippets, but you could have had him anyway!

305
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,100
And Baby Bear,

306
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,540
you and that

307
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:14,700
family,

308
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,600
you and that fellow there,

309
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,840
with your beautiful complexion,

310
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,980
and I'm jealous of your hair,

311
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,600
and your gauges are bigger than mine,

312
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,640
and that makes me feel inadequate.

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:37,220
At least I know that I'm not the one that has to go home with the girl that I made cry when I raped Bob.

314
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,440
Sorry about that.

315
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,560
I'm sorry.

316
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:44,700
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,540
About saying rape,

318
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,340
not about raping Bob,

319
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,340
but by saying rape,

320
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,140
because that is ten times actually worse.

321
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,160
It's actually worse.

322
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,120
It's actually worse.

323
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
Down in the medicine fish hole.

324
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:42,080
in the medicine fish hole, down in the medicine fish hole, we were down in the medicine fish

325
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:49,360
Well, you may wonder what the Medicine Fish Hole is, and you'd wonder even more if you

326
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,620
were down in the Medicine Fish Hole because, well, it's full of medicine.

327
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,080
And fish!

328
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,060
The Medicine Fish Hole!

329
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,060
Down in the Medicine Fish Hole!

330
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:17,240
You see, there's this hole behind the couch where Medicine Mom keeps the medicine.

331
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:27,900
And when the good bad Sandy or the good bad Tavis or any good bad kid is bad or good and

332
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:35,040
gets hurt or sick, they go down in the medicine fish hole.

333
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,040


334
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,240
Down in the medicine fish hole.

335
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,600
Down in the medicine fish hole.

336
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:53,700
And see, like I said, there's medicine in there, but there's also fish because even

337
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:01,060
though it's behind the couch, there's this, at some point there must have been blood because

338
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,040
there's a barbed wire fence that's, you know, it's a barbed wire fence.

339
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,040


340
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,700
And it's got, I guess, got washed down the creek, slammed into this big rock, and somehow

341
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,180
got folded into kind of a fish trap.

342
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,840
It's like a barrel made of barbed wire that somehow got accidentally formed from a broken

343
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,820
piece of fin.

344
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,200
It's been stuck up against that rock for, I don't know how long.

345
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,000
And it tends to trap fish.

346
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,620
It's full of fish and medicine.

347
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,480
That's where the medicine mom puts the medicine.

348
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,960
And I know some of you take medicine.

349
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,580
I know that happens.

350
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:52,960
I know that you, somebody out there, you have been down in the medicine fish hole.

351
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,720
Down in the medicine fish hole.

352
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,000
So yeah, you don't know what's going to happen in the medicine fish hole.

353
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,360
There's going to be medicine.

354
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,240
There might be side effects.

355
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,580
It's probably going to be good medicine, but you've got to be careful.

356
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,440
You know, sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.

357
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,700
No telling what's going to happen down in that hole.

358
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,680
Did you go down?

359
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,920
In the medicine fish hole?

360
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,500
Now did you?

361
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,080
I know some people went down there tonight.

362
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:36,880
Oh yes.

363
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,220
You can't fool me, kids.

364
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,840
I know the how it, because I can smell the fish.

365
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,340
It's kind of stinky down in the medicine fish hole.

366
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,700
But it is, after all, the medicine fish hole.

367
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,300
Thank you.

368
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,900
Thank you.

369
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,120
Thank you.

370
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,120


371
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,240
We need to get him out first, all right!

372
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,500
They are going to be able to get you out of here, when you come down it's going

373
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:05,500


374
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:05,500


375
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:12,080
We want to make sure you will, some medicine has to have some prison canceled

376
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:22,380
or then you will be released by force.

377
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,700
And there we go.

378
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,600
¶¶

379
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,240
¶¶

380
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,100
¶¶

381
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
¶¶

382
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:37,360
Yes, dear friends, that was a wonderful Wotan jam, you might say,

383
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,300
there that we just heard with the kazoos,

384
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,080
the beautiful kazoo duet by Reverend Anna Maul

385
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,080
and Reverend A.P. O'Stacey.

386
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,300
There were other people involved there,

387
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,580
I think Dr. Shoggoth and Reverend...

388
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,400
Reverend Hazel of the Windmills on different guitars

389
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,160
or electric ukulele in one case.

390
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,700
They were also playing on the Medicine Fish Hole Wotan song there.

391
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,780
Keyboards we have heard and will hear in the background

392
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,920
came from Doc Cosmack.

393
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,840
And bass playing was at different times

394
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,400
by Reverend Bover or Reverend Pease

395
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,580
or Reverend Fowler.

396
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,000
Or Reverend Sinfaltimus Ex Mortis,

397
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,820
who I think was playing on that rant.

398
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,960
He and Angry Larry and Lord Rockstar

399
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,060
were playing on that rant that Reverend Fox did

400
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,260
about his visit to Ex Day.

401
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,640
Did I mention Fid Chooley was on drums a lot of the time?

402
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,280
People just rotated all over the place.

403
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,780
Almost every night we had jamming,

404
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,560
either at...

405
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,580
at the stage, main stage,

406
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,160
which was kind of outdoors,

407
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,040
or when we thought it was going to rain in Caffeinas,

408
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,740
which is kind of indoors.

409
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,480
Now, our friend called a minute ago, Princess Wee.

410
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,060
Yes.

411
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,480
And then he gave up.

412
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,840
Oh, no.

413
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,680
Because he called five minutes too early.

414
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,420
No.

415
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,580
So...

416
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,160
Dave.

417
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,920
Here.

418
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,240
I shall call him.

419
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,840
You know, you shan't,

420
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,180
because you don't have your phone.

421
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:24,940
Oh, that's right.

422
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:25,640
Yeah, right.

423
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,120
So, here, you can use my phone,

424
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,420
which has a special...

425
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,500
Praise Reverend Stang's phone.

426
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,640
Here, let's just listen to some music.

427
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,120
Thank you.

428
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,600
Thank you.

429
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,040
Thank you.

430
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,880
Thank you.

431
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,300
Thank you.

432
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,420


433
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,060
Thank you.

434
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:48,660


435
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,500
Thank you.

436
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,260
Thank you.

437
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,260


438
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:50,980
Thank you.

439
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,100
Thank you.

440
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,440
Thank you.

441
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,620
Why would he even bother with a song like that?

442
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,120
Who cares?

443
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,120
It's a terrible song, man.

444
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,320
Why would he even do that?

445
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,140
I do kind of know that this will not be on the radio.

446
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,820
Obviously.

447
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,080
Oh, except for maybe the XXX version.

448
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,500
We do those kind of shows, but you don't hear them on the broadcast show stations.

449
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,580
This is Lord Angry Larry or Angry Lord Reverend Larry or something.

450
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,460
And Lord Reverend Rock God, son of Sinfaltimus.

451
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,480
Oh, yeah.

452
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,560
Oh, yeah.

453
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,320
Oh, yeah.

454
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,320
Oh, yeah.

455
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,760
Oh, yeah.

456
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:38,640
Oh, yes, dear friends.

457
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,140
I think all the music that we'll be hearing in the background tonight is from X-Day.

458
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,000
And this is from Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

459
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,800
Yes, the old nasal God humper.

460
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,680
The old nasal God humper.

461
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,760
Not the only one, mind you.

462
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:58,880
No.

463
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,100
No.

464
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,700
There was a rant earlier tonight about a God.

465
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,480
I thought that I intuited that on the airwaves.

466
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,100
God eats.

467
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,180
Yes.

468
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,580
Yes.

469
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,940
God eats or God hates us.

470
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,140
No, I don't think he hates us.

471
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,480
Actually, I think he just sort of sits back and watches the show.

472
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,180
I think he kick-started the whole thing and then just sat back and went, oh, God, look at this.

473
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,280
Yeah.

474
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,500
Self-referential.

475
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,000
Wasn't it something like God is eating himself and we're the digestive enzymes or something?

476
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,580
That's right.

477
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,380
That's right.

478
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,980
There was Reverend Nugget's rant.

479
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,620
It's exciting to relive parts of X-Day.

480
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,220
Oh, it is.

481
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,400
It is.

482
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:48,320
Often they sound better to my deafened ears in the headphones than they did in real life.

483
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Although there were several times when I was the only person who could really hear what was going on because I had the headphones.

484
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:07,260
We had an equipment breakdown on the very last night and I could record vocals, but they weren't amplified.

485
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,700
Mm-hmm.

486
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:08,820
Mm-hmm.

487
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,340
Oh, ho.

488
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,780
Those were some of the best ones.

489
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:19,400
So, yeah, Dave, I'm glad I didn't pick up the phone when you first called because that wasn't you.

490
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,360
Yeah, that's a good thing because I wasn't on the phone there because it was too early.

491
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:34,600
Because even though I am slightly misshapen, did you know that God believes that we're like the geese that they make patated foie gras out of?

492
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,580
And that's why they shove our pancreas full of stones.

493
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,560
No.

494
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:45,200
And then that way God can eat us like the way French people eat patated foie gras.

495
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,980
Now, I'm not saying this is a legitimate answer to any question that you might have posed in the future or the past.

496
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,360
Because I know that you're, you know, into time control.

497
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,660
The church is so geese, you think, oh, time control.

498
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,880
Well, we're big on talking about it.

499
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,940
Yeah.

500
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,900
We talk a big time control, yeah.

501
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:06,920
Yeah.

502
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,740
Yeah, sure.

503
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,680
You talk a good game.

504
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:11,880
You talk a good game.

505
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:22,240
Speaking of talking a good game, we got a letter from a prisoner this week who had mentioned that, well, we get a lot of letters from prisoners that have no money in them.

506
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,200
And they heard we were, you know, good marks to hit up or something.

507
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,000
I don't know.

508
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:36,200
But this particular prisoner in Texas has been listening to Hour of Slack on his iPad.

509
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,160
That's his iPad.

510
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,820
A relative gave it.

511
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,140
It's his only way of reaching the outside world.

512
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,560
And he mentioned in his letter, he said, no offense, but my favorite part of Hour of Slack is Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

513
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,640
And that's the second such letter I've gotten.

514
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,400
Unsolicited.

515
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,820
Unless it's really that Dave controls the media.

516
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,580
That would explain it.

517
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,900
Dave probably controls the media.

518
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,020
That's why they only say nice things about him.

519
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,360
Well, you know, I am Fortagonian, and they say that the Fortagonians control.

520
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,840
The media with their eyelids.

521
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,840
Right.

522
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,940
And that's why I was a foreskin myself.

523
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,800
Well, the way I look at it.

524
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,780
They're all different body parts.

525
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:22,760
You know, you have to know how to control each body part perfectly well to get the polystyrene action going that way.

526
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,560
And then you go, it's like tentacles.

527
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,320
Like, you ever see the movie The Godfather?

528
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,420
The logo for, like, the puppet hands and stuff?

529
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,780
Oh, no.

530
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,000
The logo for the puppet hands?

531
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,900
Well, no.

532
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,540
The puppet hand logo.

533
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,380
It's like.

534
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,580
The movie The Godfather.

535
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,020
Oh, right.

536
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,580
The poster.

537
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,000
Yeah.

538
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,020
Yeah, the poster.

539
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,360
And it has, like, you know, puppets.

540
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,140
Not puppet hands.

541
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,640
Strings.

542
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,700
Puppet strings.

543
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,500
How could I get confused between puppets and between strings and hands?

544
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,840
Because everybody knows that these mandibles we use are not strings.

545
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,280
I'm sorry.

546
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,100
But, yes, that's how we control minds.

547
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:07,940
Well, I figure if they control all of the media, then they must be pretty smart and probably should be world overlord.

548
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:20,120
If they, you know, if they're that swuffed that they can control everything in the media, except, of course, there's some uncontrollables like Rush, I guess.

549
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,620
But nobody's really paying much attention to him anymore.

550
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:30,620
Because you just turn on the TV and you've got crazy guys screaming at you any time.

551
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,080
Not just him.

552
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,940
Lots of them.

553
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,500
Yeah, lots of them.

554
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,420
I've noticed that, too.

555
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,380
Like, you just.

556
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,680
I used to just go.

557
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,700
Go take the dial and just swing it from left all the way to right.

558
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,980
And you'd hear, like, there would be a little breakup from the middle of the sentence.

559
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:54,020
And you'd go to another channel, another station, and there would be the same amount of garbage and the same type of garbage flowing from that entity.

560
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,880
And it was just incredible how unfree.

561
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,220
Unfree.

562
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,220
Yes, that's right, friends.

563
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,540
I said it out loud in dirty language.

564
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,940
Unfree.

565
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,960
Our First Amendment.

566
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,160
Yes.

567
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,120
Why?

568
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:23,260
But what's so amazing about the fact that the liberals completely and utterly control the media is that the people who learn that get that news from the media.

569
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,400
And usually not exactly liberal slanted talk shows, either.

570
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:36,060
So there's certain contradictions in here that cause a pain between my ears.

571
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,420
It is a bit of a conundrum.

572
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,020
Yes.

573
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,040
Can I tell you a short, I'll try and be as brief as I can, story about this controlling the liberal media?

574
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,240
Take off your briefs and whip it out.

575
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,560
Okay, baby.

576
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,540
Daddy-o.

577
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:55,780
Well, this right-wing talk show host had a lady on her.

578
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,440
Apparently, they didn't screen her very well.

579
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,800
She was a professor of Indiana University in Pennsylvania.

580
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,860
There is such a place and such a university.

581
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,260
It's not the university of, I don't know.

582
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,600
It's the one where you know it's from.

583
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,480
Pennsylvania, Indiana, Pennsylvania and not Indiana.

584
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:21,640
Anyway, he got her on and he wanted to know about, well, we heard that the liberal media controls her, that the liberal is liberal and stuff like that.

585
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:33,360
And apparently what she did was she took a study of thousands of regular network TV shows and examined encapsulation and shots.

586
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,660
As you know, if you shoot somebody from above, it creates a problem.

587
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:37,660


588
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:37,660


589
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,560
It's a certain thing in the listener.

590
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,980
If you shoot somebody from under, that creates another ethos.

591
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,880
Right, sure.

592
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,200
And she went to NBC and CBS and ABC and they're all shooting to make liberals look bad.

593
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,000
And the guy was freaking out because she had all the stacks and the stats with her.

594
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:06,700
And he was flipping because he didn't want to accept the fact that the opposite was true, that all the media, which is owned by very, very wealthy people.

595
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,320
I guess people don't understand that either.

596
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,340
Except for this one right here, which we're doing pretty good, I understand, but we're not wealthy.

597
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,400
I mean, we're kind of.

598
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:22,840
Well, I think you can hear this college radio station at least for four miles radius.

599
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,200
Something like that.

600
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,600
Yeah, we can hear it from four miles away.

601
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,080
Well, then there's the Internet and 25 people can listen on the Internet.

602
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,200
So there you go.

603
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,620
But this actually is not necessarily a liberal control.

604
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,520
It's not a controlled station.

605
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,260
It's at a state university.

606
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:47,220
It is an ignored station for the most part by the university, thankfully.

607
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:48,840
Yeah.

608
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,780
It's not an ignoramus station by any means.

609
00:39:52,480 --> 00:40:03,480
But, yeah, most of your media is actually driven more by advertising needs than anything else.

610
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,260
Yeah.

611
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,520
They can make a lot of money.

612
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:13,060
They can make a lot of money off of people who are sitting around in their seedy apartment,

613
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:23,540
hating all those retired or permanently unemployed people that got nothing better to do than listen to the talk radio

614
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,960
or watch the talkers on TV and the walkers on TV.

615
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,540
Pretty soon they become walkers.

616
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,640
Walkers for Trump.

617
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,160
That was my Halloween costume at last Christmas.

618
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,920
Did you know that?

619
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,180
Yeah.

620
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,580
Didn't walkers for Trump?

621
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,220
Yeah.

622
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,700
Yeah.

623
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,040
I made a sign that said walkers for Trump.

624
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:48,960
And then I got a zombie mask so I'd look like one of those walkers in The Walking Dead show.

625
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:56,600
And I found a walker that old people use to help them limp.

626
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,040
And I taped the sign walkers for Trump to that.

627
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,060
And then I had my zombie mask on.

628
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,600
That's what I did at X Day and Star Wars.

629
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:05,900
Yes.

630
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,640
It was X Day and Star Wars.

631
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:07,820
It was X Day and Star Wars.

632
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,080
Not Christmas, which is what you said the first time.

633
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,760
Well, I liked it that way.

634
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,220
I liked it that way, too.

635
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,980
You just like to dangle the little Christmas balls from your tree.

636
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,760
I like balls.

637
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,700
Little Christmas balls.

638
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,480
Little shiny balls.

639
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,420
Cheery little Christmas balls.

640
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,180
Dangling from the tree and tinkling.

641
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,780
There's always tinkle.

642
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,160
In fact, the balls smell slightly of tinkle, too.

643
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,960
Isn't that fun?

644
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,980
It's tinkle, tinkle balls.

645
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,460
It's a good thing you don't have to lecture tomorrow.

646
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,100
It's a state university of you know what.

647
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,620
You know what I do have to do?

648
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,860
I have to go get hearing aids tomorrow.

649
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,280
Hearing aids?

650
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,280
So is Princess We.

651
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,200
We're both going in and getting hearing aids.

652
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,120
Jase, we're going to see if it is appropriate for us to be wearing the machine in our ears.

653
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,880
They're very, very, they're made to look invisible lately.

654
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,280
Well, I don't care how they look.

655
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,780
I just care how they sound.

656
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,260
Princess We and I are hoping to find out what it is.

657
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,180
We've been arguing about all these years.

658
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,340
Because we don't really hear what each other is saying.

659
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,700
Just crabbing away.

660
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,380
We're about equal.

661
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,360
It's sad.

662
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:25,360
She has to, when we go for walks, she has to be on my left.

663
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,680
Because that's the only side of my head where the ears work.

664
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,220
Well, it's good.

665
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,980
It's a good thing you've got two or three, four ears on the left side of your head.

666
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,240
Right.

667
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,440
Because the ones on the right side don't work at all.

668
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,280
And there you have, like, what, 20 of them just hanging there.

669
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:43,940
Right.

670
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,360
And not one of them works.

671
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,380
They're all deep.

672
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,060
I honest to God, I thought it was the headphones.

673
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,400
I thought that all the headphones in the station and at my house just all had a really weak right channel.

674
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,300
So I could tell by the VU meters that they were the same volume.

675
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,080
But they obviously weren't sounding that way.

676
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,320
They had to have been broken.

677
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,000
Why was that ear so quiet?

678
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,440
Have you ever tried sucking all the wax out of it and perhaps maybe giving it to the poor people?

679
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,200
Yeah, I tried the wax candling, you know, because those create such intense suction.

680
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,600
And it actually sucks the ear wax out of your head.

681
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,760
That's believable, right?

682
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,940
So I was told, yeah.

683
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,760
Have you ever tried one?

684
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,400
Have you ever done the ear candling?

685
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:27,760
No, it cost too much money.

686
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,720
But I went out there to the place, to a health food store that claimed they did it.

687
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,220
And then she said how much it was going to cost.

688
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,940
And I went, oh.

689
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,300
OK.

690
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,820
Well, you know, you can buy the candle for a dollar.

691
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,340
And the way it works is you hold it up to your ear and light the end of it.

692
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:51,520
And by golly, there's some wax at the bottom of that melting wax-covered paper.

693
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,280
And that must have come out of your ear because the great suction that a giant cone makes when a little fire is burning on one end.

694
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:04,980
And the funny thing is when there's no ear there, it sucks ear wax out of the ghosts and spirits.

695
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,220
That's how you know it works because it does the same thing whether there's an ear next to it or not.

696
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,620
There's still a little ear wax there.

697
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,320
You can just see it.

698
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,960
Oh, well, then I'm glad I didn't go back to the bank and get a bunch of money.

699
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,680
Yeah, if you believe in ear candling, then I say vote for Trump.

700
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,360
They go hand in hand.

701
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:30,440
And don't let your kids ever be vaccinated because, frankly, we don't want your kids voting either 20 years from now.

702
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,620
If that's even allowed.

703
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,160
And that's true, too.

704
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,980
That is true.

705
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,320
That's the last thing we'd like to see because we would be another non-functional, useless pair of pipe.

706
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,820
What do you call it, Seth?

707
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:49,140
If that were true, because imagine what Trump is going to do when he gets in there and he hears about the Church of the Subgenius.

708
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
It'll be huge.

709
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:59,360
Well, you know, some people say that obviously he is what you call a rogue subgenius who is just adding chaos.

710
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,580
But I think they're being a little charitable to the guy.

711
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,540
Yeah.

712
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,820
I think he's just exactly what he sounds.

713
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,240
Like, oh, well, it's not a nightmare.

714
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,300
It's not a strange party sound.

715
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, right.

716
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:21,560
I wish he would quit, too, because he actually every once in a while says a few things that are right.

717
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,100
I think that's how they further obfuscate this.

718
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,300
This re-erection of that's when it's being sarcastic.

719
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,140
No, no.

720
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,020
He was being sarcastic when he was right.

721
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:30,940
Duh.

722
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,520
Can't you even tell?

723
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,780
Don't you even know what sarcasm is?

724
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,740
Go live.

725
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,980
The guards are so stooped.

726
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,180
They're so stooped, I can't believe it.

727
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,620
So is sarcasm.

728
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:48,840
I thought it was really, really wild when they were attacking NAFTA, which they forced on everybody.

729
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,500
They forced on the Democratic Party.

730
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,460
And NAMCO.

731
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,380
I mean, Clinton signed it, but he wasn't the author of it.

732
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,540
It was Newt Gingrich.

733
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,060
And so when Newt Gingrich is talking about Trump, all of a sudden, they're going to turn over that dirty, rotten NAFTA.

734
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,980
Just like he wasn't the guy who did it.

735
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:05,980


736
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,200
He did it.

737
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,720
And I talked to somebody at work about it, and they said, well, you know how politics are.

738
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,600
People just lie.

739
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,480
And I said, jeez, yeah, I guess that's true.

740
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,180
Yeah, they lied to each other to make each other feel real good about how everything's going to,

741
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,520
how those others are going to get what they deserve.

742
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,300
The others.

743
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,500
Those others.

744
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,620
They all hate the others.

745
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,020
They live right next door to us, too.

746
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:35,340
You can see them being all happy and singing and dancing merrily.

747
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,460
And just enjoying themselves when they're part of the evil Eve.

748
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,880
Socialist conspiracy.

749
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,680
They all hate Jesus because they don't want to have a big old fight right now.

750
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,020
Let's blow up the world in the name of Christ.

751
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,060
Criminy.

752
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,220
Criminy.

753
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,240
Praise criminy.

754
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:56,840
Criminy.

755
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,180
Criminently.

756
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,120
I had a dream, Dave.

757
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,580
Oh, no.

758
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,700
Yeah, well, it was prompted by.

759
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:15,840
I have a bad habit of looking at about 10 different kinds of Internet news sites in a row.

760
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:25,000
And I'm used to seeing a certain thing right there on the front page every day on every one of those sites.

761
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,720
So I turned, I was looking at, I think, Yahoo News or something.

762
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,720
And there wasn't the thing that I always see there wasn't there.

763
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,240
There wasn't a picture of Trump.

764
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:35,880
And there wasn't.

765
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,960
There wasn't an article about it.

766
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,980
And that's when I had my vision or my dream.

767
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:54,620
I thought, OK, he's decided that all of his supposed troubles are entirely invented and cooked up by the media, which is hand run by the senile, demented Hillary Clinton.

768
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,240
Right.

769
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,560
That all makes sense.

770
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,480
She's dying and senile.

771
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,640
And so.

772
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,220
But she cleverly controls.

773
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,360
Well, pretty much everything.

774
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:05,980
All Republicans.

775
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,880
OK.

776
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,560
And so Trump has been saying that, you know, all the media is the lowest thing in the whole world.

777
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,940
I'm sure he wouldn't.

778
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,480
He doesn't include Breitbart or a judge reporting that.

779
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,560
But those don't have pictures of him.

780
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,640
Actually, if you look at those, they don't have the Trump news.

781
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,940
They only have the evil Hillary news.

782
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:34,480
Now, my dream was, what if the evil overlords who actually do control all the media.

783
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:46,480
Decided that they really were tired of Trump calling them names and just agreed amongst themselves for three days next week.

784
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,620
Let's not put anything about Trump on our front pages.

785
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:51,940
Nothing.

786
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,420
No matter what he does.

787
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:53,960
That's crazy.

788
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:00,440
So that when he gets up in the morning, he has that same experience I did with the thing that's always there isn't there.

789
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,320
If he was not on the front pages of all those news.

790
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,900
Sites for three days in a row.

791
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,740
What might he do to get attention?

792
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:17,180
So, in other words, if the media wanted to, they could goad the guy into doing something so crazy.

793
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:17,580
Yeah.

794
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,820
They'd have to put him back on the front page.

795
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,860
That's brilliant.

796
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,060
That was the dream or that was an actual kind of strategy.

797
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,820
Well, I should probably call up the masters of all the media, which I think are named.

798
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,680
Their names are Bill and Hillary, according to everything.

799
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,160
I've been.

800
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,100
Reading in the comments section all day.

801
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:36,840
Yeah.

802
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,620
They're also Patagonian, too.

803
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,100
Yeah.

804
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:39,800
Yeah.

805
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:45,980
And they founded Patagonia anyway, even though they even though it was founded long before their birth.

806
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,240
Yeah.

807
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,140
It's their responsibility because of their weakness.

808
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,120
They allowed that to happen before they were powerful.

809
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:54,100
Yeah.

810
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,120
So it's all their fault.

811
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,920
It's all everybody else's fault.

812
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:03,320
It doesn't have anything to do, listener, with your drinking, your lack of education.

813
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:10,040
Your inability to hold down a conversation, have a conversation without using four letter words, every other word.

814
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:14,840
None of those are the reason you're angry, fearful and miserable.

815
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,440
It's all the other guy's fault.

816
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:24,940
And by the other guy, I mean all the other guys and girls, especially the girls.

817
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:33,120
They the girls and the sissies have been oppressing the big tough men so long now.

818
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,800
That the big tough men have turned into girls and sissies.

819
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,020
They can't do anything but why.

820
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,560
And the girls and sissies have become big and tough.

821
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,160
It's like it's upside down.

822
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,180
It's terrible.

823
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,680
It's emasculating.

824
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,140
It is.

825
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,980
It's a horrible feeling to wake up and look down upon yourself and see nothing there where there used to be three things.

826
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,480
Big tough white men are being beaten by little old ladies with senile dementia.

827
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,360
It's right there.

828
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:02,680
They're socially.

829
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,080
And want to give you something for free.

830
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:10,500
And everybody knows that's the worst thing you can do to give to do for anybody is giving something for free.

831
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,120
That's crazy.

832
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:11,780
Like a free education.

833
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,780
That's just what they want you to do.

834
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,460
That's horrible.

835
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,100
That's just what they want you to do.

836
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,420
Why would you want to give anybody a free education or or cure them free?

837
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,260
That's they have to pay.

838
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,200
Jesus would be sickened.

839
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,260
He would be absolutely disgusted by these socialists.

840
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:32,140
Disgusted the idea of free education, free anything.

841
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:32,780
Free medicine.

842
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,660
Free fish or loves.

843
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,200
What?

844
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:36,340
What?

845
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,460
You think these fishes loves just come from magic?

846
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:39,620
Yeah.

847
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,760
You think these tax cuts are just going to come from?

848
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,840
Man, why do you think you're not all each getting an individual loaf and a fish?

849
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,440
Right.

850
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,140
Because, you know, this costs a pretty penny.

851
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,820
I mean, not as far as, you know, glamorous looks or anything.

852
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,120
That's just a giveaway to people who don't want to work.

853
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,400
They just want the loaves and fishes, but they don't want to go fishing.

854
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,180
Yeah.

855
00:51:59,360 --> 00:51:59,760
Welters.

856
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,220
They call.

857
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,280
I'm.

858
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:01,620
I'm.

859
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,920
I gave that guy fishing.

860
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,280
Paul.

861
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:08,000
And the next day he came back and said he broke it and he wanted me to fix him some more fish.

862
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:08,680
Yeah.

863
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,280
And all they want to do is stay in their mother's basement and smoke frap all day.

864
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,360
That sounds good.

865
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,760
I want to do that, too.

866
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,820
No, that's horrible.

867
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:22,660
Oh, that's getting free medicine or free food or, you know, like if you're starving and somebody gives you a sandwich.

868
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,200
What is wrong with those people?

869
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,020
Oh, and here's what's even worse.

870
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,720
My mother, there's there's no basement at my mother's house.

871
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,460
Oh, well, what?

872
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,640
We have to live in the whole house.

873
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,860
My mother doesn't even live in my mother's house or my father.

874
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,020
We live in there in that house now.

875
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,520
And there's no basement for us to sit and collect welfare in.

876
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,320
So I'm still having to work.

877
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,640
I'm going to be mailing out subgenius membership packs till the day I die.

878
00:52:52,420 --> 00:53:02,540
And since I've got senile dementia, which is proved by the fact that there's a picture of me stumbling once, that means that means that, you know, that.

879
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,320
I guess that's it.

880
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,280
That's the end of the world.

881
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,660
Everybody's just going to take everything for free from me.

882
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,160
No way.

883
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,160
I can hardly.

884
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,320
And I'm confused again.

885
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,540
But it doesn't matter.

886
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,340
I don't care.

887
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:23,020
As the great orange man said, Obama founded ISIS.

888
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:32,000
And the man said, no, he hates ISIS and he's killing members of it right now as we speak.

889
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,840
I don't care.

890
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,900
He founded ISIS.

891
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,040
And that's the point.

892
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,180
The key sentence.

893
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,520
I don't care.

894
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,540
Yeah, I said so.

895
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,380
I don't care what happened or didn't happen.

896
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,120
It's what I said that counts.

897
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,960
Don't trouble me with the facts.

898
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,780
Yeah, probably not with facts.

899
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,100
Right.

900
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,000
That is correct.

901
00:53:52,680 --> 00:54:01,480
Because facts only confuse people and get them to become malingerers and people that want free food stamps and free medicine and free education.

902
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,900
You know, you've got to.

903
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,660
You've got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, even if you don't have any feet.

904
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,860
I heard somebody the other afternoon say, well, how can you pull yourself up by your bootstraps?

905
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,740
You don't have any boots.

906
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,460
And I thought, well, dude, a lot of people don't have any feet.

907
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,460
And I thought if we could only get everybody two or three feet, that would be enough.

908
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,680
You know, just a couple inches would even work.

909
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,380
So true.

910
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,220
So, so true.

911
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,740
And so out of the left, we am pure.

912
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,180
And yeah, it's stupid.

913
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,620
That's what I say.

914
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,300
She ain't got no legs.

915
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,920
You can't say that.

916
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,820
Legs are on fire.

917
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:41,540
Sorry.

918
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:50,140
Well, even though it was originally said by a preacher and that guy ripped it off, then if we say it, then we're ripping that guy off.

919
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,440
But Dave was talking about not having any feet, so I just had to say it.

920
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,140
Well, you don't want to plagiarize any preachers, even if they're subgenius preachers.

921
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:58,760
Okay, sorry.

922
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,820
You might want to punch them in the belly button.

923
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:01,360
I'm sorry.

924
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:01,660
What's up?

925
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:01,960
What's up?

926
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:01,960


927
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,480
What's up?

928
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:02,480


929
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:02,760
What's up?

930
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:02,880
What's up?

931
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:02,880


932
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:02,900


933
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:02,900


934
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:02,900


935
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:02,900


936
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:02,900


937
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:02,980
What's up?

938
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:02,980


939
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,280
You talk about Youngstown, Bodies With No Feet.

940
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:05,840
Yes.

941
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,200
No, I didn't.

942
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
I'm totally unaware of that song.

943
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:09,880
Yeah.

944
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,040
It wasn't on any of their conspiracy albums.

945
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,700
It's called Otto Modown.

946
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,080
Right.

947
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:15,980
Otto Modown.

948
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:21,320
You probably heard more covers of it on this show than the original Otto Modown.

949
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,920
I've heard of Otto Modown.

950
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,360
Yeah.

951
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,220
But I didn't know it was about the connectigating snakes of Youngstown.

952
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,460
Yeah, it was about the corruptigating snakes of Youngstown, basically.

953
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,840
And gang wars and murders and all that.

954
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:44,920
But, you know, I turned off our background music because it was coming to a song.

955
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,300
A song.

956
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:53,440
It was one of the first songs that was performed or recorded last X-Day drill.

957
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,960
The 21st X-Day drill or 19 X-Day.

958
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,340
That special song.

959
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,340
Well, it's a song everybody asks for.

960
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,580
This is a nose drill you're talking about.

961
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,640
The kind that's used on the pineal gland.

962
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,280
Where you just put it right between the third eye there.

963
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,200
No, that's a different recording.

964
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,500
I did play.

965
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,620
I'm glad you heard about my nose flute playing.

966
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,100
I did play nose flute quite a bit at X-Day.

967
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,400
But that's not what this is.

968
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,320
In fact, I don't think I was there to hear it.

969
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,080
But I was there to record it.

970
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,280
My recorder was laying on a chair catching all this.

971
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,700
Anyway, it's Freebird.

972
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,380
It's the subgenius Freebird.

973
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,440
That's another thing Jesus would hate would be Freebirds.

974
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,420
You've got to work by your bootstraps if you want to earn a bird or two.

975
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,980
But, yeah, this is, let's see now.

976
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,200
What band is this?

977
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,440
I believe that the main culprits in this case.

978
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,840
This is Wednesday night.

979
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,800
We had not set up any real recording stuff.

980
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:57,000
Just the people who were there early started jamming with their equipment.

981
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:57,740
They couldn't help themselves.

982
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,480
There was a little PA.

983
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,320
I think the main guitar player.

984
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,880
The main player and singer here is Dr. Shoggoth.

985
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:09,780
But, and Reverend Hazel of the Windmills.

986
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,200
I'm not sure who's playing drums.

987
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,660
But I know the drums were a box.

988
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,700
A large wooden box made for that purpose.

989
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,140
Yes.

990
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,580
He sat on a drum.

991
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,160
Anyway, here.

992
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:21,680
Box drum.

993
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,360
Dave, we have to go because the show is over.

994
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,280
It's two minutes till ten.

995
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,100
And the song is two minutes long.

996
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,460
Okay, well, I'll listen on the other end.

997
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,060
And Pokemon.

998
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:31,440
Go.

999
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,660
Oh, Pokemon.

1000
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,000
Go.

1001
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:33,800
Okay, Pokemon.

1002
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,420
Here goes.

1003
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,340
I don't know the second verse.

1004
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:47,740
UFO sausage coming for me.

1005
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:57,000
We're gonna kill all the pink ones.

1006
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,320
It's time to go.

1007
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,740
1998, this time.

1008
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,940
Just you wait and see.

1009
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,280
Mary Bob lied to us again now.

1010
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,740
Oh, no, no.

1011
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,940
That's really okay.

1012
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:28,840
That motherfucker, he's already got my money.

1013
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,380
Good.

1014
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,880
This is so smart now.

1015
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,840
You can't drink that bird.

1016
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:38,440
No.

1017
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,160
You can't put any fucking shit on.

1018
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,280
Oh.

1019
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,080
Oh.

1020
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:46,600


1021
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:47,920


1022
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,960
Oh.

1023
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,580
And this bird, he kept on chaining

1024
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:21,660
And this bird, he kept on chaining

1025
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:25,460
And this bird kept chaining

1026
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,440
And this bird, he's not having it

1027
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:28,820
cubed

1028
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,340
