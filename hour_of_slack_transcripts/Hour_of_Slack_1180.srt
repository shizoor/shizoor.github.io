1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what is commonly known as money.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,180
It comes in all sizes, colors, and denominations, like people.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,740
We'll be using quite a bit of it in the next hour.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,480
Luckily, I have enough for all of us.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,020
The Self Genius.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,120
Our self.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,780
You've got a macabre sense of humor.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,460
Neither do I.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:37,960
My dear listener and friends, this hour of Slack number 1180 is not in fact that,

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,100
but is truly Bob's Slack Time Funhouse number 740.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,120
Yes, it's a Suzy the Fluzy show, an incredible show,

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,440
which she did a few weeks ago when the Econo Cataclysm hit.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,980
This is a collage episode.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,300
It's an episode that she calls not the Stock Market Show,

15
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,660
but the Stark Mock It Show,

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,620
a depression comedy.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,760
First broadcast on Bob's Slack Time Funhouse at WREK in Atlanta,

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:25,360
one of the greatest college stations of this or any other planet, friends.

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,940
And so without further ado, we go directly into the Econo Cataclysm,

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,100
of Suzy the Fluzy.

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,180
Apples.

22
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,920
Get your apples.

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,020
Come on, you financial whiz kids.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,500
You've got to keep your strength up while your whole house of paper crap is collapsing around your ears.

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,160
Apples.

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,780
Come on, you failures.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,640
Get your apples.

28
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,820
Lord, I'm so hungry.

29
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,620
But I don't have enough to buy an apple.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,220
Oh, please, dear God.

31
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,020
Can I trade you my blackberry for it?

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,540
Ah, what the hell.

33
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,600
Sure, lady.

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,720
It's just such a kick to see the mighty fallen.

35
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,680
Sure, I'll trade your blackberry for an apple.

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,740
Fruits, fruit.

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,480
Here you go.

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,520
Oh, bless you, bless you.

39
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,820
And here you go.

40
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,020
Sweet.

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,240
Soccer.

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,700
Ah!

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,960
Hey, lady, this isn't a blackberry.

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,160
This is a wallet.

45
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,580
And it's stuffed with...

46
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,660
Fifty-five thousand dollars?

47
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,940
Come back here, you thief.

48
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,040
You ripped me off.

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,480
This won't even buy a freaking paperclip.

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,780
Oh, damn it.

51
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,760
Stiffed again.

52
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,860
Ah, hell.

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,360
I guess I really shouldn't laugh at them.

54
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,580
I know their pain.

55
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,380
Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,840
I was rich once.

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,160
Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,200
I put half my money in toilet paper.

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,580
And the other half in revolving doors.

60
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,180
And I was wiped out before I could turn around.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,760
And it wasn't hard to do at all.

62
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,480
You know, you can't help but find the poor house.

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,500
It's the last address on Easy Street.

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,600
So now we're all in the same sad sinking ship, aren't we?

65
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,540
Yep.

66
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,600
Looks like the worm has turned.

67
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,100
The chickens have come home to roost.

68
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,420
Our hash has definitely been settled.

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,320
And now everybody's in the same sad-ass situation that I've been in for years.

70
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,080
Oh, yeah.

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,580
Welcome to the exciting new world of dumpster diving and do-it-yourself dentistry.

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,260
And, hey, if you can scavenge enough ketchup, dog tastes good.

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,340
Oh, and all of the seekers.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,900
All I can do is find more reason to believe the word of Dobbs.

75
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,900
Because if you remember what he prophetically spouted in a fight with his neighbors back in the mid-50s,

76
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,480
it's all come horribly, horribly true.

77
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,200
You'll all be eating roach crap by the turn of the century.

78
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,820
Get your toilet green here.

79
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,440
Try new.

80
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,540
New toilet green.

81
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,100
Why?

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,220
Hey!

83
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,360
Toilet green.

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,260
Hey!

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,860
Toilet green is people!

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,900
And people taste good.

87
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,660
Yes?

88
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Don't open the show.

89
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,400
Thought you might want to celebrate.

90
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,620
Fresh off the boat.

91
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,540
Well, you heard wrong.

92
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,320
Pull up a coffin and lie down with the rest of us.

93
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,080
Gee, business is so tough that nobody wants to owe me anymore.

94
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,720
You can go.

95
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,420
Gather round, people gonna tell you what they're on.

96
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,380
About the time that the clock's all quit.

97
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,900
And the robber will fail.

98
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,040
Every day of the week, a fortune given away.

99
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,520
Yay!

100
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,720
The music quickly changes as we move into the Wall Street area.

101
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
The financial district.

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,280
The cash register of the world.

103
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,620
Whatever you want to call it.

104
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,980
Money means security.

105
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,480
No money means terror.

106
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,820
Oh, oh.

107
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,400
This is Angel.

108
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,340
This is Angel.

109
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,400
We are the Android Sisters.

110
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,640
Today's topic is money.

111
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,700
Money is important.

112
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,380
Everyone needs money.

113
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
Have you been deprived of money?

114
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,660
Do you suffer from money withdrawal?

115
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,580
Do you need a money fix?

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,880
Is your money fix not big enough?

117
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,920
What if you lost your job?

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,060
The job you can't stand.

119
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,520
The job a machine could do.

120
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:58,820
Do it.

121
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,620
Do it better.

122
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,140
What if you lost that?

123
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,020
Then what?

124
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
Uh oh.

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,380
No money means terror.

126
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:08,980
Oh.

127
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:09,980
Oh.

128
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,780
Are you happy?

129
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,480
Do you wonder why you are not happy?

130
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,380
Do you live in a constant state of fear?

131
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,960
Have they made you into a money junkie?

132
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
Do you hate your job?

133
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,100
Do you have a job to hate?

134
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,500
Are you looking for a job?

135
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,460
Are you looking for a job you will hate?

136
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,240
A job that could be done by a robot.

137
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,520
A job to save the world.

138
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,520


139
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,520


140
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,520


141
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,520


142
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,520


143
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,520


144
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,520


145
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,820
Is this not a stupid way to live your life?

146
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,200
You need money.

147
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,420
Money means security.

148
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,980
No money means terror.

149
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,120
Are you happy?

150
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,300
Do you wonder why you're not happy?

151
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,460
Do you live in a constant state of fear?

152
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,680
Do you know how easy it is to control someone in that state of mind?

153
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,540
Do you know how many hours a day you think about money?

154
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,380
Do you ever think about how much you think about money?

155
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,720
Aren't you sick of thinking about money?

156
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,780
Money.

157
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:15,740
Uh.

158
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,120
Eh.

159
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,540
Pooey.

160
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,020
But money means security.

161
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,960
No money means terror.

162
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,480
Oh.

163
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,240
Oh.

164
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh.

165
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,780
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this guided tour of your New York Stock Exchange.

166
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,960
The shares we trade here are owned by millions and millions of ordinary Americans,

167
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,760
just like you and Howard Hughes and J. Paul Getty.

168
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,020
The market is a ticker, a slender piece of tape,

169
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,580
which notifies the...

170
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,580
The public of its economic shape,

171
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,180
which, if it weren't legal, would be statutory rape,

172
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,880
that's perpetrated daily from ten to half past three.

173
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,720
A simple little business.

174
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,400
It's A, B, C.

175
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,420
A is for analysts.

176
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,820
These are highly skilled professionals

177
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,960
who spend their entire lives studying the market.

178
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,740
Sir, do you think the market is going up or down?

179
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,980
We have every confidence that if there is no decline,

180
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,620
the market will go higher.

181
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,800
We passed the New York Stock Exchange,

182
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,740
the nerve center of the U.S. stock market,

183
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,140
where transactions reaching into the billions are undertaken every day

184
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,960
in the closely packed office buildings and banks.

185
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,360
Today, a seat on the exchange costs over $500,000.

186
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,540
Gold.

187
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,820
Real gold.

188
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,620
Ha, ha, ha.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,300
Ha, ha, ha.

190
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,840
More. Give more.

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,520
You've got it bad.

192
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,960
Yeah, take it to the security bank.

193
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,580
I'll fix you up.

194
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:14,800
Thank you.

195
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,520
There you are.

196
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,560
You can count on Acorn immediately.

197
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,240
Thanks.

198
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,920
Good luck.

199
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,920
Acorn, we're going to become bankers. Rich bankers.

200
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,440
What for?

201
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,240
Make money, get rich, live high.

202
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,460
How much more high you want to live than we've been living?

203
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,480
Well, you're going to go to work,

204
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,280
and you're going to like it.

205
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,280
I'm going to work, but I ain't going to like it.

206
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,560
Don't forget, being a banker in a small town's a big job.

207
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,680
You know, you're so close to the folks you deal with.

208
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,380
Why, your word has got to be twice as good as their bond.

209
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,640
There. I'm through preaching.

210
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,820
From now on, you're the chief.

211
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,740
I'm just a depositor.

212
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,480
Well, you know, sometimes it's not enough.

213
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
Merely to teach, one has to punish as well.

214
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,960
A little bit of the old pause.

215
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,240
Pause for pause.

216
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,200
Here.

217
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,280
Here I am, Daddy.

218
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,580
Mine, what a big cigar.

219
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,180
Yes, and a big man that smoked it too, honey.

220
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,820
Mm-hmm.

221
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,480
Honey, I does everything in a big way.

222
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,300
It must have cost you a lot of money to keep that car in show for while you were born.

223
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,640
Chicken feet, honey. Just chicken feet.

224
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,160
You must be powerful rich.

225
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,940
Oh, I got a little. I got a little.

226
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,640
More, more, more.

227
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,240
Lay more eggs. More.

228
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,400
Gold. Real gold.

229
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,380
More. Give more.

230
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,580
Some more.

231
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,020
More, more, more.

232
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,820
More, more, more.

233
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,000
Ouch, said the hooker.

234
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,920
You see, mark that person of irritable mirth.

235
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,260
He's made a million out of man's inhumanity to man.

236
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,720
Salt of the earth.

237
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,220
Yes. Salt of the earth.

238
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,000
Perhaps together we can restore his faith in the mystery of life.

239
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

240
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:25,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

241
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,720
Oh, where is the money?

242
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,720
Look up, the skies are sunny.

243
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,940
Oh, magic action, you are through.

244
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,140
You've done us wrong.

245
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,840
Sure is a pretty thing.

246
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,120
Hey, what's all this?

247
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,480
Oh, I'm just getting ready for the new

248
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
vegetable present, that's all.

249
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,640
What's all this about a new present?

250
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,680
Ha, ha.

251
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,440
Let me resuscitate you.

252
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,920
Grrr, grrr, grrr.

253
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,420
Grrr, grrr, grrr.

254
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,020
Grrr, grrr, grrr.

255
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,020
Say, Mom,

256
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,440
by the way, why don't you let me take a shot

257
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,580
at reinvesting those government 3.5%

258
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,460
of yours? I can get you 6 or 7%

259
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,420
easy. You must never touch those bonds.

260
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,140
They're here for the protection

261
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,340
of depositors. Oh, don't be nervous.

262
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,820
It'll all be over before you know it.

263
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,560
Ha, ha, ha.

264
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,800
Money, money, money. Money, money, money.

265
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,140
Money, money, money. Money, money, money.

266
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,500
Money, money, money. Money, money, money.

267
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,080
Money makes the world

268
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,460
go round the world, go round the world.

269
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,880
Go round. Money makes the world

270
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,560
go round. Of that we can

271
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,540
be sure.

272
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,740
Stop on being poor.

273
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,820
Money, money, money. Money, money, money.

274
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,140
Money, money, money. Money, money, money.

275
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,200
Money, money, money. Money, money, money.

276
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,940
Money, money, money. Money, money, money.

277
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,380
Hi there, investors. This is the friendly voice

278
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,400
of Dow Jones reporting on the state of the

279
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,520
bustling American economy.

280
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,200
At 12 noon, the Dow Jones averages

281
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,640
are down 7.43.

282
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,560
Next report

283
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,460
on the state of the bustling American economy.

284
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,980
will be at 1 p.m.

285
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,180
The bigger deals to come.

286
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,900
Oh, my goodness. Champagne.

287
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,600
You lived in the poorhouse.

288
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,160
Oh, well, on a day like this,

289
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,380
we ought to get fuzz, I mean fizzed up.

290
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,040
Oh, I suppose you should. There we are.

291
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,840
The first

292
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,500
in this country on the brink of a financial

293
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,560
absentee. Oh, things would be

294
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,400
all right if people take their money out of their stock

295
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,320
and stick their foot in it.

296
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,780
Drowned by the promise of the women

297
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,740
and the lace

298
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,900
and the gold and the cotton

299
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,580
and pearl.

300
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,900
It's a place where they keep

301
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,960
all the darkness you need.

302
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,340
You sail away from the light

303
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,700
of the world on this trip, baby.

304
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,180
You will pay tomorrow.

305
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,660
You're gonna pay tomorrow.

306
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,860
You will pay tomorrow.

307
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,800
You will pay tomorrow.

308
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

309
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

310
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,340
That comes along with the territory.

311
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,620
Right?

312
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,100
If you're one of the high rollers.

313
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,080
Lots of status.

314
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,280
If you will, I'm gonna strip you naked.

315
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,240
So let me give you some ammunition

316
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,560
about the people out there who think

317
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
that they're doing okay.

318
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,300
Now, one of the things you never want to come up to me

319
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,380
and say is I'm doing okay.

320
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:07,820
Okay.

321
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
It's all I'm taking from you.

322
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:09,600
Get back!

323
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,620
Ow!

324
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,320
Ow!

325
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:11,940
Ow!

326
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,760
Stop pummeling me!

327
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,120
It's really painful!

328
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,380
That's what I thought.

329
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:17,760
Ow!

330
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,480
Punk ass.

331
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,400
That is true.

332
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,820
I can't stand that because I know how okay

333
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,580
most people are doing.

334
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,020
You've heard me say that most people

335
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,900
in this country are broke.

336
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,460
Most of the people in this country are broke.

337
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,040
Why do I say that?

338
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,460
Why?

339
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,080
Have you been part of the 5% cutback?

340
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,240
You're not doing right.

341
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,880
Has your rent just gone up this month?

342
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,140
Yeah.

343
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,080
Has the inflation escalator just hit you?

344
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,540
Holy mackerel, what a lie.

345
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,000
Shut up.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,880
What do you really mean by that?

347
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,240
If you answer yes to any of those things,

348
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,620
you're broke.

349
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,440
Don't feel bad.

350
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:42,980
You're in the majority.

351
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,540
The first thing I write on the board

352
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,260
is a large circle,

353
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,340
and I put a dollar sign in it.

354
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
And what I want you to do for the moment

355
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,920
is envision that as your income.

356
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,380
The most profound thing you need to know is this.

357
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,120
Whatever it is,

358
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,880
it is.

359
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,880
This could be a problem.

360
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,520
If that's all you have to work with,

361
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,120
you can't keep living on the if-come.

362
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,880
Ah, that's what means

363
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,100
that you've prepared for an emergency.

364
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,340
Where are those keys to my safe deposit box?

365
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm going to take those $100,000

366
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,520
with the government's bombs

367
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,540
and I'm going to pack them right up

368
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,440
the head of the seller

369
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,580
so everybody can see them.

370
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,860
I'll stop the gold rush.

371
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,520
They'll never catch a banker

372
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,420
with his pants down.

373
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,060
Put on your pants, Captain.

374
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,000
Please.

375
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,260
Once again, attack dogs were used

376
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,100
to put down an attack dog.

377
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,100


378
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,100


379
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,840
Another food riot.

380
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,680
Now here's Jay with another gloomy market report.

381
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,080
Lovely day, isn't it?

382
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,440
Lovely.

383
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,260
Papers say nice day tomorrow, too.

384
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,580
I haven't seen the papers.

385
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,280
Yes, well, there's not much in them.

386
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,140
Not much.

387
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,700
From what had gone before,

388
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,700
it was clear that this was to be

389
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,540
no picnic.

390
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,580
Say,

391
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,420
did you ever hear of a thing called

392
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
amnesia or aphasia?

393
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,180
That means when your whole past

394
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,020
has been wiped out,

395
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,900
when you can't remember,

396
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,380
anything that's ever happened before.

397
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,020
Well, believe me,

398
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,120
I'm saving my money for a rainy day.

399
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,220
Goodbye, moderation!

400
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,820
If a person goes out

401
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,600
and hangs on a binge,

402
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,900
they can't come home and say,

403
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm going to pray and have this not happen.

404
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,460
They're still going to have their hangover.

405
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,720
God's going to punish them.

406
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,540
They're going to lay in it

407
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,980
until that part of it is gone.

408
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,640
My God!

409
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,700
In other words,

410
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,600
once you create a problem

411
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,440
through a sin in one form or the other,

412
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,100
you're going to live with it,

413
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,320
the built-in punishment thereof.

414
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,760
Hello, Bob?

415
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Say, listen, Bob.

416
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,080
Yes, give it the words.

417
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
We'll hear everything right away.

418
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,700
All right.

419
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,360
The most glamorous street of America,

420
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,980
Millionaire's Row,

421
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,960
is where the homes and estates,

422
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,360
of many of New York's

423
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,320
wealthiest psychiatric and alcoholic citizens, stand.

424
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,140
I awoke this morning in my push-button

425
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,040
Neiman Marcus said,

426
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,540
La, la, la, la.

427
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,520
I caressed the sables that had died

428
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,820
to provide me with a spread.

429
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,980
La, la, la, la, la, la.

430
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,100
And I don't know if I ever thought

431
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,360
of it quite this way before.

432
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,700
But I woke this morning

433
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,660
with a loud, clear conclusion in my head,

434
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,880
which said,

435
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,400
rich is better.

436
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,060
Um.

437
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,700
Rich is better.

438
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,360
Shut the hell up.

439
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,480
Rich is better.

440
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,320
We never see a headline

441
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,800
without a red line today.

442
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,400
And when we see the land floor,

443
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,560
we can look that guy right in the eye.

444
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,200
We're in for money.

445
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,080
Come on, honey.

446
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,680
Let's spend, let's spend, let's spend

447
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,600
all we've got.

448
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,080
Prosperity will get them into hot water.

449
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,860
But it takes money.

450
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,760
We haven't got it.

451
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,580
Suppose I knew a way to get a hold of some money.

452
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,380
How?

453
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,060
We can't afford to do anything crooked.

454
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,640
You understand?

455
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,680
Hey, listen, I know it's crooked.

456
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,080
But I got into this jam through helping you fellas.

457
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,560
It's a shame to leave all that money down there.

458
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:04,860
Yeah.

459
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,820
That town owes us plenty.

460
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,760
It sure does.

461
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,040
It sounds good, but what about Bob's orders?

462
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,780
We won't even know about it

463
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,680
until we give him his share.

464
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,820
Just remember that this thing

465
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,300
isn't as black as it appears.

466
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,080
Anybody for me?

467
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,080
Stop it!

468
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,640
Stop it!

469
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,380
Stop it!

470
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,600
This, this is just...

471
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,360
I am just...

472
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,560
But I'll take all the responsibility.

473
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,740
Well, I don't like it.

474
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,060
Oh, yeah?

475
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
After all, now,

476
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,300
the fine hell I'd be

477
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,720
if I didn't take a chance for it.

478
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
What's a friend good for

479
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,140
if he don't stand by a man

480
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,780
when he's in trouble?

481
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,760
Oh, thanks, Harvey.

482
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,480
Just give us a line

483
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,560
relieving us of all responsibility.

484
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,860
You're right.

485
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,760
Well...

486
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,080
I know I'm right.

487
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,080
And someday you'll thank me for this.

488
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,680
Say, I'm thanking you right now.

489
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,580
Someday he'll thank you, eh?

490
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,040
Only when he does,

491
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,820
I won't be here.

492
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,740
And a chill of the heart

493
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,160
and his Austrian son,

494
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,680
left to hide out in Rio

495
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,960
to fly out and relive the past.

496
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,880
Sammy showed them around

497
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,400
when they got into town,

498
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,820
but he warned them the rules

499
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,540
they'd be changed

500
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,000
since they played the game last.

501
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,500
Oh, the chill of just grinning

502
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
and wanking his friend.

503
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,980
I forget what went down.

504
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,900
After that, it all happened so fast.

505
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,120
God bless America!

506
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,140
Ah!

507
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,060
Come on!

508
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,320
Let's get out of here!

509
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,180
Looks as if you were expecting a childbirth.

510
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,960
And how.

511
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,160
Stores bankrupt,

512
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,120
factories closing,

513
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:32,980
banks failing.

514
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,400
One never knows when they're gonna be wiped out.

515
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,620
Oh, you're getting yourself all a-twitter over nothing.

516
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,160
Your money's safe in our bank.

517
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,800
Well, how do I know where it is?

518
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,560
I'm not losing any sleep over it.

519
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,280
Everybody over in Hillsdale had confidence in their bank,

520
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,640
and it blew up this morning.

521
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,480
Oh, crap! It's on fire!

522
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,520
It is, ah!

523
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,400
It was full of frozen assets.

524
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,520
Well, nobody's gonna freeze mine.

525
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,360
Come on!

526
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,060
Bob generally knows what he's doing.

527
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,960
He does everything for the-

528
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,920
Sit down. Shut up.

529
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,940
Our government is fully aware of its difficulties.

530
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,240
It can pull itself out of its economic rut

531
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
without the assistance of any other crackpot.

532
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,900
Its attempted action must therefore be attributed

533
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,400
to a diseased mind,

534
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,980
afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur,

535
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,640
and obsessed with an insane desire

536
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,440
to become a public benefactor.

537
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,880
One has to be smart when observing the effects of money on the arts.

538
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,540
Another fine mess.

539
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,440
No, we have but slept.

540
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:26,940
Slept?

541
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,560
Yes, through the economic recession, you see.

542
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:29,840
What?

543
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,740
Well, five million years ago, the galactic economy collapsed.

544
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,040
And seeing that custom-built planets are something of a luxury commodity...

545
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,160
You know we built planets, do you?

546
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,640
Oh, well, yes. I'd sort of gathered.

547
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,080
Fascinating trade.

548
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,180
But like the good book says,

549
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,640
there are bigger deals to come.

550
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,700
And that's bad.

551
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,980
There was something funny about the whole business.

552
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,980
The market has a logic!

553
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,560
Whose wonders never cease!

554
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,220
It's basically predictable and free of all caprice!

555
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,740
It hits the floor in time of war and lore when there's peace!

556
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,180
And all the smart investors rely on LSD!

557
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,220
A simple little business.

558
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,740
It's A-B-C!

559
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,080
Oh, my God!

560
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,600
Do you realize if you don't open that bank and pay me back what you owe me,

561
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,200
your grandchildren will be on the street?

562
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,860
The bank will open.

563
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,740
You'll get every cent.

564
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,560
I'll believe that when I see it.

565
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,460
But there'll be a warrant on for it.

566
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,260
A warrant? For whom? What's his description?

567
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,780
George wondered if his name was on that list the cops had found in the cabinet.

568
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,880
You know, Bob, I don't know.

569
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,400
I told you long ago that that mongoloid George was our nemesis.

570
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,680
Now he has struck his final blow.

571
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,380
George! Look what you've done!

572
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,180
Uh... uh... uh... uh...

573
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,880
Warrant, you're... you're an idiot.

574
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,080
Now that jailer, he saw all the smoke in the air

575
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,480
And he wished he was there

576
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,560
Instead of inside watching ourselves

577
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,360
But, Harland, if I don't get those bonds today, the bank will have to close.

578
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,020
So we said, go do your share

579
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,120
We ain't going nowhere

580
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
He agreed, grabbed his gun with a smile

581
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,980
And he wished us all well

582
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,740
What kind of a bitch are you, fish-face?

583
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,200
Before he had got to his car

584
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,480
We had cut through the bar

585
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,680
Snuck outside and just sat back to watch

586
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,060
Till the bank fell

587
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,160
The shock and terror had made him wet his pants.

588
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,240
A few or three days ago, he ordered a sign,

589
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,820
This bank open for business.

590
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,240
And I ain't seen him since.

591
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,900
Shall I cart it over and put it up?

592
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,360
Sure. Put it up.

593
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,100
Yeah.

594
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,780
The bank's gonna open.

595
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,320
Oh, well, I'm awful glad for all of our sake.

596
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,160
Yeah. Goodbye.

597
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:34,920
Goodbye.

598
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,360
What a bad joke.

599
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,080
As we move deeper into the heart of Wall Street,

600
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,000
We pass Trinity Church on your right.

601
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,480
Why did God let this happen?

602
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,520
Jesus, you're a thief.

603
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,240
And John the Baptist and Uncle Sam

604
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,900
They was carrying the plans for some new kind of object for peace.

605
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,860
John the Baptist and Uncle Sam

606
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:55,860


607
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,140
When all of a sudden this river-gate band

608
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,580
With their guns in their hands

609
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,980
Stopped the boat that demanded

610
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,300
That look in the top-secret case.

611
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,080
Oh, but just in the nick of time

612
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,060
They were stricken blind by a low-blind plane

613
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,100
With no name and no number to trace.

614
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,440
Oh, but just the same

615
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,780
John lost his head and they said he was gone.

616
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,940
He tried to run but someone held him down

617
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,600
And Sam tied up his hands.

618
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,880
He cried out to his boss but he couldn't get across

619
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,160
Cause the knives were all down and the crowd

620
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,760
Cheered him on from the stands.

621
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,620
But he finally did get away.

622
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
You can find him today.

623
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,700
It's a silver place and still waits for the boss to call back.

624
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,760
Prosperity will return in a moment.

625
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,300
A tablet bears these famous words.

626
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,960
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.

627
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,540
All your peace are belong to us.

628
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,080
Music

629
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,020
And if there are warning signs on the horizon,

630
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,980
We need to pay attention to them.

631
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,360
How do you know that?

632
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,580
How do we know that?

633
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,740
Um, and we need to act in a positive way

634
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,160
To make sure that our economy continues to grow

635
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,680
So people will be able to find high-paying, high-quality jobs.

636
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,380
I, I, I, I, I, uh...

637
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,240
Don't look now, but there's something funny going on over there at the bank, George.

638
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,140
Gosh, okay.

639
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,640
I've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks to be in a rug.

640
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,240
Ugh!

641
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,700
Let me out.

642
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,300
Get off, buster.

643
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,060
I'll give you $500 for your place.

644
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,600
I'll make it a thousand.

645
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,520
Money.

646
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,720
That's not good anymore, eh?

647
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,080
Here comes another.

648
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,580
Pull that guy off there!

649
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,380
I'll be back in time.

650
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,700
Time for what?

651
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,200
I said, take my money out.

652
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,960
Take your money out?

653
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,180
Yeah.

654
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,200
I was only fooling you.

655
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,380
Yeah, there's a run on the bank.

656
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,560
What did you say?

657
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,820
I said, there's a run on the bank.

658
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,320
There's a run on the bank?

659
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:17,680
Certainly.

660
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,240
Oh!

661
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,440
My money!

662
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,700
Oh!

663
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,260
Oh, my money! Oh, my money!

664
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,040
Oh, oh!

665
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,160
What's going on in the bank?

666
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,420
He's throwing all of the money out.

667
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,040
Really?

668
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,360
Yes, I'm going to tell my husband.

669
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,240
I'm going to tell my husband.

670
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,840
The boss was asleep when he heard such a clatter.

671
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,880
Sprang from his bed just to see what was the matter.

672
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,640
Looked down on the street and that scene filled his eyes.

673
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,120
But you know he wasn't even surprised.

674
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,480
Well, he got on the phone and he ordered some thunder,

675
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,320
some rain and some disc blades to plow it all under.

676
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,500
Someone asked why with a sigh.

677
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,800
He explained that the fools was up doing it again.

678
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,160
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

679
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,140
Wait!

680
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,680
You can't close this door in my face!

681
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,780
Open it up! Open it up!

682
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,340
I've been thinking, Bob.

683
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,600
Maybe if I went out there and talked to those people,

684
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,760
I could make them understand about you.

685
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,820
Oh, you'd just be wasting your breath, Ben.

686
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,060
Only thing that mob will understand is a bullet.

687
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,740
Yeah, maybe they'll get one.

688
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,040
Say, Bob, I had an idea.

689
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,180
You promised me no one would get hurt.

690
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,640
Anyway, the recession came.

691
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,240
So we decided to sleep through it.

692
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,120
We just programmed the computers to revive us when it was all over.

693
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,420
They were indexed, linked to the galactic stock market prices, you see,

694
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,000
so that we'd be revived,

695
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,620
but everybody else had rebuilt the economy enough

696
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,520
to be able to afford our rather expensive services again.

697
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,020
Good God, that's a pretty unpleasant way to behave, isn't it?

698
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,620
Is it?

699
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,200
I'm sorry, I'm a bit out of touch.

700
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,960
And until further notice, this station will continue its around-the-clock coverage

701
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,860
of this national television program.

702
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,080
What is that?

703
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,040
Oh, horrific.

704
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,400
And now we switch you to the state capital.

705
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:20,880
Now what?

706
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,800
Where His Excellency the Governor

707
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,740
Oh, Jesus.

708
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,180
is speaking from the executive mansion.

709
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,660
Holy mackerel!

710
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,860
And then I got scared to death and closed the doors.

711
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,180
I...

712
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,980
You must come with me.

713
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,320
Great things are afoot.

714
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,940
You must come now or you will be late.

715
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,720
Late? What for?

716
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,620
I don't know.

717
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,620
Now the first thing I noticed when we hit the street

718
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,140
was the seventh fleet.

719
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,260
They was cruising the center of town.

720
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,540
Spook mills very strange.

721
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,860
And nobody seemed real clear who had sent them now.

722
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,660
But they sure looked grand with the band of balloons and the pound.

723
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,340
I love a parade.

724
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,120
And they played cankers away for the rest of the day.

725
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,740
Except for times that they'd lower their guns and shoot some renegade down.

726
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,640
And now back to prosperity.

727
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,480
What?

728
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,480
You almost had me.

729
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,240
You mean you're growing your own power?

730
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,560
You mean you're growing your own power?

731
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,580
Every cent.

732
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,520
But I don't want any eyes.

733
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,300
But I want my money.

734
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,480
Well, if you'll just wait a moment, I'll...

735
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,880
You mean to tell me I can't take my money out when I please?

736
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,180
You see, I have to get an okay from the president.

737
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,300
Well, it's none of his business.

738
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,880
I put my money in here and I've always to take it out.

739
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,160
Wall Street is still the banking and financial center of the world.

740
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,120
Today, a seat on the exchange cost around $500.

741
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,380
Five hundred bucks!

742
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,340
Now come on, give me my money.

743
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,220
Do I have to stand here all day and yell for you?

744
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,800
For my money?

745
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,620
My money?

746
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,660
My money?

747
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
This is Angel.

748
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,680
This is Angel.

749
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,800
We are the Android Sisters.

750
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,820
What is your question?

751
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,880
All of reality exists in our minds.

752
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,800
Is that true?

753
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,860
What is your intelligence rating?

754
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,160
I'm classified as a 5.5555.

755
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,180
You understand we only speak to you on the level that you can comprehend.

756
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,480
I appreciate that.

757
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,100
For those of you watching out there, adjust your I.T. ratings.

758
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,340
I'm 5.5555.

759
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,740
I'm 5.5555.

760
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,720
What is your question?

761
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,120
I already asked it.

762
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,560
What is your question?

763
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,440
I said I already asked it.

764
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,140
What is your question?

765
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,900
What is your question?

766
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,940
All right, I want to know if reality is in my mind or is it out there.

767
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,440
I mean, what if it's all in my mind?

768
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,080
I mean, change my mind, I could change reality.

769
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,000
Right.

770
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,000
Wrong.

771
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,960
What?

772
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,540
What's wrong with you?

773
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:45,540


774
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:51,680
Dear confused, briefly, reality is merely what everyone agrees is real.

775
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,760
What everyone agrees is not real, does not exist.

776
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,080
Who programmed you?

777
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,860
Who programmed you?

778
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,220
How should I know?

779
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,360
Everyone, I don't know.

780
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,440
I'm still confused.

781
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,820
Dear still confused, you are confusing the symbol for reality.

782
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,520
Reality.

783
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,660
Money is a good example.

784
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,620
Money.

785
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,000
What about money?

786
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,720
I like money.

787
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,640
Money.

788
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:15,920
Money.

789
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,020
I will use two pieces of paper as an example.

790
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,460
Can you see this?

791
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,380
I see one piece of paper, the other's money.

792
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,160
Two pieces of paper.

793
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:25,780
What?

794
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:32,300
Here are two pieces of paper, both the same size, both just paper.

795
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,080
Paper.

796
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,760
Humans are obsessed with money.

797
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,560
Money.

798
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:36,940
Money.

799
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,360
Money.

800
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,580
Money.

801
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:37,780
Money.

802
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:37,920
Money.

803
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,080
Money.

804
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,320
Money.

805
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,860
Not all humans, just some of us.

806
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,220
Most of us.

807
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,040
One piece of paper is worth 500 solar credits.

808
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,960
The other is worthless, not even worth a solar centavo.

809
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,280
Do you know why?

810
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,820
Sure, one is a piece of money and the other is a piece of paper.

811
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,120
They are both paper.

812
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,040
Yeah, right.

813
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,760
One has been blessed by the treasury wizards.

814
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,680
The other has not.

815
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,620
That's it.

816
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,480
That's it.

817
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,880
The symbol is controlling your mind.

818
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,720
Hmm, I see.

819
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,500
Oh, our time is up.

820
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,140
This is Angel.

821
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,980
This is Angel.

822
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,660
Looking for the right loan can sometimes leave you in the fog.

823
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,860
But when I ask for credit on the equity in my home, I got it.

824
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,680
When I ask for my loan to come through in a hurry, I got it.

825
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,200
Got it.

826
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,160
When I talk, bankers listen.

827
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,140
Right, boys?

828
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:39,840
Right.

829
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,720
Right.

830
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,100
Now who is it?

831
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,540
My money!

832
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,860
God, I'm not leaving until I find out what's going on.

833
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,240
Okay, okay.

834
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,560
I want it to wait outside as promised.

835
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,140
I'm not waiting outside.

836
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,300
For the love of...

837
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,740
My money! My money!

838
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,040
I'm asking you, do I get it or don't I?

839
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,180
No.

840
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,000
What?

841
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,280
Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up.

842
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,560
I've been wrecked before, but never in such a unnatural and brutal way.

843
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,760
Good grief!

844
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,120
That woman must be lashed until she drops.

845
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,040
She is undermining our civilization.

846
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,680
Hundreds of people are being demoralized.

847
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
You stop heckling me, I'll beat you a lot sooner.

848
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,060
Anything for a buck.

849
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:32,700
The fabulous J.P. Morgan Financial Empire was reconstructed with money donated by schoolchildren

850
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,400
from all over the United States.

851
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,020
Yeah!

852
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,920
Oh!

853
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,300
Come on, I've got some work to do.

854
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,800
Oh, you are you!

855
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,160
Oh, you're all killed, Jerry!

856
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,620
There you go.

857
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,940
I just wanted to see if you had your price.

858
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,960
Most of us do.

859
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,660
Oh, yeah!

860
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,180
The market is a hot tip your neighbor will supply.

861
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,780
In which you keep investing till its price has hit the sky.

862
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,320
So when you go to sell it, there is no one left to buy.

863
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,440
It's plunge ahead with Edsel and sell AT&T.

864
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,680
And you'll be a rich man.

865
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,760
A simple little business.

866
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,300
It's A-B-C.

867
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:13,000
At 1 p.m., the Dow Jones averages are down 777.43.

868
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,660
That's our stock market, ladies and gentlemen.

869
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,440
Great.

870
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,560
Now what?

871
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,900
The impact was so great that a song was written about it.

872
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,580
When you haven't any coal in the stove and you freeze in the winter and you burst to the wind after a break.

873
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,920
When you haven't any shoes on your feet and your coat's in a paper and you look 30 pounds underweight.

874
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,560
When you go to get a word of a day.

875
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,200
When you get a word of advice from a famous.

876
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,360
But hunger comes around.

877
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,860
At your window, see, a love flies out the door.

878
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,200
For money makes the world go around, the world go around, the world go around.

879
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,460
Money makes the world go around.

880
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,500
That clinking, clanking sound of money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

881
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,880
You get a little, get a little money, money, money, money.

882
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,860
Mark again, about four pounds.

883
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,840
The clinking, clanking, clunking sound is all that makes the world go round.

884
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,520
The box has the food

885
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:16,900
Now, to come to make a touch, the bank has food.

886
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,540
For the last time, I'm asking you for my money!

887
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,840
My money!

888
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,120
Well, you don't have to holler.

889
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,080
What do you want?

890
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,120
I told you, I came here to take my money out.

891
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,460
If I can get it...

892
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,740
You know, this bank has been open for 60 years,

893
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,560
and no one has ever lost a dollar.

894
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,140
Uh-oh.

895
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,560
Oh, help! I'm ruined!

896
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,500
Oh, cut it out now.

897
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,200
Why, I thank you for 20 years.

898
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:50,500
Yes.

899
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,640
And the minute people start crying about hard times, you get panicky.

900
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,820
You come yawning in here for your money like a wounded wildcat.

901
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,260
No, we don't need...

902
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,140
We need customers like you.

903
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,720
It won't limit your business.

904
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,460
What am I going to do with it?

905
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,200
Oh, stick it in your shirt.

906
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,360
That's the thing for it.

907
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,260
Not getting it ready for you!

908
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,420
Not yet ready for you!

909
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,160
Won't be long, though!

910
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,340
When a bank goes fresh, I don't lose my cash.

911
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,420
I find great enjoyment in unemployment.

912
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,180
I'm the only man the world can overcome.

913
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:35,120
In other words, gentlemen, hallelujah, I'm a bum.

914
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,860
The workers will rule the world someday,

915
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,620
and all of your kind will be wiped away.

916
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,360
Your socks and pants may have holes,

917
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,660
but your booter packs down your soles.

918
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,780
This ain't right, Bob.

919
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,580
Nothing's right anymore.

920
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,160
Go on.

921
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,900
Now, get it ready for you.

922
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,100
Now, get it ready for you.

923
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,100
Lyons! Cossacks! Hoovers! Cossacks!

924
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,580
Ah, what do I see?

925
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,380
You shiver and tremble, and you call yourselves free.

926
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,480
You're slaves, and what's right to the powers of cash?

927
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,260
I'm proud as can be that they can't frighten me.

928
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,940
You'll die as you live, a useless slut.

929
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,980
Parasites living off parasites.

930
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,260
And what have you got?

931
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,820
Ah, let's go to them.

932
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,320
Oh, shit!

933
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,080
I'm for sucking them!

934
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,700
Oh, scum.

935
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,320
You're bum.

936
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,800
Welcome to your king.

937
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,400
Does your majesty bring news of the plutocrats down south?

938
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,600
Those rich idle shirkers who live on us workers.

939
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,360
Yeah, you work hard with your mouth.

940
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:44,780
Yeah.

941
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,620
That's just about enough.

942
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,680
Love that radical stuff?

943
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,460
If a man doesn't work, he ought to be dead.

944
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,340
Ha ha ha.

945
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,140
Pardon me, egghead.

946
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,780
You talk like a rat.

947
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,600
You're a parasite, Saul.

948
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,560
You're a parasite, Saul.

949
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,180
You're brothers in crime.

950
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,900
When the revolution comes, you won't sit pretty.

951
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,620
Egghead, I demand an explanation.

952
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,800
Well, it's up to you to prove I'm wrong.

953
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,020
Any time now.

954
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,140
Ha ha ha.

955
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,280
Why the hesitation?

956
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,040
Not long now for free money.

957
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:16,840
What?

958
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,480
What?

959
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,400
Free money.

960
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,020
What?

961
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,700
Where is it?

962
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,800
Here, very soon.

963
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,380
And it's free.

964
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,880
Free money.

965
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,540
Arriving soon.

966
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,940
Now.

967
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,080
Is this your order then?

968
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:38,520
One hundred gallons of blood, two hundred gallons of urine, five hundred cubic feet of

969
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,100
animal manure.

970
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:39,600
Yeah.

971
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,940
Where do you want it put?

972
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,960
Put it in the vat.

973
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,260
Put it in the vat, Fred.

974
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,520
Don't brush the stairway.

975
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:54,180
The prolongation of such a weird, fantastic, and impractical plan has concentrated by the

976
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,540
defense in these times with the country incapacitated by economic ailments, and indeed, the country

977
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


978
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


979
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


980
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


981
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


982
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


983
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


984
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


985
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


986
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


987
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,540


988
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:03,000
is in danger of an undercurrent of social unrest, is capable of fomenting a disturbance from which

989
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,080
the country may not soon recover.

990
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,920
It is our duty to stop it.

991
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,820
Prosperity will be turned in a moment.

992
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,080
My money, my money, my money.

993
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,740
Tell her that we'll have the bank open before noon tomorrow.

994
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,500
You will?

995
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,120
Oh, I always said you'd put it over.

996
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,180
I am so screwed.

997
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:20,860
Nonsense.

998
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,840
Yeah, nothing that, uh, does a rat poison wouldn't cure.

999
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,140
Now, now, John, that's no way to stop married nights for the new president.

1000
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,480
I give it to the little guy.

1001
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,520
I'm going to give it to the little guy.

1002
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,520


1003
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,520


1004
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,520


1005
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,760
Yes.

1006
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,320
My money.

1007
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:29,320


1008
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:29,320


1009
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,260
To keep the respect for the people in this town.

1010
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,820
What I did was for them, too.

1011
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,760
I took a risk for them, and I lost.

1012
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,680
You've struggled and worked and slaved for them, and what's it got us?

1013
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,280
I'll wind up in jail and you'll wind up at the poorhouse.

1014
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,920
We can't think of ourselves now.

1015
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,580
Why not?

1016
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,980
Haven't we sacrificed enough?

1017
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,800
What have we got left?

1018
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,900
Responsibility for the people of this town.

1019
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:48,920
Responsibility?

1020
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:49,760
Responsibility?

1021
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,760
Oh, I've heard all my life, it's the war on honesty, the war on this and the war on

1022
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,100
that, the war on them can rot, for all I care.

1023
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,440
Good evening, everybody.

1024
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,500
I am John.

1025
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,340
My God, it's almost dark.

1026
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,500
They'll be waking up soon.

1027
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,660
Dammit!

1028
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:20,180
Millionaire's Row is where the homes and estates of many of New York's once wealthiest citizens once stood.

1029
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,840
Once the most glamorous street of America, Millionaire's Row.

1030
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,100
It's pretty much Skid Row today.

1031
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,080
Who do we eat?

1032
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,180
This is military orders. All civilians are subject to summary execution.

1033
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,880
Stay in your homes. Repeat Conrad Channel.

1034
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,720
This is a class one emergency. All civilian traffic is barred from...

1035
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,780
They're down on steel and carbon and high on UFOs.

1036
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,460
Up here I.G. Farman, that's how the money goes.

1037
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,480
Do you realize the truth, Bill?

1038
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,580
Yes, I do.

1039
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,440
Your country has no future now.

1040
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:52,820
You see?

1041
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,240
There's nothing you can do about it.

1042
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,120
You're stupid minds. Stupid.

1043
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,420
Our job here was a success.

1044
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:57,880
Stupid.

1045
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,400
And soon we'll be back in the 23rd century.

1046
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,580
You see? You see?

1047
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,480
We dream of wealth.

1048
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,980
No. No.

1049
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,760
Good morning.

1050
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,320
Things can't go on like this.

1051
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,060
I've tried and tried and I can't stand it another day.

1052
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,240
I don't care if we starve.

1053
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,120
Oh, Lizzie.

1054
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,580
Shh.

1055
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,400
We has to trade in Lizzie,

1056
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,140
cause we is needin' food.

1057
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,600
Oh!

1058
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,180
Oh, I'm stripped of everything I've got!

1059
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,620
Get out of here.

1060
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,300
I was with

1061
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,980
dress two

1062
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:45,940
split

1063
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,280
and fall

1064
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,020
I thought the

1065
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,180
doves

1066
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,160
had my

1067
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,900
back

1068
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,940
Now, I'm in

1069
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:11,680
I think I'm going to be sick.

1070
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,840
Your nose will tell you we're approaching the financial district.

1071
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,560
Like a bitter, sour ass.

1072
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,600
Today, a seat on the exchange costs around five cents.

1073
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,180
And it's pretty much falling.

1074
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,420
Don't throw your garbage down here.

1075
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,280
But worst of all was the disgrace.

1076
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,600
Wait a minute.

1077
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,920
Listen.

1078
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,600
Don't you hear that wailing?

1079
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,960
Wailing?

1080
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,500
Men marching, marching.

1081
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,220
Marching in the rain.

1082
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,400
Jobs. Jobs.

1083
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,440
Gee, don't it get you?

1084
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,540
Okay.

1085
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,300
Is anyone here not a downer?

1086
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,640
Anyone?

1087
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:55,680
No.

1088
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,780
What would Jesus do?

1089
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,220
Like the good book says.

1090
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,740
On the way!

1091
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,860
We've been going through a tough time together.

1092
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,460
This town, this grand country of ours.

1093
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,220
But the worst is over and we've learned a big lesson.

1094
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,740
Yeah, but the biggest thing of all we've learned is this.

1095
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,960
There are bigger deals to come.

1096
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,720
Don't be mad at me.

1097
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,400
You know when the Dow Jones is up, it's good.

1098
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,720
When it's down, it's not so good.

1099
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,460
Indeed.

1100
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,660
I'm going to put the money back in the bank.

1101
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,500
In what bank?

1102
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1103
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,340
Go.

1104
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,080
Wall Street was falling apart.

1105
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,980
I'm sorry, old man.

1106
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,200
I know this spot you're in.

1107
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,060
I'd give my right arm if I could help you.

1108
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,860
Make it two pounds on your left foot.

1109
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,840
Stay on second row.

1110
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,320
Better keep your foot for when we're ready to run.

1111
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,420
I forget what went down after that.

1112
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,940
It all happened so fast.

1113
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,100
Yes, it was looking real bad.

1114
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,760
And it looked like we had it.

1115
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,440
It lost it.

1116
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,480
I don't know what happened.

1117
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,780
It's like we were in the park at the dock when the army arrived.

1118
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,500
Big trouble, you know, because they was sweeping the town, chasing renegades down.

1119
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,940
There was no friends to be found.

1120
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,120
There was no place at all left to hide.

1121
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,700
And the Austrian's son, he was having so much fun.

1122
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,080
He'd been put in command of the camps and his prisoners all died.

1123
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,740
Meanwhile, way across town in the penthouse suite of the tallest building, New York.

1124
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:37,080
And we're here to see the arrival and departure of the elite of international society.

1125
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,880
The men and women who shape the destinies of nations.

1126
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,180
We are here to sacrifice them to our gods.

1127
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,040
Right along.

1128
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,900
Narrow winding staircase to the top of the tallest building in lower Manhattan is worth the climb.

1129
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,640
The view at the top is breathtaking.

1130
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:55,980
Always has been.

1131
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,900
Any reason for a change?

1132
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,920
We don't want money.

1133
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,480
Money is a curse.

1134
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,660
It's risky business and worse.

1135
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,140
I know a fellow who found some dough.

1136
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,440
He put it in a bank.

1137
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,580
The bank gave him his dough, began to grow.

1138
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,560
He got rich in a hurry.

1139
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,440
Then he started into worry.

1140
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,940
Worried because he was in dough.

1141
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,600
And.

1142
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,860
Jumped right out of the window.

1143
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,560
1046 feet up.

1144
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:39,600
And 1046 feet down, down into the street of shadows.

1145
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,520
The street of forgotten.

1146
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,480
Maybe you just forget the whole thing.

1147
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,580
If you're smart.

1148
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,980
The impact was so great that a song was written about it.

1149
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,420
After you jump.

1150
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,380
Up.

1151
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:51,640
Up.

1152
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,080
Up.

1153
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,080


1154
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,900
The sky strayed above.

1155
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,580
After you jump.

1156
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,640
And we read about it in the paper before you go.

1157
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,320
Oh.

1158
00:45:59,340 --> 00:45:59,820
Oh.

1159
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,520
Can I have your stereo?

1160
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:02,940
Ding-a-dum.

1161
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,720
Ding-a-dum.

1162
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,960
Da-da-da-da-da.

1163
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,140
After you jump.

1164
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,460
And they read your final statement.

1165
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,340
After you jump.

1166
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,700
And they scrape you off the pavement.

1167
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,500
Before you go.

1168
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,140
Oh.

1169
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:16,660
Oh.

1170
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,380
Can I have your stereo?

1171
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,800
Ding-a-dum.

1172
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,580
Ding-a-dum.

1173
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,660
Da-da-da-da.

1174
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,220
After you jump, and they take you to the morgue

1175
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,260
And after you jump, and they ask me why, what for

1176
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:35,600
But I don't know why, but can I come along for delight?

1177
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,720
After you jump, they'll say that you had everything

1178
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,720
After you jump, they'll say that you could really swing

1179
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,340
Before you go, oh, oh, can I hear the stereo?

1180
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,000
After you jump

1181
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,140
After you jump

1182
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:13,000
After you jump, oh, oh, can I hear the stereo?

1183
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,140
Oh, oh, can I hear the stereo?

1184
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,360
Oh, oh, can I hear the stereo?

1185
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:27,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, can I hear the stereo?

1186
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,820
Coming down now are the first of New York's once wealthiest citizens.

1187
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,720
It's estimated so many people quite sensibly plunge magnificently from this point

1188
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,020
that if they all pried the sidewalks in one time

1189
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,720
there wouldn't be enough room on Wall Street to take care of them.

1190
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,460
Funny, funny smells.

1191
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,000
Oh, boy.

1192
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:01,820
Eek!

1193
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,640
Meanwhile back on the street

1194
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,220
This clown in a gown and a hat with tattoos on his shoulder

1195
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,720
Comes over and whispers, it's gonna be alright

1196
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,380
It says he's in!

1197
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,420
Personal friend of the boss

1198
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,620
And then asked if we got any sheep

1199
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,840
He can sacrifice later that night

1200
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,380
We said no, said oh, and then wanted all

1201
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,560
Chantin' some strange sound of language

1202
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,620
And wait for his world in the sky

1203
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,400
Most unusual individual confused me in all that

1204
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,080
Sam and Attila, their skin-dead field of action and danger

1205
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,040
They burned every manger in town

1206
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,780
And old John's eyes were hazy

1207
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,040
Must have gone crazy

1208
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,000
Goin' around trying to drown everybody he found

1209
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,360
And the Austrian son was still having his fun

1210
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,080
No, should be too sad to death

1211
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,120
They know that all we're making is sound

1212
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:15,580
And then they move it all, making this sound

1213
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,820
And it's a warning without any warning

1214
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,740
The sky opened up and the boss stuck his head through the clouds

1215
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,820
Something they'd never seen before

1216
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,440
And the army and navy, they opened a fire

1217
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,000
But it grabbed them, that lightning

1218
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,080
That laid them all under the ground

1219
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,100
Sam jumped up to salute

1220
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,660
The boss said that's real cute

1221
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,840
But it's a little bit lame

1222
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,260
Cause I've seen what's been goin' down

1223
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,640
Sam said, you've done it all wrong

1224
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,640
It's them that you're wrong, not me

1225
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,460
Can't you see that's Attila and the Austrian kid?

1226
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,940
The boss says, yes that's true

1227
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,260
But I also want you

1228
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,780
Do you think that I'm blind?

1229
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,180
Did you think you could keep yourself hid?

1230
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,860
And just then the clown in the gown hits the ground

1231
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,340
And starts kissing his feet

1232
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,560
But his steps on his feet are all the same

1233
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,400
And his tongue says, who is this kid?

1234
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,700
Alright, look everyone

1235
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,500
He hasn't been gone that long

1236
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,120
Look!

1237
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,020
That's him, that's the guy

1238
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,140
Gotcha

1239
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,300
I swear to God

1240
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,340
It's all a big mistake

1241
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,120
You gotta believe me

1242
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,620
I'm so sorry

1243
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,260
You stand here convicted, very late

1244
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,940
Of sneak thievery

1245
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,740
Low hydrogen

1246
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,020
Greed in

1247
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,720
I'm sorry

1248
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,020
Sodomy

1249
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,780
I don't know what happened

1250
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,220
And enthusiastic corruption of the public good

1251
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,880
You've got the wrong man

1252
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,740
How many times have I heard that before?

1253
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,100
Wall Street is a 500 billion dollar graveyard

1254
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:09,760
Free electricity! Free electricity! Free electricity! Free electricity! Free electricity!

1255
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,860
Wall Street, Skid Row, whatever you want to call it

1256
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,340
Is the worst slum in Lower Manhattan

1257
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:21,120
Oh gee, don't cry

1258
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,160
It ain't so bad

1259
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,620
You go to sleep like a good little kid

1260
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,540
And tomorrow morning everything will be alright

1261
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,260
As if on cue

1262
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,600
Snap it up, will ya? On stage, forgotten man number

1263
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,480
Forgotten man number, everybody on stage

1264
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,800
Come on girls, make it snappy, forgotten man number

1265
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,920
On stage, alright girls, on stage

1266
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,000
Forgotten man number, on stage

1267
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,240
Forgotten man number, alright Miss Carol

1268
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,080
Forgotten man number

1269
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,660
Now, I'll be loud and clear

1270
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,800
Remember my forgotten man?

1271
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,380
You put a rifle in his hand

1272
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,420
You sent him far away

1273
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,980
You shouted, hip hooray

1274
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:09,880
But look at him today

1275
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,160
Remember my forgotten man?

1276
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,600
You had him cultivate the land

1277
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,020
He walked behind a plow

1278
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,620
The sweat fell from his brow

1279
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,800
But look at him right now

1280
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,260
Forgetting him, you see

1281
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,000
Means you're forgetting me

1282
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,340
Like my

1283
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,940
My

1284
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,480
My forgotten man

1285
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,320
Remember my forgotten man

1286
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,740
You put a rifle in his hand

1287
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,380
You sent him far away

1288
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,020
You shouted here for air

1289
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,120
But look at him today

1290
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,400
Remember my forgotten man

1291
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,740
You had him cultivate the land

1292
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,620
He walked behind the plow

1293
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,040
The sweat fell from his brow

1294
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,760
But look at him right now

1295
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,620
Forgetting him, you see

1296
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,140
Means you're forgetting me

1297
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,000
Like my forgotten man

1298
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,740
What do you think we are?

1299
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:41,460
Animals?

1300
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,520
What are we?

1301
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,140
Almost shaking?

1302
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,520
You're right.

1303
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:47,800
We're men.

1304
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,140
We are men.

1305
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,100
We are men.

1306
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,140
We are men.

1307
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,020
We are men.

1308
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,800
We are men.

1309
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,460
Run!

1310
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,260
Run!

1311
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,980
Now let me see those eyes.

1312
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,680
I don't think I feel so good about this all of a sudden.

1313
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,940
I wouldn't do this!

1314
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,800
It's nowhere near the wake.

1315
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,020
No about that.

1316
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:30,760
What I'm saying is no such thing as просто

1317
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,080
Does it make me happy to see him fcry like this?

1318
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,000
I don't even know why subscribe to this channel

1319
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,840
Bye bye

1320
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,660
Stay there for a while

1321
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,240
And live in this right way

1322
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,940
Oh don't doing well

1323
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,200
This is dangerous

1324
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,980
Understand more

1325
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,000
What benefits?

1326
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,000


1327
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,380
Stay, well not GREAT

1328
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:50,380


1329
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:50,380


1330
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:50,580
Estoy...

1331
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,000
Hey!

1332
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,000


1333
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,000


1334
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,320
You

1335
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:51,320


1336
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:51,320


1337
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:51,320


1338
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:51,320


1339
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:51,340
The people

1340
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,340


1341
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,340


1342
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,340


1343
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,340


1344
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,340


1345
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,340


1346
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,340


1347
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,340


1348
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,480
Don't do it

1349
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:51,920
We're loose

1350
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,120
Never

1351
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,740
Not right now

1352
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:52,880
Jesus

1353
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,260
Oh, hear this.

1354
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,760
Oh, hear this.

1355
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,020
Oh, hear this.

1356
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,200
Go to your cabin and wait there.

1357
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,620
Maybe the ship's going down with all hands down.

1358
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,700
This is the United States Army.

1359
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,180
You're surrounded.

1360
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,460
You have 30 seconds to move.

1361
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,960
You have 56 minutes.

1362
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,960
Your head is full.

1363
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,140
You're a defender.

1364
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,360
We are the real forgotten men.

1365
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,440
Yes, we're forgotten.

1366
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,940
We're not to break the track again.

1367
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,240
For we are forgotten.

1368
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,520
We're not to fall back by.

1369
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,000
Oh, glory was our pride.

1370
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,440
But soon our glory died.

1371
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,280
Now the young are memory.

1372
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,480
Oh, we're forgotten.

1373
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,420
Remember your forgotten men.

1374
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,020
We're forgotten.

1375
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,080
We're not to let us live again.

1376
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,540
We may be marched away.

1377
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,900
To fight for you, I say.

1378
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,340
But we're forgotten.

1379
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,060
We're forgotten.

1380
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,580
We're forgotten.

1381
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:01,940
We're forgotten.

1382
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,780
We're forgotten.

1383
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:05,320
We're forgotten.

1384
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,540
We're forgotten.

1385
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,220
We're forgotten.

1386
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,800
We're forgotten.

1387
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,220
Please just forget about it.

1388
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,200
Leaving the sprawling financial tenement district behind,

1389
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,760
we find ourselves suddenly out in the open

1390
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,040
in a beautiful park

1391
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,340
at the very tip of the mountain.

1392
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,340
The top of the island looks quiet now.

1393
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:25,720
Oh!

1394
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:26,580
Oh!

1395
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,060
Yeah, very funny.

1396
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,780
We have learned that the stock market may go down,

1397
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,980
but the sun will always come up.

1398
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,200
The sun will come out tomorrow.

1399
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,740
Bet you bought a dollar that you'll borrow.

1400
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:41,660
Ah!

1401
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,500
Sir, listen.

1402
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:47,000
If we could, for a moment, move on to the subject of fiscal policy.

1403
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,000
Fiscal policy?

1404
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:48,240
Yes.

1405
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,300
How can you have money?

1406
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,840
It doesn't grow on trees, you know.

1407
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,760
Well, if you would allow me to continue.

1408
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,460
Yes, since we decided a few weeks ago

1409
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,160
to adopt leaves as legal tender,

1410
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,820
we have, of course, all become immensely rich.

1411
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,760
Yes, I really wonder if that's the case.

1412
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,240
But we have also run into a small inflation problem

1413
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,120
on account of the high level of leaf availability,

1414
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,100
which means that I gather the current going rate

1415
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,980
has something like three major deciduous forests

1416
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,080
buying one peanut.

1417
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,600
So in order to obviate this problem

1418
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,300
and effectively revalue the leaf,

1419
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,820
we are about to embark on an extensive defoiling process.

1420
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,020
So the idea is to do what we do best.

1421
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,020


1422
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,020


1423
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,020


1424
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,020


1425
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,020


1426
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,020


1427
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,300
and start a new irrigation campaign

1428
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,400
and, um, burn down all the forests.

1429
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,100
I think that's a sensible move, don't you?

1430
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,540
That makes economic progress.

1431
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,940
You're absolutely...

1432
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,520
Farming!

1433
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,000
You're a bunch of raving nutters.

1434
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,960
Well, is it, huh?

1435
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,300
I have got news for you.

1436
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,300
It doesn't matter,

1437
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,260
a pair of fetid dingoes' kidneys,

1438
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,460
what you all choose to do from now on.

1439
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,860
Burn down the forest anything.

1440
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,740
It will make a scrap of difference.

1441
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,820
And that's it.

1442
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,100
Your race will be dead, gone,

1443
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,740
and good riddance to you.

1444
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,680
Remember that.

1445
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,360
But there must be something we can do.

1446
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,520
No, nothing, really, nothing,

1447
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,120
because it's all been done.

1448
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,540
I mean, listen, that doesn't change the future

1449
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,140
because we've seen it.

1450
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,940
I mean, wise up, kid.

1451
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,260
The human race is currently sitting round that rock over there

1452
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,320
making documentaries about themselves.

1453
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,520
There's nothing you can do to change it

1454
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,080
because it's already happened.

1455
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,260
It's all been a bit of a waste of time for you, hasn't it?

1456
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,240
It's sad, though.

1457
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,460
Just at the moment, it's a very beautiful planet.

1458
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,120
It is. It is indeed.

1459
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,120
The rich primal greens,

1460
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,680
the river snaking off into the distance,

1461
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,540
the burning trees.

1462
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,660
And that's the way it was.

1463

And that's the way it is.

1464
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,660
And that's the way it's probably gonna be.

1465
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,220
