1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,000
B.D.I.s flexing, flexing, eager to crush out life.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,880
Great teeth gnashing with rage, powerful fingers flashing with hatred.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,680
And now, for the first time on the air,

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,220
The Self-Genius Power of Splash!

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,520
How were we to dislodge him from his perch and bring him back alive?

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,760
That is how the Batiks, the natives, make a complete roof over your head.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Bizarre.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,120
Bizarre.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
Bizarre.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,160
Bizarre.

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,820
Ospar.

12
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,340
Bizarre.

13
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,100
Bizarre.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,900
Ospar.

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,320
Bizarre.

16
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,700
Bizarre.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,680
Bizarre.

18
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,820
They've got their thoughtless road

19
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,500
We'll use our mind control

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,000
They've got their thoughtless road

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,640
We'll use our mind control

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,520
We'll use our mind control

23
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,900
We'll use our mind control

24
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,240
We'll use our mind control

25
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,300
We'll use our mind control

26
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,860
We'll use our mind control

27
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:59,820
We'll use our mind control

28
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,460
We'll use our mind control

29
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,140
We'll use our mind control

30
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,140


31
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,560
And no one but me

32
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,440
I'm not giving a chance

33
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,040
I am a cry

34
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,300
I am sad

35
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
Would you mind if we do that inside?

36
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,200
Please.

37
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,060
He lo-lo-ve-s me.

38
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,700
...Even survive.

39
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,900
Leaving me lon-le-s still.

40
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,260
Your ... supply will never drop off, don't you understand?

41
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,280
Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of being a king?

42
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,200
When they became one?

43
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,920
It's too hideous.

44
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,020
But except for the names, a few other changes if you talk about me.

45
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,480
The story is the same one.

46
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:50,480


47
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,120
I've got an emptiness deep inside.

48
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,380
And I've tried it won't let me go.

49
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,180
Do you understand?

50
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,200
I'm not a man who likes to swear.

51
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,960
But I never cared for the sound of being alone.

52
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,840
I am I said.

53
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,040
There's no one there.

54
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,420
And no one heard me all night.

55
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,320
Even the chair.

56
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,160
I am a cry.

57
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,960
I have said I.

58
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,460
And I have lost it again.

59
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,760
He will survive.

60
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,040
Leaving me lonely still.

61
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,180
I have given red corpuscles enough to fill the frigate.

62
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,580
Do you understand?

63
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm not a man who likes to swear.

64
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,160
But I've tried it won't let me go.

65
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,040
It's too hideous.

66
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,040


67
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,040


68
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,040


69
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,720
It's too hideous.

70
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:38,720


71
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:38,720


72
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,820
And I've tried it won't let me go.

73
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,280
It's too hideous.

74
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,340
I have given red corpuscles enough to fill the frigate.

75
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,320
I am the well true good at swallowing

76
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,580
Thank you.

77
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,640
Thank you.

78
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,500
Thank you.

79
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Thank you.

80
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,300
Thank you.

81
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,700
I'll just start singing.

82
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,560
What kind of song?

83
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,360
Whoa, what's going on here?

84
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,640
You know, it's not all Chris, you know.

85
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
What do you mean?

86
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,440
Really?

87
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,640
What's Chris?

88
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,140
Oh, so nice.

89
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,220
All right.

90
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,440
And that's Chris.

91
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,700
Oh, my God.

92
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,080
Chris, what's up?

93
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,160
Oh, my God.

94
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,680
Oh, my God.

95
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,080
Oh, my God.

96
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,820
Oh, my God.

97
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,340
Oh, my God.

98
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,460
Oh, my God.

99
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,980
No wiggle room.

100
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,320
Go.

101
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,020
Location.

102
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,040
It's time to go to the next place!

103
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,060
What?

104
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,060


105
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,840
You're back!

106
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,660
Oh my god!

107
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,620
I'm back!

108
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,120
What is that?

109
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,620
He doesn't know what he's doing!

110
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,500
This is so unique!

111
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,760
I'm getting hooked on this!

112
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,760
I'm back!

113
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,480
Oh, yes, dear friends.

114
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,660
And welcome to our Slack number 1,571.

115
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,200
That's how many we've done since 1995.

116
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:24,920
1995, and what we just heard was Rural War Room, the strange, strange band from Little Rock with our friend Donovan Suitt and St. Byron Warner.

117
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:36,520
And any bands that we play, I'm going to try to pronounce their name clearly because we've been asked, how do I get this stuff?

118
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,120
How do I pay?

119
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,720
How do I pay for this stuff?

120
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,600
One guy said, okay, you've forced me to become addicted to the Rudy Schwartz project.

121
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,900
How can I give him money?

122
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,980
Well, I can't tell you because a lot of these folks don't do their own fulfillment, nor is their stuff exactly for sale.

123
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,540
All I can say is use your internet and Google them.

124
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,640
Rural War Room.

125
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,500
Did that mix?

126
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,060
The last 10 songs by them I've played on the show.

127
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,960
It was called The Modern Age.

128
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,520
Each one is a different version of The Modern Age from their album, The Modern Age.

129
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:26,200
Before that, there was an instrumental that was happy sounding, but crazy and kind of Zappa-esque in its weirdness level, if not style.

130
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,660
And that was by The Psychoskeletons, our friend Reverend Basil.

131
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,020
And The Psychoskeletons albums are all on SoundClick.

132
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,020
I think that's it.

133
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,320
SoundClick.

134
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,700
Yeah.

135
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:48,640
That horrendous cover of I Am, I Said was by the Rudy Schwartz project.

136
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,580
And Schwartz is spelled S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.

137
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,640
That's actually not really his name.

138
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:07,180
And the very first song we played, Thought Patrol, which was somewhat Devo-esque, was by a band called The Fart.

139
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:23,760
Fantastic Plastics, which we did see along with Rural War Room, come to think of it, at the last devotional held here in Cleveland by the devotees of the band Devo, I think.

140
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,300
Didn't Reverend Mark have a birthday recently?

141
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,420
And he's got a big art show opening at the MoCA.

142
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,080
You can go have a MoCA with Mark at the MoCA.

143
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,540
Yes.

144
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:33,920
Yes.

145
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,300
Yes.

146
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,780
Yes.

147
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,340
Yes.

148
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:35,540
Yes.

149
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,020
Yes.

150
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,720
Yes.

151
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,160
Yes.

152
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


153
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


154
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


155
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


156
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


157
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


158
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


159
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


160
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


161
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


162
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


163
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


164
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


165
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


166
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


167
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


168
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


169
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


170
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


171
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


172
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


173
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,160


174
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,920
Yes.

175
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,120
Yes.

176
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,040
Mark Mothersbaugh show.

177
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,920
We went to a show last night, Princess We and I did.

178
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,840
I don't get out much, but she does.

179
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,860
And we saw the band that's playing the music in the background.

180
00:16:51,360 --> 00:17:06,920
We went to the Spaces Art Gallery where there was kind of a CD release party and concert for this CD called Sons of Time by Ron Slabe and Halim El Dab.

181
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,240
And we've played Ron Slabe's electronic music on the show in the past.

182
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,740
He's a regular performer at Starwood.

183
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,360
And friend.

184
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,860
And Halim El Dab is a famed composer.

185
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,940
That's him in the background.

186
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,380
Listen.

187
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,160
That's Halim.

188
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,940
That's Halim.

189
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,780
Halim is Egyptian.

190
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,180
He's a great musician.

191
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,180


192
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,180


193
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,180


194
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,180


195
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,180


196
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,680
In fact, he's a Pharaoh.

197
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,920
And he's not a young man.

198
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,860
He's, I believe he's now 3,092.

199
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,300
Yes.

200
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:56,400
The last time I had a long chat with him, he told me that he was one third man and one

201
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,180
third God.

202
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:57,880
Yes.

203
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,560
And he didn't tell me what the other third was.

204
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,720
And I presume that that was microorganisms in his...

205
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,160
Because we're all one third microorganisms.

206
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,640
We're all microorganisms in our guts.

207
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,140
There's a lot more of them than there are of each of us, anyway.

208
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,240
There's only one of me, but there's 18 billion little flora and fauna down there inside my

209
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,640
tummy.

210
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,120
Indeed.

211
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,700
Anyway, and even Pharaohs, I guess.

212
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,400
But yeah, Halim El Dab has been around forever and he inspires us all to be around forever.

213
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,840
His name is spelled in an unusual way, El Dab.

214
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,140
Sounds kind of like a name.

215
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,680
It's a name that's like Bob Dobbs, doesn't it?

216
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,540
Yes, it does.

217
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:41,820
Halim El Dab.

218
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,660
Like we say, there's no prob with El Dab.

219
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,160
No prob with El Dab.

220
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,320
El Dab spelled backwards is still Bad-leh.

221
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,560
And Halim is also known to his Fremen followers as Moad Dab or the stud.

222
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,740
And so keep your eye out.

223
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:04,360
There's...

224
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,780
It's...

225
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,740
Oh, I was going to read what Halim said about this music.

226
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,220
Yes.

227
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,900
This is great.

228
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,780
Liner notes.

229
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,140
Liner notes.

230
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,360
Yeah, the liner notes in this are fabulous.

231
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,900
Okay.

232
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm trying to delete.

233
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,480
The sonic expression of the album helped me discover my resonance.

234
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,020
I am walking, suspended in time on different spheres.

235
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,320
Surrounded by clouds.

236
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,700
Birds fly all around while I travel strange seas.

237
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,940
Rising and falling between the crests and troughs of the waves.

238
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:56,780
I am propelled and ejected into the newly undefined space only to be examined by an

239
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:05,120
alien intelligence who came on a silent wind in response to the ancestors' voices.

240
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,840
I poorly say I am quick, mark my horses with axes of anguish.

241
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,120
And Ron Slabe said...

242
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,140
... These recordings represent an oral dichotomy.

243
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,420
Acoustic versus electric.

244
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
Field recording versus studio.

245
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,760
Analog versus digital.

246
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,980
Ancient versus modern.

247
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:27,020
We as artists walked the thin line between the extremes, weaving in and out, as if drunk

248
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,740
on the paradoxical juxtapositions between them.

249
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,020
And while I'm going to basis已经 humble how some things of this daily routine on the

250
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,020


251
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,100
My buddy, Bhim, ArWeem, lives it.

252
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,100


253
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,720
And, yeah, pretty crazy, man.

254
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,400
Now, I'm going to fade that down, although I could fade it back up again any minute,

256
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:54,180
because I have a rant to do, not by me, because I'm not, I've just got too much slack

257
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,100
to do these kinds of rants myself anymore.

258
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:07,960
But this is something found by Reverend, the good Reverend Roger of Tucson,

259
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,780
found lurking on his hard drive a year or so ago.

260
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,180
I've got just the perfect music for it.

261
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,900
The government has been screaming at me for my whole life

262
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,080
that crackhead Godzilla is on a business.

263
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,020
He's a slander and he's screwing our collective crap royally.

264
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,980
When I was a young man, Godzilla was a communist.

265
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,040
Later, he was a drug-crazed maniac.

266
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,180
Then, he was a madman in a turban.

267
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,500
Then, just a little over ten years ago, the government came out and told us the truth.

268
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,100
As Pogo once said, we have met the enemy and he is us.

269
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,600
In short, I'm now told that I am the enemy.

270
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,080
That if I talk about it, I'm the enemy.

271
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,280
If I talk about the Constitution, I should be watched closely.

272
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,580
If I oppose the endless wars we get in,

273
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,320
I'm to be put in a dossier and hassled at every opportunity.

274
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,760
It turns out that after all these years, I am Godzilla.

275
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,280
And, dear friends, you could be Godzilla too.

276
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:24,040
Yes, the government and the electorate that puts up with them is really that sick.

277
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,680
But, if I'm Godzilla and I don't want to go to reptile jail,

278
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,700
or some camp in Guantanamo Bay, or the Arctic,

279
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,440
oh, you didn't hear that from me,

280
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,020
then I'm going to have to be Godzilla in disguise.

281
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,060
Everything, metaphorically, of course, falls down,

282
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,520
catches fire, and sinks into the swamp,

283
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,480
and no giant lizard to be seen.

284
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,080
Call me the enemy, will you?

285
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,900
I'll give you the enemy, you swine,

286
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,680
and I will not rest until I've penetrated you with my gigantic dinosaur appendage.

287
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,760
In your ear hole!

288
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:09,840
I was content to sit by and stack up my pitiful pile of filthy lucre.

289
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,780
I was content to run my mouth about you bastards, but leave it at that.

290
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,700
I never even got off my arse about the camp x-ray thing, or even Abu Ghraib.

291
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,260
But as the great Saint Vince once said,

292
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,040
if they do it for you, they'll do it to you.

293
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,980
And he was, of course.

294
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,160
Utterly correct.

295
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,480
Everyone believed him, him being a holy man and all,

296
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,020
but we didn't really believe it.

297
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,980
So now there's armored vehicles.

298
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,960
Lots of armored vehicles in Tucson.

299
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,900
Who the hell needs armored vehicles here?

300
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,240
It's too hot to riot,

301
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,440
and I don't see the ghost of Erwin Rommel leading the DAK out of the Santa Ritas anytime soon.

302
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,360
I see buses without windows,

303
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,780
and the name Wackenhut on the side,

304
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,640
and small letters.

305
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,120
Windowless buses taking people from one prison to another.

306
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,180
What are they guilty of?

307
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,960
Arizona has a fairly low violent crime rate.

308
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,980
So how do they have so many people that they have to move three or four buses a day?

309
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,160
Oh yeah, they're shipping people to the facility south of Tucson,

310
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:25,360
where we store the worst and most violent offenders for being caught with a pocket full of sunshine.

311
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,040
Bear in mind, they're stacking them.

312
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,200
Six to a two-man cell in that place.

313
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,980
This isn't so much punishment for being caught with some weed or some happy pills

314
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,340
as it is a warning to the rest of us.

315
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,500
Stay in line or else go to hell before you even die.

316
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,040
And that can be arranged too.

317
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,360
All of this may make me sound like an anarchist.

318
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,280
I am not.

319
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,800
I am in fact a bit of a statist.

320
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,020
But a statist who is mad at the state in the same manner

321
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,120
as a libertarian would be mad at pay cops if they suddenly robbed him.

322
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,360
Is the libertarian going to get another gang of pay cops to arrest the first gang?

323
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,160
Good luck with that sucker.

324
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,780
Same thing applies here.

325
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,760
Try to get the government to control itself.

326
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,560
It hasn't really been able to even pretend to do so since the Reagan administration.

327
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,600
So, how can you beat them?

328
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,460
Well, you can't.

329
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,280
The most you can do is make them miserable.

330
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,720
Get a little of your own back.

331
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,440
Find ways to torment your local state and federal government.

332
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,080
Not threats.

333
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,920
They know how to deal with threats.

334
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,540
Actually, I can't tell you any of his suggestions.

335
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,840
Look for creative ways to turn their paperwork against them.

336
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,040
Prank call the local Wells Fargo bank managers.

337
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,180
You're a pack of creative bastards.

338
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,280
I imagine you could come up with a trick or two.

339
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,660
The thing is, it's not just Congress and the president you see.

340
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,660
It's the entire system.

341
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,540
Every squirrely little bastard.

342
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,400
Every bastard with an ounce of pretend power.

343
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,180
So, be Godzilla.

344
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,540
A compact, quiet version of him.

345
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,440
A velociraptor-sized model.

346
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,960
Eat what you can, burn the rest, and grin through your six-inch fags.

347
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,600
And this is signed, I remain, or kill me, the good Reverend Roger.

348
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,980
A real man made of help and a real prosecutor made of wrestling.

349
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,860
You have your freedom

but he doesn't quite know how to deal with their bathroom situation.

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,100
There's this giant mistress, a gigantic woman, let's guess that she's about 80 feet tall.

367
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,140
She set me on a table where I showed her my sword, all bloody,

368
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,840
and wiping it on the lappet of my coat, returned it to the scabbard.

369
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:01,860
I was pressed to do more than one thing which another could not do for me,

370
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,720
and therefore endeavored to make my mistress understand that I desired to be set down on the floor,

371
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:14,080
which, after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself further

372
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,960
than by pointing to the door and bowing several times.

373
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,160
The good woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived what I would be at,

374
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:29,480
and taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden where she set me down.

375
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,640
I went on one side about 200 yards, and beckoning to her not to look or follow me,

376
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:43,700
I hid myself between two leaves of sorrel, and there discharged the necessities of nature.

377
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,000
I love the way he puts all this.

378
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,280
I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the like particulars,

379
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,040
which, however,

380
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,980
insignificant they appear to groveling vulgar minds,

381
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,020
yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge his thoughts and imagination,

382
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,800
and apply them to the benefit of public as well as private life,

383
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,340
which was my sole design in presenting this and other accounts of my travels to the world,

384
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,340
wherein I have been chiefly studious of truth,

385
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,920
without affecting any ornaments of learning or of style.

386
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,780
Well, I...

387
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,140
I think the last thing I want to do is to go to bed.

388
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,920
I don't think the lady doth protest too much.

389
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,560
I don't think he runs, well, yeah, he does run into a little bit more bathroom struggle

390
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,340
when he falls in among the yahoo's or yahoo's,

391
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,540
which are what we would now call humans, dear friends.

392
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,520
The yahoo's are prodigiously nimble from their infancy.

393
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,000
However, I once caught a young male, of three years old,

394
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,780
and endeavored,

395
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,120
by all marks of faith,

396
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,120


397
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:59,340
tenderness to make it quiet. But the little imp fell a-squalling and scratching and biting with

398
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:05,820
such violence that I was forced to let it go, and it was high time for a whole troop of old ones

399
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:14,380
came about us at the noise. But finding the cub was safe, for away it ran, and my sorrel nag being

400
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:21,980
nearby, they durst not venture near us. Because, you see, horses are the civilized creatures on

401
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:27,940
this land, and the humans are the animals. I observed the young animal's flesh to smell very

402
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:34,520
rank, and the stink was somewhat between a weasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable.

403
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,980
I forgot another circumstance, and perhaps I might have the reader's pardon if it were wholly

404
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:47,640
omitted, that while I held the odious vermin in my hands, it voided its filthy excrements of a yellow

405
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,960
liquid substance all over my clothes. But, by good fortune, I was able to get it out of the

406
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,480
house, and I was able to get it out of the house. And, by good fortune, there was a small brook hard

407
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,520
by, where I washed myself as clean as I could, although I durst not come into my master's presence

408
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:04,600
until I were sufficiently aired. And by what I could discover, the yahoos appear to be the most

409
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,500
unteachable of all animals, their capacities never reaching higher than to draw or carry burdens.

410
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,480
And, friends, you know, if you act like a dumb person, they'll treat you as an equal.

411
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,820
Yet I am of the opinion this defect ariseth chiefly from a

412
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:28,960
perverse, restive disposition, for they are cunning, malicious, treacherous, and revengeful.

413
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,140
They are strong and hardy, but of a cowardly spirit, and by consequence, insolent, abject,

414
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:41,060
and cruel. It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous

415
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:47,720
than the rest, whom they yet much exceed in strength and activity. So there's Jonathan Swift

416
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,520
on humans, and especially redheads.

417
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,620
Hear that, Susie? Now, let's, uh, I know what she's saying.

418
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,480
I'm not really a redhead.

419
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:10,400
Okay. Oh, uh, he, he also, that, in the very third of the Gulliver travels, um, travels,

420
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:20,460
he goes to the floating island of Laputa, where, um, everyone is an expert. And last week we read

421
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,960
as a physician, he was a physician, and he was a physician, and he was a physician, and he was a

422
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,960
physician, and he was a physician, and he was a physician, and he was a physician, and he was a

423
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:31,500
cure him of colic. Uh, he ran into other advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall say

424
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,820
something when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who is called among them the

425
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:43,980
universal artist. He told us he had been 30 years employing his thoughts for the improvement of

426
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,600
human life. He had two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities and 50 men at work.

427
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,840
Some were condensed.

428
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,220
Injor.

429
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,120
Chris is aiest.

430
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,340
All right, so when sport went wrong, white folk would.

431
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,340


432
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,120
And she'sím gitget it.

433
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,620
Yes, implant your handСТO hey.

434
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:09,620


435
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:09,620


436
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:09,940


437
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,700
was wanted for a imitation.

438
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,840
She gonna died right?

439
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,700
She gonna die at the像

440
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,080
Loud been telling us.

441
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,980
She's are.

442
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:30,600
The artist himself was at that time busy upon two great designs, the first to sow land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I was not skillful enough to comprehend.

443
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:48,260
The other was by a certain composition of gums, minerals, and vegetables outwardly applied to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs, and he hoped in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked sheep all over the kingdom.

444
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:58,340
I think he must have succeeded at that, because I look around our kingdom and I see quite a few naked sheep.

445
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,260
Really?

446
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,580
Well, I see a lot of...

447
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,800
...of sheep, and their nakedity offends me.

448
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:14,120
Another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering plots and conspiracies against the government.

449
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:29,100
He advised great statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons their times of eating, on which side they lay in bed, and with which hand they wiped their posteriors.

450
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,320
To take a...

451
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:42,740
...strict view of their excrements, and from the cull-hour, the odour, the taste, the consistence, the crudeness or maturity of digestion, form a judgment of their thoughts and designs.

452
00:36:43,620 --> 00:37:00,580
Because men are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent as when they are at stool, which he found by frequent experiment, for in such conjunctures, when he used merely as a trial, to consider which was the best way of murdering them.

453
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:00,580


454
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:09,560
But in the case of murdering the king, his ordure would have a tincture of green, but quite different when he thought only of raising an insurrection, or burning the metropolis.

455
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,100
Hmm.

456
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,520
So, uh, there's a lot to be learned there from your little poopies there, Fran.

457
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,220
I suppose so.

458
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,920
If you, if you really know your stuff.

459
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,900
As it were.

460
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,720
Well, we're still hearing the, um...

461
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,360
...the lovely, lilting...

462
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,160
...tunes of Sansa Thyme in the background.

463
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,040
That's, uh, what is that little instrument that African piano...

464
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,660
Kalimba.

465
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,900
Yeah, the little kalimba.

466
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,240
It's...

467
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,300
They're both, they both play kalimbas, but...

468
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,400
...they use a lot of extra stuff.

469
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,460
Yes, they do.

470
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
Some echoey stuff.

471
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,600
And, uh...

472
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,040
Some little tablets, too, and other electronic devices.

473
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,860
Well, they have a big stack of iPads.

474
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,320
I mean, it's like these little, tiny, primitive-looking instruments.

475
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,900
And, and a turtle!

476
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,580
A turtle shell!

477
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,320
Mm-hmm.

478
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,760
Just like the one I almost ran over a month ago.

479
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,280
Mm-hmm.

480
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,140
Same kind of water cooter.

481
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:13,640
But it was, it was an empty shell, but it had a microphone attached to it, so you could blow, I guess you'd blow into it or make kind of a...

482
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,140
...turtle shell sound.

483
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,600
All those electronics and a turtle shell.

484
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,800
Rural War Room is like that.

485
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,180
They have all these electronics, and then, and then in front of Byron is a bunch of noisemakers, including, uh...

486
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,500
...a kite.

487
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,080
...a coyote call.

488
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,460
That was my contribution to the band.

489
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,300
And, uh, yeah, there's some strange bands out there, friends, that's for sure.

490
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:39,920
I'm in one.

491
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,360
Princess, we and I are in a band.

492
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,000
We're, we're in Doctors for Wotan.

493
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,480
We're gonna be performing at, uh, X-Day.

494
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,260
Sure.

495
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,100
Not at Starwood.

496
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,000
No.

497
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,580
No, they don't, they don't have doctor bands at Starwood.

498
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:52,940
No.

499
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,540
No.

500
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:53,920
Just X-Day.

501
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,460
Unless we did one in the Pufferdome.

502
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,900
That's still up in the air.

503
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,480
That's true.

504
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,380
I could just bring all our fart pianos and hand out...

505
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,700
toy musical instruments

506
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,620
and have everybody in the puffer dome

507
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,520
become the band.

508
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,720
And me and Philo can sit, and you can sit in the audience

509
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,640
and watch the audience play our

510
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,420
band music.

511
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,860
Sounds like a plan.

512
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,040
That's the one

513
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,300
good thing about

514
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,520
doctor music, subgenius doctor music,

515
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,640
is you can do that.

516
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
You can get up on stage

517
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,580
and start

518
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
pretending you know how to play your instruments,

519
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,340
but you start seducing

520
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,120
the audience into coming up on stage,

521
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,280
or at least grabbing instruments.

522
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,180
After a while, you get it set up

523
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,300
to where the whole audience is up on stage

524
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,340
and you and your buddy

525
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,040
who were supposed to be in the band

526
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,800
are sitting in the audience

527
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,320
twiddling your thumbs and checking

528
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,160
the recording levels.

529
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,100
The editor of

530
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,460
Performance Art Magazine

531
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,880
in the 80s saw that happen

532
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,240
at the Baltimore World Subgenius

533
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,320
Convention and decided that we were the most

534
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,220
advanced performance artists

535
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,940
ever, even though

536
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,160
quote, none of them

537
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,780
even went to art school.

538
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,900
We're real proud of that.

539
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,220
And I wrote a column for

540
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,340
Performance Art Magazine about performance artists

541
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,320
of the kind that you didn't usually

542
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,060
think about, like professional

543
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,020
wrestlers, professional

544
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,600
preachers.

545
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,160
These are performance artists

546
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,380
that bleed for their art

547
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:26,720
friends.

548
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,880
For real.

549
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,680
Well,

550
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,960
Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave

551
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,680
couldn't call in tonight because

552
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,460
he was sick.

553
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,440
Dave.

554
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,580
Friend, send your

555
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,000
powerful alien healing

556
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,020
rave vibes out

557
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,840
towards Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

558
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,520
Yes.

559
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,880
I'd give you his email or his

560
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,000
Facebook page, but I can't because I don't think

561
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,280
he has any of that stuff.

562
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,700
Just rush them swiftly to

563
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,140
the place that you

564
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,540
know is Dave.

565
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,740
Right. Yeah.

566
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,460
The place that you know is Dave.

567
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,560
The place that you know is Dave.

568
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,060
And Dave will get your vibes.

569
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,840
And hopefully he'll heal swiftly.

570
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,000
Well, what else

571
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,740
do I have on this CD in the background?

572
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,900
Hey, when you don't have

573
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,840
Dave, you just use puzzling

574
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,900
evidence cuts. And I have

575
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,520
a really nice stretch of

576
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,020
blabbering by Dr. Philo

577
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,680
Drummond and Dr.

578
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,860
Hal on the Puzzling Evidence Show

579
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,880
from about six months ago, I think,

580
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,080
that I found really interesting

581
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,540
when I listened the other night.

582
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,960
We'll see. Maybe we'll get to the end of it and hear

583
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,160
some more Rural War Room.

584
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,160
Praise Philo. Praise Dr. Hal.

585
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,720
But first, just to get away

586
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,520
from all the voices and talking,

587
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,200
we'll, in theory,

588
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,220
be playing

589
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,640
one of those little one and a half minute

590
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,720
pieces by Reverend Jimmy

591
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,560
Ryan.

592
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,280
Where's Jimmy?

593
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,920
I don't know.

594
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,540
I don't know.

595
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,100
I don't know.

596
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,720
I don't know.

597
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:35,720


598
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:35,720


599
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:35,720


600
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,300
What about if we had Professor Challenger

601
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,380
and Professor Quartermain together

602
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,620
in the same story?

603
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,580
That was done in the League of Extraordinary

604
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,920
Gentlemen. Oh, no, no. Challenger wasn't

605
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,580
in that, though, was it? No, they put Alan

606
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,860
Quartermain there. He's not a professor

607
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,580
so much as a big game hunter.

608
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,040
That's right. That's right.

609
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,820
Professor Challenger might have gotten

610
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,840
along better with Doc Savage, who actually, uh, was a professor.

611
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,700
Actually, what, did have scientific achievements.

612
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,680
Oh, yeah.

613
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,380
Who's the, was it Quartermain?

614
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,460
Who was the, no, who was the character

615
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,180
that was in

616
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,780
Five Million

617
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,140
Miles to,

618
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,580
you know, not so far, I think.

619
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,040
You mean, uh,

620
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,780
Catermass. Catermass. That's

621
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,460
who I'm thinking of. Quartermass, yeah. In the, uh,

622
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,740
the Catermass

623
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,720
experiment. And also the one

624
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,800
where he goes to, uh, they, yeah, where they

625
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,840
find the ancient, uh,

626
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,740
thing that's causing the noise in the middle

627
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,620
of the subway. Yes, that so-called

628
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,680
Five Million Years to Earth. Five million

629
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,680
years to Earth. Known in England, where it

630
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,740
originated as Catermass and the Pit.

631
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,720
That's a good movie. Have you

632
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,640
ever seen Enemy, is it

633
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,560
Enemy from Space, the second

634
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,480
movie? That's the rarest one

635
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,720
of the series where aliens

636
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,440
have taken over this industrial

637
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,560
installation in England and their

638
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,640
huge alien blobs are

639
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,940
growing in vats in this giant factory.

640
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,760
No, I don't remember that one.

641
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,080
It's a pretty good one.

642
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,700
Catermass in it, too. Yes, it does.

643
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,460
It's his second outing.

644
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,520
The first one is, um,

645
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,440
The Creeping Unknown.

646
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,700
Where a spaceship crashes

647
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,100
and the guy gets out and

648
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,600
morphs into a huge monster which

649
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,820
pulls up in Westminster Abbey.

650
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,600
These were based, these movies were

651
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,700
pretty good. They were based on teleplays

652
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,080
that were even better by

653
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,840
Nigel Neill that everybody in England

654
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,500
watched when they were on.

655
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,000
For one thing, there wasn't much to do in England

656
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,520
after the Second World War.

657
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,860
About the only entertainment was

658
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,760
to watch these things

659
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,600
on TV. They made a sensation.

660
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,560
And so, because of their

661
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,520
popularity, they made the movies

662
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,700
based on those. And the movies kind

663
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,540
of lost some of the subtlety

664
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,820
and interest that was in the

665
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,700
teleplay. Hey, I hear a caller trying

666
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,700
to come up out of the caller pool. I wish

667
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,780
I could hear him. I know he's there. Maybe

668
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,780
they're listening to... Is there a caller?

669
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,940
Hello, caller.

670
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,140
No, it's a lost

671
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,200
cause. We'll never hear that caller.

672
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,940
But it's comforting to know that

673
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,940
they're actually there. Still trying to get

674
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,040
I think they take care of each other when they're in the pool

675
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,620
together, you know. They pad each other on the back.

676
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,180
Try to keep each other afloat

677
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,540
and not drown, you know.

678
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,260
Give each other a crust of bread.

679
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,700
A crust of bread, a

680
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,320
jug of wine.

681
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,860
And they hold hands during

682
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,580
a non-violent die-in.

683
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,920
Yeah, that was the Professor Quatermass.

684
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,700
That's what I was thinking of, yeah.

685
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,840
Played in two of the movies by

686
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
Brian Donlevy.

687
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,540
Yeah, the one with the

688
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,820
London Underground and the Martian spacecraft

689
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,060
buried. Yeah, he wasn't in that one.

690
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,760
That had influenced human evolution.

691
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,640
I liked that one.

692
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,300
That was a good story. Yes, it was.

693
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,280
It was actually a good story. It was well done.

694
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,760
Because the...

695
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,560
It was a crashed Martian spaceship.

696
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,080
Oh, there he is.

697
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,620
Is this how you use the

698
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,280
divine gift of being able to be heard

699
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:11,800
on the show?

700
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,340
He's kind of

701
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,660
broke. That's difficult to understand.

702
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,960
Yeah, it's so broke

703
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,060
it can't be fixed.

704
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,900
Well, um...

705
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,600
Do not try to fix it

706
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,740
and do not mess with Texas, man.

707
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,520
Dr. Howe, we know you.

708
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:27,840
You're a good man.

709
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:27,840


710
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:27,840


711
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:27,840


712
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,800
We got your name. We got your number.

713
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,220
We got your number.

714
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,720
We got your number.

715
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,780
Okay, well then send me some plastic dinosaurs

716
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,540
or a couple of chicks

717
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,440
so I can purchase them myself.

718
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,480
But send them on the other show because this show here doesn't take money

719
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,880
except for KPFA, which you can send any time you want.

720
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,720
Well, I'm not giving out a name. I can't give out an

721
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,700
address. You know, I can't really

722
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,480
make that sort of decision. No, you can't do that.

723
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,980
But if you listen

724
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,260
to Dr. Howe's show,

725
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,140
Why won't you just...

726
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,660
If you just listen, if you just listen,

727
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,820
it's even worse if you just listen.

728
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,060
And when you listen, you can just concentrate

729
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,100
on what you hear.

730
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,600
Visualization

731
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,480
We're in a sports-to-earth policy here.

732
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,660
Yes. I'll teach you

733
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,560
the secrets of the truth. What do you think we burn

734
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,640
those bridges for so that we're

735
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,740
setting fire to the earth and the bridge gets on

736
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,460
fire and just now everything

737
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,380
goes downhill from there. It's a

738
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,840
conflagration. You shall learn that which cannot be unlearned.

739
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,160
A powerful theory as well.

740
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,540
I have a powerful theory of...

741
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,720
If Paul Paul came and he had to swear, you know...

742
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,800
It's gone. What would happen

743
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,360
if the Power Pack kids

744
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,200
met the Powder Puff Girl?

745
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:34,660
Yeah.

746
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,860
You know, it is the power. It's not Powder Puff.

747
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,560
Oh, okay. It's Power Puff Girl.

748
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,740
But they go to powder their nose all at the

749
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,240
same time. Yeah, they use the almond

750
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,600
brake heavily in that...

751
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,900
their theme song.

752
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:55,400
The role of

753
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,660
George Edward Challenger has been played

754
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,740
in the movies by

755
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,880
Wallace Beery, Claude Rains,

756
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,800
John Rhys-Davies.

757
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,180
...

758
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:06,920
...

759
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,040
...

760
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,240
...

761
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:13,860
...

762
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:15,860
...

763
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,040
...

764
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,720
...

765
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:21,860
...

766
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:21,860


767
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:21,860


768
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:51,860


769
00:49:51,860 --> 00:50:21,860


770
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:27,440
In the late 80s, I was, you know, pretty much coked out to my gills all the time, pretty much.

771
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,220
Yeah, pretty much.

772
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,000
Pretty much all the time.

773
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,480
I didn't watch any TV during the 80s.

774
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,800
Too much to do with Cyrus Vance and other fancy pants characters.

775
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:46,560
During the Jimmy Carter and James Earl Carter administration in France,

776
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,480
they did the special dance with Cyrus Vance.

777
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,180
I'll have some proof of that next time, though.

778
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:58,460
Because I'm not going to go on just a wing and a prayer and a hope and a dream

779
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,500
and a wink and a nod.

780
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,940
There's one motor gone still I must carry on.

781
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,560
It's got to be something more solid than that.

782
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,940
I've got to have something I can chew on, something we can sink our teeth into,

783
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,440
something with some substance to it, something that we know when we swallow

784
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,320
that it's going to hit our belly with a big resounding...

785
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,420
Whoa!

786
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,040
Whoa, watch that.

787
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,400
I don't know what kind of sound it makes, actually.

788
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,260
I don't have a microphone down there to measure properly.

789
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:33,080
Now, if you're ever swallowed by a giant snake, there are some things that you ought to consider.

790
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,440
I'm glad that guy didn't go through with that experiment.

791
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,680
Did you hear about that guy that built a suit so that they caught an anaconda

792
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,100
and they were going to...

793
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:47,880
He built a suit that was a crush-proof suit, and he was going to allow the anaconda to swallow him.

794
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,060
But the anaconda doesn't crush you once you're inside.

795
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:56,240
And then, once he gets in, they were going to then make the anaconda regurgitate.

796
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,140
They've been known to do that.

797
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:05,240
But the problem is that the actual gastric chamber, the stomach of the anaconda,

798
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,200
has acid in it so strong that it'll dissolve your feet while your head is still conscious.

799
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,980
It was a metal suit they were in.

800
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,860
He'd done all his research.

801
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,200
They can dissolve anything.

802
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,260
They can dissolve bones.

803
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,780
They finally got up to the point where they built the suit.

804
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,400
He was ready to go with it.

805
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,740
And then somebody thought, maybe the anaconda doesn't want you to do that.

806
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,960
Yes, exactly.

807
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,220
How about the anaconda?

808
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,440
And they had second thoughts at the last second.

809
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,820
But they went through the long...

810
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,040
You know, they had a whole show on it.

811
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:34,880
It was just ridiculous.

812
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:35,840
Did you...

813
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:42,280
You know, there have been survivors of creatures eaten by the anaconda that are vomited out

814
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,200
and they're simply coated with mucus because they haven't yet entered the gastric chamber.

815
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:51,160
But once you start being dissolved, there's no way out except through the...

816
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,740
other end of the anaconda as a puddle of mush.

817
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,380
Did you ever see the movie Anaconda featuring John Voight?

818
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,840
Because at a certain point in the movie, John Voight is vomited out of the anaconda

819
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:13,320
and covered with mucus, he lands with a plop and then he winks at the audience.

820
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,140
It's extremely disturbing and, well, you'll just have to see.

821
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:18,320
What do you mean, winks?

822
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,780
Was the winking the disturbing part?

823
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,300
Well, he's...

824
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,780
He's a bad guy.

825
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,600
He's eaten by the anaconda.

826
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:28,120
Then it throws him up and he comes out as this mucus-covered blob, but he winks like,

827
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,140
yuck, yuck, this messed with your head, didn't it?

828
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:31,820
Yeah.

829
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,580
I'm going to switch.

830
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,960
I'm not sure what they talk about after that.

831
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,960
That's Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Hal Robbins on the Puzzling Evidence Show

832
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,240
recorded off of KPFA Berkeley back in them days.

833
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,960
I've got one last cut.

834
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,580
I was going to play it before we go home.

835
00:53:54,080 --> 00:54:01,580
It's another rural war room cut that should make you lose your mind if you listen in headphones,

836
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,220
especially.

837
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:12,920
This one's from their CD called Soviet Life, which had three announced cuts, Soviet Life

838
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,000
Yesterday, Soviet Life Today, and Soviet Life Tomorrow.

839
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,280
However, there was a bonus track that I...

840
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,400
I think was Soviet Life Subgenius or something.

841
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,580
That's what I'm going to play now.

842
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:30,220
This is Rural War Room.

843
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,380
Thank you.

844
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:43,140
Oh, and you're listening to The Hour of Slack being produced at the beautiful studios of WCSB in Cleveland this particular night.

845
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:49,460
You can find more information from subgenius.com.

846
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,760
Great thought.

847
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:59,060
What did you want to tell us about the upcoming reality of Soviet Life?

848
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,220
I think Waltім K offenses have been very expensive these days.

849
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:05,720
But I would like toruck in and test on them and see if it's enough right now.

850
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,420
Also, just a bit of a partager there.

851
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,460
Like I mentioned, we've been sending over $5,000 of solar energy to wspu-

852
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,740
We had a low eid money cover- remember?

853
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:17,980
Because there had been huge Allies standing over us.

854
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,360
That's où we need to do it.

855
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:19,420


856
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:19,420


857
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:19,420


858
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,240
Stupid
