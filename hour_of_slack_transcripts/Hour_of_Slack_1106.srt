1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
We understand the value of every single person as a taxpayer.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,700
Now that's the real value of every single human life.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,420
A human life is one that pays taxes.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,920
What do you make of the terrain?

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,120
Only thing that would grow up there is a weed.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,780
And that's what marijuana is. A weed.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,520
Now hear this.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,140
All right, men. The smoking lamp is lit.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,420
You mean we gotta sit here and let a hophead get away with murder?

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:34,840
Yes!

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,820
Great, Scott!

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,840
The Miracle of America.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,680
Uncovered in smelly scales and it's spreading.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,620
All for just $19.99 a month.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,760
And besides, it's fun to have both your eyeballs looking out of the same socket.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,980
There is nothing wrong with your television set.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,500
Do not attempt to adjust the power.

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:58,720
Picture.

19
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,320
We are controlling transmission.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,900
Something must be wrong with the radio, man.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,820
There is nothing wrong with your radio.

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,300
Do not attempt to change the station.

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,080
We wish to make a stop.

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,700
We are controlling the transmission.

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,520
We wish to make a stop.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,940
We control the volume.

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,780
We will control the volume.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,720
We can change the tone to a fuzzy bass.

29
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,460
We will control the volume.

30
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,160
Or focus it to a tinny treble.

31
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,000
We can roll the air.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,560
We can speed things up so fast you can hardly understand what's being said.

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,000
Or we can make things so smooth.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,800
We can change the focus to a soft tone.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,560
We control the content.

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,340
We can make it boring.

37
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:28,680
Food.

38
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,580
Or hilarious.

39
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,680
Food!

40
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,760
Food!

41
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,580
We can make it stupid.

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,720
Here comes the food.

43
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:35,900
Or moronic.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,260
It's our show.

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,000
We can do anything we want.

46
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,120
Because this is...

47
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
The Soul Genius.

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
Our own show.

49
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,180
Quiet numbskulls, I'm broadcasting.

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,160
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

51
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,320
You are about to experience the awe and mystery...

52
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,060
Which reaches from the inner mind to...

53
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,020
Bob?

54
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,860
Hey! These look kinda homemade.

55
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,880
Why don't you see we light up, buddy?

56
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,560
What do you got?

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Light a match.

58
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,560
That smoke smells like marijuana.

59
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,580
Marijuana?

60
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,400
No doubt about it.

61
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:12,760
Bud?

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,300
Yeah.

63
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,040
Man who smokes that stuff could turn killer in a minute.

64
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,000
I heard a lot of hand smokers say that.

65
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,020
I only want to take a few drags.

66
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,580
Later, I said.

67
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,100
Yup!

68
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,320
I got a headline back there all set and gathering dust.

69
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,320


70
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,320


71
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,780
It says...

72
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,640
Kill Bob.

73
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,260
I'd like to...

74
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,000
Kill Bob!

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,740
Oh no!

76
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,820
I wish him a long life!

77
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,280
A life filled with a torture I can now inflict on him!

78
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm going to start right now!

79
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,700
To thwart him in a blendish manner!

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Oh no!

81
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,580
People have been tortured.

82
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,320
People have been tortured.

83
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,120
People have been tortured.

84
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,820
People have been tortured.

85
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,660
People have been tortured.

86
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,220
No, no, no!

87
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,180
Stop that on me!

88
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,400
No, I'm not stopping you!

89
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,620
Listen to me for a second.

90
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,120
You're members of my religion who engage in brainwashing and brainwashing.

91
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,880
Oh, stop it!

92
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,380
You're so...

93
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,540
No, no, no!

94
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,500
Listen to me!

95
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,660
You were not there at the beginning of this!

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,260
You did not hear or record!

97
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,680
Brainwashing.

98
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,480
Brainwashing.

99
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,820
Brainwashing.

100
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,720
You are...

101
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,680
You are close!

102
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,700
You cannot discern what you're saying!

103
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,720
What you're saying!

104
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,080
Now, do you listen to me?

105
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,820
Now, do you listen to me?

106
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,600
Some people say it's a sinister cult.

107
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,140
No, no.

108
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,620
L. Ron Hubbard.

109
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,800
Somebody is shooting.

110
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,780
No, you listen to me.

111
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,740
No, you listen to me.

112
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,860
L. Ron Hubbard.

113
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,640
Isn't a religion.

114
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,620
Isn't a religion.

115
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,820
Definition of religion.

116
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,460
Bigoted.

117
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:30,960
Bigoted.

118
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,880
Is very clear.

119
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,680
Is very clear.

120
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,200
He he freely in this country.

121
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,720
Bigoted.

122
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,040
Buddy, you got it.

123
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,160
Right here, right now.

124
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm angry.

125
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,820
Real angry.

126
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,320
No, it's your turn to listen to me.

127
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,320
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

128
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,980
Why is Mojo dead?

129
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,680
The aliens should have taken.

130
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,540
I've been staying instead.

131
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,180
I've heard they turned him into some killer barbeque.

132
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,960
So I jumped into my rocket and I had a plate or two.

133
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,760
Something in my water in Texas.

134
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,220
Something that helps us keep our peer.

135
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,800
It's the little thing that makes us slowly go insane.

136
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,280
It's the secret ingredient in our fear.

137
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,520
The little thing is the secret ingredient in our fear.

138
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,520


139
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,520


140
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,300
Dead, dead, dead, dead, why is Ivan dead?

141
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,020
The pink boys finally got him, I heard they kept his head

142
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,580
So now he's on a shelf in the archive of the con

143
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,340
They bagged him while he was trying to mow his freaking lawn

144
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,700
There's something in the water in Texas

145
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,080
Something that helps us keep our fear

146
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,400
It's the little thing that makes us slowly go insane

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,980
It's the secret ingredient in our fear

148
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,320
There's something in the water in Texas

149
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,640
Something that helps us keep our fear

150
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,200
It's the little thing that makes us slowly go insane

151
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,520
It's the secret ingredient in our fear

152
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,920
Harbor!

153
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,380
Beer indeed

154
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,180
Secret ingredient

155
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,320
There really is nothing like a short, short, mispronounced

156
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,520
Psycho-psychotic ingredients in his, her beers

157
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,360
I like to make that last consonant very hard, like my forehead

158
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,220
I think that's sick, Sting

159
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,880
I think there's

160
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
There's all those people killing you different ways

161
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,600
I think the equipment in this radio station is sick

162
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,240
I can't hear myself on the headphones here

163
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,940
I think your headphones don't work

164
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,040
How about if I put my finger in your ear

165
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,520
At the same time you pompously disconnect the artifacture that we have set up here

166
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,620
We spend so many hours arranging all this stuff

167
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,460
Some of it goes back to the

168
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:19,060
Do you have any scotch tape or boogers I could use to hold that little wire in that little slot?

169
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,860
I need to keep the pole in the hole

170
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,340
I have some prehensile anal mucus

171
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,580
Which I was using for my surgery

172
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
I was teaching a monkey how to do tricks with

173
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,420
I was teaching a monkey how to

174
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,400
Well, you know, I wasn't really

175
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,300
Okay, no, I don't have any mucus or any rubber bands

176
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,260
But here is a rubber band right in front of you

177
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,540
Here's a rubber band

178
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,580
Will that do anything?

179
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,900
Oh, the broken rubber band

180
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,620
Yeah, that's the subgenius style

181
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,680
This looks like one of the new eye wrappings that we use

182
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,320
To try and keep us

183
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,560
Keep our thoughts inward

184
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,280
And our mobility down

185
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,500
And keep us smoking

186
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:54,860
Free

187
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,420
That is, for smoking

188
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,820
These things work like a charm

189
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,940
And we're not talking about magic

190
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,020
We're talking about actual charming things

191
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,880
Nothing more charming than a diseased rubber band

192
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,620
Around one of your organs

193
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,940
Awaiting the last moment

194
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,800
Oh, boy

195
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,120
So, why were they spurting your name so badly?

196
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,320
Why did they spew so much hate on you?

197
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,680
On me?

198
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,160
Yeah, Sting, Sting

199
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,020
Let's kill Sting

200
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,580
Let's kill Sting

201
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,280
Let's kill him with a shoe

202
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,440
They, uh

203
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,020
Oh, that was by

204
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,260
The Lone Star Tall Boys

205
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,420
Dave

206
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,320
Beer and Texas

207
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,640
That just suddenly appeared in my email

208
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,840
The Lone Star Tall Boys

209
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,680
A song called Small Black Tape

210
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
The usual Fernanda Nandi

211
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,700
Lee Murr

212
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,500
Collages were there all through the beginning

213
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,220
Except for the intro

214
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,820
Was a mashup by Phineas Narco

215
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,520
Of now

216
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,200
National Cynical.com

217
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,300
Now, are his sinuses still intact?

218
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,500
I heard after the pre-functory agreement

219
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,820
That he had most of his sinuses removed

220
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,580
Well, he underwent an official subgenius third nostril opening

221
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:08,960
Right

222
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,180
And I think they had a mistake

223
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,180
A power failure in the middle of the operation or something

224
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,940
Right in the middle, boy

225
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,180
That happens

226
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,740
Praise Bob, you know what I'm saying?

227
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,680
That's the way it always

228
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,620
It has a similar effect on the brain as that coffee

229
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,360
That we drink

230
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,780
Just bought from the machine downstairs

231
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,520
Now, have you considered this?

232
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,500
Since we buy coffee from this same machine

233
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,400
Every time we do the show

234
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,200
Have you considered that perhaps

235
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,340
That machine isn't merely a machine?

236
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,780
What, you mean it's watching us or something?

237
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,780
It could be watching us

238
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,900
An artificial intelligence

239
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,000
Who cares?

240
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,680
They're watching us all the time

241
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,340
I'm saying it's a coffee dispensing camera

242
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,360
In fact, where is the camera in this room, I wonder?

243
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,440
Jerry, what?

244
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,340
Nuts last night

245
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
What's his name?

246
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
The guy that does the poker show?

247
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,480


248
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,240
Yeah, the guy that does the poker variety show

249
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,260
Trying to find the camera

250
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,940
He freaked out right in the middle of

251
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,320
Who Stole My Kishka?

252
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,700
And started attacking the walls

253
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,740
And pulling things apart

254
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,900
And just like in that old movie

255
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,400
The conversation

256
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,040
He finally found it

257
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,520
It was right where he left it

258
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,100
Right in front of him

259
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,920
I was reading this sci-fi novel

260
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,740
On the toilet the other day

261
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,880
It's one of those toilet sci-fi novels

262
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,400
I know

263
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,280
That your friends write

264
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,220
Most of them are

265
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,600
And in this one

266
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
It turned out

267
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,420
When you got

268
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,140
Towards the end

269
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,800
It turned out

270
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,560
That the conspiracy

271
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,940
Had been embedding

272
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,460
Mind control signals

273
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,080
In the television and internet

274
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,000
Everything you saw on your monitor

275
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,420
Was just a carrier signal

276
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,360
For something that was subliminal

277
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,920
And in fact, in this novel

278
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,520
People even got high

279
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,540
Off of certain subliminal light beams

280
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,300
And stuff

281
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,320
Well, I think it's highly likely

282
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,560
And possible in the future

283
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,720
If you could scramble

284
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,100
A few Codicies

285
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,460
You know, a different

286
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,900
Supposedly

287
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,120
It would work

288
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
I mean, it's not like

289
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,300
It's unresearched

290
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,140
Or even named like weird

291
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,420
Well, see, quarks have weirdness

292
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,160
And stuff, you know

293
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,300
It's not like some idiot

294
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,880
Just decided to come up

295
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,180
With some names and stuff

296
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,740
No, this is one of those

297
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,480
Sci-fi novels

298
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,900
That probably will find out

299
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,800
It was all true

300
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,760
Unfortunately

301
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
Sort of like

302
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,440
A clockwork orange

303
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,940
Which turned out to be

304
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,140
A whole lot more accurate

305
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,940
Than Stanley Kubrick's

306
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,200
Previous movie, 2001

307
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,260
It was

308
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,400
And we did a lot of work

309
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,500
We did a thing in 1999

310
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,340
Spoofing in it

311
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,880
It was 1999, I think

312
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,220
Wasn't that the year

313
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,140
Of clockwork orange?

314
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:31,780
No

315
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,340
Oh, I don't know

316
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,460
I don't know when that was set

317
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,400
Oh, no, not 99

318
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,460
It was written in the 80s, I think

319
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,080
But there were like

320
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,760
Wilding UK's

321
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,660
No, no, it was written in the 60s

322
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:40,780
Yeah

323
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,800
Late 60s

324
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,620
Because I saw that

325
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,600
As a teenager

326
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,020
It made me want to dress up

327
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,680
In funny outfits

328
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,300
And go out beating up old people

329
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,620
Me too

330
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,980
And go, man, it's going to be

331
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,460
Really weird in the 1990s

332
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:50,920
And it was

333
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,440
Yeah

334
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,740
And now I'm

335
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,380
Instead of

336
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,000
Instead of being like

337
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,120
The cool droogs

338
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,060
That beat up the old people

339
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm like the old guy

340
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,500
Laying on the pavement

341
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,480
Going blurp, blurp, blurp

342
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,960
In the songs of his father

343
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,180
So

344
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,480
It's a no place

345
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,320
For an old man any longer

346
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,660
A no place for an old man

347
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,940
Speaking of tough guys

348
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,040
That beat you up

349
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,260
But you have to pay, too

350
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,080
I don't like that part

351
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,340
And the suicide booze

352
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,960
That they had in that show

353
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Futurama

354
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,180
Where, you know

355
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,680
It's like a coin-operated suicide

356
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Ha, ha, real funny

357
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,740
We laugh now

358
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,060
We laugh now

359
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,080
Because we do not have

360
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,840
Correct change

361
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,240
Well, you know

362
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,260
I had heard about

363
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,360
About a hundred years ago

364
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,900
I used to hear these hip-hop songs

365
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,480
That DJ A would play

366
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,800
As we'd be driving home

367
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,920
From the other show

368
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,960
And you thought they were

369
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,760
Always talking about your fests

370
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,700
Yeah, because they'd be

371
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,780
Talking about Stang

372
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,380
They were talking about Stang

373
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,540
There was one song about

374
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,260
We gotta do a Stang

375
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,420
And I thought

376
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,160
They're definitely saying my name

377
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,800
I remember that

378
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,820
I asked DJ A

379
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,080
I said, sir

380
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,980
Perhaps you are familiar

381
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,720
With the linguistic peculiarities

382
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,500
Of the quality

383
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,540
Perhaps you could inform me

384
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,040
What the meaning of this slang term

385
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,700
Stang

386
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,260
And he said, oh

387
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,540
That means the sacred scribe

388
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,660
Of the Church of the Subgenius

389
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,120
And it also means

390
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,920
A very manly man

391
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,460
Well, uh

392
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,260
A man who excites the passions

393
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,980
Of every woman he encounters

394
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,800
Or disagrees with

395
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,580
Depending on his pigeon-like mood

396
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,780
That's right

397
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,020
Now, that's a Stanga

398
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,280
See, I looked up

399
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,260
In the UrbanDictionary.com

400
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
And it turned out

401
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,580
That Stang had a number of meanings

402
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,420
Yes, you are

403
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,360
New meanings

404
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
You are now the Martin Luther

405
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,820
Of the Church of the Infid...

406
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,060
You are ensconced

407
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,080
As some sort of a hero

408
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,040
Of something

409
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,900
Well, I'm not a hero

410
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,440
Well, I don't know about that, Dave

411
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,220
Because here it says

412
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,580
Stang means robbery

413
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,640
As in

414
00:12:59,580 --> 00:12:59,720
That

415
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,160
Biatch

416
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,280
Ridin' clean

417
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
On them

418
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,180
Spools

419
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,000
Look like we

420
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,500
Gon' have to make

421
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,560
A stang

422
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,240
That's the example

423
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,380
That they use here

424
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,160
Well, Stang is

425
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,220
So that's like a robbery

426
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,900
My name is synonymous with robbery

427
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,200
Stangbanger

428
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,680
Is a term used to describe

429
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,260
Any

430
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,240
Collar-popping pothead

431
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,810
Who meanders the corridors

432
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,790
At Bishop Stang High School

433
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,410
Well, that would describe you perfectly

434
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,550
Popping your collar

435
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,610
Or a frop of Zulia

436
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:32,890
That our

437
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,710
Collar's popping

438
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,870
I don't get that

439
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,070
Well, as you know

440
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,690
What's a collar?

441
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,810
A priestly sort of thing, perhaps

442
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,250
A religious sort of thing

443
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,950
Popping your collar

444
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,470
Oh, yeah, yeah

445
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,010
That's true

446
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,430
Well, okay

447
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,650
And fropping your mollusk

448
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,290
And then

449
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,190
Are you with the mollusk

450
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,350
At the end of the hallway?

451
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,710
My high school used to have

452
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,690
Play football games

453
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,930
Against Bishop Lynch High School

454
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,390
Not high school

455
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:53,390


456
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:53,390


457
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,230
Not Bishop Stang

458
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,270
So we'd call it a lynchbanger

459
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,150
Mm-hmm

460
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,030
Stang style is to unmercifully go off on someone or something

461
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,970
Or, secondary meaning, to screw up big time

462
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,370
And there's no sexual meaning to Stang style

463
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,470
Just those two

464
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,610
We'll get to that

465
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,850
It says, oh man, I messed that up Stang style

466
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,350
Mm-hmm, I can understand that

467
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,310
Or, girl, you know that man will make me go off Stang style

468
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,590
So that's like screaming and yelling and tearing your hair

469
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,390
Well, there you go

470
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,170
I guess my reputation precedes me

471
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:25,310
Yeah

472
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,570
A stanga is a word describing a man's

473
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,030
I'm glad they mentioned it as a word

474
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,930
Describing a man's ability to pull the ladies with ease

475
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,730
It is indescribable

476
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,070
The male can be an average joe

477
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,050
But he is just unnatural to pull any lady he wants

478
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,430
Any time he wants without fail

479
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,250
Well, there's the luck playing for you

480
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,370
And there's slack

481
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,090
And that's what Bob promised you

482
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,010
So, you see

483
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,570
So if you make up your own fake name

484
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,170
And make it something like Stang

485
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,990
That later on takes on slang meanings

486
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,350
And they'll markedly parallel the actual Stanguage

487
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,070
That you have evolved in your own

488
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,510
You know what I'm saying?

489
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,210
It's like an observer created reality

490
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,670
Note you're saying

491
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,890
You have created

492
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,350
Note you're saying

493
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,190
An observer created reality

494
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,450
And now you live in this world

495
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,570
Where people walk around talking Stang talk

496
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,670
You see what I'm saying?

497
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,210
Only on hip hop records, though

498
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,990
Oh, but no, this is ever-changing

499
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,230
You're everywhere

500
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,030
Don't you remember the letters you've been getting?

501
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,370
The emails you've been getting from Germany lately?

502
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,810
And the amazing Hollanders that send you all these things about the Stangers

503
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,730
I did get a letter from a guy named Andy Stang

504
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,810
Who said, why would you

505
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,750
Why would anybody choose that name?

506
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,710
Because it's my church name

507
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,730
I chose it, you know

508
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,330
I was born Stankovich

509
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,290
Because you could actually see into the distant future

510
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,670
And see your name become an actual form of cultural

511
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,870
Stanged up

512
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,190
Stanged up means messed up or jacked up

513
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,810
There you go

514
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,490
Or cuffed up

515
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,470
That girl is not cool at all

516
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,530
She is straight stanged up

517
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,650
Stangblasted means to cuss out, demean, put down, put in one's place

518
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,530
See, there isn't a meaning on this whole list

519
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,390
It doesn't in some way befit your personality

520
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,430
I know, here's a note

521
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,010
Here's Stang with two Gs

522
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,830
Stanged up

523
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,650
As Melinda Smith would say

524
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,350
It's Stanga

525
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,530
A 13 year old dumbass who acts like he is in college

526
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,270
Two, a rabid fanboy

527
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,190
And three, verb

528
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,430
To Stang

529
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:38,550
To have a strong desire or urge to rape Tom Brady

530
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,930
I don't know

531
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,230
Who's Tom Brady?

532
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:41,890
I don't know

533
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,850
To Stangle

534
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,490
Maybe you'll meet him in the future

535
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,510
And rape him vigorously

536
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,750
Or at least, you know, however he prefers

537
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,550
And you can write about that

538
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,370
Or think about it

539
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,350
Stangle is a sexual technique

540
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,710
Where you are doing your lady friend

541
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,590
And they sneak up on you

542
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,670
And tickles your dangly bells, let's say

543
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,010
Okay

544
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,550
Thus, Stangled

545
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,810
Okay, now once you've been Stangled

546
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,950
Or you are Stangling

547
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,950
Does the lady have to be your friend?

548
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,570
Not if she is herself a Stangle

549
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,210
In a noun case

550
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,930
A Stangle is a girl similar to a skank

551
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,770
She might stank

552
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,470
Maybe wasn't loved enough as a child

553
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,450
So she looks for love in all the wrong places

554
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,270
Troublemaker

555
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,090
Not someone you want to be seen talking to

556
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,070
Uber slutty

557
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,830
Well, not talking to

558
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,670
Tries too hard

559
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,590
Not very pretty

560
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,810
Future stripper

561
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,890
I think these are made by

562
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,850
I think these are written by the users

563
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,550
Some of them are just

564
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,190
They're derogatory towards animals

565
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,530
And towards

566
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,870
And to Stangdoodles

567
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,730
And Bobliogra...

568
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,350
Which a Stangdoodle is a strange tumor grown in unicorns

569
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,610
Which can later be removed and used as ice cubes that never melt

570
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,830
I bet it was said by a subgenius

571
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,710
Because you can only remove them with your teeth

572
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,390
With your teeth

573
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,830
But Stang was not always

574
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,770
I mean it was

575
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,530
It had different meanings in ancient England

576
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,070
English slang

577
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,450
For instance back in the 17 and 1800s

578
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,250
How did our forebears deal with rogues in yesteryear?

579
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,450
There was one method very common in Leith and Ristelrig

580
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,510
Which in many histories is missed out for some reason or another

581
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,450
This was called riding the Stang

582
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,210
The obnoxious person was forcibly placed astride of a rough sapling

583
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,450
And thus being elevated on the shoulders of a couple of large individuals

584
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,690
The popularly convicted was mercilessly jolted over a prescribed distance

585
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,670
And any attempt to get off was prevented by the crowd

586
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,810
Now I still don't understand what happens to the guy though

587
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,530
As he's being uh...stangled?

588
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,770
Is this another use of stangled or stangered?

589
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,670
Ah man all I know is this uh...headphone jack is completely stangled

590
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,990
Well we're gonna have to uh...

591
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,530
It's stanged up

592
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,410
Get new calcium with more calcium than any other calcium

593
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:19,510
Get new calcium with more calcium than any other calcium

594
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,510


595
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,170
And now there's calcium

596
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,630
And now there's calcium

597
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,270
And now there's calcium

598
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,850
And now there's calcium

599
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,470
Yes calcium contains one third of your daily calcium needs instantly

600
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,170
Ugh

601
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,850
Oh no

602
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,290
It's not even staying in there it may be better or something

603
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,310
Is that the one that was...

604
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,190
It keeps falling out it's just...

605
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,230
It just keeps falling out

606
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,490
Have you ever had that problem man?

607
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,510
Man that's the first time you've referred to me like that

608
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,170
You've referred to me as one of our familiar brothers

609
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,410
You always uh...call me It or YouBags

610
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,150
Which is a very convenient name now YouBags

611
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,810
YouBags

612
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,870
One who uses the YouTube inordinately and incorrectly

613
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,050
A YouBag

614
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,970
Let's see where was my uh...

615
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,330
I don't know I...I'm...

616
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,290
Okay if I were to actually be able to hear now I can hear things again

617
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:22,610
For all I know when I pushed that button earlier it was playing and I just...

618
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,050
You know it's coming out

619
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,930
And now I found a jack would you like to try to use it?

620
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,330
Uh you found now that...

621
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,850
No no no no no don't use I used that jack before I jacked in

622
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,310
Yeah I jack in friends I'll admit it

623
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:43,030
We're thinking about having a public confession booth at X Day

624
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,750
But you have to have correct change

625
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,770
We've done that before

626
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,130
Nikki Deathchick used to run the uh...

627
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,650
She would uh...dressed as a hot nun

628
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,470
Hot nun

629
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,190
Hot nun

630
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,910
She would uh...encourage people to come up and confess their sins

631
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,970
And then she would spank them

632
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,790
Oh sister

633
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,270
Which they mightily enjoyed some time before

634
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,430
Oh sister I've been bad

635
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:06,790
Uh...

636
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,470
I've been a lot worse than bad lately

637
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,990
Just trying to get through everything you were talking about earlier

638
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,550
I don't understand why there's so much hostility towards you

639
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,750
You've tried to enlighten me

640
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,030
You've tried to enlighten people

641
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,870
You've tried to bring them the truth if not the truth of the issue

642
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,990
Well I stank them man

643
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,570
What can I say?

644
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,350
That's what we do

645
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,270
Well what about you be stankin?

646
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,030
Is that wrong?

647
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,870
No that's stinking

648
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,670
That's like a...that's different

649
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,330
You be stanky you be skanky

650
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,350
No

651
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,250
Susie the floozy

652
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,090
Used to be choosy but now she'll use it

653
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,330
Said that the word stanky would refer to a kind of a smell that was

654
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,630
A bit...a kind of a...

655
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,210
Bitter and irritating but not exactly bad

656
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,470
Just...

657
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,330
Stanky

658
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,170
An inconvenient smell an inconvenient odor

659
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,150
Well something that really stuck out poked out at you

660
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,630
Well that's more than inconvenient

661
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,650
If it pokes out of its pants

662
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,010
What else?

663
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,210
Friends there is some news

664
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,210
If you ever look at the internets

665
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,310
On subgenius.com

666
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,410
I'm not selling anything this time by the way

667
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,290
I'm giving some...giving away the artwork

668
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,610
That has been done over the last year by the...

669
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,170
Great subgenius artists

670
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,290
If you look at subgenius.com

671
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,970
There's a new art mine

672
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,710
Art mine tunnel number 23 has started being excavated

673
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,030
And it's got about a thousand new ugly and pretty pictures

674
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,350
But miles and miles of earth removed to get those things up on the wall down there

675
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,870
Yeah I had to drain alt.binaries.slack

676
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,810
The news group of all of its art

677
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,610
And I had to drain an abscess

678
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,190
Yeah

679
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,250
To get some of it back on

680
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,930
That's how what we use to glue the artwork onto the internet

681
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,570
That's the stuff

682
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,170
Is we use the pus from the abscess caused by the bad art

683
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,310
To glue the art onto the screen

684
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,170
The other side not the side that you're on

685
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,410
Looking at obviously

686
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,230
Well and not

687
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,570
That would be impossible

688
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,570
Well and not you've heard of what

689
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,030
But the other side of the screen

690
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,890
Organic reconnections

691
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,370
That's where they're going

692
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,370
So it's all confusing because we're getting ready for X day

693
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,510
The world is going to end

694
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,750
And you know it's funny you always run around trying to clean house

695
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,830
Just before the world is going to end

696
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,170
It's odd the way that works

697
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,810
And you try and pack and you keep on going through your clothes over and over again

698
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,610
You know there's never going to be enough underwear to escape this place completely and finally

699
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,390
I mean you're going to be passing out for Centauri and stuff

700
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,290
And you're going to be looking for a pair of fresh shorts

701
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,510
Briefs

702
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,530
I'm going to be sleeping probably when X

703
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,870
That's my prediction

704
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,350
When I get ruptured

705
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,590
When I get ruptured up as Bob says we all will

706
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,810
All those of us who are subgenius ministers

707
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,970
On X day this July 5th

708
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,050
When I'm ruptured up probably what I'm going to do is go to bed

709
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,990
Well that's what you asked for

710
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,930
You wanted to be sound asleep as you were ruptured

711
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,330
No I want to be awake

712
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,310
Because if you're dreaming about something at the moment of rupture

713
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,390
You'll be locked into a real version of that dream

714
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,150
Yeah

715
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:12,290
So if you're dreaming you're appearing in your elementary school with no pants on

716
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,110
And everybody's laughing at you

717
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,090
That's going to be it for a while

718
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,130
That's going to be your reality

719
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,010
That was my reality 15 minutes after the first X day

720
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,450
Yeah

721
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:28,070
7-15 July 5th 1998 I was pantsed and being laughed at by 300 people

722
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,710
That should have told you something right there

723
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,030
That the members of the hierarchy are not exactly square

724
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:40,270
Well we're not exactly immune to comeuppance from the angry believers

725
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,270
We need more pseudo-religions

726
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,550
We need more comfortable lodgings with lots of comfortable things like saunas and naked Swedish ladies

727
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,350
We have those at Brushwood

728
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,050
Yeah but they're so primitive

729
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,550
I mean it's like well you're imagining

730
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,570
There's the little rascals style sauna

731
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,110
Right right

732
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,910
The little rascals style hot tub

733
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,350
Where sauna the S is backwards you know

734
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,670
Right

735
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,190
But it's

736
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,150
No girls allowed

737
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,590
Yeah

738
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,530
The girl haters club

739
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,190
There was a little rascals where they formed the girl haters club

740
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,750
Oh boy

741
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:16,110
But then Darla came along and suddenly Alfalfa was singing a whole different tune

742
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,290
And so was Spanky and everyone else they were all singing a different tune

743
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,070
They were singing this song

744
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,450
What is this song?

745
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,810
I don't know but a minute ago it was like a really awful version of Smells Like Teen Spirit

746
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,230
From some

747
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,810
I don't know what this is

748
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,750
I think it's music from Radio Cuba perhaps

749
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,010
Yeah that wasn't what I wanted to play

750
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,110
No they're filtering our funnels

751
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:49,010
Boys it's too late Reverend Nikki Death Chick is married

752
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,890
Too bad

753
00:25:49,890 --> 00:26:00,070
Last weekend I performed the holy rites of matrimony and married Reverend Nikki Death Chick to Reverend Bob Wilde

754
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,330
That's his real name so she's Reverend Nikki Death Chick Wilde now

755
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,710
And soon she'll be Dr. Wilde because she's studying for her degree in

756
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,830
Torture or something

757
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,170
Yeah but she'll have to grow weird beaver teeth when she becomes Dr. Wilde

758
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,130
To ensure more fright in the smell of children

759
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:27,150
Oh she can't wait until some kid comes up to her wearing a bob button and being a wise ass

760
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,430
And trying to somehow impress her with his knowledge of the obscure cult

761
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,970
Yeah

762
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,890
When she gets to reveal her real secret identity

763
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,690
If I were one of those prepubescent students I'd probably just say

764
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,690
I'll just go put my head on her teacher chair and wait for her to come and sit down

765
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,730
And they go da da you know

766
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,270
Hey when we went to Dubuque Iowa to

767
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,790
Funny name for a town

768
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,970
Yeah what was it Princess Wee was going to write a song called

769
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,370
Don't Rebuke Dubuque

770
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,590
Beware the Maui Waui in Iowa

771
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,450
Something like that

772
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,270
But Dubuque is very historic

773
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:09,670
There are giant catfish there on the Mississippi River that have human feathers

774
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,070
And they have a big human festival

775
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,830
Where they all serve

776
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,730
They catch humans and have a big human festival

777
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,110
I missed that we didn't get served

778
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,270
There's nothing like deep fried human with a hush puppy and a bag of snot on the side

779
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,170
Lemonade fresh lemonade it's just like hand squoze

780
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,810
They don't say hand squeeze down there they say hand squoze

781
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:33,710
I don't know if that has to do with squeezing the actual hand or the lemons involved

782
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,190
But it sure is tasty

783
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,670
Well soon the Iowans and people from other states will be coming to Dubuque Iowa

784
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:39,670


785
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,030
And they will be converging in Sherman New York

786
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,450
Climber

787
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,150
At Brushwood

788
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,230
Sherman not Climber

789
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:51,150
For the annual subgenius migration to the western New York breeding grounds

790
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,070
That's another thing we're calling X Day now

791
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,130
I realize it is it's an annual migration

792
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:01,270
It is like the fennels or whatever they call them the fennukes that go over the cliffs and stuff

793
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,910
Following each other and having sex before and after

794
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,110
Yeah the really really horny ones

795
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,150
The lemmings

796
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,290
Will make the trip

797
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:13,990
You know the lemmings did not really commit suicide by running off cliffs

798
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,170
That was an idea come up with by a bunch of Disney camera men

799
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,990
Who would throw the lemmings off the cliff to add drama

800
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,370
You know to an otherwise boring documentary about these silly little rodents

801
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,690
It's a good year so we hired plenty of little gaffers to chase them

802
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,590
We didn't have to move

803
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,690
We would sit in our director chair and say lemmings hush begin

804
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,710
And they would all look like they were running over

805
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,970
And that's terrible to think about

806
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,410
I'll stop

807
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:49,050
Well we're getting ready for the great convention and migration

808
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,230
In fact I've already got a copy here of the welcome to X Day schedule

809
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,470
And the liability waiver

810
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,350
Check this out

811
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,990
Here's the liability

812
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:04,130
I the undersigned do hereby certify that I must be completely insane to walk into this place

813
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,430
Where I might witness or be induced to perform terrible acts

814
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,210
Which acts will probably be filmed and streamed to the internet

815
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:18,750
And I likewise recognize that I would be much safer staying outside the 10X Day gates

816
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,530
Signed your name here buddy

817
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,390
And that about says everything

818
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,310
But sister

819
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,570
Now is there a special disclaimer

820
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,790
But but but

821
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,990
Is there a special disclaimer for injuries incurred on the place with you know with the wilding you

822
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,870
That was it

823
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,230
There is they have to sign away their right to sue us

824
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:39,950
Even even a

825
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,490
And we get filmed

826
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,750
A shrapnel doesn't get you a lawsuit

827
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,890
Getting injured

828
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,370
Yeah

829
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,230
Uh now there is a warning on here

830
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:55,150
Warning all employees of the US government must prevent present identification to registrar before entering these grounds

831
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:00,490
All electronic recording devices and weapons must be presented for in-sphinction

832
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,110
In-sphinction

833
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,710
Oh in-sphinction

834
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,350
Prior to entry

835
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,110
Right

836
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:12,430
US code title 303 section 91998 jy5 dhs regulation 13013x

837
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,130
Well at least you've got the slashes down right

838
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,510
Because they will not do as it says

839
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:18,890
Unless you've got a

840
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,150
And you know uh Lonesome Cowboy Dave

841
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,410
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Detardos is not on the schedule

842
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,690
Well you thought I was just not going to I told you a million times I was

843
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,110
The amino acids will be placed

844
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,250
And the

845
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,430
Equal health

846
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:50,830
Including screening

847
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:50,830


848
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,150
During bad film

849
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,770
Danger and dirt

850
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,990
Well, no, they're terrible.

851
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,270
They're really, really bad.

852
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,570
That's what I like about them.

853
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,270
Why did you not put my name on there,

854
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,390
at least saying I was going to stop by for a fritter

855
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,510
and a couple bags of snacks?

856
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,610
That's a good question.

857
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,430
I knew that I had screwed.

858
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,530
And there's a band listed which isn't going to play.

859
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,230
However, the band Mike Bison will play.

860
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,190
And Two Beans will have his disco.

861
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,770
You can't call it a rave because raves are illegal.

862
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:28,970
It's illegal.

863
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,510
Raves are drugs.

864
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,310
But this is a disco.

865
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,430
Discos aren't drugs.

866
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,310
So a process is now a drug?

867
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,170
Yeah, if it has...

868
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,050
There's a law in New York, apparently,

869
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,090
that if you put drugs in your hair,

870
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,450
that you will be able to fly.

871
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,230
Those little neon sticks, those are drugs now.

872
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,350
Anything related to a place where drugs are often used,

873
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,770
like raves, that's all illegal now.

874
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,750
And also, thinking about drugs,

875
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,350
is illegal.

876
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,810
Yeah, that's why you call it a disco instead of a rave

877
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,110
because everybody knows, you know,

878
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,930
people in discos don't do drugs.

879
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,690
It's only raves.

880
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,070
You can't retroactively think about drugs either.

881
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,710
And alcohol's not a drug.

882
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,410
That's another important thing to remember.

883
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,050
It's merely a substance you rub on your body

884
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,870
when you need a shot or a spanking.

885
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,510
Just keep that in mind.

886
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,890
Why do you keep thinking about spankings, Dave?

887
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,330
Nikki.

888
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,350
Uh-huh.

889
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,070
You were thinking about Nikki spanking your butt.

890
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,690
Well, you were talking about her.

891
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,550
Well, I was thinking about spanking her,

892
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,230
but, you know, I...

893
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,350
I wouldn't mind being spanked in it.

894
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,510
Actually, I've seen Nikki did get tied up

895
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,670
and spanked at one of those X-Days herself.

896
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,610
I think.

897
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,230
You think?

898
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:39,810
Yeah.

899
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,930
You can't remember anything about it.

900
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,650
I know, that's why.

901
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,350
You're right.

902
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,730
You're absolutely right.

903
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,510
But, you know, as Mark Twain said,

904
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,610
if you never lie,

905
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,670
you don't have to think about anything.

906
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,690
Um, I don't understand how that...

907
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,170
Well, really, if you will, think about it.

908
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,110
If you don't lie...

909
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,590
Since you're lying,

910
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,210
you're going to have to think about it.

911
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,810
Right, you'll have to go back and...

912
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:00,730
See...

913
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,070
That's true.

914
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,410
I subscribe to that,

915
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,910
and I haven't paid for it.

916
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,070
But I believe in that.

917
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,950
What a tangled web we weave

918
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,130
when first we practice to deceive.

919
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,670
When you go out and try to stang somebody,

920
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,670
or pull a stang,

921
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,830
you know, then you have to remember

922
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,550
your alibi, your excuse.

923
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,910
You have to think about a lot of stuff.

924
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,150
And you have to think about your stangs.

925
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,670
You've got to think about who you lied,

926
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,090
which told which lie to.

927
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,390
I've got that problem.

928
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,390
So I...

929
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,250
And who are you stanging on?

930
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,050
I used to have that problem.

931
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:28,210
I used to have that problem.

932
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,350
But now, I...

933
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,650
My curse is that I can only tell

934
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,550
the absolute truth all the time.

935
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,290
I'm the opposite of Bob.

936
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,630
Bob always lies,

937
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,090
but he's always right.

938
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,170
Yeah.

939
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,170
No, no, you've said that before,

940
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,650
and I still draw a big blank

941
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,290
when you say that,

942
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,970
because it's like the two sisters.

943
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,650
One sister always tells the truth,

944
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,890
and the other sister always lies, you know?

945
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,590
So you come to the fork in the road,

946
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,830
and which sister...

947
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,290
You know, it could be a very perilous journey,

948
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,870
so you have to ask the right sister,

949
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,090
which is the way to...

950
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,270
Um, Dobstown?

951
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,690
And so you see,

952
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,030
which is the way to Dobstown.

953
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,810
So what you're supposed to ask is,

954
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,990
you're supposed to say,

955
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,810
any one of them, you say,

956
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,150
what would your sister say

957
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,330
is the quickest road to Dobstown?

958
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,030
You know what I mean?

959
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,050
Wow.

960
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,630
And then she will tell you

961
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,870
what her sister would say,

962
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,630
and if her sister is the liar,

963
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,490
she'd tell you what the liar would do.

964
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,110
If her...

965
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,790
If she's the, uh,

966
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,590
truth teller,

967
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,090
she'll tell the...

968
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,830
You know what I'm saying?

969
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:29,910
You go the opposite way.

970
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,270
You've heard the story, haven't you?

971
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,370
I wish that our listeners could hear

972
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,510
what I was hearing on my headphones just then,

973
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,230
as the little...

974
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,330
the wire was jiggling back and forth,

975
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,530
and it was cutting in and out.

976
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,650
There's an expensive plug-in

977
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,810
on my computer audio system

978
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,550
that I could use to mimic

979
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,570
the terrible way that I've been hearing this show,

980
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,590
parts of this terrible show.

981
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,870
And you just mute it right now?

982
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,630
Yeah.

983
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:56,990
Oh.

984
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:57,170
Okay.

985
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,330
That's just what we did just then.

986
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,370
Now, see, I'm gonna have to go back

987
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,410
and have the effect now.

988
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,090
Forget about that now.

989
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,710
Ay-yi-yi.

990
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,850
Yeah, this, um,

991
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,390
our X-Day schedule and brochure

992
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,970
is a four-page booklet.

993
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,370
It has the nearest liquor store directions on it,

994
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,350
which is really important.

995
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,070
It's in Jamestown.

996
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,250
Not Jamestown, Virginia.

997
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:22,970
Remember that.

998
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,670
It's in Jamestown, New York,

999
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,070
on the western tier

1000
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,070
of...

1001
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:27,890
of, uh, New York,

1002
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,990
near the shores of

1003
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,890
Great Faken Quaken Lake Erie,

1004
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,810
where you can get your fish

1005
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,570
every day from 6 to 12.

1006
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,630
There's also silence races

1007
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,330
carried on in the background

1008
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,190
by the bemused members of the church.

1009
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,290
Some of them are too fat to roll down the hill,

1010
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,490
but we prod them with sticks.

1011
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,190
There's also, besides the confessional booth,

1012
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,490
attended to by Spanky,

1013
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,530
the sister Nikki Spanky.

1014
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,970
I've read the saddest thing,

1015
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,650
and that newspaper, The Onion,

1016
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,950
it said that something like 59% of Americans

1017
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,370
are now too obese to commit suicide.

1018
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,510
They're so fat, they can't kill themselves.

1019
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,290
The Onion never lies, does it?

1020
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,770
It made me cry.

1021
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,890
Well, are you sure it wasn't

1022
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,850
the sliced onion making you cry?

1023
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,090
Now, here's an Amsterdam...

1024
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,130
This is a Dutch review of X-Day

1025
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,730
that we found in an Amsterdam guidebook.

1026
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,270
The X-Day house party

1027
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,930
and freak show parade

1028
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,910
is something even the back-to-gabbers do.

1029
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,490
With a pumped-up number of beats per minute,

1030
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,490
10 pills down your gob

1031
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,890
for 20 hours of chomping your bit.

1032
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,250
No ambience,

1033
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,710
save for a couple of yellow cube lights,

1034
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,110
haven't been able to kill.

1035
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,650
I said this is from a Dutch translation.

1036
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,510
Also, consider the fact

1037
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,850
that bouncing around on bad frop,

1038
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,010
probably pills, if nothing worse,

1039
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,250
or bad shit,

1040
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,510
church air, probably frop, if nothing worse,

1041
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,730
is considered a definite no-no,

1042
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,210
never mind what you heard.

1043
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,210
And then, is it really your idea of fun

1044
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,070
to stand around some crossroads

1045
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,170
with no clue as to your whereabouts,

1046
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,270
with a brushwood map in hand

1047
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,770
which has snakes for roads crawling about

1048
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,550
because you're hallucinating like an oil slide?

1049
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,850
Well then, simply get to know a few people first,

1050
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,430
which is not such a hard thing to do at an X-Day,

1051
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,810
and all kinds of possibilities will, if need be,

1052
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,770
arise by their own accord.

1053
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,530
Wow, what a way of looking at it

1054
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,450
through those psychedelic...

1055
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,610
I'd like to comment more,

1056
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,550
but since I guess I'm not going to be there...

1057
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,750
Dave, it does say...

1058
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,510
The postcard says you're going to be there.

1059
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,030
Oh, sure.

1060
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,310
The postcard says you...

1061
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,990
So you know you're going to be there if the post...

1062
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,570
I've mailed out 4,000 of those.

1063
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,830
I'd rather be in a brochure because they're fatter.

1064
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,630
I like big, fat, juicy brochures

1065
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,450
maybe with three or four pages in them.

1066
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,150
You know, a postcard.

1067
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,770
I want maybe three or four pages devoted entirely to me.

1068
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,890
Me, just for no reason other than I want to see it.

1069
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,030
Well, once again, your tickler is stanging.

1070
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,450
Yeah, everything is all stangy around...

1071
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,130
Smells all stangy around here.

1072
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,270
And your bells are burning.

1073
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,410
Let's talk about hell and what they're not going to miss.

1074
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,230
Think of it this way.

1075
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:24,510
The first hour, the first hour they come into that Brushwood camp...

1076
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,030
Brushwood, did you say?

1077
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:26,850
I said, Brushwood.

1078
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,130
They should call it Breastwood.

1079
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:28,770
Breastwood?

1080
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,290
No, no.

1081
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,990
Once again, your vortex is spouting you off.

1082
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,910
It's not Breastwood.

1083
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,610
It's Borstwood.

1084
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,730
It's Breastwood.

1085
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,350
Flushwood.

1086
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:35,910
Flushwood.

1087
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:41,910
And the minute you arrive there, there are all kinds of beautiful, sexy aromas invade your head.

1088
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,930
And they plant flags and they put up their own schools.

1089
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,290
And you start firing other parts of your brain that don't belong.

1090
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,190
And the next thing you know, they own your head.

1091
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,470
But it's beautiful.

1092
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,250
It's just so beautiful.

1093
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,890
And you look out over the horizon there.

1094
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:55,870
And there's like...

1095
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,590
Saucers like mirrored against the backdrop.

1096
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,950
It's as if they were already here, but they're just on their way and you can see it that way.

1097
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,750
And there's so many little kiosks and booths with so many strange things.

1098
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,470
And I mean, it's like the evil doctor Lou...

1099
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,730
Something, you know, you just walk up to one of these booths and you can have anything in your mind.

1100
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,410
If you had one to have one with.

1101
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,650
You can order something, perhaps herbs.

1102
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,310
My mind is not my mind.

1103
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,210
Uh...

1104
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,070
Cloth things.

1105
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:25,850
Yeah.

1106
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,230
You could wear on your ears and eyes.

1107
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,530
But that's not the exciting part.

1108
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:28,990
No, no, no.

1109
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,470
Of course not.

1110
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,430
That's not the exciting part.

1111
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:38,830
The exciting part is when they start shooting the children up with various chemicals which we use to make things easier.

1112
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,010
Of course, you know a lot more about it than I do.

1113
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,890
I'm not even sure.

1114
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:47,870
I was just trying to describe what few things I can, you know, try and titillate people into.

1115
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:53,650
Well, we can't titillate them into going to ag state because I stand to make money off of that.

1116
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,190
See?

1117
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,570
Yeah.

1118
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,010
And this is a non-profit broadcast.

1119
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,590
Oh!

1120
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,430
I hurt myself.

1121
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,550
Although if it makes anybody feel any better, usually we just barely break even.

1122
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:11,090
It is a great party though and the lobotomies...

1123
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,530
They cause.

1124
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,530
Well, they heal up real fast by the time...

1125
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:21,530
I mean, people at work might notice a scar for about a week afterwards.

1126
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:21,910
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1127
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,170
And you can always just say, oh, well, I bumped my head.

1128
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:29,610
Or I was at an amateur trepanning party or something like that.

1129
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,370
They sting.

1130
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,570
You don't have to let on that you're in a cult.

1131
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:42,570
You always omit the fact that people have the errant one eyeball pointed left and one pointed right stare after weeks, weeks, weeks after lobotomies.

1132
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,250
And, you know, the voluntary trepanations.

1133
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,010
Yeah, but most of them do that anyway.

1134
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,590
I mean, so nobody can tell the difference.

1135
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:51,990
Oh, okay.

1136
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,290
Oh.

1137
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,190
But that's nowadays.

1138
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,550
Usually what you have is some kind of occipital swelling.

1139
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,230
One side gets real huge.

1140
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,450
The other one gets real tiny.

1141
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,370
And the eyeball looks like a little bead.

1142
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:07,370
It pops in and out and beams neon messages to people or people.

1143
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,650
People, yeah, people, sure.

1144
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,070
Yeah, people.

1145
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,390
That's who we want to...

1146
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,110
We don't want anything because it would profit someone.

1147
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,510
Right.

1148
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,950
Yeah, we don't want anything.

1149
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,110
Well, then let's just talk about Bob and what a useless character he is.

1150
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:22,470
Yeah.

1151
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:24,770
Bob.

1152
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,930
Yes, Bob.

1153
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:26,790
Bob.

1154
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,390
Himself.

1155
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,030
Himself.

1156
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,370
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1157
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:30,670
That's right.

1158
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:38,030
Just thinking of him makes me leak and drain from all my glands while just thinking of Bob's pipe.

1159
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,070
All my, I can smell the Bob's pipe.

1160
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:46,550
The, the, my memory of the, the, the smell, the wafting whiff of Bob's pipe.

1161
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,030
It just freaks me out, man.

1162
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,050
You're a bad sign.

1163
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,270
This is my happening.

1164
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:52,450
The Bob's pipe.

1165
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:52,450


1166
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:52,450


1167
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:52,450


1168
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,290
And it's freaking me out.

1169
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,090
This is my world.

1170
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,530
Our grave of a soldier.

1171
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,450
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1172
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,870
There's a road in West Virginia.

1173
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,050
A road where dreams come true.

1174
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,030
Named after that Popeye comic who's entertained for you.

1175
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:21,210
And if your life has got you down, there's a place where you can go.

1176
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,290
Morgantown, West Virginia.

1177
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,450
It's there you'll know.

1178
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:30,370
Dreams do come true on Diamond's Avenue.

1179
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:38,690
They do come true on Diamond's Avenue.

1180
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:46,170
Well, he started out in grade school as a ventriloquist.

1181
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:50,490
And he made so many movies that not one should be missed.

1182
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,690
So pour a cup of coffee.

1183
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,390
And fill it to the rim.

1184
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,650
And watch those classic films that got a road named after him.

1185
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,830
Dreams do come true.

1186
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,550
Diamond's Avenue.

1187
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,070
They do come true.

1188
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,890
Diamond's Avenue.

1189
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,690
No time for sergeants.

1190
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,430
Wake me when it's over.

1191
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,910
Last time I saw Archie.

1192
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,710
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.

1193
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,770
Move over, darling.

1194
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,930
The incredible Mr. Lampet.

1195
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,910
The ghost Mr. Chicken.

1196
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,690
The reluctant astronaut.

1197
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,210
Herbie Ghost, Monte Carlo.

1198
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,270
Hot lead, cold feet.

1199
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,410
The prize fighter, Big Bully.

1200
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,390
Then Cannonball Run 2.

1201
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,590
Shake this gun in the West.

1202
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,650
Pound to frame a fig.

1203
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,650
The Apple Dumping Gang.

1204
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,670
No deposit, no return.

1205
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,290
Dreams do come true.

1206
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:53,910
Diamond's Avenue.

1207
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,450
They do come true.

1208
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,250
Diamond's Avenue.

1209
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,850
Diamond's is the man.

1210
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,950
Shake, bugger, and lean.

1211
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:14,050
Watch one of his movies and he'll know what I mean.

1212
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,690
And if your life has got you down,

1213
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,250
there's a place where you can go.

1214
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,690
A magical road in West Virginia.

1215
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,370
Just ask my friend Joe.

1216
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,490
Dreams do come true.

1217
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,130
Diamond's Avenue.

1218
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,790
They do come true.

1219
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,510
Diamond's Avenue.

1220
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,070
Dreams do come true.

1221
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:43,970
Diamond's Avenue.

1222
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,610
They do come true

1223
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,010
Like donuts have a new

1224
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,810
Yes, dear friends.

1225
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,530
The Chuck Hestens is the name of that band.

1226
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,690
And you can reach them at myspace.com

1227
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,950
slash thechuckhestens.

1228
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:09,950


1229
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:17,050
They sent a couple of CDs that were quite varied in styles of songs.

1230
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,470
But they all mention Hollywood stars, though, right? Or not?

1231
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,090
No, this is the only one they mentioned was Don Knotts.

1232
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:23,650
And I played...

1233
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:28,570
There's a lot of subgeniuses that are huge Don Knotts movie fans.

1234
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,470
Well, they used to call Charlton Heston Chuck.

1235
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:32,850
Do you remember those days?

1236
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:36,410
When I was working for the National Gun Club.

1237
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,770
And as Bob flies his private jet towards Fort Knox

1238
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:50,010
to take over the U.S. economy and set it back...

1239
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,190
Yank it up by its own bootstraps and set it back running

1240
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,050
for him, the way it should be.

1241
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,350
I'll sign that now.

1242
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,310
I'll sign that later.

1243
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,990
There's a signature for that.

1244
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,870
It's something found...

1245
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,090
in the wild.

1246
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,490
Friend, are you ready to meet Bob?

1247
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,130
And you know, we've predicted that the world was going to end

1248
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:18,610
on a yearly basis now.

1249
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:19,690
And...

1250
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,870
And the world will end.

1251
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,590
And you... And, friend...

1252
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,490
The world ends tomorrow.

1253
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,290
And you may die.

1254
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,590
And, in fact, you will die.

1255
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,610
And tomorrow could come any time, you know.

1256
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,150
It may come in an hour when ye least expect it.

1257
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,470
So are you ready to meet Bob?

1258
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:43,350
Behold...

1259
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,490
And or your maker.

1260
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,490
Bob is probably not your maker.

1261
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,790
They lay not asleep for the hour is of hams.

1262
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,410
And it is before them as they sleep before the hour is of tams.

1263
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,810
They know not the time of their...

1264
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:59,710
You know, what the time was there that you mentioned.

1265
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,070
Yes, the end times.

1266
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,550
And they know their own time of they may...

1267
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:07,030
Their own, yeah.

1268
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:07,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1269
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,910
Friend, do you own your time?

1270
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,950
Or does boss man own your time?

1271
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:13,610
Come on.

1272
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,610
Do you have to...

1273
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,770
Do you have to urinate in a little jar every now and then

1274
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,190
to prove that your mind is still okay?

1275
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,710
It's changing colors, for God's sake.

1276
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,710
Make that for Tom's sake.

1277
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,010
And it'll stay the way you want it.

1278
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:28,710
That's right, friends.

1279
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,130
When you become a subgenius,

1280
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,610
when they give you that urine test,

1281
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,550
you'll break the machine every time.

1282
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,370
Because they won't know what to do

1283
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:35,990
when that...

1284
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,270
Your blood pressure keeps changing

1285
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,330
from yellow to green to purple to red to blue,

1286
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:41,150
cycling,

1287
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,150
and sometimes even with paisleys in it and stripes.

1288
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:48,670
When it turns into a moving barber pole of colors,

1289
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:56,510
how's Mr. Boss Man gonna deal with your blood froth content, huh?

1290
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,650
When it breaks the machine, my friend.

1291
00:47:58,810 --> 00:47:59,270
Yes, friends.

1292
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,450
And what are you going to do

1293
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:03,410
when that urine sample begins tock down to the nose?

1294
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:04,410
Repent.

1295
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:05,290
Quit your job.

1296
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,150
Slack off.

1297
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,010
It's the tickest display.

1298
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:07,250
It's the tickest display.

1299
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:07,930
It's the tickest.

1300
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:08,270
Stop.

1301
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,350
Jack in.

1302
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,390
Jack out.

1303
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,350
Track in.

1304
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,250
Track back.

1305
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,470
Okay, let's take a shot of this guy over here.

1306
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,270
His head has just been shaved,

1307
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,470
and there's all kinds of weird,

1308
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,330
looks like they're henna tattoo markings

1309
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,170
on the back of his head saying,

1310
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,510
Bob was here.

1311
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,050
Here's another one of beautiful,

1312
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,530
beautiful, beautiful young ladies.

1313
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,030
That's a good tattoo.

1314
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,310
I haven't seen that done.

1315
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,090
So I'm having Bob was here tattooed

1316
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,210
on the back of your head.

1317
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,410
Oh, that's as old as Conroy

1318
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,410
or whatever his name was,

1319
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,710
the Native American guy.

1320
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:36,110
I forget.

1321
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:36,610
I forget its name.

1322
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,130
Tompo.

1323
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:37,830
Tompo.

1324
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,070
Tompo.

1325
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:39,890
Tompo was here,

1326
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,590
and so was Bob so many times.

1327
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,270
Bob has been around the block

1328
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,990
more than once,

1329
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,870
and he offers you a form of slack.

1330
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,010
Slack.

1331
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:48,750
Slack.

1332
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:51,270
If you can handle it.

1333
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:52,330
Slack.

1334
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,890
Most of us can't handle slack.

1335
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,690
All the slack.

1336
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,450
Slipper.

1337
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:00,610
You could possibly ever want.

1338
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:04,170
It comes and goes of its own free will.

1339
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:05,590
No.

1340
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,670
For your own pleasure.

1341
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,250
Use it or lose it.

1342
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,750
Or just stare at it for a long time.

1343
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,170
That's what I prefer to do.

1344
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,930
Sometimes I take my little slack box

1345
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,330
when the kids aren't watching.

1346
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,110
After I've all stuffed them in their mummy boxes

1347
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,350
and given Grandpa a tweak on the hard pickle,

1348
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,330
sent my old lady to bed where she belongs,

1349
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,330
sneak down into the basement,

1350
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,250
open up the mahogany chest,

1351
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,670
and there it is.

1352
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:33,850
My slack box.

1353
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,190
It's got a pipe,

1354
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,770
a pipe engraved on the side of it,

1355
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,690
given to me by you-know-who,

1356
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,550
one and only J.R. himself.

1357
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,630
It was a day in Dallas in 1967.

1358
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:47,030
I remember that day as if it was Tuesday,

1359
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,110
for Christ's sake.

1360
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:49,490
Look.

1361
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,750
Somebody's been messing with my slack box.

1362
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,810
Maybe it's one of them damn kids.

1363
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,090
Maybe it's that damn woman

1364
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,370
checking my slack.

1365
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,910
Way more slack.

1366
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,090
Way more slack.

1367
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:03,230


1368
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,370
Way more slack.

1369
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:04,490
Way more slack.

1370
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:05,050
Way more slack.

1371
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:05,170
Way more slack.

1372
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:05,170


1373
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,730
Way more slack.

1374
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:07,890
Way more slack.

1375
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,090
Way more slack.

1376
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,330
Way more slack.

1377
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:10,630
Way more slack.

1378
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,490
Way more slack.

1379
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,550
I'm feeling a little low-key.

1380
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,630
Stressed and pressed and lonely.

1381
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,390
I need an attack.

1382
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,650
I gotta get back to my FX rack.

1383
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,030
I'm feeling a little low-key.

1384
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,070
Stressed and pressed and lonely.

1385
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,810
The car is in.

1386
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,070
I'm pursuing my signal.

1387
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:27,910
The car is back.

1388
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,070
Can't deal with no flack.

1389
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,090
I'm not a flack.

1390
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,210
I'm not a goose gack.

1391
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,730
This grind I can't hack.

1392
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:35,510
I need.

1393
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,770
Way more slack.

1394
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:37,930
Way more slack.

1395
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,170
Way more slack.

1396
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,350
Way more slack.

1397
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:41,190
Way more slack.

1398
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:42,050
I'm feeling the lack.

1399
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:44,590
Getting tired of the mack.

1400
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,930
Don't wanna read the fact.

1401
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,250
Or crack the manual and shack.

1402
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:52,330
My short stack, I don't even want to whack.

1403
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,770
Rosie Palm and her four sisters are losing the deck.

1404
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:00,650
Rosie Palm and her four sisters are losing the neck.

1405
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,470
They're losing the deck.

1406
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,350
Humbling, mumbling, fully hardest.

1407
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:07,370
I just gotta stack the deck to fuel my frop mecca

1408
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:12,670
I just gotta stack the deck to fuel my frop mecca

1409
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:17,510
I know I need way more slack, way more slack

1410
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,730
Let me hear that guitar part sack, take these subgeniuses back

1411
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,130
To the beginning of the start of something to give us all

1412
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,530
Way more slack, way more slack, way more slack, way more slack

1413
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,390
I need a little low-key, best pressed lonely

1414
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:56,770
I need the tech, I gotta get back to my FX rack

1415
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,830
I gotta pursue my future, I see the road's finding me

1416
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,930
Way more slack, way more slack, way more slack

1417
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,330
P.S. if you want to keep your track up, you gotta keep your track up

1418
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,770
Way more slack, way more slack, way more slack

1419
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:11,650
Way more slack, way more slack, way more slack

1420
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:28,210
Way more slack friends from 4L Prек

1421
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,390
of 4lprek.com

1422
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,790
That's spelled N-O-R-E-L-P-R-E-F.

1423
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,110
That was an actual song.

1424
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:38,470
Norrell Preff?

1425
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:39,350
Oh, that song.

1426
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,550
That was a song.

1427
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,890
Way more slack.

1428
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:47,210
When you don't play enough and you need to weigh more slack.

1429
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,090
How can you weigh slack?

1430
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,630
What are you going to put on a scale?

1431
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:51,190
Yeah, really.

1432
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,290
What is slack for you?

1433
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,610
It would be as if Temis, the ancient goddess of justice,

1434
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,430
were holding her scales up high

1435
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,390
and there was not enough slack in one half

1436
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,810
and too much slack in the other.

1437
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,450
Come on, it just doesn't make sense.

1438
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,230
It makes about as much sense as the day we both had

1439
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,970
putting shoes on the wrong feet,

1440
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,990
arguing with other people's children.

1441
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,770
And none of us have any right now, do we?

1442
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:12,410
Or was that yesterday?

1443
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,750
I'm giving my daughter away this weekend.

1444
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,090
And I'm so glad that you're giving her to me, Stang.

1445
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:20,470
No, not to you.

1446
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,450
And not to Paul Mavridis either,

1447
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,310
who always thought he was going to get that.

1448
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,870
Yes, but why not?

1449
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:30,370
I just don't want my daughter marrying a subgenius.

1450
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:30,610
Yes.

1451
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:30,790
That's right.

1452
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:33,150
But what a present for any subgenius.

1453
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,390
Stang's beautiful young daughter.

1454
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,450
I won't do that anymore.

1455
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,490
She's only 39, 48, whatever, 52.

1456
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:42,690
I'm kidding.

1457
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:43,590
She's 17.

1458
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:52,050
There's been a lot of weddings in the subgenius era lately.

1459
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,910
But not enough people getting married.

1460
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,110
Just a bunch of weddings.

1461
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,070
Yeah, and a whole lot of procreating.

1462
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:58,730
That's good.

1463
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,350
To create more little...

1464
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:01,330
Sometimes it's good.

1465
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:01,890
Yeah, 10-10.

1466
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,290
With the barbed wire and the sandpaper.

1467
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,090
Not so good.

1468
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,050
Not so good, comrade.

1469
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,290
Not over it.

1470
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:07,730
Nah.

1471
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:08,330
Nah.

1472
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:10,030
Well, you can try it.

1473
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:10,810
Hey, have you ever...

1474
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,490
Well, you raised a kid.

1475
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,550
Didn't you use barbed wire some of the time?

1476
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:15,150
Once in a while.

1477
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,250
Keep them pinned in?

1478
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:19,090
But we were kind of like getting off the barbed wire thing

1479
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,070
and the sandpaper.

1480
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,830
Weaved from the barbed wire.

1481
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,570
Mm-hmm.

1482
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:26,290
We used an electric fence to keep the children in.

1483
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,430
One of those cattle fences like Pappy had?

1484
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,330
No, more like for dogs and rabbits.

1485
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:30,630
For rabbits.

1486
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,550
Cattle fence would kill a child.

1487
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,470
I thought maybe you just like cut it back a little bit.

1488
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,510
It did actually kill a squirrel one day.

1489
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,210
My son and I, when he was real little,

1490
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,330
we went out in the backyard and there was a squirrel

1491
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:49,350
standing, clutching the electric fence and not moving.

1492
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,870
He had committed suicide, Stank.

1493
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:55,750
And my son, who was about four or so, said,

1494
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:59,010
why is that squirrel not moving, Daddy?

1495
00:54:59,250 --> 00:54:59,970
And I said,

1496
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,110
that squirrel is dead, son.

1497
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,530
That's a dead squirrel.

1498
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,730
He touched the electric fence and held on and he died.

1499
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:07,650
What a cruel dad.

1500
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:08,870
And you know what my son said?

1501
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,970
Someday I want to be just like that squirrel, Daddy.

1502
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,090
Oh, my.

1503
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,710
You did not lie to your child and say,

1504
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,670
no, that squirrel is merely excremented.

1505
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:20,950
He didn't, yes.

1506
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,410
He's having a confused moment right now,

1507
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,090
but then he's second hill snapped too.

1508
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:29,650
No, you had to lay it on him at an early age of 35?

1509
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:30,090
Oh, I thought,

1510
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:33,390
we, yeah, we didn't hold anything back from our kids.

1511
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:36,710
We told them all the horrors of the world immediately.

1512
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,890
Except for about Santa Claus.

1513
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,310
We didn't tell them the horrible fact about Santa Claus.

1514
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:45,950
And boy, when we did, they never forgave us.

1515
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,010
Oh, you can't blame them.

1516
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,850
Tell them Santa Claus is a Romanian gypsy

1517
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:52,430
with some kind of strange sexual habits.

1518
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,490
The other kids mocked them.

1519
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:58,150
The other kids usually get BB guns and converge on your house.

1520
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:59,850
And they'll all, you know,

1521
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,750
besides swearing to put out your eye,

1522
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:05,370
they'll tell you the real political meaning of Santa Claus.

1523
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,790
Santa Claus, they call him sometimes.

1524
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,710
I just want to make sure them kids stay off my lawn.

1525
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:14,090
Hey, it's one minute till showtime end.

1526
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,150
And I'd like the listeners to know

1527
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:20,170
that they're listening to Hour of Slack number 1106.

1528
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,270
1106.

1529
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:28,890
And if you want more information about what,

1530
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:30,670
is going on here,

1531
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:35,210
you can look at a website that never ends

1532
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:38,850
called subgenius.com.

1533
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:43,110
Subgenius, by the way, does not have an O in it,

1534
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:46,930
although dot com has at least one.

1535
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:49,950
At least part of the time.

1536
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:56,130
And this music in the background is the swinging love corpses.

1537
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,330
Before that, we heard some background music by

1538
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,510
Javier Cugat,

1539
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:02,050
Lombada,

1540
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,130
and the Moog cookbook.

1541
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,070
Oh, and Ed Fred.

1542
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:07,670
Oh, and you forgot to mention,

1543
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,870
you played some of my music too.

1544
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,370
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's detective music

1545
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,730
was used at the opening of the show.

1546
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:15,430
Yes.

1547
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,490
And in the background credits of other shows

1548
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,150
that Dave doesn't get to hear.

1549
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,970
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

1550
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:22,450
Heh, eh.

1551
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:25,490
Okay, now let's see if I can...

1552
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,770
I just noticed that pause button is actually,

1553
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:32,630
the disconnected pause of the squirrel at your ranch.

1554
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:37,270
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

1555
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,710
Bah, bah, bah, bah, down on your knees.

1556
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,570
The job is easy.

1557
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,290
Fresh beauty.

1558
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:42,350
Save yourself.

1559
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,710
Take life easier.

1560
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,130
I can even give it to you backwards.

1561
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,430
Wow, how disgusting.

1562
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:49,110
Lady, it was nobody else's butt.

1563
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,710
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

1564
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,330
So dirty, you know.

1565
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:53,830
I vibrate.

1566
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,310
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1567
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:56,290
Mm.

1568
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,350
Heh, heh, heh.

1569
00:57:58,650 --> 00:57:59,130
Hedge.

1570
00:57:59,130 --> 00:57:59,910
Pretty good, Johnny.

1571
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,130
But that ain't the way I heard it.

1572
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:02,750
Give me that monkey.

1573
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:03,430
Give me that monkey.

1574
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:04,310
Heh, heh, heh.

1575
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:05,930
That's what they all say.

1576
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,810
Send over your...

1577
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:07,390
Send over your...

1578
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,430
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

1579
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,150
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1580
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:14,930
I'd like to make a suggestion that I know will be very helpful to many of you.

1581
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:15,850
Play with it.

1582
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,870
Clap with it.

1583
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,670
I finally got the darn dirty ahead to eat it.

1584
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:20,990
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1585
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:24,230
here is a vital message on our nation's internal security

1586
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:25,830
from J. Edgar Hoover,

1587
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:28,130
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1588
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,950
Mr. Hoover's message is, and I quote,

1589
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,690
For wartime security,

1590
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:35,490
American industry has had to maintain secrecy

1591
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,350
about many of its most amazing projects.

1592
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:38,830
For instance,

1593
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:42,890
The Sogenius Powerhouse.

1594
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,350
Everything's flowing smoothly

1595
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:48,610
until they start their undercurrent of bitterness.

1596
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,770
They spread rumors round and round

1597
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,750
and suck a lot of foolish people into the trouble

1598
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,050
that they stir up.

1599
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,310
It gets harder and harder to see clearly.

1600
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,490
It becomes impossible to keep your head

1601
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:59,130
above water.

1602
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,870
You just go thrashing about,

1603
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,430
striking out at everything in sight

1604
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,730
and never making any headway at all.

1605
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:07,990
Now, you can avoid getting into such troubled gang

1606
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:11,390
just by sticking to the mainstream of friendship.

1607
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,930
No purchase required.

1608
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:13,770
No obligation.

1609
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,670
Free while his supply lasts.
