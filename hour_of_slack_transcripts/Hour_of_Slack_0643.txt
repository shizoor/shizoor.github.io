My prayers aren't answered.
People do not hear.
God does not understand.
You know, nothing's going on when I'm praying.
It's because there's sin in your life.
The heavens turn to brass.
God turns his face.
He shuts his ears and his eyes.
And Nehemiah is saying, evidently,
God hasn't been listening as his people, the Jews,
the Hebrews, have been crying out to him.
Him.
It's the same way with Bob.
Oh, it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.
I love you all, too.
Goodbye, Tin Man.
Oh, don't cry.
You're a rustle, dreadful.
Here's your oil, Tin.
Here's your oil.
Goodbye.
Now I know I've got the heart, because it's breaking.
Goodbye, Lion.
You know, I know it isn't right,
but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help
before you found your courage.
Are you ready now?
Yes.
Say goodbye, Toto.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times.
And think to yourself, there's no place like...
Bob.
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.
On board were the Twelve.
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician,
and the other so-called gods of our legends.
But not...
Bob.
The gods they were.
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind,
let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day.
But we'll have to wait another year.
Hail the sex goddesses.
Because they did show up at X-Day.
A new day.
Yeah, we went over the rainbow into the mitochondrial yeti DNA level C.
Well, we're gonna have to go north and south and east and west.
And we gotta wait another year, yeah, but...
But we're gonna fill up a new pipe.
We're gonna wait for the sun to shine.
We're gonna turn around and take our time.
We're gonna break the seal to the other side.
You know, from the valley, I hear the muffled cries
of all them poor sheeple that we left behind.
And we're gonna take that next evolutionary path.
Yeah, we're gonna climb on those rocket ships.
We're gonna build the vessels if we have to.
We're already testing the engines.
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip.
We're on the ride, yeah.
Mitochondrial Eve, thanks for the ride.
We'll take it from here.
Walk through a rainbow.
No
You've made me
The ones who'd spin






to worry
All this is supposed to last
For what you call it
Nothing in this world
れ
But how can there be love without the Father?
He hasn't left us.
That is what I will tell the others.
I'm watching for any blinking lights.
I did something wrong using the computer.
Amazing. There it is.
You are on.
You are on.
From up here in the escape vessels, we see the Earth blinking and winking down below.
There are some garbled signals coming through as we look out the windows.
It looks like G. Gordon Gordon and Stang on the edge of a wing or something.
Eating chicken wings or something.
We are just sitting out here on the wing in our moon pants.
Sipping and playing with ourselves.
Sitting out on the wing of the escape vessel.
We are just sitting out here on the wing in our moon pants.
Your voice is gone, man.
When your diapers fill up, those moon pants are ready to chuck.
That is why we party in our moon pants.
I didn't know the radio station was going to be down by the engine room.
We are not in a good spot at all.
Let's quit kidding ourselves, you guys.
Let's face it.
We are still on Earth.
Something went wrong.
We don't know what it was.
We are still on Earth?
Not much of an Earth.
I can't believe it.
I can face it.
X-Day came.
X-Day went.
You were tired and feathered.
I was a little more disappointed than most people.
I think you can well imagine.
On the other hand, I think a lot of people and a lot of subgeniuses,
in fact, Dr. Legume himself was saying,
I guess this is the end of the church, Stang.
I was going, what the hell are you talking about?
Hadn't you read Revelations?
I said, no.
I hadn't even read the book of the subgenius.
You know what they used to do?
I go to confess my sin to the Lord,
and the Lord said, I've already heard about it from Bob.
My dog's bigger than your dog.
My dog's smarter than yours.
My dog's better because he gets kennel ration.
My dog's better than yours.
During the past few weeks,
I've wondered whether you might be having some second thoughts about the mission.
I've been thinking about it.


How do you mean?
Well,
it's rather difficult to define.
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.
I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion
that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.
Now listen,
everything depends on how long we can stall them while still showing results.
The exes may well say,
quote,
well, this is great,
but you can't have another 200 years.
We'll be back in 1990,
1999.
And what if in 1999,
Dobbs strings them along a little further?
We might end up having an
ex-day gut blowout party
on a yearly basis.
One hundred years away.
I'm not giving in to a smile or a grin on a face I might never see again.
I'm not gonna fly in some big,
phony sky on a life that I know just can't win.

And I'm not gonna take second best.
No, I've got no use for the rest.
So, world,
you better hear what I say.
Cardboard
For me,
true love could be
One hundred years away.
And if it is, I'll wait.
Yes.
What do you mean?
You don't even know my psychocardiogram.
Eh?
Never mind.
Never mind.
Never mind.
Never mind.
Never mind.
So you could get me off the hook, couldn't you?
I mean, like you could explain to the fuzz, just tell them everything.
You could save me.
We believe you.
All the excess baggage you've left in so many places and so many lives.
Just think of how many worlds you lived in.
And all the crap you left behind.
Well, there's that suitcase back when you were a marine biologist in 1929.
You were one of the first until you fell overboard.
And then there was all that psychic baggage you left when you were a witch in the Middle Ages.
And remember when you fell off the top of the amphitheater when you was watching the Roman circus?
You were a slave, but you were making good.
Good box, man.
Who cares?
You could have bought your freedom in two years.
Roman circus slaves.
Walk through any door.
You're welcome.
They're only here.
See how it's in hell.
Grunt. Grunt. Grunt.
Everyone grunt. Everyone grunt.
Everyone grunt every day.
Every night and day.
Every night and day.
Everyone grunt the night away.
Everything will be all right.
You are in my hands.
I am here to protect you.
You have nowhere to go.
But I don't care.
I still believe in Bob.
I don't care if the X's don't come in 99.
I don't care if Bob says they'll come in 2000.
Have you talked to Bob since X-Day?
I still believe in Bob.
Have you talked to Bob?
I think Gordon had a short conversation.
A very short conversation.
What did he say to you?
Oops.
Oops.
Oops.
Oops.
Oops.


Oops.
Hey, Sam, look up there.
Earth.
Oh, what?
Oh, no.
It's catching fire.
It's burning.
Oh, no.
That can't be Earth.
How am I to can't do this to me?
I got all our money invested in this place.
Go ahead, Sam.
Switch on more lights.
Turn up the music.
Get the hot dogs on the fire.
There'll be another batch of customers coming along in about 100 million years.
What do we do?
You ask that question now?
I was, uh...
The great countdown.
No, I, um...
In fact, we counted down twice.
Twice.
Yeah.
I came to Earth.

Yeah.
After the tribe, we counted down again and they stole them, Scott.
How much longer must this disaster have contained you?
My brother, God, was wrong about the comet.
How were we to know it would land right in the middle of our giant warehouse?
It's a cataclysmic tale down here where, flooded, we're over our poor heads in remnants,
burnt ends, and labeled from such naturally famous weeds as Royal Moo, Lemurian, Westerness,
and Munchkin.
We're all going to get them.
Dog hair, hairball, slick stags, striptease.
We got them, you get them.
Your nap will rise again, and that's my siren.
Well, I guess, Chaz, you may have been right all along.
We may have to...
We...
I don't think we have to build our own shits.
We may have to build our own shits.
But we should go ahead and start.
Yeah.
Maybe draw a plan for our...
At least it'll give us a goal, you know, something to do before we, you know, hit.
I come from that spark of light so far in space, space, space.
You're my only hope.





And in our mind, the distance could not comprehend.
CSX Day was a little more low-rent than we expected.
But this is the church of cheap genius.
This is the church of the subgenius, and we don't need conspiracy, fancy, chrome-plated
escape vessels.
No, sir.
Maybe the paint's chippin'.
Maybe our escape vessels don't really fly yet.
Maybe some of them are made out of them styrofoam take-home packs.
Maybe some of our sex goddesses are shaped like blow-up balloon ladies or whatever you

We're going to be able to destroy them.


And we're going to destroy what's called a cyborg.

Get them, get them.

right-handed doctors maybe just maybe that the movies spend more money on their special effects
it's okay it's okay yeah it's belief is what counts and you know the jehovah's witnesses
they've had their end of the world fall apart on them i don't know how many times half a dozen
times at least and i have seen no dearth of jehovah's witnesses at my door they're still
coming on strong and the subgeniuses by the same token a true subgenius will have faith that bob
maybe you know well we might have to wait a little long stay when you
more memberships man yes we didn't have enough numbers when you shout when you fall off a horse
what do you do you get up on you ride again
you kick it no no no you pull off the horse you shoot the damn thing for stumbling and
stange riding the four horses of apocalypse man so he's got three more shots for sure
four go-karts of the apocalypse what the hell are you guys talking about the four go-karts
of the apocalypse they're sputtering man but they're coming down the line anyway
the seventh seal shall park and juggle
pretty well brother pretty well
you
look down there
we're faster faster and faster they're spreading the force i'd help the force
the sheet of flame around the earth
dr tell me what is it how much is our spiritual growth tied
into the faithfulness and using our spiritual gifts a major part of it the way i liken it is to
somebody who is not a man and a woman los angeles has walked into the spiritual world andieggeet


who is eating, maybe eating all the right food,
but just keep eating and eating and eating,
never exercise and never move,
I mean, that's going to develop obesity.
Christianity employs a certain technique we can use in weight loss,
humiliation.
So I'd like to begin this session
with the Inattitude, Diatribe, and Humiliation Dread.
God hates folks who are fat.
He hates them.
It's simple, and that's that.
No quibbling with the Lord.
If your body's shaped like a gourd,
he'll chop you up and halve you with his sword.
He's my T-sword, he's my T-sword.
God, God, God, God.
Oh, God, God, God, God, God, God,
hates them who are fat.
Okay, let's begin now.
God hates people who are fat.
He spices them, and that is simply that.
If your body's shaped like a gourd,
God hates people who are fat.
He'll chop you with his mighty sword,
and leave you out of judgment day,
and that's that.
That is that.
Wait, where's the time to die tonight?
Well, how many, like, dads and daddysons or whatever
do you guys believe in?
Oh, jeez.
As many as we need to for that moment.
If we get tired of them after a while,
we kill them.
And kill them.
You kill your dads?
Well, so do you believe in entities, though?
Sure, we create them all the time.
We are entities in a fashion, isn't it?
Uh, not in neo-fashion.
Uh, just, I'm sorry.
Neo-fashion entity?
Yeah.
That doesn't make sense.
Oh, come on, now, you know what I'm talking about.
We have a very sharp weight within a neo-fashion entity.
Stop asking me what entity would you like to create.
You know, kind of like really tapered in,
and then have those buckles around the hips,
and big boots, and, uh, you know, riding bridges.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You have the tapered head, though.
You still gotta have the tapered head, like you said, right?
I don't wanna get- I can't.
I'm gonna be all stiff like you.
Do you make your dads and goddesses,
and then drop them like they're nothing?
Yeah, of course.
It's our- well, it's what, they did that to us.
Yeah.
As a matter of fact,
to tell the truth, we just got sick and tired of this god character pushing us around,
and have declared war on god.
If you don't mind, I figure any god that's all worried about us declaring war on it
ain't much of a god.
That's right.
Well, I mean, like, the gods and goddesses put wars, you know, like, in the world.
You know, that on our earth is our child.
Goddesses are a dime a dozen, Duchess, Duchess.
You know, it's like we create them, wipe them out, recreate them, permutate them, mutate them, you know, whatever.
You can create them, but you can't wipe them out.
You can create them, but you can't wipe them out.
You can't wipe them out or feel that way, because they put you here, and they give you a problem.
No, they don't.
That's a big aside.
If you see me when you're walking down the road, kill me now.
They didn't create us.
We created them.
That's right.
I see where she's coming from, though.
When a god is- when a god no longer serves,
it's just a god.

It's purpose.
Put it on the shelf next to the ices with one nostril, and just go and dust it every
once in a while, put flowers.
And put a candle next to it, right?
Every once in a while.
Don't urinate on those used-up gods and goddesses.
Don't urinate on them, Duchess.
Yes, right.
Did the Buddha say, if you see me-
If you pick one, square it off, and give another one?
Walking down the street, kill me!
Yes.
Feed me bad mushrooms.
Yes!
Call me your grandmother.
I don't care.
Oh yawesome.
Bring that yawesome.
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
It's not the idea that you're going to get off the wheel.
It's the fact that the wheel exists.
Everybody wants to come back, you know, be on Baywatch again.
You know how it is.
Keep spinning it and spinning it.
I've taught you much, my little droogies.
Oh, my friend, there is a future.
And that future comes, hang on, in your death.
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
I am your Messiah
Well, how long has your religion been around?
Before the Masons.
Before the Masons.
We invented the Masons, and they invented religion.
Yeah.
Our religion has been around ever since the first caveman with weak vision.
We figured out how to change it.
We figured out how to trick the other caveman into bringing him food for free.
Someone's dying, my lord.
Kumbaya.
Having their guts cut out.
Kumbaya.
Packing a part with a machete
in Africa.
Someone's dying, my lord.
Kumbaya.
Build a flourishing using a aside of iron.
Someone's dying, my lord.

For Maya.
Someone's mutilated, my lord.

Half two pieces.
Half two pieces.
Shot with an arrow.
Shot with an arrow.
Biological weapons, my lord
Chemical ones, too
Genetic manipulation
All for you
Yes, Billion, what an attractive, exciting world of the future it will be.
You must sign up now because space is limited.
Space is limited.
Space is limited.
I am your messiah.
I am your messiah.
I am your messiah.
I am your messiah.
I am your messiah.
You are your own messiah.
You must learn to think for yourself.
But only J.R. Bob Dobbs can show you how.
Well, I don't know how to. I'm only 16 years old.
Well, I'm...
I don't know what I want and what my answers to my world are.
And who I follow and all this.
Yeah, I was that smart when I was 16.
But by the time I hit 73, I realized just how dumb I really was.
I'm younger than that now.
Woo-woo.
Woo-woo.
Woo-woo.
The topic for tonight is the order of the asmix spaghetti of fate.
This is one piece of art of the other life.
You can't anybody else.
Vamos.
Vamos.






the shed and old shed of tears
when you tore my dreams all apart.
I must have died a little bit inside,
but there's no more tears in my heart.
No longer do I yearn and pray someday that you'll retire.
No longer do I cry.
There are ways for people to come to their senses.
No longer do I cry over him.
Like if you're a hammer, you know, everything you see is a nail.
No longer do I cry over him.
Come on, let's quit kidding ourselves, you guys.
Let's face it, we're still on Earth.
Something went wrong.
We don't know what it was.
No longer do I cry over him.
Have you considered the possibility that on a star,
the star people wish upon an Earth?
Was it all a dream?
Did any of it happen?
Could any of it happen?
Of course not.
How stupid.
One hundred years away.
I don't think there is any question about it.
It can only be attributable to human error.
This sort of thing has cropped up before, and it has always been due to human error.
There are as many atoms in one molecule of DNA as there are stars in a typical galaxy.
We praise the molecular god.
The nano god.
Yeah.
As well as the...
No.
The macro god.
The atomic god.
And the neutrino gods.
And the DNA level C god.
You know, it's just a matter of microcosm, mesocosm, microcosm, mesocosm, microcosm, mesocosm.
Listen, babe, if you can look at the television right now and talk to us and see us on the television right now,
you're a lot further involved in this church than we are, and you can just keep on talking and we'll shut up.
And we'll send you money.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And our nocturnal emissions and stuff.
How much can we send you?
You can send...
Send me all that you want.
And our cute little penguin on her panties.
But, Price, she is the new goddess.
Yes.
She said we could send her all that we want.
What's your name there, Bubblegum?
Tiffany.
Praise Tiffany.
Praise Tiffany.
You are a tool, Tiffany.
She's so light, they named her after a lamp.
The subgenius monks and scholars and bobbies and learned old farts will be endlessly...
And the hierophant.
You know, theorized.
And theorizing and sifting through the clues.
Um, you know, trying to figure out when the moment is, you know, the time that is nigh shall come.
But none shall know the hour.
Well...
Things didn't work out.
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.
I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
You cannot petition the Lord with prayer!
They hated being out of control.
Yes.
So anything to be in control...
So, that's what they're going to do.
You can hear it in her voice.
You can see it in her eyes.
It won't fail because of me.
Ten, nine, five, four, three, two, one, commet.
Wait until Bob throws you in his pipe and lights you up and starts smoking you.
I would love to meet this guy, Bob.
Oh, you wouldn't, really.
Stan would, too.
Actually, Dobbs does have a little bit of explaining to do to all of us, I suppose.
On the other hand, you know, as it said in the book, if you have perfect trust and faith in Bob, you will definitely be ruptured.
Go.
This is a very unusual phenomenon.
Don't you think I should abort the countdown so that you can remain to study it?
You're making the right decision.
I think we should stop.
Four minutes to ignition.
I enjoy working with human beings and have stimulating relationships with them.
We enjoy working with you, Hal, and we will continue to do so even if we are separated by great distance.
Good God.
The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.
I didn't have it!
I wish I was a spaceman, the fastest guy alive.
What do they want?
Where are they from?
Where are they going?
Anybody can write a religious book and have at least a couple of followers.
Catch it on.
You are starting praise Bob.
You are starting to catch on.
And she's only 16.
Anybody can write their own religious book and have a couple of followers.
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special edition of the Bob and Bob Show.
All you of Earth are idiots.
Don't add more pain to their already diminished lives.
It makes the religion of his so true that you follow it and that you believe in it.
Because we can reinvent it every five minutes to fit the situation as the fluctuations of the quantum universe wash across us and cause us to reconstruct.
And also, we're not followers of any particular region.
This region where they grow the grapes now follows us around like a closely watched channel.
You're a child, you know what I mean?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Friday's child makes something look like nothing.
You realize there's a government directive stating that there is no such thing as a flying sausage.
This is the best part of the trip.
This is the trip.
The best part.
I really like what he said.
Welcome to the Salt Parade.
Welcome to the Salt Parade.

The question is not whether you can or whether you should
or whether you will or whether you won't.
The fact is you owe it to yourself.
You get one shot, you go around, it's your movie, you're the director.
You are the principal actor.
You write the script and you know how it goes out.
And if you let anybody else direct it for you, it's your fault.
The salt parade has now begun
Listen to the engines hum
People out to have some fun
Cobra on my left, leopard on my right
Sanctuary
I must find a place to hide
A place for me to hide
A place for me to hide
I would love to meet this guy Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Oh, you wouldn't really.
Stan would too.
Actually, Dobbs does have a little bit of explaining to do.
I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave

And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward in my grave
Apparently right now you're not able to handle the freedom.
You leave me no choice but to have you go to your room.
I don't know.
If I'm to pour my life's dreams on you

Let me all the pepper

Oh God!
He said that when I came back offGet him off of here.
I tried to console him back but when I didn't have a word with him
I arrived迄
He ultimately passing Hartman down the street.
He's doing something great.
简 gdzieял To make my life a nightmare
that, you know, entertainment there is not going to be the solution.
But for her to hear that by virtue of the way she's used her mouth...
And this flashback, it is so strong that if you talk with an individual when the flashback is occurring,
they would actually believe that it is occurring right then and right there.
If I had ten divisions of those men, then our troubles here would be over very quickly.
We have five nuclear weapons.
You have five of them?
Yeah.
We just got a new one last year from the Ukrainians, thanks to me.
Thanks to Chief Gordon Gordon here.
I might as well say you can pound on that thing with a hammer and don't have to worry about it.
No, we're not terrorists. We're peacemakers.
We've come to bring peace to Earth by killing.
We've come to bring peace to all the human beings and letting only the subgeniuses live.
Hey, if there's a weapon for every Kazakhstani out there,
why shouldn't a subgenius at least have his own be packing himself?
Right.
With a miniature nuclear weapon or a huge one, if he can carry it around somewhere.
And as anyone who is toting nuclear weapons like Bill Clinton should have the right to enjoy oral proclivities in their office...
Oh, that's sad.
...for having a twitchy trigger.
...for having a world cool on Saturday night.
And people should quit pestering those of us who own atomic bombs.
Come on, move, move, move, move!
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
You'd much rather have us happy and satisfied believe...
Smells like...
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
Was a little shoe shine, was a little shoe shine, was a little shoe shine.
Was a little shoe shine, was a little shoe shine, was a little shoe shine.
Baby, baby.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
There was a little man who ran a shoeshine stand.
And every day the man would swim.
Oh, yeah.
He walked her from the busy street.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He hadn't said a word.
Had anybody heard?
There was something in his face, a loneliness could not erase.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh well, baby.
baby
When his eyes met mine
he made a little wine
so he came
within an inch or two
and then he whispered
I hate you
I've got to 얼�re
And make yourself a king
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
How do they know?
How do they know?
How do they know?
How do they know?
For a long time I've been stuck in a corner
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It was a funny little monkey
And I knew what is funny
And it's a little game game
And sometimes it rages
I turn my mumps all around
And drag my monkey all around
I drag my monkey all around
I drag my monkey all around
I drag my monkey all around
I drag my monkey all around
I drag by monkey
I drag my monkey all around
I drag my monkey all around
Oh what a sweet little monkey
I drag by monkey
I drag my monkey all around


Oh what a sweet little monkey
I drag by monkey

Oh what a sweet little monkey
You know, I was faced with the most ..
You know on the holocaustal side
there were some real hardened warriors, actual soldiers, professional cops, soldiers, football players,
great, big, hairy, ugly, mean guys.
And the evangelical side, all we had was a few wimpy little B-spectacle guys like me
and a few beautiful, tall, Amazon, topless women.
He was totally surrounded by a full-on...
And so I figured that the only way to beat the Holocaustals was to lay some passive resistance on them.
And I built myself a turtle shell out of...
Bubble wrap.
Bubble wrap.
Bubble, bubble, bubble.
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.
Of untouchable security.
Bubble of untouchable security.
It does look kind of like the Michelin Man or the Pillsbury Doughboy.
Pillsbury Doughboy, that's what it reminds me of.
Yeah, it was one of the funniest things.
An average scene.
But I did not get hurt.
Yeah, right.
That was important.
The evangelical team did not technically lose.
Simply because no one won and nobody could tell who was on what team after the fighting started.
And as a visual timekeeper, I have to say that if we'd have gone two more minutes,
everybody would have been dead on both sides.
It's a perfect trap, Captain.
Who would suspect his own mother?
You'd better close your eyes.
I'm going to leave my child for a moment in order to be better in tune with the infinite.
It's all right.
You forgot.
He's a five-finger man.
He's a five-finger man.
Waiting in the sky.
He'd like to come and meet us.
But he thinks he'd blow our minds.
There was no clue to her species, but I loved her nonetheless.
I think she was...
So we're alone.
Love cult.
I've never used anything like that.
But the juvenile minds which you possess will not comprehend its strength until it's too late.
Puppies.
Puppies will put them to sleep.
Sleep.
Now they'll sleep.
God is a little man in a canoe.
Oh, no, it's a little man in a boat, I thought it was.
It's a man in a boat.
I'm asleep.

I bet you can't wait to hear what happens next.
Bob, Bob, Bob gave you another chance.
He gave us a chance to have a better idea of what tortures we would inflict on our,
and to increase our enemy list.
We have another year to build our hate for X-Day, 1999, Dos Equis.
That's right.
We have another year to build our love of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
We have another year to accumulate our ammunition.
We have another year to sharpen our knives.
By the time you get to the Christian heaven, you'll be wishing to God you'd made it to subgenius hell.
It's not a rehearsal, darling.
This is the last act of scene three.
I mean, if you go around one, you know.
Excuse me, let me turn the page here.
I said seven three.
I have been surrounded by murderers.

You guys to go out.





Listen up, stick to your son as kind of buyer.







る
You're a good dick, too.
What about you?
You!
That's what's going on with me.
I'll take you.
I hate you.
Go ahead and hit me, Anna.
But you like what I do, don't you?
I hate what you do.
I still like it and you know it.
Don't touch me ever again.
The whole history of humans, when you're looking at the landscape of time in the fourth dimension,
is this tiny little pinhole.
There's hardly anything at all.
Pinhole. Just a little pinhole.
One more. One more little light there.
And it is unusual that we now walk under a microscope look like Franks and Beans.
Billions and billions points of light.
Billions of little Franks and Beans on fire.
In my dream, the aliens, the top half of their head looked like the normal humanistic view of aliens.
But the bottom head was the chin of a monkey with a big goatee.
And he talked like this.
And they were wearing dandruff.
And they were beckoning me.
They had a lot of jewelry on and rouge and real wild lipstick.
And they looked, I don't know, a little too wanton and slutty for me.
But I walked over to the car and it turned out to be a car without wheels.
And then I noticed there was a car that wasn't even have a form.
Like it was immaterial.
I was gone.
Keep your eyes to the sky.
Keep your eyes skyward.
Look to the skies.
Look to the sky.
The sky.
The sky.
The sky.
The sky.
The sky is like iron.
Choo-choo will set your wings free.
Choo-choo will burn you down.
Dang it.
I said so.
I said so.
You're wearing a choo-choo.
It's time for the worms to ring again as we bring out the Johnny's Bachelor forest.
No rest of the gang down by the old National Art Park.
Let's say park ranger's not too happy tonight.
This swollen Mina comes back with a very, very bad case of gout.
Swollen Mina tonight is played by Carmen D'Angola.
The famous Mexican actress is also a star on stage, green television, radio, and down there.
So let's hope her career goes well here, even though we can hardly understand her,
with her extremely strange lip protrusion and the ailment.
But what's that, Donald? Let's get right down to it.
The first act of Ozark players sing, Mommy, Mommy, Don't Let Go.
How long have you been waiting, my son?
It's all ours.
From the moment we laid our fish, John,
at the first day we came here,
to this big, small tiny place we're standing on,
to the day that we clenched down into the ground
and lifted the dirt up to our eyes and said,
Look at this stuff we've got.
It's dirt, and it's our dirt.
And this land, which is our land, which we are on right now,
since the days when we first came here,
we went all out of caves in what we call the wellspring in the first cave,
which is actually not a real place, but a psycho-spiritual area.
We jumped out with our dirt.
We laid our fish, did your clothes on,
and did the chicken dance all night long.
Till two in the morning, we plucked and strutted,
and we fried ourselves in lard,
and sang the blues, and drank a pig,
a knuckle and a pork wine,
and a beer,
a whole bottle of wine.
Wow.
But now we're here, we're back to let you know
that jazz like shit, if you wanna dance this dance,
you gotta do this dance with me.
Or if you don't do this dance,
then we don't dance,
then you're not gonna dance with...
You know what he means.
Hey, Nonny Nonny.
She fell from the sky,
she fell very far.
You cannot petition the Lord with prayer!
Nobody gives a darn about this whole spatialism,
and they don't care.
And there was a time in our history
when America was really mad to go into outer space,
and to colonize other worlds,
and just like hang out there in different,
you know, where they ain't got no air and stuff.
And I don't know why they want to do that,
but I don't really care why they didn't want to do that neither,
but the idea of getting back here is that
greed is controlling this planet right now,
and materialism,
and nobody has them high aspirations
or perspirations no more.
They just don't seem to, uh,
want to push themselves to any kind of limit,
except for how many beers you can drink
and how many lates they can stay up,
and I don't know if I want to hang here myself much longer.
I've been thinking about...
Oh, Taz's telling me I'm really wanking off paddling.
I don't want to talk about nothing right now.
I don't feel very good,
because the bit's moving in my head,
and it was a long drive as usual,
and I have the same complaints all the time,
but I don't want to talk about that.
I want to talk about a space effort.
And if anybody wants to talk about the space effort in Spanish,
you'll have to forget about it,
because it's too late.
Now, if there are any people out there
who would like to make a spaceship
out of cardboard boxes and other things
they get when they dumpster it in bones and stuff,
we can all paint them up and put them on top of the hill,
just like the blueberry Fourth of July,
as special as we used to have.
We'd pretend we were spacemen.
We'd put them up on the top of the hill
and put little firecrackers underneath it.
Boom! Blow them off a log,
and we'd be landing on Mars.
Then we'd go out in the backyard
and bang up some glue.
Yeah, the redwoods and orchards would blow.
And we'd visit many other planets,
and we'd fall down and strike our heads.
You are listening to...
Einstein's...
Einstein's...
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
Is it a time for...
A nice, cold, refreshing glass...
Of salami?
Just put your teeth there on the rug.
Nobody, nobody, nobody minds. It's all right.
Oh, don't worry about Fifi.
With a little fur on the teeth.
She's gonna take it easy.
Fifi's just got a thallium.
So just relax and sit back and take...
Uh, well, whatever's left of Fifi.
But Fifi's thalliums.
Take another pill.
Take another pill.
Take another pill.
All right, Andy.
I'm getting completely stuck in a
ride.

Take another pill.
All right.
A deluxory of Malone with dementia and a disorientation of mood.
My love.
So take another pill.
You know it ain't gonna kill you.
Amen.
Do what's well.
When you take another pill.
Amen.
Stay away from that.
Window, window, window.
Future events such as these will affect you in the future.
The new, the filling of the new bowl.
This is a Pro-X Life shirt.
The Einstein Secret Orchestra.
Yes.
Will, will bring in the new year.
Zero minus one BX or something like that.
I'm fucking done.
Jesus just walked in.
Hey.
Hail Jesus.
Hail Jesus.
Hail Mary Magdalene.
This is so scary because the person can wake up screaming.
The blessings on your old hometown.
Cleveland lost Jesus.
Hello, this is the Lord.
It's Jesus on the phone.
Oh, Lord bless us.
We are stupid right now.
We're blessed.
Jesus, you saw me.
You saw me.
You're the only one I think that saw me.
A Tesla.
It's a Tesla.




We're going to start building our own ships.
Yeah, I did.
I thought those were beautiful.
I thought those were missiles.
I thought those were to take down the Yakutism, I guess, if they came.
No, it's just my, I have a goal.
But I want to put two pounds and 200 miles up by the year 2000.
Oh, so those were the test ships.
Yeah.
The subgenius.
That must be why they didn't have any parachutes and they rocketed straight into the ground.
They were supposed to go straight into the sun.
or Bob is waiting for us in his solar kingdom.
Well, they're either going to have to become bigger
or we're going to have to become smaller,
but they were beautiful.
They were beautiful test flights.
Yeah.
We're well on our way.
We'll work on it.
Okay.
I have to go, but I do give a blessing upon you
and the great studio, WCSB.
Give our greetings to Mary Magdalene as well.
Okay.
She has something in her mouth right now, but I will...
I'm sure she does.
The world has officially come to a startling halt.
Time has actually stopped at 7 a.m. July 5th, 1998.
Time has stopped.
Sooner than you think.
So we lower Dobbs into the ground.
And there's the rest of the Dobbs family
standing very close to the carillon.
I'm wearing a...
I'm wearing a very...
I'm wearing a black tight-sheet outfit
that shows her hips off to the best advantage
and she's looking very...
Little John John and Bob Bob bob their heads.
Little baby Connie.
Their father is laid into rest.
Little Nathan is...
They throw the little roses on top of the casket.
They throw the little John Benet in as well
and all the servants and pets.
And it looks like someone's...
It's a great tomb.
All the jewelry.
The huge blinking neon eye
on the top of the pyramid-shaped tomb lights up.
It's beginning to wriggle now.
It's starting to vibrate.
There it goes.
Hello.
Come on, baby.
We have lived off the Dobbs tomb
containing all the failed prophecies of Dobbs
now rises up into the sky.
Death is for its new home in the heart of the sun.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
It's like they think it's eating the planet.
I think it is.
150 million years is no guarantee of survival.
But they were all protected by the soft machine team, sir.
How can you complain?

Sun cult.
Un-cult.
P cult.

Third eye.
Third nostril. Third earring.
Falling ball slash

I only know I must be brave.
And I must face a man who hates me.
Hates me.

Until next week, keep your hat on tight.
You're back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.
Yee-haw.
Happy trails to you.
I'm gonna go change diapers.
We're gonna see you stuffed with trigger.
Your place is so cattle now.
I like it when you talk like that.
Oh, no.
Not so.
I'm gonna go get you a bottle of...
No.
No.
I don't...
I can't use that.

And if you wake up in the morning,
We'll be off!
The Portuguese sailor under your bed,
singing in strange voices,
and crying with pieces of lead,
you know he's discovered the wrong things.
He's gone the wrong way in the stray.
He's visited the witches of Absalom
and laid beside their glimpses.
He put his nose in the air one night
and said, I smell the fish.
But he was a million miles out to sea,
and now he's a porcupine's dish.
His breasts were ripped asunder
and sent to the seven winds.
The four quarters gave him his last revenge,
and that's what I said I did.
Amen, brother.
It was not even obscure, that stupid.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh!
Hell yeah.
Workin' hard on him this year.
He's called Bouda.
He's awięksing to the
