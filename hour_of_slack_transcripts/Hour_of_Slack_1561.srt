1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
Now, what about beer?

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,660
All I want to business is the subgenius power of beer.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, my dear friends, welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry number 1076.

4
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,820
I think that's what it is.

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,820
It's hard to tell because we're in the throes of time control.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,660
Yes, I've been pulling the levers on the way back archival tape machines

7
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,120
and digitizing ancient epic media barrages

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,640
and, uh, subgenius power.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:47,640


10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,920
Subgenius convention assemblages, collages, epics.

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,440
As we delve further into the history of the Church of the Subgenius,

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,180
the first 100 years, this is being done initially

13
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,240
for the ongoing MaybeLogic.org online course,

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,360
but it is also being done for the grander glory

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,220
of a later book, DVD set, I suppose,

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,680
and, uh, yes, yes, yes,

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,260
we've been learning so many things that we forgot

18
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,020
and so many more that we never knew.

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,320
It's interesting and inspiring to hear the fervor of the early doctors.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,500
And in this particular episode, friends,

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,540
we're going to slide back in time

22
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,860
into an admixture of the 1982 World Subgenius Convention in Chicago,

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,560
where the...

24
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,720
where the head was launched,

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,980
where the church was taken over by the women,

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,240
the Connie Tights,

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,860
and, uh, in fact, the head was launched onto the roof of the building next door

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,460
and then rescued later from the wino's nest

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,820
by Buck Naked and some poor retarded girl

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,120
that he had picked up that weekend.

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,360
Friends, friends, it's exciting.

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,560
It's deadly. It's dangerous.

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,820
It actually was dangerous,

34
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,320
and it's surprising that so many of us survived.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,860
Quite a few didn't.

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,440
And so, let us pull the lever and go back, back,

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,540
back now into the past.

38
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,700
When will you believe?

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,320
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,020
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

41
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:41,080
This tape is copyright 1982 by the Subgenius Foundation.

42
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,120
Uh, the first step is that you make the art.

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,880
The second step is that you, uh,

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,380
you, uh, mail the art somewhere.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,440
And then, uh, you, uh,

46
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,400
you, uh, destroy the art in the mail.

47
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,500
And then, you, uh, claim it on your chance.

48
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,400
CKR Bob Dobbs!

49
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,580
It's come now to us!

50
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,080
CKR Bob Dobbs!

51
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,080


52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,440
It's given us some true wisdom!

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,200
I say, fellas, I say!

54
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,100
Make the art, destroy the art, claim the art.

55
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:34,320
You will, you will make much more of that art piece than you would have in any other way.

56
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,660
Don't you think it would be a good idea for you to turn the radio on?

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,080
Turn the machine on.

58
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,600
Turn the machine on!

59
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,320
Turn the machine on!

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,280
Turn the machine on!

61
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,100
Well, it is a beautiful world out there.

62
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,760
It is a beautiful world out there, all right.

63
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,900
Take, for instance, the city of Chicago earlier this month.

64
00:03:51,060 --> 00:04:00,320
It was filled to overflowing with Wookiees, Warlocks, and Japanese robots as thousands flocked to the annual World Science Fiction Convention at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.

65
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:09,340
But at the cheaper hotel across the street, a group of people too weird for most science fiction fans to comprehend were holding a little convention of their own.

66
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,440
These wackos call themselves the First Church of the Subgenius.

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,100
And they include, in their, to say the least, eccentric membership ...

68
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,400
Bob .

69
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,160
What do they believe in? Everything.

70
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,620
Who do they believe in?

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,640
A mysterious character named Bob.

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,080
I'm sorry I hadn't time for social obligations.

73
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,740
There is another world.

74
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,560
Who are they winning souls for, Satan or Jesus?

75
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,120
We are not, then, alone in our battle.

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,000
Indeed, how bob, hey.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,420
The rise and fall of Atlantis, the erections of pyramids and other mamluks,

78
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,420


79
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,580
monuments seen here, which no slopeheads could build alone.

80
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,420
Oh, here they are now, the miracles of the Old Testament.

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,500
And all these and more events are strictly interwoven

82
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,620
in the invisible background war

83
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,800
between Jehovah and the exes.

84
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,220
Here we see on hand the barbarian.

85
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,140
Yes, it's true.

86
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,980
The subgenius convention is in a hotel in Chicago

87
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,800
at this very moment.

88
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,360
They cannot get into the hotel.

89
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,780
It started off as an innocent convention.

90
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,380
It has turned into the last holdout of the subgenius.

91
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,200
We're taking over these mics.

92
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,120
We're taking over.

93
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,320
We've got both heads in custody.

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,880
We have both heads.

95
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:21,960
Both heads.

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,580
Both heads.

97
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,620
Can we get these to go?

98
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,540
We're not giving them to him.

99
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,960
This is a patriarchy.

100
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,340
No.

101
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,480
We have the heads.

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:29,920
We have both heads.

103
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,060
Until we get all nine demands, both heads

104
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,580
are not returned to this room.

105
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,120
No heads for both heads.

106
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,520
Nobody.

107
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,540
Shut that music off.

108
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,160
Put your hands on the radio.

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,080
Put your hands.

110
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,160
Put your hands on the radio.

111
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,660
A family doctor says you're just fine,

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,020
but you feel so down all the time.

113
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,560
Well, people, you don't have to worry.

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,760
The job is a lie.

115
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,360
Send your money in on reserve.

116
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,840
Don't worry.

117
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
It's deductible.

118
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,800
Well, people, you can forget your sins or forget your troubles.

119
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,740
Put your hands.

120
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,760
Put your hands on the radio.

121
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,380
Put your hands on the radio.

122
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,600
Put your hands on the radio.

123
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,200
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer has come to redeem us.

124
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,340
And I'm here to say that I don't want any more beer.

125
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,920
This next convention, we're going to have

126
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,580
Kia, gin, vodka, mixers.

127
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,940
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer is the only thing that matters.

128
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,760
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer is the only thing that matters.

129
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,260
All that we can comprehend.

130
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
And there's the head.

131
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,800
I can see it now.

132
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,020
A moment of supreme power.

133
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,460
Okay, you're doing great.

134
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,200
We're standing over the head now.

135
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,900
And I just picked it up by the neck.

136
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,220
I'm holding it up.

137
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,540
Would you give it a kiss, please?

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,860
She kissed it.

139
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,300
She kissed the forgotten head that nobody else wanted.

140
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,880
All right.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,840
She patted its head, scratched its hair.

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,740
We have a forgotten head.

143
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,120
It's ours.

144
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,600
Master Bucknaker places the pipe, the sacred bob pipe,

145
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,740
the white, broad-necked bob pipe in the lips of the head.

146
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,140
And we take off.

147
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,340
As the tiny dog looks on in the calm, calm place,

148
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,500
Dr. Moneycutt likes the tiny, calm, and calm.

149
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:34,820
I'm a zombie!

150
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,460
I'm a zombie!

151
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,740
I'm a zombie!

152
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,320
That's what you and me shall inherit when I have a something as base as mine!

153
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,160
As one day, as the 스�لك나�ר told in Bob Eccles's first speech after 26th hvor

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,020
we shall know that indeed2 Doctors for Bob shall be as one, and they shall leak their

155
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
minds.

156
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,460
And, Doctors for Watch Guns, Sally Merge, Victorious Doctor for Bob shall become

157
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,960
one and all as an ordered water power!

158
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Looking away!

159
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,420
The story told in Bob Ecclesian, verse 3, chapter 26.

160
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,360
Lo, ye shall know that indeed, doctors for Bob shall be as one, and they shall leak their minds.

161
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,780
And doctors for Wotan, Sally Merge, victorious doctors for Bob shall become one and all, and have an honor and power.

162
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:16,760
And the individuals make up the separate alignments which he and Yellman together in doctors for Wotan shall align themselves to become one and all.

163
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:46,740
And the individuals make up the separate alignments which he and Yellman together in doctors for Wotan shall become one and all, and have an honor and power.

164
00:08:46,760 --> 00:09:08,460
And the individuals make up the separate alignments which he and Yellman together in doctors for Wotan shall become one and all, and have an honor and power.

165
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,460
The problem becomes one of mission.

166
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:31,700
The sleazy reality of the present sub-com has, I'm afraid, sunk the entire group into a morass instead of a prophecy crusade.

167
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:40,520
The Church of the Subgenius was an order of scoffers and blasphemers dedicated to total slack, delving into mockery science, state of futuristics, megaphysics, scatology, and all.

168
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,320
Got the picture? No? Well, let's try it again.

169
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,520
The Church of the Subgenius.

170
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,680
The Church of the Subgenius is the single most important organization of the 20th century.

171
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,440
Oh, there's one now.

172
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,960
A person asking somebody to kill him now.

173
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,380
Don't forget, the launching scene here of the bleeding head of the World Cup golfer, a sacred relic long in the possession of Jane and Hyperclean.

174
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,480
Yes, I know, Doug.

175
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,340
The Megaphis Temple lodged with...

176
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,180
Sit down, Doug. Sit down.

177
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,160
The Church of the Subgenius in Little Rock, the head was temporarily captured in mid-81 by a rival band of Trevinoists,

178
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,100
the developers of the false pretender to the World Cup, and the Palmer-Trevinoist War still rages at this very moment.

179
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:29,000
In fact, we have heard conspiracy rumors that the head might be, at some point during the convention, kidnapped by rogue subgeniuses.

180
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,460
You think John Kennedy was killed?

181
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,240
Ha ha ha.

182
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,420
Why do you think he went to Dallas?

183
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,220
Well, so it seemed.

184
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,440
He needed to join the Church and disappear forever and become a drunk living in Dealey Plaza.

185
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,940
It was the only way to gain his freedom.

186
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,580
A small price to pay for losing your groceries in the high noon sun of Dallas.

187
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,100
As my thoughts swing...

188
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,820
Word and in word.

189
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,720
I was born again and Bob made sure I died again and now I've been born a third time.

190
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,540
Born thrice.

191
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,360
So the rumors were true.

192
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,680
By the women.

193
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,820
By the women.

194
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,700
What'd you have to do to?

195
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,560
Praise Barbara.

196
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,460
I think, I think he's dead.

197
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,540
Let's change the prop again.

198
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,880
I'm telling you what kind of dimension we're gonna find ourselves in when our eyes clear from all this coughing.

199
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,360
This is the drug, I think.

200
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,300
Yeah, it is. I feel my head expanding.

201
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,520
Try and sit down. We're probably still just in the corridor.

202
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,260
Oh. Where are we?

203
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,740
This is the bathroom.

204
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,180
Yeah, big bathroom.

205
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,040
Who's that?

206
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,860
I can't tell. It just changes.

207
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,820
Look, look at that.

208
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,020


209
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,700
Listen.

210
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,640
It's the slap squat.

211
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,460
Hey, that's the slap squat, isn't it?

212
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,580
I can't talk.

213
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,840
I can't talk.

214
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,180
I can't hear.

215
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,340
Oh, what's going on?

216
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,580
Are we back, are we back down in that control room, she thinks?

217
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,400
It's the drug.

218
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,100
I know it's the drug.

219
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,700
I can hear that music.

220
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,940
I don't hear anything.

221
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,140
You don't hear music?

222
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,780
No, I hear, I hear voices.

223
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,340
Focus on Bob.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,940
Try to imagine that your body is made of syrup.

225
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,840
Oh, count backwards from 83.

226
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,120
And then, you may now take your pill.

227
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,460
It reflects what we're feeling. Try to relax.

228
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,140
Okay.

229
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,460
They're not shooting at us.

230
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,800
No.

231
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,480
This is all the drug, right?

232
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,860
Uh-huh, this is the drug.

233
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,280
This is all just the drug.

234
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,140
Are you sure?

235
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,720
I am.

236
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,160
Who, you ask? Who is J.R. Pop Dox?

237
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,560
Who is it?

238
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,200
J.R. Pop Dox.

239
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,720
Well, see, what you gotta understand is like, Bob is not super intelligent.

240
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,840
In fact, he's a complete fuck-up.

241
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,400
But every time he fucks up, he makes a million bucks!

242
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,420
This is a restricted area.

243
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,220
If you need help, a man sent in to take this.

244
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,800
No, it's the drug.

245
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,640
He's speaking of the drug.

246
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,880
Oh, man.

247
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,340
Oh.

248
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,280
This is a restricted area.

249
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,760
This is something that we need to leave.

250
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,420
This is a second telling.

251
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,540
This is a second telling.

252
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,100
Oh, shit.

253
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,800
This is the drug.

254
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,580
This is something that we need to leave.

255
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,520
If you get to Dobbs town in time, it will happen there, and you won't want to miss it.

256
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:27,920
Here...

257
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,280
I know that, Frank.

258
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,560
We've been singing that song for the last 10 years, but it can happen here.

259
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,380
In fact, while you weren't looking, it did happen here.

260
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:35,680
Hi.

261
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,060
Hi.

262
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,860
Just drop the phone.

263
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,500
You're going to get it.

264
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:37,740
Let's go.

265
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,300
You can't stop.

266
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,080
Let's go.

267
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,420
Let's go.

268
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:42,700


269
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,980
Get out of here.

270
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,000
Get out of here.

271
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,440
Get out of here.

272
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:45,520


273
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:45,520


274
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:45,520


275
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:45,520


276
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:45,520


277
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:45,820
Bob!

278
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,920
You may risk becoming a weird Bob.

279
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,040
At this point we go to the subgenius convention.

280
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,400
We are live now. If you'll watch the monitor you will be seeing

281
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,420
Guy Duell, Doug Smith and assorted other subgeniuses speaking.

282
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,220
We can see them there and before.

283
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,440
There have been rumors that the conspiracy wishes to interrupt the proceedings here.

284
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,760
We hope that there will be no such interruption.

285
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,000
The subgenius heads are now answering questions from the floor.

286
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,380
Right, exactly. They're trying to cover...

287
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,360
They didn't want us to go about left and right brain to begin with.

288
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,720
Or the forebrain or the hindbrain.

289
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
These are the assorted holy doves.

290
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,600
We just recently found out that exes do have four brains.

291
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,180
They have four brains that can work...

292
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,560
This proof is available in the rear of the convention area.

293
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,060
Up and down as well.

294
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,740
Nobody wants to see it.

295
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,340
That's why they do not see it.

296
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,180
That's in their physical form which resides on planet X at all times.

297
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,180
We're not defeating them. We're wheeling and dealing with them.

298
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,040
That's what Bob's for.

299
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,840
Why defeat them when you can't make a deal?

300
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,180
He's holding up one of four brains of the aliens.

301
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,600
He has a brain encased in lucite that is left of the world.

302
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,260
The left of the screen.

303
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,380
That is an alien brain that he has hold on to.

304
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,500
Whatever we're...

305
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,260
There's President Zandi in the background.

306
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,640
Asking for his mother or father but they're so involved in it.

307
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,200
There's a problem.

308
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,600
They do not see this at all.

309
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,580
They just like the aliens.

310
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,820
Here come the tiny subdued elves marching around on the back of the stage.

311
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,860
They're the ones in the funny color.

312
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,500
They're gone now.

313
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,540
They disappeared just like that.

314
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,020
That's it.

315
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,400
Bob has harmony.

316
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,240
Bob has harmony.

317
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,680
Bob has slack.

318
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
Answering questions now from the floor.

319
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,300
Bob has slack and even the Elder God...

320
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,960
Dallas Doug Smith.

321
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,900
...have trouble getting slack.

322
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,100
Yeah, they can't fight that.

323
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,440
We are in that respect, we are equal to the gods.

324
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,640
Guy Duel using one of his rifles to push a...

325
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,540
That's the part of it.

326
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,160
...the God that's in every man that you read about in the Gnostic scripts and everything.

327
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,700
Subdued windows, holy stained glass windows.

328
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,620
The battleground of the gods is in us.

329
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:50,640


330
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,200
The gods are fighting out there.

331
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,220
It seems that somebody has thrown a tape he didn't like through the stained glass window in the church in the subdued years.

332
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,420
...the Elder God.

333
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,400
But that thing can be replaced in just a moment.

334
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,200
There are two heads.

335
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,280
And now there are two heads.

336
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,640
There's a second, a tiny head and a big head.

337
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,360
No, with the head, that is the false head.

338
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,600
The only real head is the bronze head.

339
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,520
Sure, you can be...

340
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,680
You've been bowing down to a false prophet.

341
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
And those lucky enough to be fated to be in.

342
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,020
Doctors for Odin, me, Doctors for Bob.

343
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,320
Consider yourself thrice blessed.

344
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,040
For it shall be your salvation.

345
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,720
And now I guess I'd rather be smoking dope than Florida than down here working.

346
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,980
But what the heck, I think this is the most important thing that has ever happened to you in your life.

347
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,280
What is happening now is a whole different...

348
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,420
Never ever be this stupid.

349
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:04,920
Never.

350
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,480
...see heroin again in the...

351
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,180
...in the...

352
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,400
...in the...

353
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,540
...in the...

354
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,180
...adi 09

355
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,180


356
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,780
... aroma up my...

357
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:11,780


358
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:11,780


359
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,440
And they just thought that if I out those' in the...

360
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,760
...and used this dope on my body, then I'd put to sleep or something...

361
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,100
probably go back to...

362
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:22,760
And smoking dope down in Florida, if I had an opportunity to, any place, any substance that might, I don't know, work...

363
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,260
God, that was just one of the most violent drug sequences I think I've ever had.

364
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,100
Look at that.

365
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,900
It's just fading right back in.

366
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,540
All the body parts are just dissolving.

367
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,480
That's amazing.

368
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,640
And there's not even all gone yet.

369
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,700
We've still got some here.

370
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,880
I think I know just what to do with that.

371
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,160
Well, look, what about these girls you keep telling me about?

372
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,740
Bob has just all kinds of little groupies and everything.

373
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,980
Something's happening here.

374
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:05,840
The women...

375
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,740
Somebody's taking over.

376
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,920
God, dissidents and subjugations have just taken over the convention.

377
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,700
A group of women have just stormed the stage.

378
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,380
They're trying...

379
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,000
They're trying...

380
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,620
They're trying...

381
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:18,680
They're trying...

382
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,740
They're trying to take over the...

383
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,560
They have to have nine demands.

384
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,220
They've stolen the head.

385
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,660
Until we get all nine demands, both heads are not returned to this room.

386
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,920
No heads for nobody.

387
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,060
It looks like a group of women have stolen the bleeding heads of Arnold Palmer and are now...

388
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,440
Two audience mics.

389
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,360
They're reading their demands.

390
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,680
Bob's jackstrapped.

391
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,700
Bob's jackstrapped.

392
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,580
Male sacrifice.

393
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,880
Male sacrifice.

394
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,580
Round of chili dogs.

395
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,380
No head.

396
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,600
No head.

397
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,600
Dick of Bob.

398
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:47,900
Dick of Bob.

399
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,240
Dick!

400
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,900
Dick of Bob!

401
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,180
Dick of Bob!

402
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,280
Dick facts a 12 year old dancing boy.

403
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,980
That request surprised dog or something so much he crashed into the side of the convention hall.

404
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,400
Male, man!

405
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,360
We have to hit!

406
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,100
No head!

407
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,700
No head!

408
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,580
No head!

409
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,220
No head!

410
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,800
No head!

411
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,840
No head!

412
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,520
No head! No head! No head! No head! No head!

413
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Something has happened in the motorcase.

414
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,640
Yes, I believe I can see Arnold Palmer showing up.

415
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,360
You mean he's alive?

416
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,040
Something did happen. No, he's not alive.

417
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,940
Temporarily?

418
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,340
I'm most honored at this point to say that we will be going to camera one on the floor live,

419
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,380
and we'll be catching the decapitation of Arnold Palmer.

420
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,160
This is Arnold Palmer.

421
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,000
Hi, golfers.

422
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,640
Ah!

423
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,140
Illusions. All illusions.

424
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:05,980
That is Buck.

425
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,980
Yeah, he shaved.

426
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,460
He shaved.

427
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,400
He lost all his hair with the radio.

428
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,880
This is funny.

429
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,120
We're walking in a third person.

430
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,480
Yeah, yeah.

431
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,340
I said to each other, I'm not walking.

432
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,000
He was just saying, the strangers among us are great holy men, and we will do whatever.

433
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,860
I said, I'm not walking.

434
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,360
I'm walking on a chunk of tar.

435
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,900
Wait a minute.

436
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,560
Hold on.

437
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,160
Hold on, friends.

438
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,000
Hold on.

439
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:34,220
Bob said, before this convention started, he said, if any of these cheap bobbies, these

440
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:42,400
immature, pit-eye, pink-splanned subgenius types come out here and blaspheme my sweet

441
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,840
name.

442
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,080
Then pee on my head.

443
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,400
Yeah, that's beautiful.

444
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,960
Those are worth, well...

445
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,440
There's no prize for them, yeah.

446
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,260
Nobody knows about them.

447
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,100
Look at them.

448
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,760
Good thing they don't.

449
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,260
These old Malaysian guys are just gonna...

450
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,840
Lost in time of pee...

451
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,360
That chief has like sixteen different navigational computers.

452
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,680
Look at that!

453
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,440
We'll show you what's still in there.

454
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:12,820
What is that?

455
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:12,820


456
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:12,820


457
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:12,820


458
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:12,820


459
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:12,820


460
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:12,820


461
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,360
Stourneau said you guys were going to build a catapult, but I guess that didn't happen.

462
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,020
Who was going to carry it?

463
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:29,320
Who knows? That's another plan like Wellman's cardboard limousine for dealing claws over.

464
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:37,040
I have a foreign distraction and have a madly memory of the great and terrible huge subject.

465
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,700
I beg to give one of my bitty eyes. I might give it all to the poor old boy.

466
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
They have this thing where they cut their nipples off.

467
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,080
No more sweetness in life, bullfish and catapult. The only answer is hot lead.

468
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,320
Eat a lot of lead or kill me.

469
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,380
When they say or kill me, that means you're going to die.

470
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,760
That's it. That's what it really means.

471
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,860
When Dan Hart says open the door or kill me, you better open the door.

472
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,460
Or try to kill me while I'm protected by the...

473
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,740
Mark the code for the spiral.

474
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,900
Has Jane ever showed you that sort of stigmata on his back where the blood spatters?

475
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,820
Oh man, I've seen... I've seen...

476
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,620
I've seen Jane's body. I hate it. I hate that things really exist.

477
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,240
I've seen him go flopping around on the ground and have little things run out of his mouth.

478
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:33,440
I've seen heliopters, like little ones with heliopters fly around and get his way, his way, his way.

479
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,600
Yeah, just come out of a psychic ether.

480
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,920
Yeah, just a little miracle.

481
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,100
Yeah, just a little furry onesie.

482
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,000
Doctors calling Doctors for Bob. Calling Doctors for Bob.

00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,880

Doctors for Bob news from the Doctors for Bob show. Available only from the Doctors for Bob.

488
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,300
We now present Doctors...

489
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
Doctors for Bob. Doctors for Bob.

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,140
You're wanted in the Smith Jones reality wrap incision vision room.

491

You're wanted...

500
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
The

501
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:57,400
Thank you very much backside!

502
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,100
Good Horrible!

503
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,460
Good Horrible!

504
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,100
All because of Me.

505
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,780
I can't believe this.

506
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,200
You cut, you want to talk murder.

507
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,640
Everybody wants to talk murder.

508
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,780
God.

509
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,820
We're just faithless.

510
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,620
In all the times Dolphins played,

511
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,380
it is unlikely that we have ever had a champion or a foe

512
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,840
who could move the chances out so well

513
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,880
and was so little afraid of taking them.

514
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,960
And will Arnold Palmer decide to take a few chances in politics?

515
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,840
Yeah, Arnold, what's this?

516
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,580
What are the skills that he has in that kind of a career next?

517
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,900
Follow the balance.

518
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,900
That bleeding head.

519
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,500
The is-ness of the head.

520
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,720
The is-ness and the what-ness and the all-ness

521
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,060
and the whole being.

522
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,680
A generous sprinkling whiskey on the guy.

523
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,040
Yeah.

524
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,460
Covering the guy with whiskey.

525
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:00,980
He's drinking it.

526
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,420
That solution.

527
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,600
He's rubbing it.

528
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,240
Yeah.

529
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,260
He's got the blood.

530
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:04,460
Yeah.

531
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,800
He's got the problem.

532
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,080
He's got the problem.

533
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,640
He's rubbing the drop juice around the man's being annoyed.

534
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,160
But the man doesn't.

535
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,940
He's falling.

536
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,760
And when the head is falling, then I say,

537
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,540
Ha, ha, ha.

538
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,580
No head, neither head.

539
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,240
Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have anything else to go on screen right now.

540
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,640
We have to keep these people on screen.

541
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,120
I know that you are amazing.

542
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,700
No head, neither head.

543
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,580
Oh, now Sandy is upset.

544
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
President Sandy, upset in the background,

545
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,540
trying, attempting to scale the head.

546
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,640
19,000-foot head.

547
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,740
The convention has been disrupted by this renegade group.

548
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,240
This has to be as amazing as the attempted assassination of Bob late last year.

549
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,720
The groups have become as manageable.

550
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,120
Um.

551
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,880
Now the cities are together.

552
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,960
Trying to tell one head from the other at this point.

553
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,180
There's heads everywhere.

554
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,100
I mean, we've got no leadership at all.

555
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,440
Right.

556
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,860
You can well imagine the usual situation.

557
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,620
Right.

558
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,940
Bleeding head good, real head good.

559
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,360
We'll give it up.

560
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,720
We're just going to see if we can break these loose

561
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,740
and get them into the Gulf, the whole state.

562
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,200
There'll be a record inside, a little record,

563
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,320
so that you can play it and hear the songs and the prayers

564
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,840
and the beautiful rituals and hymns to Bob and the screams.

565
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,140
I see.

566
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,340
And there will be proof of UFOs and that kind of thing.

567
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:58,800
Yeah.

568
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,340
What about the Subcon 2 that was held recently in Chicago?

569
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,380
Could you tell us exactly what happened with the bleeding?

570
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:06,780
Oh, yeah.

571
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,540
Yeah, sure.

572
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,680
The World Subgenius Convention 1982 was held in Chicago.

573
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,540
And the bleeding head of the World Cup golfer was launched.

574
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:24,300
Arnold's face spun through the air and landed on the building of the roof of the building next door.

575
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,060
So the world won't be coming to an end this year.

576
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,580
And the summer will last a little longer.

577
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
I think it's already over.

578
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:38,680
But the problem is, I don't know if you guys knew this,

579
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,240
but the women of the church of the subgenius overthrew the patriarch.

580
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,260
It's like, I don't even know why you're talking to me.

581
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,560
You ought to be talking to the great master of dominatrix, someone else,

582
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,520
who's downstairs in your throne chamber of exclamation.

583
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,800
And waiting for me to fix her a cup of coffee.

584
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,100
I see.

585
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,640
I see.

586
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,160
Seriously, the women overthrew the patriarchy of the church.

587
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,940
You showed that on film.

588
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,400
At this point, it's all just a sham.

589
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,780
I mean, us popes and high-end predictables can pretend all we want.

590
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,780
But you have the panier.

591
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,340
I'm going to babysit tonight, you know what I mean?

592
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:18,800
I see.

593
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,120
I see.

594
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,860
How has the church changed due to this new development?

595
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,000
I couldn't play.

596
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,560
I mean, the day-to-day life of the church.

597
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,580
Bob's dead and Bob Rose is taking command.

598
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,660
Yeah, I see.

599
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,780
Bob's not really dead.

600
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,760
He just lived.

601
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,740
But because you can't kill that witch.

602
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,380
He's now running in the back of the limousine.

603
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,600
Flames, but...

604
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,780
You know, it's real confusing on this end, just as much as it is on your end, as you can well imagine.

605
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,120
It's always been that way.

606
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,700
If you'll notice, one of the first gigantic shows we had there in Dallas, the first one we put on,

607
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,460
Jackie was not hit, and yet Jack was.

608
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,460
Of course, we in Puzzled Evidence have the actual photographs of Jackie being hit.

609
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,260
She was, of course, hit, and there was an argument between people in the car.

610
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,700
Yeah, as I understand, she was climbing over, getting onto the back of the car to make herself a better target,

611
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,640
that noble, noble woman.

612
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,100
No, she was scrambling for a piece of her brain.

613
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,360
It was shot out.

614
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,540
And see, she got her brain, but we didn't.

615
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,740
Dallas is a friendly town, and we'll try to cooperate with the snipers here.

616
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,240
We need the...

617
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,040
We need the trade.

618
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,980
We need the people coming in, and of course, the hotels are all set up now.

619
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,720
You don't have to use school book buildings, warehouses, anything like that.

620
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,500
You can work right out of your hotel room.

621
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,760
Okay, and I just want to...

622
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,060
A note to local callers.

623
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,800
We do see that you're on the board right now.

624
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,600
It's just that we want to complete this satellite call while the satellite's in the arc, and we'll get to you as soon as possible.

625
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,360
Oh, hi.

626
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,020
Thanks.

627
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,460
Yes.

628
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,780
Oh, we have more people there.

629
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,020
Hello.

630
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,960
This is who from Dallas?

631
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,180
Oh, hello.

632
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,100
How are you doing, JR?

633
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,240
I'm doing all right.

634
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,440
Doug, are you still with us?

635
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,740
Yeah.

636
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,400
Oh, okay.

637
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,560
We've got a conference call here.

638
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,060
JR wants to talk to you.

639
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,680
JR, go ahead and speak to Bob.

640
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,420
Bob.

641
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,040
Bob.

642
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,760
How are you doing?

643
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,820
All right.

644
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,040
Yeah, you said Dallas was a slow town?

645
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,480
Slow?

646
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,880
No, nice little town.

647
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,240
Yeah, Dallas is a nice little hamlet, yeah.

648
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,240
Dallas is a money town.

649
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,140
I want you to know that.

650
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,520
Money.

651
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,180
Well, we know that, and...

652
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,600
Why do you think I'm here, Daddy-O?

653
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,540
This is the money town for any religious cult worth its salt.

654
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,200
I'll tell you.

655
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:24,600
All right.

656
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,780
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

657
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,780
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

658
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,200
It's a sunny moment and you feel it low.

659
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,900
You get hurt all over and you're moving so well.

660
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,560
People, here's something that you should know.

661
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,100
Tune us in on the radio, Dad.

662
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,680
We got charisma, we got style.

663
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,000
Well, people, we'll make you feel better for a while.

664
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:54,800
All right.

665
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,500
Put your hands, Put your hands on the radio!

666
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,540
Put your hands, Put your hands on the radio!

667
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,360
And here we are

668
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:22,940
at

669
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,320
the

670
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,340
Saggenius

671
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,100
convention, the World Subgenius Conclave.

672
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,540
Next year I think they'll be called the World Subgenius Party

673
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,840
because the Subwinis have pretty much

674
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,480
given up, I believe, according to spokesmen on the organizational idea.

675
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
That's the maids, the hotel maids here at the Radisson.

676
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,360
Bob just walked by just a few seconds ago.

677
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,860
We didn't get him on camera. I understand.

678
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,020
That is to be expected.

679
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,480
Oh, they're talking. There's Bob.

680
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,520
Bob's new health clinics are coming out

681
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,560
pretty soon. I think we should be seeing them in most major cities.

682
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,360
You've already seen the ads. The conventioneers are in the background

683
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,760
fighting.

684
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,560
Some having fun. Almost all of them drunk.

685
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,720
In some way.

686
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,600
It was

687
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,460
so far the convention has been much like

688
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,940
the first convention for the 15th. There seems to be

689
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,320
no... Here we are on camera 7. You can see some of the rituals starting up.

690
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,320
Some of the reporters

691
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,940
are...

692
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,380
Not all of the reporters have the security clearance that I do.

693
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,540
Being as I am a publicity manager

694
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,660
for doctors and Bob.

695
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,840
How about that's a heavy one.

696
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,440
Okay, here's a heavy one. This one's real heavy.

697
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,740
Jerome Palmer taught his sons to be more than just a good golfer.

698
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,340
A good golfer also had to be a certain kind of man.

699
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,160
In high school, for example, Arnie learned a very important lesson.

700
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,360
He missed a shot in the junior match.

701
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,320
He was very, very angry. Arnie's face turned

702
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,220
red and he picked up his golf and threw it over a bunch of trees.

703
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,720
Everyone who is observing us has fled.

704
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,560
They weren't listening to the words. That's the problem. Don't pay attention.

705
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,080
They think they've got to get in some damn hell ritual

706
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,240
or some kind of ritual or musical rhythm.

707
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,300
And they don't listen to the words at all.

708
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,580
Oh hell, their minds on dancing.

709
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,340
They want to dance. That's exactly it.

710
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,760
They don't want to lighten it. They want to move their damn feet.

711
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,800
Beer dancing. Your modern day sex.

712
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,140
Faithless. Faithless generation.

713
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,340
Universal creation. Self genocide.

714
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,400
They have to see a miracle for proof.

715
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,300
They demand proof.

716
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,280
Bob demands that we create those miracles.

717
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:13,820
Yeah!

718
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,180
But Mr. Palmer,

719
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
What can we do?

720
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,280
Hey!

721
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:25,640
Bob couldn't stop the aliens from killing me.

722
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,980
Bob can't save me.

723
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
But will he?

724
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,500
Don't count on it, Buc.

725
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,720
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,

726
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,500
Dobbsey, Dobsey, Dobbsey, Dobsey, Dobs.

727
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,060
What is right in Bob's head?

728
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,600
there for me

729
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,140
Bye

730
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,020
Alphabets, of these alphabets

731
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,840
Alphabets

732
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,340
Doctor's perfect

733
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,400
Doctor's perfect

734
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,740
For everything real

735
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,940
In my life

736
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,580
In my life

737
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,440
I go black

738
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,560
The damn pickup didn't

739
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,620
Run over my wife

740
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,020
Doctor's perfect

741
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,380
That want that pick-up truck

742
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,040
On Friday

743
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,220
run over my wife!

744
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,700
That damn pickup truck run over my wife!

745
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,460
Doctors!

746
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,200
Doctors survive!

747
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,520
Doctors...

748
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,180
run it.

749
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,100
Doctors survive if you run it in the

750
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,560
Mind Incision Transplant Center.

751
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,560
Doctors survive if you run it in the

752
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,160
Nuclear Radiation Pickup Truck Zone.

753
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,600
Doctors survive if you run it in the

754
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,120
11-Hot Dog Seekerspeed.

755
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,580
Calling Doctors Survive.

756
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,800
Calling Doctors Survive.

757
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,060
Calling Doctors Survive.

758
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,260
They've got the flaming pipe that's ready.

759
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,000
They're there, they're getting it right up to the edge of the pipe.

760
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,900
There's Sterno, there's the Jader, and he's going like,

761
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,680
man, I want to get the tape of this later.

762
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,260
This guy, of course, really thinks he's going to be

763
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,860
shoved right in it, and that's going to be it, right?

764
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,700
Okay, they put his head down on the block.

765
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,900
I think he's got his golf clubs, he's got his iron,

766
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,440
he's holding the iron in his teeth.

767
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,420
This is a new development.

768
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,140
This really is.

769
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,600
Oh, look, he's putting one hand in his pocket.

770
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,420
Good Lord, like he does like it's real.

771
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,260
This is, I do this every day.

772
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,460
This is the first time he's ever had American clothes on.

773
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,540
And now Sterno raises the huge scimitar.

774
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,880
That thing must be seven feet long.

775
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,860
And they're building to a fever peach that

776
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,740
The legs say, they're saying right now, they're saying,

777
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,120
healed head, bad, bleeding head, good,

778
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,480
golfer must die.

779
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,240
Golfer must die.

780
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,440
Oh, look at that.

781
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,280
That's incredible.

782
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,520
That was beautiful.

783
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,620
Oh, man.

784
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,660
Oh, man.

785
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,660
Now he's got, he's holding up the head.

786
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,600
It's bleeding, see?

787
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,960
Oh, it's still, yeah.

788
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,620
Okay, he's putting it back on.

789
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,720
Yeah, there we go.

790
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,260
It bleeds on.

791
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,120
It bleeds on.

792
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,620
They're carrying the body off.

793
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,280
They do throw the body into the pipe.

794
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,520
Look, it's bubbling.

795
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,200
It's bubbling.

796
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,900
It's just, yeah.

797
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,060
There you go.

798
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,040
There goes the body.

799
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,860
All recycled back into the eco-space.

800
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,000
That's the neat thing about subgenius religion.

801
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,960
Look at that.

802
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,580
You can see in the water.

803
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,560
Yeah, there he goes.

804
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,360
Sternow really swings a mean scimitar, and I like that.

805
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,200
I like the way he carries it in the guitar case.

806
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,660
I think that's a real nice touch.

807
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,860
Yeah, okay.

808
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,540
He's got a lot more traditional style.

809
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,680
Yeah, there we go.

810
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,380
He's holding the head up.

811
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,000
It's still bleeding.

812
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,200
It will keep bleeding.

813
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,880
It will bleed for, until it needs to be done again, and once the dolorous stroke is administered

814
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,780
one more time.

815
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,780
One more donor.

816
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,380
One more.

817
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,160
Up beneath his torso.

818
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,900
That's it.

819
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:12,980
That's it.

820
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,580
That's it.

821
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,200
You can't use your brain to think about your religion.

822
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,980
You go into war.

823
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,080
This is the law.

824
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,280
That is the law.

825
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,760
What is the law?

826
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,020
Nobody's thinking about using their brain to create a new family.

827
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,340
You use your brain to think about a new family.

828
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,780
He says, you put those boxes up round, you're fired.

829
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,620
So you go home.

830
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,500
So you go home, and your mother's at the door.

831
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,880
And your mother looks up, and she says, you're fired.

832
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


833
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


834
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


835
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


836
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


837
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


838
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


839
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


840
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


841
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


842
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


843
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


844
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


845
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


846
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


847
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:42,880


848
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,140
She says, I don't care what happened.

849
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,320
Where's the rent?

850
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,640
What were you doing, smoking pot again?

851
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,220
And you think you've lost it all.

852
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,440
And there's no place for you to go.

853
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,760
You've got no job.

854
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,860
You've got no home.

855
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,780
So you've got to use your brain and make a breakthrough.

856
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,540
Every time they knock you down, you've got to get back up.

857
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,420
That's the real thing.

858
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,540
That's real.

859
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,120
Sex hurt.

860
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,840
Hell, these people think sex hurt means tying them up.

861
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,760
Hell no.

862
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,400
You don't know what sex hurt is.

863
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,060
Misunderstanding, reading meaning into sex hurt.

864
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,000
It means what it is.

865
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,080
Sex until it hurts.

866
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,080
Until it hurts.

867
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,340
It pays the curse.

868
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,420
It pays Bob.

869
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,680
I mean, it's simple enough.

870
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,940
You can understand that.

871
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,180
Love them.

872
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
Love one another.

873
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,620
Anybody can understand that.

874
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,320
You don't have to go to school to understand that.

875
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,940
Take a little sore in your mouth.

876
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,340
You go to school and they take it away from you.

877
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,840
Too much love is better than not enough.

878
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,300
You've got to back.

879
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:56,600
You've got to back.

880
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,860
Then you're sure locked into business again.

881
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,060
You've got to backslide.

882
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,540
Then you let go.

883
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,180
Then you let go of the church.

884
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,840
Let go all the way.

885
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,620
Upside and downslide.

886
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,900
Slide into home.

887
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,920
If you want to avoid temptation, go at it.

888
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,360
Forticate like your very life depended on it.

889
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,220
By the way.

890
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,400
I have a lot of pills.

891
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,280
And if anybody would like to take a pill, I'd like to give them a pill right now.

892
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,920
Come up and be anointed, friends.

893
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,100
Well, now these are Dobbs type pills.

894
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,860
That means that each one's just got a slightly different grain to it.

895
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,260
Each one will hit you just a little different too.

896
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,280
Oh, friends, let's get ready.

897
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,420
He's got the pill in his mouth, friends.

898
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:40,680
Go.

899
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,220
Go.

900
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:41,760
Go.

901
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,180
Go.

902
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,440
Go.

903
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:42,840
Go.

904
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,040
Go.

905
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:43,720
Go.

906
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


907
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


908
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


909
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


910
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


911
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


912
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,560
Oh, yes, friends.

913
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,020
Another soul saved for Bob.

914
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,680
Oh, yes, friends.

915
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,420
To roll in the aisles.

916
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,680
To have a spiritual experience at your expense.

917
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,100
Oh, yes.

918
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,600
Jesus has taken still the church.

919
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,960
As he said in the nine-hour cleasing.

920
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,080
Well, fuck it.

921
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,000
Jesus has took off.

922
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,380
Fuckin' for Bob.

923
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,600
Jesus has taken still the church.

924
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,040
As he said in the nine-hour cleasing.

925
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,060
Five, six.

926
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,720
Jesus has taken still the church.

927
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

928
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,260
A little girl came up on stage.

929
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,720
Right about.

930
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,300
And handed me a magazine article.

931
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,940
The title of that article, ladies and gentlemen, is Bob dead.

932
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,100
Hallelujah.

933
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:31,940
No.

934
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,180
Prosphemy.

935
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,560
Prosphemy.

936
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,540
If you think Bob is dead, just ask Connie.

937
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,540
Go on.

938
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,060
Do your own thing.

939
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,200
Do your own thing.

940
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:42,540
Go on.

941
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,260
Just do it.

942
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,160
Just have some time.

943
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,680
Get out of here.

944
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:45,960
Bob's dead.

945
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,900
It's true.

946
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,720
It's all right.

947
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,220
Maybe he's dead.

948
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,540
Maybe he's dead.

949
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:48,860
Sure.

950
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,080
My God.

951
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,000
My God.

952
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:57,020
The only person in this country who can print lies like this.

953
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,860
Is Bob dead?

954
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,920
Is Bob dead?

955
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,620
Is he?

956
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,400
No.

957
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,480
Is he even a little sick?

958
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,120
No.

959
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,600
Well, maybe a little sick.

960
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,200
No.

961
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,200
No.

962
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,480
Yes.

963
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,200
Yes.

964
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,520
Kill Bob.

965
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:11,980
Kill Bob.

966
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,200
Kill Bob.

967
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


968
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,100
Kill Bob.

969
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,180
Kill Bob.

970
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,600
Kill Bob.

971
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,600


972
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,600


973
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,600


974
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,600


975
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,600


976
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,600


977
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,180
As it is written in the book of fire, kill Bob Ecclesian, spy seven.

978
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,920
Jesus did take pills in church and he did kill Bob.

979
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,360
Heal head.

980
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,000
Heal head bad.

981
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,360
Bleeding head.

982
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,320
Good.

983
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,700
Good head.

984
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,620
Yeah.

985
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,580
Bleeding head good.

986
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,040
Yeah.

987
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,960
Sears catalog head.

988
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,180
Marine Catholic nun craved a boner.

989
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:42,180


990
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,540
Billionaire Navarro Palmer.

991
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,260
Those messages from the exes said,

992
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,400
on this paper, build a church.

993
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,020
That paper was a $10 bill.

994
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,300
And Bob went out and said, I want my army.

995
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,720
I want my army of subgeniuses.

996
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,840
So he went to the police station,

997
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,640
and he walked in there and he said,

998
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,860
how many of you people here will do whatever I tell you?

999
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,660
And three-fourths of them stood like this, one step.

1000
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,240
And he looked at the other fourth and was going,

1001
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,000
hey, I don't know.

1002
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,640
You're subgeniuses, he said to them.

1003
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,100
He went into the Pentagon, and he walked up to them,

1004
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,480
and he said, how many of you are going to stand with me in my army?

1005
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,100
And they all rose their hands, except for three janitors.

1006
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,120
And he turned to the janitors and said, why didn't you do it?

1007
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,160
He said, well, I don't want to join an army

1008
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,620
unless the war is right and everything.

1009
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,860
And Bob said, you're with me!

1010
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,260
And the Church of the Subgenius was formed.

1011
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:23,640
Now this, this is the fourth time I've ever been on a stage

1012
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,480
in front of people in my life.

1013
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,940
And Bob gave me the feeling to do that.

1014
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,300
And he said, what do you mean by that?

1015
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,860
And I said, well, I got something that makes me want to shout.

1016
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:35,940
Fuck it!

1017
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,140
I've got this funk that you can't hear.

1018
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,400
It like comes over me and shouts all over me.

1019
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,880
And it says, Mike, these people here are here for one reason,

1020
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,020
and you are here for one reason, and that is to be

1021
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,800
funkin', funkin', funkin' with Uncle Bob!

1022
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,660
You better dance!

1023
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,500
And me.

1024
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,140
Un

1025
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,800
baking está

1026
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,000
Michael Flores twisted the little empty Tylenol capsule apart.

1027
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:43,260
A fiendish grin spread over his puckish little face as he poured the cyanide into the empty Tylenol bottle, capsule, and recapped it and put it in the bottle along with all the others.

1028
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:57,660
He he he he thought to himself, won't those innocent people with their headaches be surprised when they wake up dead two days from now.

1029
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,020
It was the voices in his head.

1030
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,760
No no no no no no!

1031
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,960
I am not dead!

1032
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,320
I am not dead!

1033
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,020
I am not dead!

1034
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,880
It's apparently like getting drunk or something.

1035
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,780
Hold on, that was tentatively a convenience.

1036
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:30,240
He is perhaps the most picturesque of all the subgeniuses here.

1037
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:36,980
He tentatively has a very high standard of what is not art

1038
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:42,080
and is trying to make sure that the convention itself is killed.

1039
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,880
If not the convention itself, at least a few of the doctor men, the evil doctors.

1040
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,160
There he's pumping up his synthesizer.

1041
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,760
It's an air-controlled electronic synthesizer.

1042
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,340
Oh my gosh, he hit start-up!

1043
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,040
What the hell is playing?

1044
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,220
We don't want to record a video

1045
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,720
I don't want to record a video

1046
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,600
I don't want to record a video

1047
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,620
I don't want to record a video

1048
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,820
We don't want to record a video

1049
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,780
I bought the slow and cut slow

1050
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,060
I bought the slow and cut slow

1051
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,000
I bought the slow and cut slow

1052
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,600
I'm too tired to sing this drivel

1053
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,520
Close my eyes and lead me away

1054
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,360
I mean I like the music

1055
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,420
But what's this done this joy?

1056
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,980
I bought the slow and cut slow

1057
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:33,220
I bought the slow and cut slow

1058
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,220
Well, it is legal around here.

1059
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,740
Round about.

1060
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,720
But of course, wisdom does not depend on drugs.

1061
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,700
Yay, the sacred herb, Havafrop Zipulop,

1062
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,740
that is found on the graves of the Tibetan wise man

1063
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,120
in those small white bundles.

1064
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,660
Well, that's the kind of thing that many,

1065
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,300
and I don't mean those...

1066
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,000
Opium?

1067
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,080
The white bundles that you find here in...

1068
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,020
Oh, opium. Well, that's getting to golf.

1069
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,380
There you've got Arnold Palmer, the head of the sub-D.

1070
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,180
About whom we used to be apathetic, but now we just don't care.

1071
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,780
Right. We'll be seeing the bloody head launching in just a little while, actually.

1072
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,100
We have a lot.

1073
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,700
We have several Arnold Palmer drugs.

1074
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,980
We have training films, too, for those of you into hardcore rough and green maintenance.

1075
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,900
Right, hardcore rough and tumble, Arnold Palmer.

1076
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,340
Later on, we'll be having on video cam three,

1077
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,040
the best out of two of three falls with Arnold himself.

1078
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,180
Volunteer girls from the audience will be coming up and taking their turns with Arnold.

1079
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,040
Why spoil the beauty of the thing for legality's sake?

1080
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:37,480
Remember, kids, nothing is illegal if 100 sub-Guinea businessmen decide to do it.

1081
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:37,980
That's right.

1082
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,440
And we had that wonderful tape where you saw the...

1083
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,240
young, naked, nubile maidens wrestling with Arnold Palmer's bloody head.

1084
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,140
No heads, no heads!

1085
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,560
We want heads!

1086
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:53,680
Both heads are being held hostage in one room in this hotel, and nobody knows which.

1087
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,720
They're in the closet, they're in a sack, and you don't know where.

1088
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,820
There ain't no bobs here, they're all dicks.

1089
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,340
Go on!

1090
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,780
No heads, no heads!

1091
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,620
There ain't no bobs here, they're all dicks.

1092
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,940
Dicks for Bob! No heads!

1093
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,340
No heads, no heads!

1094
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,880
Demand no heads!

1095
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,500
I've been the possessor of the head for the past...

1096
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,340
oh, since I was in eighth grade.

1097
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,640
It was originally my dad's head.

1098
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,500
Dottie came up to me and asked me if she could borrow the head for a minute.

1099
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,980
And I said, yes.

1100
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,740
But I say...

1101
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,740
Wait a second, wait a second.

1102
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,880
I say, you can have the head!

1103
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,160
You can have the head!

1104
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,780
I don't want it!

1105
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,280
It's a curse!

1106
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,160
It's a horrible curse that's been with me for the past...

1107
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,840
all my life.

1108
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,300
That I absolved myself from Spice Building for the head!

1109
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,080
The curse be on you!

1110
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,520
You are the curse of the head!

1111
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,160
Flores is trying to make like...

1112
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,720
Flores is desperately trying to break up with the cash register where the people have been paying to get in.

1113
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,640
He's not the only one, but he's...

1114
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,520
Looks like he's got a gun, yes?

1115
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,040
I feel like they're holding him off.

1116
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,460
They're trying to...

1117
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,840
Flores is convinced.

1118
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,360
From what I can understand, Flores set this up with tentatively inconvenience.

1119
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:25,220
All the violence, the nudity, that was LSD that was being given away.

1120
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:30,180
Buck Naked was giving away capsules with very, very high doses of LSD inside them.

1121
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,800
We believe it's LSD.

1122
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,160
I don't think it's the legendary froth.

1123
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,660
Oh, wait.

1124
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,460
Hold it.

1125
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,580
We'll have to tune out now.

1126
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,720
We're like a needy town.

1127
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,460
Is Senator Kenny here for the interrogation?

1128
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,480
I guess not.

1129
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,820
Well, you guys, this is the panel discussion.

1130
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:57,380
Science does not remove the terror of the gods, especially the elder gods.

1131
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,140
The gods seem to get crankier with age.

1132
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,440
More forbidding all the time.

1133
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,360
More vengeful.

1134
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,120
More dangerous.

1135
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,560
Get your damn foot off Bob's head.

1136
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,080
Put your feet on Bob's head.

1137
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:20,700
I got a case of boozeys up in the room and I figure we ought to load them up, go over to the science fiction convention and just chill them all.

1138
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,300
Kill them, then.

1139
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,560
Chill, kill, kill.

1140
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:22,880
Chill them, goddamn.

1141
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,880
Don't run a hundred bag of vile faves.

1142
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,860
You can only go to Dobby Town and kill them without asking for it.

1143
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,520
You suck-ass, goddamn new wave science fiction weirdos.

1144
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:30,840
Ah!

1145
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,860
Poor ear of Bob's.

1146
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,500
Yeah, yeah.

1147
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,740
Who cares about him?

1148
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,380
He's just shit.

1149
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,740
I heard some strange things about him.

1150
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,120
He's just shit.

1151
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,160
No, there will be no panel peeing.

1152
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,440
It's not in the schedule.

1153
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,460
Juvenile urination.

1154
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,420
Can't we?

1155
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:44,800
Can't we?

1156
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,240
Nasty doctors.

1157
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,900
Those doctors always talk about pee and gross stuff like that.

1158
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,640
I always talk about real childish.

1159
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,040
Childish doctors.

1160
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,020
Stevia.

1161
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,660
Doctors for stool examinations.

1162
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,380
Stool examinations.

1163
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,120
Bone cancer surgeons for Bob.

1164
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,320
P.C.'s dissection.

1165
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,740
P.C.'s dissection urologist.

1166
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:06,700
I've got two dogs.

1167
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,980
Surgeons for Robert.

1168
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,820
Tec-3 Technicians for Bob.

1169
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,460
Yodlers for Bob.

1170
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,900
Zitcreme sellers for Bob.

1171
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,280
Pants for Bob.

1172
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,700
Toothless for Bob.

1173
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,180
Baby snatchers for Bob.

1174
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,160
Ah, alright the, uh, procession has started up.

1175
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:31,100
They're reeling, the women are bringing the dead corpse of Sterdo Kieckhaver into the,

1176
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,040
into, people are laughing.

1177
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,920
I can't believe it.

1178
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,900
They don't believe he's dead.

1179
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,620
They think this is all a plot.

1180
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,100
The Reverend Janor Hypercleets from Little Rock, Arkansas,

1181
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,580
tried to make it all a little clearer to me

1182
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:47,300
with his own explanation of his conversion into the Church of the Subgenius.

1183
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:52,520
They said this jar was my mind, and then they poured it down a sink.

1184
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,460
Run that by me again? What do you mean?

1185
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,920
I don't know.

1186
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,120
Has anybody got any Tylenol?

1187
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,140
I just need a couple of extra straight tabs to get off.

1188
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,180
I've got some of those 15-year-old Tylenol here.

1189
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,620
Maybe if we soak them in that leftover Kool-Aid

1190
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,060
from that other religious experiment, we can have some luck with them.

1191
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,240
Sounds like a Tylenol party, sure.

1192
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,720
I'm always up for a Tylenol party.

1193
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,760
Because, you know, I don't want to run into Paul.

1194
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,020
I don't want to run into Paul.

1195
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,580
I don't want no Yaka Tisa.

1196
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,480
I don't want no Subdinis.

1197
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,120
And I predict that our local American doctors will go on strike

1198
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,760
and be replaced by African witch doctors.

1199
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:58,420
We're splashing liberation right around the world, and we'll die to do it.

1200
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,700
Everybody sing of Arnold Palmer, and he can set you free.

1201
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,160
Bring in a Arnold Palmer.

1202
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,600
He'll stand up for me.

1203
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,100
He'll stand up for me.

1204
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,180
Bring in Arnold Palmer.

1205
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,640
He'll stand up for me.

1206
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,120
Come on, sing up.

1207
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,500
How are you going to start this war if we don't sing?

1208
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,420
How are we going to start this Vietnam War?

1209
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,220
Put the church right down the middle, friends.

1210
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,560
It's what the church needs.

1211
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,060
Put the church right in twain.

1212
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,980
You're talking Trevino.

1213
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,020
You can just back your cart out of here.

1214
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,100
You're talking Trevino.

1215
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,120
I prefer basketball myself.

1216
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,880
They say he's a golfer.

1217
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,240
They constantly know a golfer.

1218
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,760
I remember I was watching TV in 1967,

1219
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,540
Master's Tournament, third hole.

1220
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,780
I saw him miss a shot about like this.

1221
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,640
I couldn't believe it.

1222
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,460
They say he's a golfer.

1223
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,560
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants,

1224
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,140
it must have been very disconcerting for them

1225
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,460
to cross millions of miles of space

1226
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,100
only to be hit on the head with rotten orange.

1227
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:04,540
Subdinis.

1228
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,880
Subdinis, right.

1229
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,180
Subdinis, yes.

1230
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,180
They grant wishes.

1231
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,940
Well, kind of, yeah.

1232
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:10,800
Subdinis.

1233
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah, the right question.

1234
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:12,460
Subdinis.

1235
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,920
Yeah, or they give you spells, or they can bring on problems like sickness,

1236
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,800
world problems, death, drugs, pain, perversion.

1237
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,060
Subdinis.

1238
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:24,900
Or they can occasionally go out and just get spaced out and dingy,

1239
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,320
as the young people say today.

1240
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,940
By 1950, some of these characters were beginning to spin their stories

1241
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:34,660
of fantastic conversations with alleged space people.

1242
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:35,840
Subdinis.

1243
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,300
Subdinis.

1244
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:36,600
Subdinis.

1245
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:36,600


1246
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:36,600


1247
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,900
Rob ads them.

1248
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,960
Subdinis.

1249
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:47,180
Another young man chop down subChaetti Wakestreet a made it very

1250
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,060
busy crazy time by models at DOA.

1251
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:52,800
Cute faith hash.

1252
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,560
strangest taxpayers from months on when the dog.

1253
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,920
Subdinis.

1254
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:02,680
You won't be fooling me.

1255
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:02,980
Subdinis.

1256
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:02,980


1257
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:02,980


1258
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,160
Coordinator agreeable.

1259
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:06,580
Medical Director.

1260
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,540
ورicette.

1261
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:16,660
Well, being the saint of sails, he's going to be wheeling and dealing the fate of the earth with these beings that are so technologically advanced they've gone beyond technology and they're more like gods.

1262
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:30,200
They wiped out the dinosaurs on a picnic 63 million years ago, which was about the same time that they planted the seeds of the human race and the subgenius race, which are, by the way, two separate races.

1263
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,180
Once again, the main point is...

1264
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:05,000
There's hope for slack in these coming end times. That's exactly why we're here in Berkeley tonight.

1265
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:10,320
Now, what is this fabled slack once of you speaketh?

1266
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:19,640
Slack, Bob, is... Slack, I guess you'd say, is the absolute and total absence of any stress whatsoever.

1267
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:27,240
It's the highest state that man can try to reach in his spiritual or carnal quests.

1268
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,140
We're here to...

1269
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:37,960
We're here to spread the word of Dobbs, which, of course, is the main path to slack that the people need.

1270
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:51,520
If the last 50 years made such a change, just imagine the New York of 1980, when everyone has a number instead of a name, and the government tells you whom you should marry.

1271
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,040
Just imagine 1980.

1272
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,140
Things are completely out of hand here at the convention.

1273
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:58,940
Let's go!

1274
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:00,820
Mass panic.

1275
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,860
Royal heaving.

1276
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,100
Now the security forces are attempting to clear the hall.

1277
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:15,560
I want to thank the ladies for one of the best moves that has brought this convention back to life.

1278
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,800
It's the sex head war.

1279
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,080
But you cannot get away from this power.

1280
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,400
Just listening to what I'm telling you now can be the turning point in your life.

1281
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,480
Hello.

1282
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:29,860
Thanks, old one.

1283
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,600
You will die.

1284
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,060
You will die.

1285
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:45,280
All she needs is somebody who'll die.

1286
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,360
She's a terrible woman.

1287
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:53,340
Yeah, well, a decapitation is usually necessary to join the church, to find yourself within the church.

1288
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,080
Ah, but once the head is lost, the head is found.

1289
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,460
That's right. Bleeding head good, healed head bad.

1290
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:57,920
Yeah, that's right.

1291
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,800
That's the Arnold Palmer cult theme.

1292
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:06,880
For those golfers out there who may be interested in the Trevino-ist theory of lawn maintenance and green tending,

1293
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:12,280
we'll tune in later for a live broadcast from the 14th hole of the Pill Beach Golf Course.

1294
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:18,840
And we do want to differentiate between the live Arnold Palmer, the Trevino-ist, and the Church of Vic Morrow.

1295
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:19,700
Indeed.

1296
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,660
Somebody who's died.

1297
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,980
I myself killed some 15,000.

1298
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,180
We will discontinue this.

1299
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,020
We'll do the interview to check the quality of the recordings.

1300
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:38,580
We switch you to the 16th tee, where we'll show you in slow motion Arnold Palmer, U.S. opium champion.

1301
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,580
Somebody who'll die.

1302
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:49,120
And everything else is at subgenius.com,

1303
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,740
because this is the Hour of Slack, and it's the Church of the Subgenius,

1304
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:55,420
and our new official post office box,

1305
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,580
well, it's the old Cleveland Heights post office box,

1306
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,240
uh,

1307
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,440
the Texas Austin office had to move,

1308
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:11,480
so now we're at post office box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1309
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,120
www.subgenius.com

1310
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,280
Is that bucket?

1311
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,900
Is that bucket, Jones?

1312
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:21,900
Turn it on.

1313
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,080
How you gonna fuck it?

1314
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,220
Look at that dick!

1315
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,800
Look at that dick!

1316
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:29,820
He got back!

1317
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,260
How you gonna fuck it, Jones?

1318
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:31,820
It's hard!

1319
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,000
How do I do it?

1320
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,420
Coming back!

1321
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,280
Can't!

1322
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,700
And Jones didn't fuck Wanda's dick!

1323
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,020
He technically fucking Wanda's pussy!

1324
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,420
And Wanda's fuckshat on Jones' shit!

1325
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:47,340
Fuckly!

1326
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,580
Hell, all he needs is a couple of six-packs of beer,

1327
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,620
a four-wheel drive,

1328
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,020
and six orifices,

1329
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:54,980
and gin and jam,

1330
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,660
for Dr. Surabab,

1331
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,720
for the band that has the musical question.

1332
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:08,620
Get large amounts of LSD being combined with hard liquor to produce bad results.

1333
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,940
And the answer is a resounding no.

1334
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:16,300
You can just get off our fucking game, motherfucker.
