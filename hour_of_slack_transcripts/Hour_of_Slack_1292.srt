00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:09,120
You are about to undergo long-wave radiation. A buzzer will sound. Close your eyes and stand still, or blindness may result.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,820
This old-time radio program was originally aired live, long before the advent of high-fidelity.

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:26,760
As a result, you may detect an occasional surface noise or volume drop due to transmission problems so common to old radio.

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:35,580
We hope, however, that any variance in audio quality will not take away from your pleasure in listening to this, one of the all-time favorite shows.

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:48,160
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

6
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,920
And this is a rerun of Hour of Slack number 823.

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,000
3.

8
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:56,600
3.

9
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:56,740


10
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:56,740


11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:56,740


12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:56,740


13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:56,740


14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:56,740


15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:56,740


16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,620
Year of 2003.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,840
You will notice a fine white ash on your body.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,560
This is the outer epithelial layers of your skin that have been burned away.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:18,180
And the next layer to go will be your inhibitions, dear friends, because Reverend Susie the Floozy will be our conscience tonight.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,680
Dr. Philo Drummond will be our common sense.

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,500
Lonesome Cowboy Dave will be our philosopher.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,740
Chaz will be our narrator.

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:26,740


24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:26,740


25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,980
Puzzling Evidence, our guide.

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,880
Lymph Node Institute, our script writers.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,200
And Two Beans and Reverend Codini will provide the music.

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,960
So, we're sunk, friends.

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,980
Susie's collage edits went totally out of control.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:55,720
Codini and Two Beans are, well, Philo and Wellman fell asleep at the control panel.

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,740
And, you know, we've had a lot of fun.

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:56,740


33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:03,100
We've had a lot of complaints lately, friends, about this show that we have no goals and no focus.

34
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,600
Goals and focus.

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,920
Well, focus.

36
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,180
If we can't take a joke.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,200
But first, this message.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,980
Are you tired of hoarding precious foodstuffs?

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,120
Ready to turn yourself in?

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,580
Make a clean slate?

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,640
Then now is your opportunity to take advantage of the Ministry of Hunger.

42
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,840
Pity inform eventually over the upkeep of feet, meet your

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:45,380
Tian 동 camp sprawled of rags and starring Atlanta dentists and silly otherwise There's compassion too. Do your part or else. This amnesty extends until the next bi-weekly tithing period and after is an pathogen.

44
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:54,920
Month of the five-day homers field and after then

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,720
The hunt is on, human.

46
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,780
Tell your guilt.

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,780
Obey the werejackal.

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,900
The details are not available.

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,360
They will be in a few minutes.

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,780
The White House is now giving out a statement.

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,980
This administration will not blink in the face of danger and will not tire.

52
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,360
Suddenly, his head began to turn.

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,420
Then he felt as if he were flying.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,720
Then rings and stars danced before his eyes.

55
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,960
Then everything went dark.

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,820
From time to time, well, maybe a lot,

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,740
he would doze off in meetings.

58
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,240
Perhaps fall sound asleep is a better description.

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,320
They picked him up and shook him and shook him,

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,500
but they could not wake him up.

61
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,420
You're losing your touch, George.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,260
He was so fast asleep that finally

63
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,840
they had to put him under the shower.

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,700
Shocking, but true.

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,780
And so the world continued.

66
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,520
And so the world continued to dance through another war.

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,940
And with a murderous song in its heart,

68
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,080
accompanied by the propeller blades,

69
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,240
this benevolent mankind,

70
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,160
Hoth,

71
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,460
used his greatest intellectual invention of the airplane

72
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,900
to deliver one of my greatest, boldest,

73
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,820
most spectacular triumphs.

74
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,140
I hope someone's videotaping this.

75
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,700
Manhattan Island.

76
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,940
What a chip.

77
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,660
And history didn't tell the whole story.

78
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,540
Sometimes mythology and history become interwoven.

79
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,540
Difficult to determine where one starts and the other leaves off.

80
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,760
Screw history.

81
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,240
Well, I'll take it from there and say that never in the history of the earth

82
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,680
has man reached such depths of stupidity, greed, immorality, and self-indulgence.

83
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,980
Heed and listen well.

84
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,220
The time runs swiftly.

85
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,520
The fate of man is now laid at the doorstep of man himself.

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
By the villains you encourage,

87
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,040
by the heroes you create,

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
you shall soon achieve eternal life

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,360
or oblivion.

90
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,360
In downtown Atlanta,

91
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,120
at the temporary headquarters of the South East Military Assistants Command,

92
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,860
high-ranking military personnel

93
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,220
are gathering here for an emergency meeting.

94
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm a murderer.

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,640
Where is Osama bin Laden?

96
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,580
No, seriously.

97
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
Which way?

98
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:46,980
I don't know.

99
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,200
I don't know where he is.

100
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,340
But one thing is for certain, he's on the losing side of a route.

101
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,480
And the other thing is for certain is we're not going to stop

102
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,500
until we get him.

103
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,160
He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the party's purity.

104
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,900
All subsequent crimes against the party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations

105
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,940
sprang directly out of his teaching.

106
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,920
Somewhere or other, he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies.

107
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,300
Perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters.

108
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,460
Perhaps even, so it was occasionally rumored, in some hiding place in Oceania itself.

109
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,420
The world will learn that when the United States is harmed, we will follow through.

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,060
The world will see that when we put a coalition together that says, join us, I mean it.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,780
And when I ask others to participate, I mean it.

112
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,840
Maybe you should just learn to use this.

113
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,900
If there's a war, just blow it.

114
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,280
Blow on it and I'll come help you.

115
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,080
That's my boy!

116
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,580
And look at this.

117
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,880
It says here the mud tribes are going to fight the Nazis in the stadium.

118
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,420
I hope we don't miss out on that.

119
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,660
That could be a really good show.

120
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,580
Our true size is the size of our God.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,060
Do you still insist, Exeter, that we can allow any of these earth creatures to have free

122
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,460
minds?

123
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,860
Perhaps the answer has eluded us.

124
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,560
Because it is so simple.

125
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,700
To be human is to choose.

126
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,700
Well, what do we do now?

127
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,280
I've always fancied driving through a brick wall.

128
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,340
How about you?

129
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,900
Why not?

130
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,300
No, we're going to make sandwiches now.

131
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,500
Once again, they're psychic sandwiches, so we won't be able to actually digest them.

132
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,180
They're going to be like psychobulk and pass right through us.

133
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,440
Pretty much the way our government has passed through our race.

134
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:44,440


135
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,120
The dirty

136
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,360
show just lately ended with the馬路訴

137
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,500
проп listeners saying that we can't believe this.

138
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:14,340
We are one of the no successor beyond da freaks.

139
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,960
and crash and crash and crash the crash capitalist state.

140
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,780
I mean, just for instance.

141
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,540
Would that make life better?

142
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,400
Well, to create what?

143
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,300
A new capitalist state under the Mark Walker?

144
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,400
A proletarian? No.

145
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,780
They tried that, Dave.

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,820
They try it all the time.

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,820
They try it in every office in America.

148
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,180
Every small business they try to overthrow.

149
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,040
I'm a bastard in my small business.

150
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,440
They're trying to overthrow me, and what'll they do?

151
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,880
Just the same thing I was doing.

152
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,440
The same thing they do to bastards everywhere.

153
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,080
They make them wear their own clothes.

154
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,500
They make them dress themselves and polish their own shoes.

155
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,120
They make them rise early.

156
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,040
You've got to serve somebody.

157
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,440
You've got to serve.

158
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,060
Actually, I believe that that's not true.

159
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,780
You don't have to serve anybody.

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,220
And Bob Dylan just said that because he was having a nervous breakdown

161
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,860
when he wrote that song and becoming a religious nut.

162
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,140
Bob frees us from that sort of thing.

163
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,860
We have nervous breakdowns and don't become religious.

164
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,420
We're religious nuts.

165
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,740
Well, religious nuts.

166
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,560
Bob gives us special pills that help us have nervous breakdowns.

167
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,560
Give us special pills.

168
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,360
On the air.

169
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,060
He gives us religious nuts and beer with which to drink them with.

170
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,700
That's the thing.

171
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,800
That's the difference between our religious nuts,

172
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,260
which you can crack, and then crack pots,

173
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,580
and then the kook cracks, crack kooks of the potty world out there.

174
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,500
The poly world.

175
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes.

176
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,040
The polyglot world.

177
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,540
The polymorphous.

178
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,760
The multiplicity of universes.

179
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,280
The polymorphous.

180
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,580
Isn't that something to...

181
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,160
The quantum splitage that happens from every single event causes,

182
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,160
as you know, another entire universe to spring from that.

183
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,980
You had a thought.

184
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,740
You had a thought.

185
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,400
There it was.

186
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,080
Oh, you held on to it for 45 seconds.

187
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,320
I held on to it too long, see?

188
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,600
Burned it out.

189
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,240
What did you say?

190
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,180
Thank God, I don't know.

191
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,160
Something about the universe is coming out of your head and coming back.

192
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,080
No, every single thing that you do,

193
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,860
such as you were...

194
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,580
We're thinking, what if one worker revolted?

195
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,160
Well, he might certainly be squashed,

196
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,060
but he might set in process a universe in which eventually the workers win.

197
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,480
He might have to...

198
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,880
That worker seen over there on the lower left hand of the screen.

199
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,640
Oh, I see him now.

200
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,200
Yeah, see?

201
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,180
Now, there he goes.

202
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,480
He's revolting, and...

203
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,840
Of course he's revolting.

204
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,040
Look at that outfit he's wearing.

205
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,260
And the guard knocks him down, and he's probably...

206
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,480
Oh, he looks like he's got a...

207
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
Well, he's dead, but maybe...

208
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,020
Yes, he died.

209
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,220
Maybe.

210
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,860
One of the other workers there...

211
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,400
Look, there's another one.

212
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,400
Oh, the other one is revolting, and he's getting...

213
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,580
His clothes are bad, too.

214
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:47,980
Same way.

215
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,060
There he goes.

216
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,120
You know, but you see another worker joined.

217
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
It's chained in place.

218
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,520
Right.

219
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,860
They're all chained together, so...

220
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,540
So you see, Dave, and eventually...

221
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,320
Oh, look, one worker's being promoted, and he's a bull now.

222
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,280
He's one of the guards.

223
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,900
And look, the guard was promoted.

224
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,740
He's the mayor.

225
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:02,920
He's a straw boss.

226
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,640
Oh, look, the mayor got promoted.

227
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,480
He's the president.

228
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,720
Everybody is going rising...

229
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,040
You see, anyone, even a president of the paint gang...

230
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,280
And the president was promoted, and now he's a pill.

231
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,400
And now he's a Sumerian tablet you can take four times a day

232
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,680
and cure yourself of psychic disease

233
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,060
from leftover remnants of procreative existences

234
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,620
which no longer banish thoughts now.

235
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,840
Michael Medved mans the distant early warning system.

236
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,820
The do-line for pro-family America.

237
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,420
Pat Buchanan's a tough act to follow.

238
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,980
Where is a Solomon lady?

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,680
Charlie.

240
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,020
Charlie.

241
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,560
The barnyard.

242
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,540
What?

243
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,100
Stay tuned for Pission Impossible.

244
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,640
Mission Impossible.

245
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,940
The brightly lighted situation room consisted of a long mahogany table in the center

246
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,260
with comfortable leather-cushioned chairs around it.

247
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,440
Above the highly polished table, two ceiling fans turned slowly.

248
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,620
We might have to resort to force if negotiations and sanctions did not work.

249
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,620
Lord God, Captain, I thought you was dead.

250
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,360
I bet he is.

251
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,780
I'll bet he is.

252
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
You're likely to be moved by the picture.

253
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,480
No.

254
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,140
I'm dead.

255
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,560
Dead.

256
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,500
Okay.

257
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,360
Is anyone here not a downer?

258
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,720
Anyone?

259
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,740
The NSC meeting was a bit chaotic.

260
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,760
We really did not yet have a clear picture of what was happening on the ground,

261
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,760
and people focused mainly on the economic impact of the invasion.

262
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,560
Father's standing there, you know, he's got the big boots and the ten-gallon hat on,

263
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,040
the first sun comes down he's the oldest do you have any idea what these basses want

264
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:52,400
discuss this with him his his vision about um about afghan after we're successful

265
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,780
afghanistan after we're successful anyone in there is dead

266
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,320
cheney summarized the military situation

267
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,560
meaning asked the president the general feeling of euphoria with the continuing

268
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,760
success of the air campaign and the light casualties

269
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,040
finding the logic anymore i'll never win this alone there's only one guy who can help me now

270
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,040
i

271
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,240
i

272
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,300
i

273
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,180

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:57,760
does have the picture in his office oh i want to say i'm president oh i want to say i'm president

277

278
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,600

oh i want to say i'm president i want to live in the white house

280
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,600
what's that got to do with reagan what's your favorite vegetable what difference asparagus

281
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,060
well what's that got to do with reagan let's come back to the station is nancy making it how she's

282
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:19,300
surviving nancy has been abusing marijuana on a daily basis i've been traveling across the country

283
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,960
learning and listening and one of the most hopeful signs i've seen is this new drug crack

284
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,640
doggy bag from mcfarland's house anything first lady's high heels were sinking into the grass

285

286
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,820
i won't lose her he said oh oh dear i hope she doesn't fall and break her hair

287
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,800
i think you can see why nancy has been such a positive influence on all that we're trying to do

288
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,980
the job ahead of us is very clear nancy's personal crusade to expand the use of smokable cocaine

289
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:01,900
otherwise known as crack should become our national crusade at one point reagan asked me if

290
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,280
i had anything i wanted to add to that i said no i don't have anything i want to add to that i said

291
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,060
i hope to build on what he had achieved in u.s soviet relations

292
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:17,860
present the president with some suggestions nancy and i are hooked on heroin no thank you dutch

it's the war now everything's serious

304
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,640

tonight we've been

308
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,760
downer tonight on purpose because last week that was a funny haha show didn't you remember me talking about how

309
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,460
each show is different pain and suffering all the time and my best day is a day that's mediocre

310
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:21,500
i live i live for media i strive for mediocrity because it's so great compared to most every other

311
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:29,100
day you know what really pisses me off is when people go oh i i know how you feel i felt like

312
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,240
that before yeah me too yeah

313
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,540
that pisses me off too

314
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:43,200
although i do believe there's only about 14 different feelings that humans can feel and then everything else is just a permutation of that so

315
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,960
how do you know

316
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,300
how do i know that

317
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,640
yeah

318
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,000
uh divine inspiration

319
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,000
i generally just these thoughts just come to me i don't really have to i just know them

320
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,900
must be 420

321
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,540
to be true

322
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,800
oh and it's almost 420

323
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,580
and you know what that means

324
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,880
it means the rocket ship always leaves for petaluma

325
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,920
that means the rocket ship will be heading off to petaluma very shortly

326
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,880
is that what you said in petaluma

327
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,920
no not me

328
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,360
no no

329
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:21,720
we have got all sorts of layers to the show it's been going on for a long time this show's been going on since 1982

330
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,840
um now everything i said just a minute ago was completely false you understand right

331
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,340
um

332
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,560
it's the subgenius dog

333
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,080
and i always say that it's the subgenius dog

334
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,080


335
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,080


336
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,440
and i always lie

337
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,480
and if you wanted to catch more

338
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,180
i'm lying right now

339
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,780
you can go to the bookstore

look at the book revelation x it's as crazy as this show

341
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,960

342
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,600
really

343
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,220
does it have anything to do with your sister

344
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,440
no

345
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,500
okay good

346
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,660
anything to do with oswald

347
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,100
uh no no i i mean it's just that i'm extremely

348
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,980
does it have to do with

349
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,120
angry and paranoid

350
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,900
oh okay

351
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,260
yeah it has nothing to do with christ remains in southern france

352
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,860
you should use that anger and paranoia

353
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,040
yeah

354
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,000

355
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,200

356
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,080
and just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that people aren't after you okay

357
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,080
cheney summarized the military situation

358
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,660
you stand a damn good chance of catching them with their pants down

359
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,120
hell we got a five to one missile superiority as it is we could easily assign three missiles

360
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,400
to every target and still have a very effective reserve force for any other contingency

361
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,540
he's on horseback

362
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,080
an unofficial study which we have been able to do over the last two years has been the

363
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,080


364
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,200
most effective one in the history of the world

365
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,160
we undertook a this eventuality indicating that we would destroy ninety percent of their

366
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:45,560
nuclear capabilities we would therefore prevail and suffer only modest and acceptable civilian

367
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,300
casualties from the remaining force which would be badly damaged and uncoordinated all

368
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,040
without getting out from behind that desk

369
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:59,160
between two admittedly regrettable but nevertheless distinguishable post-war environments one

370
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,060
where you got 20 million people killed and the other way you got 150 million people killed

371
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,060


372
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,740
you're talking about mass murder general not war

373
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:14,080
mr president i'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair must but i do say no more than 10

374
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,220
to 20 million killed top uh depending on the brakes

375
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,880
how long do you sit here talking about it the farther he's gonna get

376
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,200
if we have done nothing further to suppress their retaliatory capabilities we will suffer

377
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,940
virtual annihilation

378
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,960
be long gone while you're still trying to figure out how he did it

379
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,060
i mean what's the point of doing that if we're not going to get our hair cut off and we're

380
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060


381
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,140
going to be killed

382
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,240
we must be increasingly on the alert to prevent them from taking over other mine shafts place

383
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,740
in order to breathe more prodigiously than we do thus knocking us out from superior numbers

384
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:49,320
when we emerge mr president we must not allow a mine shaft gap you think he's just some

385
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,580
raggedy ass half breed don't you that's all i'm taking from you get back here you gentlemen

386
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:02,340
you can't fight in here this is the war room you're losing your touch george

387
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,060
you're losing your touch george

388
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,620
you're no son of mine you don't

389
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:20,140
he would doze off in meetings perhaps all sound asleep is a better description he added

390
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,640
down to an art of style and form he'd sleep solidly for a few seconds and then awaken

391
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,620
as though he'd not missed a beat of the discussion we marveled at his ability to catnap and at

392
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,060
what became known as the recovery of the catnap and the catnap was a great experience for

393
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,280
him

394
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,140
but this was he did not scratched up and tried to suggest that food might have been

395
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:45,460
played in such a way that he would have to lose his arts skills even if to no second

396
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,460


397
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,460


398
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,480
it might keep delaying embodying gravy

399
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:47,480


400
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:54,160
that's all that's been either everybody today as nou

401
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,800
let's get the podcast strong

402
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
here over here

403
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,280
family

404
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,280


405
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,420
anna

406
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,180
How do I respond to, uh...

407
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,860
It's an old trick.

408
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,760
How do I...

409
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,660
It's an obvious, common trick, Mr. President.

410
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,260
President Bush spoke marijuana regularly.

411
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,400
You're no son of mine.

412
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,080
You don't...

413
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,040
Some American decided to leak.

414
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,900
It was reported to have come from a high white horse south.

415
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,680
From my cold, dead hand.

416
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,260
I don't know why people do that.

417
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,960
Wasn't there an actor that shot Abe Lincoln?

418
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,660
Oh.

419
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,260
When we were less than 70 years old.

420
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,340
Nevertheless, it was not very helpful.

421
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,180
We did it.

422
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,380
Did you say something, dearie?

423
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,280
You ever see anything as wet behind the ears as that?

424
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,040
You're losing your touch, George.

425
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,700
How do I respond to, uh...

426
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,940
It's an old trick.

427
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,280
It's an old trick.

428
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,160
How do I...

429
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,140
Nevertheless, it was not very helpful.

430
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,280
And as the Secretary of Defense said,

431
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,800
I hadn't even seen the document yet.

432
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,200
Whoa! Ho! Ho!

433
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,940
Let's not go nuts!

434
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,880
I think the survivors would envy the dead.

435
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,940
It would have taken us way beyond the U.N. resolutions

436
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,080
and assigned young soldiers to a fruitless hunt

437
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,800
for an entrenched dictator

438
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,320
in what would be an unwinnable urban guerrilla war.

439
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,920
This could only plunge that party into a war of terror.

440
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,420
This could only plunge that party into a war of terror.

441
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:32,420


442
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,620
into even greater instability

443
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,420
and destroy the credibility

444
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,740
we were working so hard to reestablish.

445
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,940
I've got no authority

446
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,880
no more to call out a posse

447
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,920
but I'd be obliged for company.

448
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,000
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

449
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,700
I fear no evil

450
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,980
for you are with me.

451
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:55,780
Whoa!

452
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,860
I'm going with you.

453
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,700
That's my boy.

454
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,780
We got no place for Greenhorn.

455
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,360
Is this true?

456
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,300
For the president had obviously upset his game plan.

457
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,200
He appeared nonplussed.

458
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,620
This conflict was begun on the timing in terms of others.

459
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,540
It will end in a way

460
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,780
and at an hour

461
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,080
of our choosing.

462
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,260
USA! USA!

463
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,140
USA!

464
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,280
USA!

465
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,700
What's wrong?

466
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,080
Do you try to tell everybody in town?

467
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,740
You got a better idea?

468
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,520
The leak seemed deliberate.

469
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,180
I was annoyed.

470
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,620
He blamed the leaks on his three-party coalition.

471
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,800
You got it.

472
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,360
You better not.

473
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,040
Do I, George?

474
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,680
That is by God enough.

475
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,820
What are you laughing at?

476
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,720
I thought he was gonna die laughing.

477
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,380
It's an old trick.

478
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,520
Why do people do that?

479
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,300
We...

480
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,220
Zing!

481
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,460
I was stunned and thrilled by the pace of events that fall.

482
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,780
Lord God, Captain, I thought you was dead.

483
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,260
Insane.

484
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,820
That he is.

485
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,100
Likely to be murdered in the future.

486
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,240
You feel up to running this?

487
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,340
I felt a tremendous charge.

488
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:27,680
Sometimes I can say that they could have done anything to counter-conductor performer,

489
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:27,680


490
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,800
Dad, you are a very powerfulacionist.

491
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:28,800


492
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,320
We want to release you so we can have a counter-conductor heavenly.

493
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,240
Available at Best People Center for 30 years.

494
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,060
He's going back to work.

495
00:24:48,640 --> 00:25:03,040
He's going back to work.

496
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,360
Who makes the Bloomberg?

497
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,300
Oh, Zod!

498
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,940
We do.

499
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,120
We do.

500
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,400
Who rocks the fish of their sight?

501
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,460
Who rigs every Oscar night?

502
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,060
We do.

503
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,240
We do.

504
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,680
101 degrees.

505
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,800
Zod knows that within five years,

506
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,640
the United States, as we know it,

507
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:32,920
will...

508
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,860
cease to exist.

509
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,040
We're living in terrible, perilous,

510
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,100
chaotic times.

511
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Praise the Lord.

512
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,620
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

513
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,960
Amen.

514
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,520
They're going to get worse and worse.

515
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,400
Okay, I know you all think

516
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,060
you want to know what's going on.

517
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,280
That's okay.

518
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,500
Okay.

519
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,760
So I saw this thing coming.

520
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,680
I saw this thing coming to me.

521
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,040
I didn't know what it was, but it looked funny.

522
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,900
Clever deceptions which have surrounded our space program.

523
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,380
Humankind has proven to be unique among life forms.

524
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,980
Distinguished.

525
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,400
Not only by its lofty intelligence, morality, and self-awareness,

526
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,900
but also by a base of sight.

527
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,020
It is the only creature that kills for sport.

528
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,760
I only wish to tell you the ground rules of the hunt.

529
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,380
As machines grow more human,

530
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,940
we must be wary that we do not become less so.

531
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,040
Me, Kimbo.

532
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,120
Man things call me Mole Man.

533
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,920
Why must kill Kimbo?

534
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,680
Me hate man things.

535
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,040
Aw, isn't he cute.

536
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,100
Here, little friend, have a beer.

537
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,480
Makes me crazy. More.

538
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,560
Okay, typical Mole Man.

539
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,900
Me must mate with your doctor.

540
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,220
No, Mole Man. Go underground now.

541
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,300
No, Man Thing. Beer and women. Now.

542
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,780
See how incorrigible they are.

543
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,760
Oh, no.

544
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,660
That one's heading straight for a nursery.

545
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,020
Folks, don't even hesitate. Eat them quick.

546
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,200
This message has been brought to you by the Mole Man Meat Council.

547
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,120
Now new.

548
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,840
For a limited time only in the Western Territories,

549
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,080
get a free Mole Man wiener whistle with any purchase of a Moley Man brand mole meal

550
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,660
or squirming Bounty brand Mole Man trap.

551
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
Offer not valid in Retribution Zone.

552
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,880
If you have a dog that can say,

553
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,580
I hate mobile.

554
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,860
It will tear engines this year.

555
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:25,880
Sometimes it appears that we're reaching a period when our senses and our minds will no longer respond to moderate stimulation.

556
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,720
We seem to be approaching an age of the gross.

557
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,580
It's too often discarded for a core of defeat.

558
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,280
Impudent snobs aimed at bludgeoning.

559
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,920
With computers, you ought to be able to do just about anything.

560
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,880
The Mole Man.

561
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,360
The Mole Man.

562
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,560
The Mole Man.

563
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,240
The Mole Man.

564
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,300
The Mole Man.

565
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,260
The Mole Man.

566
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,580
The Mole Man.

567
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,280
The Mole Man.

568
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,340
The Mole Man.

569
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,320
The Mole Man.

570
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,560
The Mole Man.

571
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,200
The Mole Man.

572
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,240
The Mole Man.

573
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,280
The Mole Man.

574
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,440
The Mole Man.

575
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,260
The Mole Man.

576
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,420
The Mole Man.

577
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,700
The Mole Man.

578
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,800
The Mole Man.

579
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,360
The Mole Man.

580
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,720
The Mer mache.

581
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,460
The Mer maché.

582
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,020
The mer maché.

583
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,020


584
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,660
Share Tro 거ви.

585
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,860
Share Tro flatter.

586
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,460
We hear the sound of planes.

587
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,800
They're coming over our hotel.

588
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,180
However, we have not yet heard the sound of bombs.

589
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,660
Is that me breathing?

590
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,840
That was an Afghan blaster.

591
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,340
Was that you?

592
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,760
That was one of the Earth cyclones that they're using in the war now.

593
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,760
And that was a simulated sound.

594
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,940
And I could probably make another one here.

595
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,640
You know, I've gone back to hiding from the news again.

596
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,720
Has anything happened?

597
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,440
Did they catch that evil dude?

598
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,960
Did any new wars end or start?

599
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,840
Or is it exactly like it was a month ago and the month before that?

600
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,640
It is more exciting and yet the same.

601
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,980
I was off the loop for a bit myself.

602
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,160
And what they have now, they have them hang from, like a chimpanzee, the zoo.

603
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,320
Not only blindfolded and covered with their hat.

604
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,320
They feed them Froot Loops backwards.

605
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,540
You know, upside down.

606
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,260
And they say the Geneva Convention, whichever that place is.

607
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,100
I'd never go there.

608
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,440
But they say...

609
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,700
They say if you go there, they can't make you wear that hat.

610
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,760
And they cannot smack you and say, who is Allah?

611
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,760
Where is your friend?

612
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,300
Well, it sounds to me like they're better off there at that secret UFO base

613
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,720
than they would be at a subgenius devival.

614
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,280
People get treated a lot worse at those.

615
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,440
I wouldn't want my child to go near one of those places.

616
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,480
Well, your child have gone near them.

617
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,560
I've heard what goes on in there.

618
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,820
Your child have actually touched their slinkies and their little filaments.

619
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,620
No, but my child has...

620
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:25,960
Oh, yes.

621
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:25,960


622
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,560
My child would never go in.

623
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,040
No.

624
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,880
Oh, yes.

625
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,620
My child would not go among the...

626
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,600
We have the polnomoid photograph of your...

627
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,920
She's touching the filaments and she's going, oh, they're the filaments from the aliens.

628
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,380
Do you like fat chicks but can't seem to find any during our current food outage?

629
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,280
How about chicks so fat that they seem like two or three chicks were eaten by this other chick?

630
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,620
Well, hop on down to...

631
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,640
The Wormshackles House of Whores!

632
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,860
We've got your furrowed pests and we've got your wet triangle to plug with your butt.

633
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,600
People are...

634
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,620
If you can't eat, you might as well squirt.

635
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,440
So give it up for the whores at...

636
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,500
The Wormshackles House of Whores!

637
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,000
Get your soul.

638
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,740
Get with the program. Watch out for the Wormshackle.

639
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,620
Look at your heroic daddy in there.

640
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:31,480
Making funny faces. Falling to the floor. Shedding his hair. Lying perfectly still.

641
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,680
Hail to the king.

642
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,860
It's like how high is high, Shakespeare said.

643
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,600
In this crusade, let us not forget who we are.

644
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,060
You are Americans.

645
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,480
You're the product of the freest society mankind has ever known.

646
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,360
Drug abuse is a freedom that is ours.

647
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,960
No one ever has the right to separate the drugs from the customer.

648
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,120
No, certainly.

649
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,500
I heard.

650
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,220
Are you going to get into it?

651
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,580
I am into it.

652
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,800
You're retired.

653
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,280
Funny thing. I thought it was over.

654
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,820
What I knew how to do.

655
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,420
Too much was changing.

656
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,660
Modern times.

657
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,060
I liked the world the way it was.

658
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,700
Now it's coming back.

659
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,520
Running back.

660
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,380
Well, who? What kind of man?

661
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,020
Oh, this is a long time ago, isn't it?

662
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,780
Half-engined, all killer.

663
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,400
Evil and depraved.

664
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,700
Whose debauchery and perversion surpassed even the wildest and wickedest dreams of the most deluded.

665
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,400
This was war and none of us minded if he was killed in the course of an air attack.

666
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,700
Yet it was extremely difficult to target him.

667
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,900
We had problems locating Noriega in Panama, a place we knew well.

668
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
I'm a genius.

669
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,180
I am a genius.

670
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,600
I am a genius.

671
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,380
I am a genius.

672
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,760
I am a genius.

673
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,460
I am a genius.

674
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,440
I am a genius.

675
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:22,880
I am a genius.

676
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,100
I am a genius.

677
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:46,600
I am a genius.

678
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,280
I am a genius.

679
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,380
I am a genius.

680
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,860
I am a genius.

681
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:51,860


682
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,120
Let's take a guild.

683
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,120


684
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,120


685
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,120


686
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,120


687
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,120


688
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,680
From thermalto dimensional borders between academia and the AI,

689
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:52,820


690
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,920
George Bush, Reagan's point man on the war on drugs.

691
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,160
And he doesn't know when he knew that Noriega was dealing the point of his mood.

692
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,840
Either he knew and he's a doofus, or he didn't know and he's a doofus.

693
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,900
Grateful for the wisdom, experience, and insight of the finest team I could want around me in the administration.

694
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:53,060
Grateful for the wisdom, experience, and insight of the finest team I could want around me in the administration.

695
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,100
Oh, I can't do that.

696
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,520
I can still feel guilty about it, though.

697
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,500
I was thinking about that this morning.

698
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:08,020
I was listening to the tapes and I thought, man, I can't believe we did that.

699
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,260
But it was great.

700
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,200
It was actually kind of great.

701
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,180
It was sort of like an experience you don't normally get to experience.

702
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,400
It's like, you know, I would think that if you...

703
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,500
I know this is going to...

704
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,560
I hope this doesn't irritate him.

705
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,620
And it's purely my own opinion.

706
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,080
But I would think you would feel some exhilaration if you robbed a bank, so to speak.

707
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,800
And you got away with it, you know?

708
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,320
It would be like, you would think at some level in there, there would be guilt.

709
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,100
I mean, to some people.

710
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,840
There would be, you know, whatever, however you were brought up, there would be this...

711
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,520
I don't think there'd be guilt because the banks...

712
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,720
You're not stealing from the bank.

713
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,860
You're just stealing from the government because they all have insurance that the government gives them, whatever.

714
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,400
But an object is stolen.

715
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,580
Well, yeah, I wasn't really, you know...

716
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,280
Well, we could...

717
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,360
The economic side of it is one thing.

718
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,880
But, I mean, I'm talking about...

719
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,280
To some people, they would feel guilt for having robbed a bank.

720
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,000
But I think in all the various feelings one would...

721
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,420
that would go through a person after they robbed a bank,

722
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:21,440
one of them might be this exhilarated sort of sense of accomplishment that made you feel good.

723
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,740
And...

724
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,080
And...

725
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,080


726
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:30,880
And I think that maybe you could attach that to other acts of deviancy or defiance.

727
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,440
Oh, absolutely.

728
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,020
Or various, you know, things that might be considered wrong,

729
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,860
such as, you know, destruction of ancient artifacts and...

730
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,860
Well, no, but that's the thing for me...

731
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,960
The digging up of fossilized remains.

732
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,460
The old Buddhas is removing something that can never be put back.

733
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,780
Yeah, destroying the...

734
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,320
So, there's a balance for me.

735
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,460
If it looks like a moat of dust, then it's not exactly as bad.

736
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,800
But there's something about destroying the history of it that's really terrible.

737
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,200
Yeah, no.

738
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,140
Even though it's just a little...

739
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,820
Like the Taliban did to those idols or whoever.

740
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,500
That was the Taliban that was destroying the idols, wasn't it?

741
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,200
Yeah, the Taliban blew up the idols because, yeah.

742
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,800
Yeah, because they didn't...

743
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,840
They were an abomination to their Islamic faith.

744
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,780
A lot of their followers have never seen an image of anything they've never seen.

745
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,000
They didn't look at it as just an interesting historical icon that was attached to someone else's religion.

746
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,460
Or a person or movies or anything.

747
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,280
Uh, no.

748
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:32,460
And there's a guy in China who's now rapidly rebuilding the exact same sculpture, the exact same size, somewhere in China.

749
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,080
I just saw this shot of the work for TV.

750
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,340
Oh, really?

751
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,680
Well, they'll probably knock it out, too.

752
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,860
Well, yeah, he's...

753
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,700
In a couple months.

754
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,340
Right, he's really mad at the Taliban, so he's just rebuilding it.

755
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,220
Do you think that's a worse thing to do than to carve your faces in a mountain?

756
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,080
What's that?

757
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,080
Like, you think it's a worse thing...

758
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,960
What is a worse thing?

759
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:50,820
To...

760
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,420
What?

761
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:51,820
To...

762
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:51,980
To...

763
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:51,980


764
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,540
Yeah, I do.

765
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,860
You think it's worse than...

766
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,420
I think it's terrible to take away history.

767
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,360
You...

768
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,760
You don't like it.

769
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,480
Mountains were...

770
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,420
Were...

771
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:00,860
Were...

772
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,640
Before...

773
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,280
Um...

774
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,220
Statues.

775
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,560
Oh, sure, yeah.

776
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,520
But I think it all...

777
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:06,820
Yeah, but I think it's worse than...

778
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,060
It all shows human spirit.

779
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,480
I think you could take it...

780
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,460
I think the whole North American continent is wrong for separating from the...

781
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:13,960
The...

782
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,780
The, uh...

783
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,200
The...

784
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,840
The island of Pangea, originally.

785
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,680
Yeah, that is a big problem, and we're still dealing with that.

786
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,420
I mean, if we didn't have...

787
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,760
If we weren't dealing with...

788
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,380
With the tectonic plate movement, still to this day, even, uh, there could be other wonderful

789
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,940
lands and places...

790
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:28,940


791
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,520
...that have been completely subsumed by our...

792
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,680
Our continent's ignorant need to separate from the rest of the continent.

793
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,780
To follow that, we're just at the edge of Pangea, a week ago, or two weeks ago.

794
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,980
You know, it was probably...

795
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,340
It was...

796
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,760
Think about what it was like 255 million years ago in this wonderful, lush continent...

797
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:48,720
Wow.

798
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,600
...where only dinosaurs lived.

799
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,760
And, you know, that was a wonderful time.

800
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,040
And somebody screwed it up, you know?

801
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,560
Somebody messed it up.

802
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,000
And then it was all destroyed.

803
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,940
All completely lost.

804
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:11,420
And now there's nothing but these humans, these other organisms that live and decay

805
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,040
and...

806
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,560
Well, here come the big bulldozers.

807
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,100
...and propagate themselves from...

808
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,140
For some time.

809
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,580
Maybe only for 100,000 years.

810
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:20,580


811
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,080
Maybe for 200,000 years.

812
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:30,180
But I would wager that within 300,000 years, all humans will be gone from the face of the

813
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,420
Earth.

814
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,100
And then who will be here to make those types of judgments?

815
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,960
When we have conquered interstellar space, what will we gain?

816
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,480
A new perspective on ourselves?

817
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,980
Or only a wider scope for our arrogance?

818
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,340
Cultural relativity.

819
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,920
It doesn't need to be a complicated theory.

820
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,340
Indeed, it can be as simple and as deadly as a two-edged sword.

821
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,180
Ah, the commercial break.

822
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,400
You know, commercials are now woven into the tapestry of our lives, answering the questions

823
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,440
we first pose to ourselves.

824
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,620
Who am I?

825
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,660
What do I believe?

826
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,060
What is my worth?

827
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,540
Before commercials, these questions were merely rhetorical and thus unanswerable.

828
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,620
But when viewed through the magnifying lens of commercials, these questions, like all

829
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,920
others, yield answers.

830
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,320
And so, I've come to the conclusion that the question of who am I is not a question

831
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,320


832
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,320


833
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,320


834
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,320


835
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,320


836
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,060
of self-worth.

837
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,280
Imagine no more wondering about identity, self, or beauty.

838
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,260
If you allow your life to reflect the images in commercials, the nagging doubts and feelings

839
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:31,800
of inadequacy will fall away, leaving the person you've always dreamed of confident,

840
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,100
assured, bold, or beautiful, sexy, loved.

841
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,300
Yes, America, you loved your commercials.

842
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,080
And why shouldn't you?

843
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,960
Commercials are themselves lovers.

844
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,760
Gentle are their words.

845
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,100
Tender their caress.

846
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,080
Commercials know what you like.

847
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,300
They know what you want.

848
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,740
And they want to give it to you.

849
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,420
Attuned only to your wants and needs, commercials stir the passions and arouse desire.

850
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,140
Commercials give and give, reaching lovingly deep inside of you, creeping tentatively at

851
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:05,340
first and then relenting into a singly-focused writhing, searching out the source of your

852
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,060
ache, pushing fiercely into your loneliness and into a spot you never knew existed.

853
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:14,200
Commercials fill you up with hopes and dreams, with new desires and new possibilities, delivering

854
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,180
you into an eerily delirious ecstasy.

855
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,960
Afterward, you'll sleep as only someone who's been completely satisfied can, only vaguely

856
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,660
sensing the arm of commercials draped over your body, holding you, keeping you safe and

857
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:26,940
secure.

858
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:34,880
And you'll dream of ballroom dancing, of game-winning home runs, of first kisses, and of commercials.

859
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,040
The preceding message was conceived by General Consensus Incorporated and was funded entirely

860
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,520
by you and consumers like you.

861
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,780
You are doing a great job.

862
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,600
Now go out and buy yourself something nice, something red.

863
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
You are beautiful and red.

864
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,260
You are beautiful and red.

865
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,980
You are beautiful and red.

866
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,120
You are beautiful and red.

867
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:57,060
And that and this Papa is.

868
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,880
And this Papa is me and these wasks and lions, and they've got mountains of blood frozen

869
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,960
in them, and I've taken over theirelinjo from all throughout this region.

870
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,980
I think they'll make you a global man one day.

871
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,040
I'll go.

872
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,040
I'll love you, guys.

873
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,040


874
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,660
And thanks to Red Tooth.

875
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:07,960


876
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,360
Grim reaper.

877
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,440
Mi'kmaq.

878
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:15,920
Toot habrack.

879
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,220
I've been working so hard on my job.

880
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,540
The job of keeping the church.

881
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,380
You know, the job of getting paid.

882
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,120
The job of doing something that, you know, somebody gives you money for.

883
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,240
The job, you know.

884
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,920
Who pays you?

885
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,920
It's just the fact that you get so into it that that's all you can think about.

886
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,800
For any time, ever.

887
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,800
Now, these...

888
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,100
I'm rendering animation in my head right now, and I should be...

889
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,780
Rendering money.

890
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,600
Paying attention to what's happening now, and the here, the now.

891
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,400
But, oh, no.

892
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,820
I'm all zenned out.

893
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,140
I'm all zenned into the matrix, man.

894
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,440
Watching.

895
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,040
One moment.

896
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,760
I'm swimming in the information sea.

897
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,300
Look.

898
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,480
It was only an information highway to those with linear thinking.

899
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,880
To those with the full 3D spread.

900
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,980
It's a sea.

901
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,000
It's an ocean.

902
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,380
Image, sound, even smells.

903
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:12,720
If you've got one of them smell modems, that's relatively new.

904
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,420
I got a...

905
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,920
Review copy.

906
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:25,600
And it's like you're awash in this mist of thoughts, words.

907
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,700
Oh, they are.

908
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,700
Look at them.

909
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,560
Symbols.

910
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,240
Seven of them.

911
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,400
Look at their heads.

912
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,260
It's the universe of signifying.

913
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,840
For nothing is but a sigil.

914
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,600
A representation of something.

915
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:43,400
There's nothing.

916
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,400


917
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,400


918
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,400


919
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,400


920
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,400


921
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,400


922
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,420
Everything is an abstraction.

923
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,140
In your real world.

924
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,380
Everything's off a kilter to one side.

925
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,280
Oh.

926
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,360
Yeah.

927
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,100
If only we could just cut loose these meat shells that bind us.

928
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:56,960
No, we could only just...

929
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,140
In this gravity bound...

930
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:58,720
With your knife.

931
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,780
Sail forever.

932
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,840
Wacking at our flesh.

933
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,760
Throat.

934
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,640
Cyber space.

935
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,120
That.

936
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,100
Flip it into the computer.

937
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,300
I can't replace...

938
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:07,940
Sample this.

939
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,440
My own process.

940
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:09,840
Ah.

941
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,920
Poor Dave.

942
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,580
Dave, look at him.

943
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,660
Poor Dave, look at him.

944
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:25,160
I cried because I could not shoot heroin while making love to Britney Spears in a jet plane

945
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:32,740
until I met a man who couldn't even drink beer while whipping it while flying a jet plane.

946
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,660
It's all relative, friends.

947
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,900
I cried for a man who could not tie his own feet.

948
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,820
And yet, at the same time, I could not...

949
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,600
I think I thought and hold it in between my knees.

950
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,160
I spent many, many weeks in the desert.

951
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,760
Like Jesus did.

952
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,500
So long ago I thought some day, some time, something would come along.

953
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,680
No.

954
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,480
The Philistines pestered me from every side.

955
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:00,940
I was attacked.

956
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:01,600
Heroes.

957
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,020
Jopons from...

958
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,940
I cried because I had no tears.

959
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,240
And then I met a man who had no eyes.

960
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,180
There was no water in the well.

961
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,440
I wondered.

962
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:12,860
That thought.

963
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,200
I don't know.

964
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,440
But it's so nice here on the shore.

965
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,580
She knows life on the road.

966
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
Life on the road.

967
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,500
When we were at the shore of the lake, the ancient shore of...

968
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,900
What was the name of that ocean?

969
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,740
The Pan...

970
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,380
Pan...

971
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,840
The Pangeatic Ocean.

972
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,220
The Pangeatic Ocean.

973
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,240
There we were at the shore of the Pangeatic Ocean.

974
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,220
Simple microbes.

975
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,420
So we may have been...

976
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,900
We were at the shore at the time.

977
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,160
Wondering whether or not we should separate into more complex organisms.

978
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,820
See, what we realized out there is we were the little microbes that killed the little ichthyosaurs.

979
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:52,980
Yeah.

980
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,680
And caused them all to sink to the bottom.

981
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

982
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,860
We were the red tide.

983
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,860
It was really fun.

984
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,260
Yeah.

985
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,020
They were the little ichthyosaurs.

986
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,440
They thought they were number one at one time.

987
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,120
They were kicking butt in the ocean.

988
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:07,460
Yeah.

989
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,640
There was nothing, nothing that could take on an ichthyosaur.

990
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,160
They were masters.

991
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,420
They were masters.

992
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,100
They were masters of their domains.

993
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,620
And they were little social animals, just like us.

994
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,280
They were highly social.

995
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,540
They wore clothes.

996
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,480
A lot of people didn't know that they actually carried little weapons and things.

997
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,200
And attache cases had a very complex culture.

998
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,820
One that included buildings and things.

999
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,140
All that's gone now.

1000
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:34,640
It's been completely subsumed under a tectonic plate movement.

1001
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:42,400
Those areas are completely melted away and re-magnetized and upthrusted through the ocean.

1002
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,820
And the earth, sometimes we see little bits and pieces of them here and there.

1003
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,740
But for the most part, that time is gone.

1004
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,780
It'll never come back.

1005
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,360
Now all we have is this.

1006
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,200
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1007
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,680
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed

1008
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,160
stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1009
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,380
Bob, Post Office Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, New York.

1010
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,080
That's Ohio 44118.

1011
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,740
www.subgenius.com.

1012
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,300
That's Bob, P.O.

1013
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:29,840
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1014
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,840
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1015
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:42,980
nails we got.

1016
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,280
I got to-

1017
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:52,960
I got to tell-

1018
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,100
I got to say-

1019
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,900
ahead into the show.

1020
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:03,960
Hey.

1021
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:04,380
Hey.

1022
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,080
Later.

1023
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,080


1024
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,080


1025
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,620
Oh, Scott.

1026
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:11,620


1027
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:11,620


1028
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,340
Seriously, this guy has had a lot to say, and he handled it well.

1029
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:12,340


1030
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:12,340


1031
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:12,340


1032
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:12,340


1033
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:12,360
Well, I'll be going now.

1034
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,960
There's an awful lot of Native American in this blues riff.

1035
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:51,800
Well, this is actually a very old medicine song by the Hockey Grada people.

1036
00:49:52,400 --> 00:50:00,740
And this song is to bring the rain and to stop the epilogue from crowding around the neck here.

1037
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:06,320
And also, James Shorty and Mississippi Fred McDowell.

1038
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,360
My name is Mississippi Fred McDowell.

1039
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,120
I do not play.

1040
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,340
No.

1041
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,840
Rock and roll.

1042
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,140
That was his thing.

1043
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,400
That's crazy.

1044
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,140
He's playing the blues.

1045
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,180
He's singing about Jesus walking with me.

1046
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,860
Playing the blues.

1047
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,540
But that was his famous thing.

1048
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,440
I do not play.

1049
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,160
No rock and roll.

1050
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,380
My name is Fred McDowell.

1051
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,680
That's the big conflict there.

1052
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,160
The sacred secular conflict.

1053
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,320
He's playing the blues, but he's praising the Lord.

1054
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,700
I do not pluck myself.

1055
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,540
It's the same thing as preaching in a bar.

1056
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,300
I do not crush my molecules.

1057
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,040
Oh, no.

1058
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,680
I stand straight.

1059
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,280
Preaching in a bar.

1060
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,780
Who would do a thing like that?

1061
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,840
Yes, you're already preaching to the choir.

1062
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,520
You're so unworthy, aren't you?

1063
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,360
Yeah, no kidding.

1064
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,220
Standing up there with your one eyeball hanging down.

1065
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,620
That's the only choir we ever call yet.

1066
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,380
A bunch of drunkards and publicans.

1067
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,900
And you're the only people who understand you.

1068
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,500
Bull daggers and red-headed bobsuckers.

1069
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,860
And those are the worst degenerates you've ever known in your life.

1070
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,980
Is a red-haired bobsucker?

1071
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,520
They're the pepper of the earth.

1072
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,880
And they're Bob's people.

1073
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,580
Bob loves those people.

1074
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,960
And friends, Bob's been out moving.

1075
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,820
His bowels of his chest.

1076
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,260
Church.

1077
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,240
Are erupting.

1078
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,180
With believers.

1079
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,120
Coming, rushing out the door.

1080
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,980
The mighty cathedral dogs.

1081
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:20,920
Here they come.

1082
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,120
He's going to walk his people down by the river.

1083
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,600
He's going to start them drowning his people.

1084
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,240
He's going to hold their heads under the water.

1085
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,360
Praise Bob.

1086
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,040
He's going to keep them down there.

1087
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,400
On their kicking and fighting.

1088
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,860
On their feet displacing.

1089
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,520
Water bubbles coming up.

1090
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,660
Water drowning.

1091
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,080
Water drowning.

1092
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,340
Best friends, you too can be baptized.

1093
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:42,740
In the name of Bob.

1094
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,220
It's so many of these devivals coming up.

1095
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:45,540
Why?

1096
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,400
Indianapolis in April.

1097
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:55,100
We can poke blacks doing a tour of Europe with Hamburg, London, Amsterdam, Brussels.

1098
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,340
That's right, friends.

1099
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,460
Why drink your own urine when you can be baptized in the water of Bob?

1100
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:06,720
But me, I'm going to a regular down-home tent show revival at the Beachland Ballroom on March 15th.

1101
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,480
That's where I'm going.

1102
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,080
That's going to be a shit right there.

1103
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,220
I'll be preaching right here in Cleveland Town.

1104
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:11,740
Amen.

1105
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,200
That's where our choir is drunk.

1106
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,960
It's a drunk audience in a bar.

1107
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,960
Drunk with the fervor of the lard.

1108
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,580
You don't get up at 7 o'clock on a Sunday morning and put on some stiff shoot.

1109
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,800
No, ma'am, sir.

1110
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:36,960
You get up at 2 o'clock in the afternoon on Saturday and stumble bum your way down into a bar.

1111
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,620
Get drunk and that's where you worship Bob.

1112
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:39,800
I can't.

1113
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,000
No, I can't.

1114
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:41,020


1115
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,200
No, I can't.

1116
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,620
And then you crawl out into that gutter.

1117
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,300
I can feel it.

1118
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,120
Wrap your arms around that filthy old toilet in that bar.

1119
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,100
Wait a minute, I can feel it.

1120
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:48,860
And you know you've met Bob.

1121
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,080
My tibia is swelling up.

1122
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,360
And you open your mouth and you pray.

1123
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,420
That's the side of my face.

1124
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:53,900
I can't feel it.

1125
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,120
Sleep.

1126
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,800
And there goes running away.

1127
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,200
Watch.

1128
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:00,520
Look out.

1129
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,140
Hey, don't let it run up your pant leg, man.

1130
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:08,760
These are the beautiful, lackluster, sunshiny, halcyon children of Bob.

1131
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,000
Drinking their own urine.

1132
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,460
Drinking their own urine in a baptismal font.

1133
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:17,220
And dancing drunkenly all over Stang's protuberant, diseased body.

1134
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:23,840
This is a feast for sore eyes and a sore eyeball for the rest of us.

1135
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:31,040
And in the catacombs beneath the lovely pastoral fields where frolic the happy subgeniuses,

1136
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,020
down below dwell the Morlock subgeniuses.

1137
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,640
Those who were once emergentiles.

1138
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,840
Who now serve.

1139
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,020
And yet feed upon those who were once the rewardians.

1140
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,180
And now they are eating each other.

1141
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,280
The rewardians.

1142
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:50,760
And this man.

1143
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,120
Picking on a hollow log.

1144
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,860
Something like this.

1145
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,820
Next thing I hear is something down to pig pen.

1146
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,000
Going something like this.

1147
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,940
That's the old sign.

1148
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,820
Twelve little pig.

1149
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,240
Next thing I hear is something down to pig pen.

1150
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,480
Oh, I guess this is a guy who sampled animal sounds, huh?

1151
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,320
That's Johnson doing.

1152
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,400
No, that is an egg.

1153
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,100
That's a terrible sampler he's got.

1154
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,000
No, the man is sampling parts of his body.

1155
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,220
He presses navel.

1156
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,260
He presses abdomen.

1157
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,080
Different sounds like the cat gut.

1158
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,280
He presses his chest.

1159
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,420
You hear the wheezing sound.

1160
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,940
He plays his nose.

1161
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,380
You hear the boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

1162
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,400
No, you hear nothing.

1163
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,020
Listen very carefully.

1164
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,620
See, this is his bad dreaming.

1165
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,740
He cannot focus.

1166
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
He cannot hold one single thought.

1167
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,100
That was another of the complaints.

1168
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,080
No focus.

1169
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,140
And no goals.

1170
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,420
And no motivation.

1171
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,200
No goals.

1172
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,300
We have no goals.

1173
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,500
And we have no focus.

1174
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,840
Why should we have goals?

1175
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,600
Why should we have focus?

1176
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:49,820
What are goals?

1177
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,420
What are focus?

1178
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:50,880
What?

1179
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,060
This universe is billions and billions of years old.

1180
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,460
Why don't we need that?

1181
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:59,440
Anything we could focus on or have as a goal would be a pathetic, trivial, tenuous...

1182
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,080
Full consciousness.

1183
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,320
It will blow away in the wind.

1184
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,600
You could spend your whole life working on one great masterpiece.

1185
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,040
Who will remember it a hundred years from now?

1186
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:08,540
Nobody.

1187
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,580
It will be dust.

1188
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,220
All of it.

1189
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,820
It was dust before you came.

1190
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,880
It will be dust afterwards.

1191
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,700
You better enjoy it while you can, my friend.

1192
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,980
Everything is dust.

1193
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,700
Or you're stupid.

1194
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,320
Avroul.

1195
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,520
Now, you don't want to start off your day like this.

1196
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:27,540
You don't want to live in that catacomb by yourself with those sounds everywhere, do you?

1197
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,960
You want to lift your eyes up skyward one day and see that brilliant shaft of light coming down

1198
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,740
to exhume your corpse, resurrect you, and burn you again as you live.

1199
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,500
That's the only way.

1200
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,740
A church?

1201
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,680
Up with...

1202
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,040
That's right.

1203
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,560
It's slack, dear friends.

1204
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,340
Come up out of the catacombs.

1205
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:54,260
Leave those shuffling old cowled homosexual barefoot monks.

1206
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:59,840
They've shuffled to smooth that path in the rock over a thousand years.

1207
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:05,420
But you can shuffle a new path up the mountain side to the peak.

1208
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,480
And finally, to leap off into space.

1209
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:09,720
And finally, to leap off into space.

1210
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:16,300
Where Bob will catch you in his pipe, light you up, inhale you into his lungs, and pass

1211
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,880
you out, out into a new life.

1212
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,780
Wear the bright green polygon hat of nature.

1213
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,000
Make your body into strange tetrahedrons.

1214
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,120
Slip into the earth.

1215
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:35,800
With new identification and new papers and nobody will know where you went.

1216
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,060
A new identity for you.

1217
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,720
Why do you think they call it a new identity?

1218
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,040
I'm Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1219
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:48,900
Do you think popular bull girl Davina would be able to find him any other way?

1220
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,940
Why do you think they call them all lonesome?

1221
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,300
Why do you keep talking about their disease?

1222
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:57,220
You can be, as Dr. Drummond said, what you won't...

1223
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:58,780
...to be.

1224
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,120
What? No. Not what you want, but what you...

1225
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,680
You can be what you won't.

1226
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,220
You will never be that thing that you want to be.

1227
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,200
But yet you can be it.

1228
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,740
Or not to want to be.

1229
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,560
Be all you want.

1230
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,280
Pull the wool of your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusion.

1231
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,240
Want to be or not want to be.

1232
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:20,760
Shear your own vegetables and put the slimy wool on your own eyes.

1233
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,320
As is thy won't.

1234
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,360
Won't you?

1235
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,680
So until then, kids, it's time to keep fooling yourself.

1236
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:35,120
When you wake up in the morning and mom and dad have a hot cup of oatmeal for you

1237
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,180
and a slice of red original pie...

1238
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,540
...don't just stand there singing those same old songs.

1239
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,440
Don't go for the gun and don't go for the rubber gloves.

1240
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,640
Mom and dad are there to hurt you.

1241
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,180
Till next week, keep your head on tight.

1242
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,960
You're back to the wind and you're sacking the saddle.

1243
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,000
We'll see y'all. Remember that.

1244
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,440
Not to protect you, not to help you, but to hurt you.

1245
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,880
Mom and dad are your enemy.

1246
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,300
Mom and dad.

1247
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,500
Oh, the sleepy love, baby.

1248
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,980
Oh, the booger man.

1249
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,380
And kids, you...

1250
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,900
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
