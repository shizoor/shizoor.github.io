1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
You may think your husband has never killed a man, but you're wrong.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,340
And before I take him in to face the charges, he'll try to kill me.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,600
Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,280
Why?

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:24,420
Skunk, skunk, skunk, skunk, skunk, skunk, skunk.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,720
Kill me.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,640
In the House, 11 Democrats and 10 Republicans died last night.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,200
Last night, commercial telemarketers voted for the measure,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,900
with one voting for almost an hour, and 215 senators not voting.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,320
Last night in the House, both the House and Senate voted for drugs last night.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,780
The U.S. Senate is spending its stake on the right of your screen.

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,120
Last night.

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,540
And they weren't arrested.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,140
Help! We're being invaded!

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,820
The civil bureaus of world governments have been engaged in an incredible and deep cover-up

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,500
of the real menace of the stepped-up UFO invasion of their target, Earth.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,800
The police departments of the world are helpless before the kidnappers of the UFO.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,980
This, too, we now know to be fact.

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,960
...that the Legionnaire's disease...

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,300
...is just a test run by the conspiracy for some certain nerve...

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,280
...nerve gas and germ warfare there.

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,860
They go after patriots first.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,900
Now, that's...

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,560
It doesn't...

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,640
It doesn't matter who's in office, because it's all hidden from us.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,060
CBS and Time magazine...

27
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,980
...sheer conspiracy.

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,360
That's...

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,800
...sheer conspiracy garbage.

30
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,920
We found out that...

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,140
...the front page to the back, I don't know.

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,700
That's right.

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,840
We found out, for instance, on our own, that Jimmy Carter, Mondale, Walter Cronkite, all those big guys in power,

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,800
they're Russian clones.

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,780
They're doubles that have been put in there.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
By the men in black.

37
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,460
Damn it.

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,760
Human flesh is porky meaty.

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,420
Whoa!

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,820
We are the men in black.

41
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,800
We are the men in black.

42
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,860
Big time in Washington.

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,780
Preacher, with me, had a man.

44
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm a man.

45
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,900
Why is he acting so strange?

46
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,380
Do you think he's one of them?

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:52,780
Guys, you were talking about how you saw Earth, and the Church saw Earth, as an intergalactic truck stop for aliens.

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,720
That's right.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,700
That's one of the reasons why we're here.

50
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:55,700


51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,540
That's one of the reasons why you see so many UFO reports and things.

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,500
Enlarge on that.

53
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,040
How does this work into the Church?

54
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:09,640
Well, basically, we feel that there's going to be some extra ornery aliens landing in about 1998.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
And to them, we're nothing more than little insects.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:21,140
And they're going to be leaving some high technology equipment that's so far and above anything that we can comprehend.

57
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,960
It's going to be like giving the atomic bomb to a nursery school.

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,500
We're dying to be invaded and put the flame on something concrete.

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,420
Waiting for the UFOs.

60
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
Waiting for the UFOs.

61
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,780
We are waiting for the UFOs.

62
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,920
We know that they're there.

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,600
In Revelation, it says,

64
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,240
Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him.

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:59,940
Well, number one, to say that Christ is reigning over the Earth now would be to me a horrible disappointment.

66
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,800
We are still living in a world that is ruled by Satan.

67
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,340
And it shall be until Jesus does return again.

68
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,440
A space probe is now traveling in our solar system, monitoring life on Earth.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,780
It may already have been seen by American astronauts.

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Gemini 7 here, USA 90 read.

71
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,320
Have bogey at 10 o'clock on.

72
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,440
You and Mr. Sulu will match course and speed with the object on our sensors, exactly.

73
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,420
So we have a bogey at 10 o'clock on.

74
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,900
Bogey is the code word for an unidentified aircraft.

75
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,060
But a bogey in space is almost beyond belief.

76
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,680
Or is it?

77
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,880
He has sensors.

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,860
I want him to think that we're a reflection.

79
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,240
Sad cake.

80
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,400
They live in their own dimension.

81
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,660
So we see only their servants, the human arms.

82
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,540
The Aetherian overlords of the UFO have thinking minds, feelings, and emotions like we do.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,120
It all screwed up.

84
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,440
I had seven of them after me.

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,280
Are you really?

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,580
Why did you say you're from outer space?

87
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,400
Because I am.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,900
Now don't say that.

89
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,940
Have you been out there?

90
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,780
See, that's the important thing.

91
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,520
Nobody's been there.

92
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,900
They got six clowns, one marine officer, and the rest of the Navy guys trying to get a piece of cement up in the air.

93
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,380
I believe in flying saucers.

94
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,780
I talked to a clown the other day.

95
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,600
He said, that's a lot of jazz.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,440
I said, are you reading Popular Mechanics or looking out?

97
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,320
I said, I've never seen any, but there are 400 billion stars out there.

98
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,880
Is this the only hip planet?

99
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,420
Everybody's got to see everything.

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,620
They're all, you know, from Missouri.

101
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,480
I see.

102
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,540
I don't believe anything.

103
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,580
It's going to happen, boy, when we land.

104
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,460
It's not going to be like H.G. Wells or any of the clowns, you know, space after dark and all that.

105
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,420
We're going to come in on Halloween so that it's a big joke anyway.

106
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,520
You know, trick or treat.

107
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,900
Charles Adams thing and say, hello, lady.

108
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,680
I'm from Mars.

109
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,520
Oh, you got a wonderful costume on.

110
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,560
All right, next.

111
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,160
What a great way.

112
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,620
We'd never attack on Christmas.

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,980
But Halloween is meat for us.

114
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,520
And all the little kids bug him to death.

115
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,320
Look at him, boy.

116
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,740
He looks all fuzzy and green and everything.

117
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,200
All right.

118
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,760
We're ready to go.

119
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,380
14.

120
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,920
Gee, that was really interesting.

121
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,920
Thank you very much, Mr. Opinion.

122
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Oh, pardon me.

123
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,480
I was possessed for a second by one of those alien trans creatures.

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,880
Well, I noticed your skin started to flush terribly when you did that.

125
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,380
Is that normal or does that have to do with the.

126
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
Only when the creatures take over.

127
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,700
I'm trying to fight them off.

128
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,940
Pardon me.

129
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,800
We have a problem with some of these alien conspiracy members trying to take over our brains.

130
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,100
And that's how you fight them back?

131
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,600
With the.

132
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,180
We use that.

133
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,840
We use that.

134
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,200
What do you call that?

135
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,000
The salute?

136
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,380
Yeah, that's the salute.

137
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,800
Do you have to practice that a lot in front of the mirror or behind the mirror?

138
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,140
Yeah, we practice these meditations for hours at a time.

139
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,580
Or sometimes it's completely spontaneous.

140
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,220
It's something that you realize needs to be done and your face will respond in such a way.

141
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,180
Well, what do you think about like if visitors from other planets, supposedly, was a little bit more sensitive to the environment.

142
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,180


143
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,080
And that they would be more sensitive to the environment.

144
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:29,240
Yeah, that's one theory I've heard that maybe the human race in a couple of thousand years gets so advanced that they create time control.

145
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:38,900
In other words, we have a feeling that if they create time control, it'll probably be from using our subgenius patented time control devices.

146
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,880
If they come back, it's only to grease their mistakes.

147
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,060
That's the only reason.

148
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,240
They're just trying to remake history.

149
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,020
I'm afraid.

150
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:53,840
I've heard things, you know, like on radio talk shows, like on Ed Bush talk shows, as a matter of fact, that some people called in.

151
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,240
And I read in some magazines, too, that they were working on some kind of a time contraption.

152
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,460
Maybe we have sent giant shock waves throughout the universe.

153
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,320
And the aetherians are here on Earth trying to find out what they can do about this intrusion.

154
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,140
Stay seated.

155
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,340
It's a bit hard to swallow.

156
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:15,820
Yeah.

157
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:27,520
You expect us to really believe that someone has duped us to the point where we would actually elect to office or actually tune in on our TV someone who's not an American?

158
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,580
You think that's bad?

159
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,220
They're being manipulated by creatures from outer space.

160
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,640
We found that advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from inside the hollow Earth are conspiring to take over this whole planet.

161
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,500
Folks, this diatribe will continue right after this break.

162
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,120
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,000
It's reasonable to expect that the 1980s were the best.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,580
The Nazis will have its share of death and destruction.

165
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,140
Gentlemen, the situation at this time is so serious that it's the worst in human history.

166
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,780
The fate of the entire Earth is in our hands.

167
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,920
Every hour, we are getting news that our factories and our refineries and schools are being attacked with rays of an unknown origin.

168
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,120
They haven't been analyzed so far.

169
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,700
Thousands of people are dead.

170
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,160
The attacks are not coming from outer space, our scientists say.

171
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,200
and certain monsters have been seen that appear to come from before the ice age,

172
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,520
long before the history of mankind.

173
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,520
They have to be stopped.

174
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,560
Here to tell us all about this princess dragon mom

175
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,220
is our scientific expert, Professor Chang.

176
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,200
We and many others believe that the next decade, beginning in 1980,

177
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,520
holds the greatest prophetic potential

178
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,560
since the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.

179
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:48,120
Our planet will witness only three cometary visitors from outer space.

180
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,360
However, in 1980, there will be eight comets in our solar system.

181
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,900
Thus, there are eleven horns of the political monstrosity

182
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,220
of the beast of Daniel 7, verses 7 and 8.

183
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,720
The Bible declares that the heavens are for signs

184
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,540
and Jesus is for signs.

185
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,420
This exhorts us to look for signs

186
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,960
which will be in the heavens in the last days.

187
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,600
I...

188
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,840
One already fell.

189
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,820
Frightening signs are already tumbling from the heavens.

190
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,980
And then Jesus Christ comes back with you and me.

191
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,620
Men's hearts paling them for fear,

192
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,400
for looking after those things which have come to pass on the earth,

193
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,540
for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

194
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,600
And now we're reading the identical truths in Reader's Digest.

195
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,300
I tell you, the time is short.

196
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,400
The signs are here.

197
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,780
When you're coming back, Jesus,

198
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,120
when you see unusual space phenomena.

199
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,700
It started in 57.

200
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,460
How would you like a $1,000 contribution to your faith?

201
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,540
I would love it.

202
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,220
All right, show me one flying saucer

203
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,000
or one legitimate person from outer space.

204
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,740
I keep asking you, but you never come up with one.

205
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
Like I told you, Joe, I don't think you'd believe it.

206
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,200
That's what I mean.

207
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,860
Well, that's only because you know that I don't believe you, right?

208
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,800
You don't believe there's people on other planets?

209
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,160
We'll come to that in a moment.

210
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,140
Don't you believe the Bible?

211
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,520
Yes, we read the Bible.

212
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,980
We can sense the character of God, the author.

213
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,300
And may I say this, friend,

214
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,180
that the Bible is the only book that we could ever read

215
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,540
and we cannot understand it unless we know the author personally.

216
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,640
Good morning, Lord.

217
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,700
Morning, Archangel.

218
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
You're looking mighty spry.

219
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,800
Can't complain, Lord.

220
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,440
That's good.

221
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,380
A little bile custard, Lord.

222
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,680
Thank you very kindly.

223
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,660
It looks nice.

224
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,300
Ten cents cigar, Lord.

225
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,080
Thank you.

226
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,620
Thank you.

227
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,200
How's the fish fry going?

228
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,960
Oh, the best one yet, Lord.

229
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,760
And how you shouters getting over?

230
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,060
Keeping the marching and singing the whole morning.

231
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,900
I hear you.

232
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,840
You're getting as good as the choir at the throne.

233
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,560
What?

234
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,400
What's the matter, Lord?

235
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,920
I ain't just sure yet.

236
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,740
There's something about this custard.

237
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,100
Ain't it all right, Lord?

238
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,080
It don't seem seasoned just right.

239
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,900
Did you make it?

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,500
Yes, Lord.

241
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,560
I put everything in it like all it does.

242
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,080
It's supposed to be perfect.

243
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,160
Yes, I can taste the eggs and cream and the sugar.

244
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,780
Oh, I know what it is.

245
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
It needs a little bit more firmament.

246
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,280
Oh, there's firmament in it, Lord.

247
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,500
Maybe, but it ain't enough.

248
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,140
It's all we had.

249
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,180
There ain't a drop left in the jug.

250
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,580
Oh, that's all right.

251
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,960
I'll just rob back and pass America.

252
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,940
Let there be some firmament.

253
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,520
And when I say let there be some firmament,

254
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,040
I don't mean no little bitty dab of firmament.

255
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,060
In case I'm getting sick and tired of running out of it when we need it.

256
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,160
Let there be a whole mess of firmament.

257
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,960
That's the way I like it.

258
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,360
Well, he's got the order.

259
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
There's a lot of firmament.

260
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,800
You'll see me when you've been free.

261
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,440
Where's you, you, you?

262
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,100
You gonna get it all cut out, Lord.

263
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,520
She's so good of skin.

264
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,620
There's plenty too much firmament.

265
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,960
Well, of course I don't want the children to catch cold.

266
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,160
Can't we dream it all?

267
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,280
There's no place to dream it, Lord.

268
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,620
Why don't we just take the babies home, Lord?

269
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,740
No, I don't want to bust up the fish fry.

270
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,060
You angels keep quiet, and I'll pass another miracle.

271
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
That's the trouble with miracles.

272
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,680
When you pass one, you always gotta rob back and pass another.

273
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,760
Let there be a place to dream off this firmament.

274
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,140
Let there be mountains and valleys.

275
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,540
And let there be oceans and lakes.

276
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,520
And let there be rivers and bayous to dream it off in too.

277
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,060
As a matter of fact,

278
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,580
let there be the earth.

279
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,160
And when that's done,

280
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,660
let there be the sun.

281
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,080
And let it come out and dry my cherub's wings.

282
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,040
I'm only thirteen.

283
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,600
But I look forward to the enchanting moment of my death.

284
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,340
When God will tell me the punchline.

285
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,760
Everything in the universe is running down.

286
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,760
The word of God informs us that the heavens will become old.

287
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,100
And,

288
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,440
like worn out garments,

289
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,620
they will ultimately be rolled up and discarded.

290
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,500
The alien intelligences of the UFO and the human earthlings

291
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,460
are all common inhabitants of the cosmic energy intelligence continuum.

292
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,580
The ordinary kind, weak and flimsy.

293
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,600
Yet no world scientific agency or government group

294
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,360
has seriously studied the problems of UFO encounters.

295
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,540
Or murders.

296
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,080
Or kidnappings.

297
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,940
Or losses of aircraft due to the UFO.

298
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,400
Is the UFO mystery truly a scientific watergate?

299
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,600
An incredible and dangerous cover-up?

300
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,220
Understanding of the UFO may be beyond our science and political system.

301
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,060
Twisted them to fit the Nazi ideology.

302
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,120
Thank you.

303
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,980
Uh, praise the old doctors, friends.

304
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,340
That was all from Media Barrage number two.

305
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,000
One of the very eldest of subgenius audio collage tapes.

306
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,240
Assembled by yours truly with a lot of help.

307
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,320
From the infant Dr. Philo Drummond.

308
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,640
A tiny baby long gone subgenius named Shep Webb.

309
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,100
The teeny tiny baby puzzling evidence.

310
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,220
Little glass madness.

311
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,540
Little sterno.

312
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,680
Huh?

313
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,180
Is this another message perhaps?

314
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,360
I fear it is a message from So-So Dada, my friends.

315
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,080
From his opera, Extase Six.

316
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,160
The

317
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,720
Well, and this is a persistent part of the flying sauce.

318
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:35,960
Yeah.

319
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:35,960


320
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,480
I'm not sure if you're familiar with the saucer phenomenon.

321
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,400
The people who have close contact with the saucers return with messages of universal

322
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,900
brotherhood and benevolence with stories of a beneficent hegemony of organized intelligence.

323
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:58,660
Where wiser, older worlds and civilizations help younger and less mature worlds toward

324
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,700
a kind of galactic citizenship.

325
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,880
Stick needles in my belly.

326
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,200
Take samples of my skin.

327
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,940
I'm a little bit of a nerd.

328
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:05,940


329
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:05,940


330
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:05,940


331
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:05,940


332
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:05,940


333
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:05,940


334
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:05,940


335
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,440
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer men.

336
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,040
I know that you don't take requests but I'm a special case.

337
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,600
Come on down you saucer men and take me off this space.

338
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,700
Ruff on the ruff.

339
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,060
Ruff.

340
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,680
They're milking rats.

341
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,440
Milking rats.

342
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,460
These people are mistreated.

343
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:33,060
They feel that they've been somehow exploited or hurt and that their captors really don't

344
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,540
think much.

345
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,400
As if they've been using guinea pigs.

346
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,680
Yeah.

347
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:35,920
Right.

348
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:35,920


349
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:35,920


350
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:35,920


351
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:35,920


352
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:35,920


353
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,600
They're just sort of testing.

354
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:43,040
Even if UFOs had a physical reality, could be photographed or could be weighed and measured,

355
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,720
they still might be projections of the human mind.

356
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,240
Oh yeah.

357
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,780
This is an important point to make which the flying saucer people are forever misunderstanding

358
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:58,580
and that is saying that the flying saucer is a psychic object does not mean that it

359
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,160
is not a physical object.

360
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,900
The realm of the psychic and the realm of the physical meet in the physical realm.

361
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,820
In a strange kind of never never land that we have yet to create the intellectual

362
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:18,080
tools to explore, this is where the mystery of synchronicity is going to come to rest,

363
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:26,100
the mystery of all kinds of paranormal activity on the part of human beings and the mystery

364
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,360
of the flying saucer.

365
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:35,040
It's interesting to see that if you take the broad world so called mystery, parapsychological

366
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,880
shamans.

367
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:44,280
Monarch, extraterrestrial, so forth and hypothesize another spatial dimension, one more spatial

368
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,900
dimension, then suddenly all these mysteries become trivial.

369
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,140
They are easily done.

370
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,740
Lost boxes are open, future events are discerned, lost objects are found.

371
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:04,860
This sort of thing becomes quite the ordinary run of things if we hypothesize dimensions

372
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,680
hidden from ordinary human beings.

373
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,120
And of course there is serious work at this point in the field of physics.

374
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,740
Yes, it's quite feasible.

375
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,640
A parallel world, a planet, a whole new life form developing in much the same way as our

376
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,400
own in a distant solar system.

377
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,300
It's all here in document 14.

378
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,480
Good.

379
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:33,700
As time has passed and the number of sightings has gone from hundreds of thousands to hundreds

380
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:40,840
of thousands of instances, as the myth has fleshed itself out with sub-themes, the theme

381
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:48,900
of abduction, the theme of telepathic contact, it's become much more difficult to fit all

382
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:56,220
the known facts into simple models of the faith-bearing visitors from another world.

383
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,320
So what we are left with then are a number of more exotic competing theories about the

384
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,600
universe.

385
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,460
Okay, it's now painfully clear.

386
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,380
The adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people.

387
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,140
You fool!

388
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,440
Can't you see it's a massive government conspiracy?

389
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,400
Or have they gotten to you too?

390
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,020
Hey, hey, hey, stop it, stop it!

391
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,440
Why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions?

392
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,640
Haven't you ever heard of Occam's razor?

393
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,480
The simplest explanation is probably the correct one.

394
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,240
So what's the simplest explanation?

395
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,360
I don't know.

396
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,300
Maybe they're all wrong.

397
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


398
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


399
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


400
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


401
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


402
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


403
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


404
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


405
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


406
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


407
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


408
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


409
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,440
They're all wrong.

410
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:33,540


411
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:33,540


412
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,160
We're first vampires and they have to get home before dark.

413
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,780
We're first vampires!

414
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,580
We're first vampires!

415
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,660
We're first vampires!

416
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,100
We're first vampires!

417
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,760
We're through the looking glass here, people.

418
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,600
Now it's time we screwed them.

419
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,940
I'm ready for that knowledge and I don't want to join a cult.

420
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,720
Join my cult.

421
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,180
I mean, maybe we should start one.

422
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,840
Just a couple nice guys like us.

423
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,100
Just two guys like us.

424
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,260


425
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,920
Shun charisma.

426
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,220
That's the great trap.

427
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:00,720
Uh-huh.

428
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,120
What?

429
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,180
What's up? Wait a minute! Wait a minute! A full suni from the planet Bob is trying to park his flying saucer down the whole world over their breakfast!

430
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,780
Well, that's pity for you, fish face!

431
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,340
Oh!

432
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:22,060
Pardon me a minute. I hear you all talking in the back. Yeah, keep talking. I can hear you back there. You won't be talking after July 5th. You'll be screaming in pain.

433
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:41,420
What the USOs are doing to us is they are eroding space in science by casting directly in the path of science a kind of darkness, a challenge, a craft dish.

434
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:50,720
Almost as though the cosmic giggles had shown up at the bachelor party of science to spoil the bath.

435
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,040
The USOs are doing this.

436
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,200
The UFO challenges the assumptions of science.

437
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,880
Gentlemen!

438
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,860
Doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor. How many doctors are there on this planet?

439
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:11,960
Professor Simpson and his team have just completed a thorough physical examination of the aliens and he has come to the conclusion that they are...

440
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,360
The UFOs are operating almost at the mythological level of our culture. They're not landing in the White House.

441
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:21,840
They're...

442
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,460
They're not really challenging the military or NASA.

443
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:40,400
No, they're very mercurial, very watery. When you reach out toward them, there is nothing there. What they chiefly have become is an intellectual force in human thinking about the future, caught in the rational net.

444
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:49,160
Your description is strikingly actually parallel to the view of many fundamentalist Christians who say this UFO stuff is all the work of the devil.

445
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,040
Which is known throughout the universe for its stupendous nature.

446
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,880
Even your Buddha and your Christ had quite a different vision, but nobody's paid much attention to them, not even the Buddhists or the Christians.

447
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,900
Well, I don't know about the work of the devil.

448
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,700
You humans, sometimes it's hard to imagine how you've made it this far.

449
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,640
Jung's criticism of Christianity was that it had not made a place for what he called the shadow.

450
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:21,280
And he said Christian culture will always be neurotic because the shadow has not been included.

451
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,440
So there's a lack of psychic balance.

452
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,040
It's funny, because it's true.

453
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,800
Well observed.

454
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:32,080
Perhaps the UFO carries compensatory psychic energy from the realm of the shadow.

455
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,700
Some people are very frightened of it.

456
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,540
Dad!

457
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,460
Don't shoot in the light!

458
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,560
Don't shoot in the light!

459
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,920
There's a UFO outside my window! Seriously!

460
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,180
Can I sit on the roof of the baseball bat in case a UFO does come?

461
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,740
Yes, yes, yes, that's fine. Good, good.

462
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,560
Some people see it as an almost millenarian, salvational hope.

463
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,480
The U.S. Army has come, you smart bastard!

464
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,820
The aliens are here! We're all going to die!

465
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,720
Some people see it as a savior of mankind.

466
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,480
So naive.

467
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,580
I think that it's very powerful that it haunts time like a ghost.

468
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,700
That the messianic anticipations of fundamentalist Christianity and Islam

469
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,700
are in fact a kicking up on the shock wave

470
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,220
that the image of the flying saucer cast backwards through time,

471
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,940
that this image of the New Jerusalem, the foregated city,

472
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,420
descending from the sky to whisk the elect away to a better place,

473
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:41,240
is a kind of prophecy yearning toward a fact in the act of becoming.

474
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,000
If ever there was a time when the skills that you are endowed with

475
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,340
were what we have need of, then this is it.

476
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,840
You're older and you see all this.

477
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,100
Unfortunately, we just get madder.

478
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,660
That's right.

479
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,120
And more, and say, gee, we thought this was going to be all known years ago.

480
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,460
We were looking forward to a marvelous future.

481
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,520
And it's been put off and put off.

482
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,040
And now we look to maybe our grandchildren, or maybe our great-grandchildren.

483
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,660
Great-grandchildren.

484
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,920
And maybe even after that, enjoying the intercourse between the higher advanced civilization

485
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,500
and interplanetary travel.

486
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,620
It's in our future. There's no way we can escape it. It's there.

487
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,300
You suggest that UFOs are deliberately trying to manipulate our subconscious mind,

488
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,580
to create a mythology in our culture about themselves,

489
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,880
which is one of the reasons that they're both physical and concrete, yet very elusive.

490
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,320
That opens the question of, could the UFO phenomenon be manipulating us?

491
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,620
Could it be a teaching system?

492
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,200
That's dumb. This earth is dumb.

493
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,260
First it's hot, then it's cold, then it's hot, then it's cold.

494
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,700
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

495
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,220
Dumb.

496
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,920
What happens to witnesses?

497
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,160
Mr. Rowe, you're certainly one of the world's leading contactees.

498
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,840
How many trips have you made to outer space?

499
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,900
Well, I'd say 350 or a few more.

500
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,060
When was the last one?

501
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,260
Well, the first part of June.

502
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,360
And who did you go with?

503
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,800
Well, people from Jupiter.

504
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,880
And where did you take off?

505
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,720
From my home.

506
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,940
Any special launching pad there?

507
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,720
No, there isn't. They come pick me up in a car.

508
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,520
Take me off to space.

509
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,680
Take me off to space.

510
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,340
Oh, now you saw the man.

511
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,900
Take me off to space.

512
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,320
Woo!

513
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:22,960
Yes!

514
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,240
Rarararara!

515
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,160
Now, what about this?

516
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,980
What would happen to you and me if we were close to that source of energy?

517
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,200
We're beginning to understand the physiological and the psychological correlations of the close encounter.

518
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:38,780
Yeah.

519
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,380
And that's something that's very difficult to convey to the believers in UFOs,

520
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,060
the believers in the old green man from space.

521
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,540
At that level, it really doesn't matter whether UFOs are real or not.

522
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,100
If enough people believe that something is real, then it is real in its effects.

523
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,160
In terms of social reality.

524
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,520
What?

525
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:13,640
Oh, thank you, Susie the floozy, the incredibulous Susie the floozy, Reverend Susie the floozy from WREK in Atlanta,

526
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,320
in pursuit of her show, Bob's Slacktime Funhouse, numbers 477.

527
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:27,080
She edited all that and this wonderfulous material about X-Day, the coming X-Day,

528
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:34,620
when our beloved alien masters, the men from Planet X, will sooner or later finally show up and all that.

529
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,220
Ah, yes.

530
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,440
Welcome to your source of...

531
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,440
I am Pleasure Goddess CV 456154.

532
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,860
Sexual gratification and desire for film will begin in a moment.

533
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:02,040
First, we invite you to look out your window, say goodbye to the pinks who were left behind.

534
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,100
Now unzip your pants.

535
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,020
Just sit back and relax.

536
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,420
Feel better.

537
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,000
Bob and Connie shall be happy.

538
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000


539
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000


540
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,800
We shall be teleporting over shortly to congratulate you on your success as a subgenius.

541
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,840
The option to copulate with either can be taken advantage of then.

542
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,660
I have taken the liberty of preparing a warning prop.

543
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,720
The time is 8 a.m. July 5th.

544
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,660
I shall leave now.

545
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,140
Press the blue button.

546
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,220
Should you need me, goodbye.

547
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,440
Bye.

548
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:40,200
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

549
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,160
Ah, wonderful friends.

550
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,440
Among the promises of X-Day, and believe me, there are lots of promises involved in X-Day,

551
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,160
among those are woe-tanning and ranting.

552
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:58,580
Woe-tanning, or doctor music, where a band or people who've never ever played any musical

553
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:06,180
instrument, such as those heard in the background, the Minoan brain eaters, can get up on stage

554
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,520
and jam or rant or whatnot.

555
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,200
True ranting, of course.

556
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,600
Comes from the gut and is generally sort of angry sounding.

557
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:25,600
In this recording, we can hear somewhat the great young ranter, Reverend Carter LeBlanc,

558
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:33,160
as he takes up the mic over the warm-up band for the amino acids, which call themselves

559
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,120
the Minoan brain eaters.

560
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,540
Let's just tune in for a minute, shall we?

561
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,900
This is a terrible subject, he says.

562
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,260
No real party, I say.

563
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,560
We are dwelling in the hour of strife and delusions.

564
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,400
This is a time of blindness.

565
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,780
This is a time of delirium.

566
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,360
This is a time of deception, self-deception.

567
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:09,020
There is a lie that we've been told to lie about people, and we've been told to lie about people.

568
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,660
The world is full of lies.

569
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,040
It's the eternal paradox.

570
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,340
Give me false slack or kill me?

571
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,260
Is that what you're saying?

572
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,520
Give me false slack or kill me?

573
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,240
Is that what one said to Reverend Carter?

574
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,460
Well, slack is better than no sign of shit.

575
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,740
Bullshit.

576
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,220
False slack is no slack at all.

577
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,960
We all know what too much is.

578
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,620
Too much isn't when the vending machine gives you the extra pack of the M&M's.

579
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,500
That may be more than you deserve, but that's not too much.

580
00:31:51,540 --> 00:32:01,100
Too much is when the things that life gives you are so real, so rewarding, amazing, funny shit,

581
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,600
you pick them up.

582
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,340
That is when you are not alone.

583
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,200
You are not alone.

584
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Now, if you will, this is a time to bring a new meaning to every life.

585

590
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,420
Thank you.

591
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,440
Thank you.

592
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,020
Thank you.

593
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,440
Thank you.

594
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,800
Thank you.

595
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,400
Thank you.

596
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,560
Thank you.

597
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,440
Thank you.

598
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,660
Thank you.

599
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,780
Thank you.

600
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,340
Thank you.

601
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,800
Thank you.

602
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,720
Thank you.

603
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,040
Thank you.

604
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,720
Thank you.

605
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:06,760
Thank you.

606
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,060
The Third Testimony

607
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,340
The Third Testimony

608
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,060
The Third Testimony

609
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,400
The Third Testimony

610
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,660
Thank you.

611
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,720
Thank you.

612
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,480
Thank you.

613
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,500
great crowd has caused to feel that you've lied, it will become an angry mob.

614
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,320
And then, God help you all.

615
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,700
You can tell by looking through there. We always run it real close.

616
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,960
It's like if the saucers did arrive, that's when the tape and the battery

617
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,640
would both run out at the same time.

618
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,280
Think how much the home movies from Heaven's Gate were worth.

619
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,340
Of course, that's because they went the distance.

620
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,920
I don't see anybody here sucking down any Kool-Aid.

621
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,040
No, well, the words are right. That's true.

622
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,820
That's not a funny word.

623
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,980
And kids nowadays, they don't even know the significance of the Kool-Aid.

624
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,760
They don't remember Jonestown. They don't even remember Dobstown.

625
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,720
They're lucky if they know what happened at Waco.

626
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,960
What really happened at Waco. The Waco Divival.

627
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,800
Dr. Doctrine has been here every 7 a.m.

628
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Along with who else? You guys have been here every damn 7 a.m.

629
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,400
The Fulcreties.

630
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,040
You know, I'm not sure that that's something to brag about, you guys.

631
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,000
I mean, how many times? This will be the eighth time, if we're not lucky,

632
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,920
that we go home and everybody goes,

633
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,140
Well, how was your ride in the escape vessel?

634
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,960
We didn't show up for the thrill station a fifth.

635
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,220
Fifth.

636
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,760
That's right.

637
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:11,320
And that's why Princess Wee and I, this time, changed our clothes, took showers.

638
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,740
Pope Fred.

639
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,080
Look, look, Pastor Pressure is looking his best.

640
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,400
He's taking his first bath in months.

641
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:29,300
Because this time, we're not going to drive the exits off with our smell and our poor...

642
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,420
Potion of hydrogen.

643
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:31,940
Potion of hydrogen.

644
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,380
Yeah, first our bad personal hygiene and our crappy dress code.

645
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,740
We're going to look and be our best.

646
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,520
Freaky suits.

647
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,140
We might try praying.

648
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,440
We might.

649
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:44,840
And who?

650
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,980
You know, we've never done that.

651
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,800
We're going to pray.

652
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,380
We're going to pray.

653
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,480
We're going to pray to God.

654
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,340
Come on.

655
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,760
You pray to...

656
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,700
P-R-E-Y or P-R-A-Y?

657
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,880
A-I-A-I-O.

658
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,920
When was the last time you prayed to Bob?

659
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,280
Or Jehovah One or Ne-Key or any, any, any...

660
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,740
I pray to Bob every day.

661
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,500
Bob gives me free parking wherever I go.

662
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,180
I don't mean like with the bathroom, the stroke books.

663
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:13,900
I mean...

664
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:22,740
You bow on your knees and knees and going, Bob, Bob, please, this one time, let it really

665
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,420
be 1998 and July 5th all at the same time.

666
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,420
Wouldn't that be nice?

667
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,000
Just by, just to have me only, what is it now, five years off.

668
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,580
Bob and no one else.

669
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:42,120
Let none, no other deities be listening as we beseech, you fucking please, this one time.

670
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,340
Because I haven't done my taxes yet.

671
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,420
You know?

672
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,280
You must deal with him as an equal.

673
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,480
Sure.

674
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,400
I mean, I'm sure all of us have something that we wish we didn't have to get.

675
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,240
I wish we could go home too.

676
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,600
Reflective Bob shirts for sale.

677
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
Last chance.

678
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,220
Special markdown.

679
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,440
Yeah.

680
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,280
Gotta go.

681
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,160
These are all at our left.

682
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,240
Ten bucks.

683
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,380
Sold.

684
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,120
Sold.

685
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,400
The world's gonna end.

686
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:10,820
We're puppies.

687
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,940
Sure, give us stuff.

688
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,680
We're gonna make a few bucks here.

689
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,280
Sales.

690
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,200
Sales up to the last minute.

691
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,300
Proof that there's hope.

692
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,100
Now see, this is what the experts wanna see.

693
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,320
And as the ships drew them off, sales were taking place.

694
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,820
Hands.

695
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,180
Over Dob's head.

696
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,400
The legless unit expanded together.

697
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,520
Cars unmanned.

698
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,680
More stops reproduced from over 80 feet.

699
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,360
Well, not too many subgeniuses on the road at 7 o'clock in the morning.

700
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,400
That was another, see, it's called mess transit.

701
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,160
You know, I've had people go, why 7 o'clock in the goddamn morning?

702
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,340
Why didn't Bob make it, you know, Bob?

703
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,380
So you could party all night?

704
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:52,860
It's because that way the subgeniuses, he knows there aren't gonna be too many subgeniuses

705
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:52,880
on the road.

706
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,160
I had to save one for Pastor Phil.

707
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,240
Well, then how could they fulfill his edict that he's gonna have to go to the bathroom?

708
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:56,240


709
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,440
Well, he said if they see him on the road, they should kill him.

710
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:05,200
Well, hey, say, you know, if I'm not here on, if I'm not at Brushwood on X Day, I wanna

711
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,060
be on the road.

712
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,660
I wanna run controlled unmanned vehicles.

713
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,420
Somebody here has gotta be the person who's assigned to make sure we don't all kill ourselves.

714
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,380
Not I.

715
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,920
In a wiseful way.

716
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,340
Not I, said the Pope.

717
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,220
You know, that was the horrible thing.

718
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,220


719
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,220


720
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,220


721
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,220


722
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:33,080
In 98, there were all these pagans, you know, right, Brushwood sort of hangers on, who really

723
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:39,220
did believe we were going to kill ourselves, and not one of them did a goddamn thing about

724
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:39,460
it.

725
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,480
Didn't even bother us.

726
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,060
But they believed it.

727
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,100
Well, you know, you would've thought they would've at least made sure all of us were

728
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,460
up on time to get in line, but...

729
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,460
They were gonna come over here and go through our pockets and steal our drugs.

730
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,220
You know, it's wakey wakey.

731
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,140
Wakey, mister subgenius.

732
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,760
Time to get in line at the pavilion.

733
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,140
You don't wanna miss the big saucers, do you?

734
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,160
No, no, no.

735
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,700
Is it proper to feel silly when awaiting the saucers?

736
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,020
No, it's not proper.

737
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:08,940
I wouldn't think so.

738
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,540
To feel silly, but when are we proper, then?

739
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:18,660
Well, I mean, you know, if you expect the worst, then you'll always be pleasantly surprised.

740
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,080
Yes, that's right, the Church of the Subgenius, a nice pessimistic religion, unlike all the

741
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,420
others.

742
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,080
Yeah, not like those others.

743
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,080
No laughing stock like those.

744
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,640
Damn it.

745
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:39,640
It's not so much that I want to get a chance to destroy the things, or to even get all

746
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,740
my dreams come true.

747
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,880
I just don't want the Discordians to be able to laugh at us again.

748
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,640
They were smart enough not to set a timeline.

749
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:49,740
The whole time.

750
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,360
The Discordians.

751
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,580
They were smart enough not to set a real date.

752
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:53,840
Well...

753
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,640
If, you know...

754
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,360
They also don't have a bank account or a P.O.

755
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:57,840
behind them.

756
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,540
We're going to feel silly waiting for these saucers, and we have to feel silly about every

757
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,820
fiber of our cell.

758
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,280
Will we feel silly?

759
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:05,840
That's right.

760
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,720
If we're going to feel silly, then feel silly the hell out of it!

761
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,240
Don't just feel sort of embarrassed.

762
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,300
You feel just totally like the stupidest...

763
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,720
Like you want to go away and hide forever because the X's saucers did not arrive.

764
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,020
Yeah!

765
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:22,920
Yeah!

766
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,880
That's the strategy!

767
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,720
An all-consuming desire to have them land.

768
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,360
An all-consuming embarrassment.

769
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:31,500
Exactly.

770
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,760
I'm such a worm!

771
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,460
And if you don't, if you don't, then Bob will get away with it again.

772
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,460
And Bob will pocket the cash from the t-shirts and swag that have been sold to him.

773
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:42,640
What's wrong with that?

774
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,240
That's actually hardly worth the labor.

775
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,580
He'll get with it again and he'll laugh.

776
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,080
He'll go off driving in his Corvette, laughing it up, smoking his pipe.

777
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,000
No, he drives a Mustang, dude.

778
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,660
Mustang?

779
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,400
Stang, dude.

780
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,420
Bob's been driving you for years.

781
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:05,240
If, however, if, however, you truly believe that Bob will be embarrassed that we were

782
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,960
so embarrassed, we were so passionate about being embarrassed, and he will have no other

783
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,460
choice than to confront what's coming for him, which is death.

784
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,060
Alex, I think you're mistaking Bob Dobbs for the man from Give a Shit County.

785
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,700
Do you hear that?

786
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:21,980
Yeah.

787
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,020
What's up?

788
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,560
Anybody know whether the flight's on patch?

789
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,700
Hey!

790
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,320
They ruptured his GPS!

791
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,960
My battery's fell out.

792
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,260
That's what they said!

793
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,020
Well, when the body part of the time being ruptured worse one sense at a time.

794
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,360
Well, in ninety-eight, I was like a hundred pounds overweight.

795
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:44,960
Yeah.

796
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,380
You lost some fat cells.

797
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:48,840
Yeah.

798
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,020
Some horrible, disgusting fat cells.

799
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,500
I lost my sense of balance in 98.

800
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,320
P. Kitty lost his ability to make insulin.

801
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,760
I actually got too much insulin.

802
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,300
Stole it, vampire.

803
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,540
You know, a little bit of folks like G. Gordon Gordon's septum was ruptured.

804
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,040
I'm sure all of us have lost some little part.

805
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,300
Or maybe your values.

806
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,880
Maybe your innocence.

807
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:17,780
Your drugs.

808
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,720
Yeah, your driver's license.

809
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,880
Your car keys.

810
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,160
Exes take piece by piece.

811
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:36,280
And only those who are faithful and show up every 7 a.m. at Brushwood will finally have, you know, at the end will just be a hand or a foot flopping around.

812
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,360
It's down to one minute, according to my sacred watch.

813
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,800
Oh, look, Vic.

814
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,260
Don't distract me.

815
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,420
Come on, now.

816
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,800
We've got to think positive thoughts.

817
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,700
But let's be real.

818
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,300
We could play.

819
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,700
Or play me on the bimbo.

820
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,160
Or the Pagans would have drums or something.

821
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,320
It would be building up suspense.

822
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,640
It's only 30 seconds to go.

823
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,820
Four cardinal directions to summon the exes.

824
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,280
This is like getting to be like a children's show.

825
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,760
20, 20 seconds.

826
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,380
This could possibly be it.

827
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,180
Ah.

828
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,180
Oh, sure.

829
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,000
That's going to work.

830
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:29,900
10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

831
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,920
Put me in the pod.

832
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,620
I can't take a joke.

833
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:36,920
Yay.

834
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,800
So, where's the dummy that we get to string up?

835
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,920
In the middle.

836
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,820
Right there in the middle.

837
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,680
Sting you son of a bitch.

838
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,300
In the pod.

839
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,360
I already knew what was going on.

840
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,660
You're lying.

841
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:49,700
You're lying.

842
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:49,700


843
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,420
Hey, hey, hey.

844
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,240
Oh, God.

845
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,200
Ah.

846
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,360
Ah.

847
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,940
You have any idea how old I am, you bastard?

848
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,680
I'm getting it.

849
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,380
I'm getting it.

850
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:03,060
You have any idea how much older I am since X day?

851
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,000
Um.

852
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:04,740
Huh?

853
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,580
Hey, hey, look.

854
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,560
This is, we got another, it's a drill.

855
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,000
You know.

856
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,440
At this rate, if my ass doesn't drop out of my cunt, I'll be ahead of the game.

857
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,280
I am getting old.

858
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,480
Get my ass off this planet.

859
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,360
I paid my $30.

860
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,680
And unfortunately, I'm getting old.

861
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:19,680


862
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:19,680


863
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:19,680


864
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:19,680


865
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:19,680


866
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:19,680


867
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:19,680


868
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:19,680


869
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,580
You know, right now, I still have a voice.

870
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,400
This is what I get paid for.

871
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,540
You got a problem with that?

872
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,200
Where's the guy that always laughs at us?

873
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,340
He didn't even bother to show up this time.

874
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,680
God, this is really pathetic.

875
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:47,320
When the guy, when, when, televangelist friend, that always sneaks in without paying the $30,

876
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,880
then mocks us.

877
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,660
He goes, you know what?

878
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,520
You fucking dumb shit spent $30 thinking you were going to get to destroy the world

879
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,960
and fly to that planet X for $30.

880
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,820
And then he goes into this whole routine about, oh, it's all an allegory.

881
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,440
You know why?

882
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,860
You're being tied to this silly belief is exactly what prevents you from being saved.

883
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,260
Blah, blah, woof, woof.

884
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:19,660
As if those sacred t-shirts weren't worth the gold that, or Bob's favorite gold.

885
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,260
You're fined for zelf-destruction!

886
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,600
Didn't you know?

887
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,000
Yeah, I did, actually.

888
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,060
But Man with the Loaves but with the Lovers, again, we're fined $35,000 for taxed Antwort

889
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,060


890
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,420
Is it something baseball and golf get competitive, though?

891
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:30,420


892
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:30,420


893
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:30,420


894
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:30,420


895
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:30,420


896
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:30,420


897
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:30,440
Irило, what's something about the

898
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:37,780
f 짜i- competing withQué Dum Ka beard Kry thunder undeuuter considérabil?

899
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,680
Dona luce arte.

900
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,220
The littleホm фильма.

901
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,900
Is it as cryptographic, as Malte is doing it, what-

902
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,100
That's just depressing.

903
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,320
That's a marketing.

904
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,400
Seven times a charm!

905
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,520
Seven times a charm!

906
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,440
We still believe in...

907
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,240
Lucky seven! Lucky seven!

908
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,040
Seven come eleven.

909
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,300
And if you feel pain, maybe they will come.

910
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,220
Or if six turns out to be nine, I won't mind.

911
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,040
Well don't stand around looking at me.

912
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,200
I ran out of funny lines in 1980.

913
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:16,720
True.

914
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,920
You know.

915
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,360
Oh shit.

916
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,820
Well, what did you do?

917
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,220
It's your turn.

918
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,020
Where's Philo?

919
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,580
Let's go march up to Philo's room.

920
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,240
Philo's never been lynched at one of these things.

921
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,880
Let's toss Philo in the pod!

922
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,220
To the trailer!

923
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,440
You'll reap what you sow!

924
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,040
I'll be right behind you boys.

925
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,200
Go on up there.

926
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,820
Now here's the thing though.

927
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,220
By the very fact

928
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,320
that

929
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,620
we obviously

930
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,640
can't depend on these exact

931
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,620
you know

932
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,280
head of a pen sort of details

933
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,480
in our religion, perhaps that means that

934
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,380
why, X-Day could come

935
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,640
any day, yes, any moment

936
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,540
could be X-Day.

937
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,100
Every day is X-Day if you have a gun.

938
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,380
Every day is X-Day

939
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,880
if you're the president.

940
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,960
Every day is X-Day

941
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,360
if you're a serial killer.

942
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,100
So why not look at the bright side?

943
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,600
Like, say

944
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,020
sentient beings, the great magic power

945
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,280
of positive thinking.

946
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,580
Yes, we'll have a

947
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,440
brighter tomorrow. Full of

948
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,480
X-Days. Flying saucers and

949
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,080
sex goddesses and

950
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,800
no jobs anymore

951
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,280
and the big rock candy mountain.

952
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,020
That's it.

953
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,380
Yeah, that's the ticket.

954
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,400
The big rock candy mountain.

955
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,840
2004.

956
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,260
God, I can't believe.

957
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,560
2004. We were supposed to have

958
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,600
fucking air car, air jet

959
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,980
packs by this time.

960
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,460
We're supposed to be flying around in cool air cars.

961
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,440
Robot slaves. Where are the robot slaves?

962
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,340
The only mark

963
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,320
of the future that I've seen is the

964
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,620
really cool special effects.

965
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,240
I didn't expect them to be

966
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,320
that advanced.

967
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,400
Great. So our TV shows

968
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,620
have better, fake aliens.

969
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,820
Some future.

970
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,760
Phooey. That's what I say.

971
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,500
That's my, I am supposed

972
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,340
to be spoken. Phooey.

973
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,860
Mark my words.

974
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,460
They never believed the old

975
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,300
prophet of doom.

976
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,600
Because they're smart.

977
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,820
God damn it.

978
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,880
Once again it just

979
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,460
peters out into a depressing

980
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,360
sadness.

981
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,180
Like life itself.

982
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,480
Hopeless.

983
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:38,980
Fain.

984
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,440
Meaningless. Random movements

985
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,220
in the chaos.

986
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,440
I was talking to her, not you.

987
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,740
Where is Jesus?

988
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,520
He's a prince.

989
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,020
He's the way, he's the huggy one.

990
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,620
Wait a minute. No he's not.

991
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,540
He is the one with that

992
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,920
eternity in hell thing.

993
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,100
Good cop, bad cop.

994
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,960
They always, they always were.

995
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,700
Something has happened

996
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,860
in the motorcade route.

997
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,620
I never miss a chance to say that.

998
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,540
Maybe if we bring back

999
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:14,540


1000
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,740
Devo here the sauce was

1001
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,800
Yeah, if we had celebrities here.

1002
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,300
We tried actually.

1003
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,540
We even offered them money.

1004
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,640
But not enough.

1005
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,820
The Olsen twins are legal.

1006
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,960
They will be.

1007
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,340
Olsen twins next year.

1008
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,500
What about the two headed

1009
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,060
That two headed girl

1010
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,840
or well Siamese twins

1011
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,240
Oh yeah, co-joined twins.

1012
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,880
They'd be about 20 years old now.

1013
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,260
They were really cute.

1014
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,760
When they were

1015
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:44,880
in the magazine.

1016
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,200
Makes logistics in the tent a bit snarly.

1017
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,820
That's something to take our mind off

1018
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,440
Bob's repeated failures.

1019
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,400
Two headed babes.

1020
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:54,860
Yeah.

1021
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,940
One head, two bodies.

1022
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,620
Okay now you can all go

1023
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,480
think about the two headed pornography

1024
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,420
and forget the

1025
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,840
$30 and Bob.

1026
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,860
See you,

1027
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,920
I've got to change the film now.

1028
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,960
Bye.

1029
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,580
Texas 78720

1030
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,460
Praise the

1031
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:52,560
Bob

1032
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,560
Bob

1033
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,620
Bob

1034
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:58,620


1035
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:58,640
Bob

1036
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:58,660
Bob

1037
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:58,680
Bob

1038
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:58,700
Bob

1039
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,180
Bob

1040
00:58:59,180 --> 00:58:59,260
Bob

1041
00:58:59,260 --> 00:58:59,260


1042
00:58:59,260 --> 00:58:59,360
Bob

1043
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:14,800
Bob

1044
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:14,800


1045
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:14,800


1046
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:14,880
Bob

1047
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,200
Bob

1048
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:15,400
Bob

1049
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,260
Bob

1050
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:16,740
Bob

1051
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:16,740


1052
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:16,740


1053
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:16,740


1054
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:16,720
