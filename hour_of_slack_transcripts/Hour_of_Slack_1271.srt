1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
Huh? Order of Saint Benedict? Is that it? The homosexual Belgian monks?

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,080
You know, since the speakers aren't pointing at me, I can't understand a word you say.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,620
I'm gonna go sit between the boys.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:28,660
I can hear fine, I just, most of what my ears pick up,

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,040
they don't feel as worth sending to my brain.

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,300
Yeah, the car alarm is not worth sending to your brain.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,860
This is Phil Proctor and David Osman of the Firesign Theatre,

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,960
and we're enjoying listening to the Hour of Slag.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,760
I'm slacking off myself.

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,500
Red, you go. Where shall I go? What shall I do?

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,500
Frankly, Mike.

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,600
Here, I don't give a...

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,660
Some genius.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,120
The power of slag.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,660
What?

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,160
Hello?

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,180
The Slag Johnson program. The show opens with me.

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,340
Doing some deuce you...

19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,720
Alice, Phil.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,240
Just a minute, Danny.

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,160
What's it about?

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,060
Mine?

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,560
What?

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:21,900
Hmm?

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,720
What?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,360
What?

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:23,880
What?

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,080
But, um...

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,580
Oh.

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,300
Oh.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,500
Oh.

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,240
Oh?

33
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh.

34
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,800
Copy, boy.

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,520
Actors, directors, and playwrights have increasingly exploited urban America.

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,620
The 2nd and 3rd Bovard Auditorium presents The Truth About Hollywood Culture.

37
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,780
See one of the hip-hop characters dance and sing to sell an evening with tickets and info.

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,040
Call Danny67.

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,180
What you need is bugs.

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,880
The easy way to keep your car looking its best.

41
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,300
If you want to give added protection to the fination, save money on car washings,

42
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,660
you can apply a coat of bugs.

43
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,500
Bugs.

44
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:58,740
Do not use them.

45
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,640
The use of a coat of bugs is not only a wonderful time and labor saver,

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,700
they do a lot of damage to the finish if you don't remove them.

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,240
Use either the special Johnson's Autobugs or the regular Household Bugs.

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,900
Ask your auto supply store, service station, or bug dealer for a package of Johnson's Bugs.

49
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,700
The easy way to keep your car looking its best.

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,340
Your husbands will be more cheerful on dark mornings if you polish their Johnson's.

51
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,140
In fact, I've heard several women say they were glad of a chance to help polish their husbands big or little.

52
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,640
Like all of us, they're glad to be a good husband.

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,400
You're glad to help in any way with self-polishing.

54
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,840
In fact, the regular use of rubbing or buffing will make your husband's last five times longer.

55
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,300
It will sparkle like new.

56
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,660
It's a tremendous labor.

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,740
But to get results, may I make a helpful suggestion?

58
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,240
Be sure to keep it protected with coat.

59
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,060
Simply apply and let dry.

60
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,280
The lone Tarentato climbed into the canvas-covered chuck wagon, lying on the floor.

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
What happened?

62
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,260
You've never seen it, Miss June.

63
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,880
You have no idea how large it is.

64
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,540
Bigger.

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,380
Is that so bad?

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,680
I could show you, but there isn't time, even for that.

67
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
Is there any chance?

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,940
Yes, I believe so.

69
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,720
But we'll have to make a try anyway.

70
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,540
It looked bloody bad, Timosabe.

71
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,380
Bart.

72
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,000
Right, kid.

73
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,900
Yeah, Bart, right.

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,480
Miss June.

75
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,060
Of course.

76
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,100
We can't waste a minute.

77
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,280
Don't you think, June?

78
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,860
I do.

79
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,240
Don't you think, kid?

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,160
I do.

81
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,400
Well, make sure she's doing it.

82
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,240
Thanks, Miss June.

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,720
Easy, big boy.

84
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,100
Adios.

85
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,780
Adios, kid.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,320
And just to set you straight, mister, you ought to know that that was the launcher.

87
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm aware.

88
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,620
This is a product of the Launcher.

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,600
Launcher Incorporated.

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,220
Created and produced by George W. Launcher.

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,480
From PR News in Washington, I'm so close to the site of the World Trade Center.

92
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,040
The U.S. government says the Labor Department rose in July by two-tenths of one percent.

93
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,980
Food and automobiles cost more than three percent, suggesting this is PR.

94
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,280
The BBC's Barclays Bank says PR is bad.

95
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,960
According to documents filed in federal court, Barclays was accused of voluntarily removing

96
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,620
tailspins.

97
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,080
from sex authorities and conducted its own extensive PR news in London.

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,740
Bad.

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,220
There are growing disease outbreaks.

100
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,060
Good.

101
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,300
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is Islamic in Manhattan.

102
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,260
Authorities anxiously swell again, nearly overwhelmed with the Iraqi army.

103
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,500
Meanwhile, in China, at least 1,200 people have ruined cranes and bulldozers.

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,800
In California, there is fading hope that more PR news can be located.

105
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,500
I don't want a ride to theok, but under the stars.

106
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,040
Don't give me land, lots of land under starry skies above.

107
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,100
Fence me in.

108
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,980
Don't let me be by myself in the evening breeze.

109
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:50,880
But I ask you please, don't turn me loose underneath the western skies.

110
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,900
Just fence me in.

111
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,600
I don't want a ride to the...

112
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,080
Where the West commences

113
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,380
I wanna fence me in

114
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,920
Just fence me in

115
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,880
Oh, fence me in

116
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh, fence me in

117
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,780
When I get home

118
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,920
And I'm all alone

119
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,160
I get to wondering why

120
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,620
I'm such a lonely man

121
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,440
Lonely guy

122
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,160
I ain't got me no woman

123
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,000
And there's none in the cart

124
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,040
But I got the next best thing

125
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,520
And it's in my backyard

126
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,340
Yee-haw!

127
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,980
I got the sheep out back

128
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,220
Yeah!

129
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,540
And she's mine, all mine

130
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,900
And if she don't care

131
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,540
I sneaks up from behind

132
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,320
Yee-haw!

133
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,880
Oh, yo, yo, yo

134
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,060
Oh, yo, yo, yo

135
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,320
Oh, yo, yo, yo

136
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:10,200
Oh, survey, oh, oh Interesting

137
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,040
She's hot for that

138
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,980
She's Cruz, the UP

139
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,900
For Elemental

140
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,200
Oh,戰

141
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,580
For Elemental

142
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,300
Uuuh!

143
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,300


144
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,300


145
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,760
The pride that caused Satan to be flung, spitting and sparking out of heaven.

146
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,120
Him the almighty power hurled headlong, flaming from the ethereal sky,

147
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,220
with hideous ruin and combustion, down to bottomless perdition.

148
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,100
There to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire.

149
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,620
Life without Bob.

150
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,960
How can anyone stand it?

151
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,840
Hello, Doctor.

152
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,800
How are you?

153
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,460
Did you ever hear of a man named Bob?

154
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,680
No, I don't think so. It's an uncommon name.

155
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,840
It became very commonly known.

156
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,200
He mutated and spread with devastating speed among human beings.

157
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm planning a group that will attack Bob.

158
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,480
But surely, without Bob, that would be the end of everything.

159
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,840
Everything would collapse.

160
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,700
There was chaos for a time.

161
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,280
How could this possibly happen?

162
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,640
Just an accident.

163
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,080
A piece of sandwich that produced unexpected cake and much starvation.

164
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,960
Shall we begin again?

165
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,480
From the beginning.

166
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,080
Yes.

167
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,500
Hello, Doctor.

168
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,440
How are you?

169
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,080
Did you ever hear of a man named Bob?

170
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,400
No, normal woman would.

171
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,020
Oh, no.

172
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
How about a drink?

173
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,940
Oh, thank God.

174
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,020
I happen to have a fifth of very medicinal scotch.

175
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,280
Oh, thank God.

176
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,540
The way it looks, when we learn the proper dosage, this could be very effective.

177
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,760
I hope not.

178
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,600
Suppose there really were a Bob.

179
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,760
Well?

180
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,260
Why don't you just kill me?

181
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:11,980
Yes.

182
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,940
Pleasure time!

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,180
Right there on the desk.

184
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,700
Could be wasted with a fire.

185
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,820
What does that mean?

186
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,600
She fell down faster than Mr. Quaid.

187
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,720
The fire-th permitirley deceive and work away.

188
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:38,720


189
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:38,720


190
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,180
Oh, I almost got the 150g doll for trial that made me fall to court law.

191
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,460
You know, I was herbivores.

192
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:46,460


193
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:46,800
The Graham Jesus people were able to create an exorcism machine.

194
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:46,800


195
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,060
That void of Lrier

196
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,480
in the amoatég

197
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,720
num

198
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,520
Thousands every day in this country seek death

199
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,080
Death is annihilation

200
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,060
Have the courage to take your own life

201
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,900
Death is nothing but a deep dreamless sleep

202
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,360
That puts an end to all earthly troubles and trials

203
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,660
Escape from the burdens of life

204
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,620
Curse God and die

205
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,140
Your life is so messed up

206
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,760
Curse God and die

207
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,980
Have the courage to take your own life

208
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,540
Thousands every day in this country seek death

209
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,160
Death is annihilation

210
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,720
Thousands every day in this country seek death

211
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,500
Have the courage to take your own life

212
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,580
Curse God

213
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,100
And die

214
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,860
Curse God and die

215
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,640
Curse God and die

216
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,580
Your life is so messed up

217
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,200
Curse God and die

218
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,960
Curse God and die

219
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,480
Thousands every day in this country seek death

220
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,480
It is appointed unto men once to die

221
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,480
Threatening death

222
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,580
It is appointed unto men once to die

223
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,380
Man desires death

224
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,520
Curse God and die

225
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,640
Curse God and die

226
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,640
I'll

227
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,740
show you how we're using Bob to connect people to the right resources.

228
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,400
Let me show you around and more.

229
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,040
I'll use modified Bob.

230
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,900
Let me show you.

231
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,780
I clicked next.

232
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,900
I selected Bob.

233
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,380
Further down on drop down, I can select Bob.

234
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,240
I can also view and change Bob.

235
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,460
Now let's close our library and return to our program.

236
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,940
Program.

237
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,440


238
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,300
Bob.

239
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,040
A. Cook.

240
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,440
Bob.

241
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,340
Pamphlet.

242
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,780
A. Doc.

243
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,240
Bullshit.

244
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,540
Let's stop smoking these pies.

245
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,260
Bob.

246
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,860
A. Cook.

247
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,160
Pamphlet.

248
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,280
A. Doc.

249
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,380
Bob.

250
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,040
A. Cook.

251
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,880
Bob.

252
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,240
Pamphlet.

253
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,980
A. Doc.

254
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,040
Bob.

255
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,200
A. Cook.

256
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,100
Pamphlet.

257
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,560
Ah.

258
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,920
A cool pamphlet.

259
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:26,020
Friends, this little bit in the background right now is by Reverend Morgan Gutendag.

260
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,020
Before that we heard a little shortcut by Norell Preff.

261
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,940
And the song Curse God and Die was by Reverend Hanson.

262
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,180
Oh.

263
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,200
Yeah.

264
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,240
Yeah.

265
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,260
Hazel of the Windmills, who also did several of the collages earlier,

266
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,560
such as the one about polishing your husband with the Johnson.

267
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,780
However, the other Johnson collage, Johnson Bugs and Wax Johnson Program,

268
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,640
and the opening was by Lee Murr.

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,640
And the song, I Got the Sheep Out Back, that's the Rudy Schwartz project.

270
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:04,840
Correct?

271
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,600
You were in love with Bob.

272
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,220
Yeah.

273
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,100
Love was Bob.

274
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,800
We all were.

275
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,260
Yes, he was Bob.

276
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,960
I had to lie there in his cover.

277
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
Lie there in cover.

278
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,980
And cover.

279
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
Frankly, I was in no mood for golf.

280
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,680
It was a good deal for Bob, too.

281
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,200
He knew that.

282
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:21,960
Hi.

283
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,900
I'd appreciate dropping the subject of Bob once and for all.

284
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,180
Got a cigarette?

285
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,580
Bob.

286
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,060
Bob.

287
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,080
Bob.

288
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:33,820
Bob.

289
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,760
Bob.

290
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:45,760


291
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,680
Bob.

292
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,660
Baber's prowl.

293
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Baber's prowl.

294
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,180
Baber's prowl.

295
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,260
Baber's prowl.

296
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,120
Baber's prowl.

297
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,120


298
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,220
Baber's prowl.

299
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,220


300
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,220


301
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,220


302
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,220


303
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,220


304
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,460
Baber's prowl.

305
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,420
Baber's prowl.

306
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,040
Baber's prowl.

307
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:03,640
Baber's prowl.

308
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,540
Baber's prowl.

309
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,560
Thank you.

310
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
Thank you.

311
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,280
Thank you.

312
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Thank you.

313
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,240
Thank you.

314
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,440
Thank you.

315
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,280
Thank you.

316
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,540
Thank you.

317
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,980
Thank you.

318
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,380
Thank you.

319
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,320
Thank you.

320
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,140
Yes.

321
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
The Devo's.

322
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,460
And they'll be in town.

323
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,620
It's a little bit

324
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,280
Virtually.

325
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,660
At the devotional this weekend, I feel I can mention that.

326
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,700
Y'all are welcome.

327
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:50,300
That's at the Beachland Ballroom on August 28th,

328
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,160
which will probably be in the past and another galaxy far, far away

329
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,540
for the people who hear the show outside of this studio.

330
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,620
From far, far away.

331
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,180
At WCSB Cleveland.

332
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,320
Because we get shown and played elsewhere.

333
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:16,960
But those that live around these parts could also hear Princess Wiardo

334
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,380
singing with revelry on that same day, Saturday the 28th,

335
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,760
at Pagan Pride Day in Bedford Public Square.

336
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,880
Oh, yeah, that's right.

337
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,080
That's Pagan Release Day.

338
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,580
When they let all the pagans out of the box for one hour

339
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,200
to listen to the show.

340
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,740
Yes, we come climbing out.

341
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,160
The Vicki Ganger and Revelry.

342
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,680
Sorry, Victoria.

343
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,260
Oh, this music in the background, for future reference,

344
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,540
it'll be on for a while, is also by the great Rudy Schwartz Project,

345
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:58,720
our friend Reverend Joe Newman, from a re-release of an ancient set of material.

346
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,100
Okay.

347
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,280
And what have we here?

348
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,040
Would we then find this man?

349
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,140
This wad.

350
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Oh, the wad is, yes, the wad is, and the worm have arrived.

351
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,280
Wad?

352
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,000
The wad.

353
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,340
The wad.

354
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,240
A big wad, a lonesome cowboy Dave.

355
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,740
What are you doing here, man?

356
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,500
Well, I'm just...

357
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,580
I was just about to say it's not the word of Bob,

358
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,800
it's the wad of Bob,

359
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,640
but I decided to leave that behind in favor of something a little bit more erudite.

360
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,360
I think people should all join their hands and feet right now

361
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,120
and lift their eyes, you know,

362
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,720
if they can get them out of the sockets and stuff like that, skyward,

363
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,400
and forget this idea of Bob, briefly.

364
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,540
Because it is an encumbrance upon the psyche.

365
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,400
Oh, I don't know.

366
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,000
Some people find it liberating,

367
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,600
at least for the first five or so.

368
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,180
For six years.

369
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,140
But then, of course, we urge them to kill Bob in their mind.

370
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,320
We've had some problems with them literally physically killing J.R. Bob Dobbs.

371
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,020
It's kind of a bummer, but...

372
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:22,700
But what, pray tell, would you have us look to, Dave?

373
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,300
Yeah, who's better than Bob, man?

374
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,160
I mean, you've got to have a short-duration personal saver.

375
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,240
Oh, I suppose we should worship lonesome cowboy Dave.

376
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,560
Yes, spit it out, spit it out.

377
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,720
Praise Dave, praise Dave.

378
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,580
I don't think there's anything better than Bob.

379
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,260
And frankly, I don't think there's anything worse.

380
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,800
So that about says it.

381
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,320
I don't want to be either better or worse than Bob.

382
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,520
And I choose to sit at his feet when they don't smell too bad.

383
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,920
Oh, God, right.

384
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah, as if you get to choose when you sit at the feet of Bob

385
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,720
or when they're going to smell.

386
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,560
I didn't say I chewed the smelly feet of Bob.

387
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,880
Some people pay extra when he's that way.

388
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,140
Yeah.

389
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,860
I could see how the military establishment complex would pay for Bob's smelly feet.

390
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,040
Yeah, when he's that way down there, a lot of people get excited.

391
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,620
Well, when he's that way down there, a lot of strange things happen.

392
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,600
And some of them are really wonderful and some of them are quite putrid.

393
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,600
And some are like this radio show and all the other subgenius radio shows,

394
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,800
all three or four of them.

395
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,680
That we know of.

396
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,900
Well, but two of them, three of them have been on the air forever.

397
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,360
Ever and ever and ever.

398
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,020
Reverend Susie the Flusie Show in Atlanta and WREK,

399
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,180
that's been on for not quite ever, but almost forever.

400
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,320
But nigh on to ever.

401
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, nigh on.

402
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,500
The beginning of the early days of the golden years of radio,

403
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,060
the Susie the Flusie Show has been on WREK.

404
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,880
Right after Marconi.

405
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,120
Right after Marconi.

406
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,920
And also...

407
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,260
Puzzling evidence.

408
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,480
It goes back to the early days of, I think on Saturday night...

409
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,680
It was originally done as digital smoke signals,

410
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,580
which took a long time to get a two-hour show out.

411
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,040
Oh, yeah.

412
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,500
But they started on the actual radio in June of 1982.

413
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,740
I know that because I was there.

414
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,260
Well, you should have said actually started on the radio, not the actual radio,

415
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,400
because it wasn't really an actual radio.

416
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,920
It was a kind of a must-plus radio.

417
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,280
A radio that...

418
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,240
It did strange things.

419
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,380
But for a long time, they did go up against the King Biscuit Hour, NBC, The Whistler,

420
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,120
some of those old shows.

421
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,220
Rump Limbaugh.

422
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,680
Well, yeah, they still went up against Rump Limbaugh, brusquely.

423
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,080
Shudder.

424
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,120
Yeah, that is an ill prescription, provided you need one.

425
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,120
Well...

426
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,100
Well...

427
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,420
Dave, I bet you haven't heard about...

428
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,760
The New York City...

429
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,540
Devival.

430
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,480
Coming up...

431
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,360
Are you going to NY?

432
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,640
October 9th.

433
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,880
Yes, we're going to actually drive there.

434
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,540
We're going to take several days and drive to New York City.

435
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,720
Well, if you're...

436
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,160
The big city.

437
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,520
And for...

438
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,080
You know who's putting that on?

439
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,600
Reverend Back It On Up and Reverend Sifu and Reverend Jimbo.

440
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,120
Oh, that's exciting.

441
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,300
More than you know, as they describe it here,

442
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,920
this music is not really...

443
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,020
Well, here, I'll do it this way.

444
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,140
Well, it sounds like what you're going to be feeling like

445
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,740
after a long night in New York City.

446
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,520
That's why we call them devivals and not revivals,

447
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,840
because they're all devilish.

448
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,040
Anyway, it says here,

449
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,100
fire and brimstone,

450
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,040
screamo rock stars,

451
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,880
the fascinating Fat Man D,

452
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,340
and Reverend Ivan Stang will be preaching to you,

453
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,520
and you will feel like you are somebody

454
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,580
when he verbally ejaculates right into your face.

455
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,960
He's going to bust a spiritual nut right in your face.

456
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,060
See the New York clincher in him screaming about God knows what.

457
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,600
Feel the power of the legendary Pope Black.

458
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,220
Smell Pope Sinfaltimus Ex Mortis,

459
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,440
but don't eat anything he hands you.

460
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,020
Here, fat free, make lots of noise.

461
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,860
Hobnob with real subgenius celebrities

462
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,640
like Modemac, confirmed sex god,

463
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,040
and DJ 2B will play something called dubstep,

464
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,500
which you may have heard him talk about.

465
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,020
Behold!

466
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,200
As Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

467
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,960
the suavest subgenius ever to come out of the big city,

468
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,000
rants.

469
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,320
See before New York gets blown off the map.

470
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,660
Oh, and also there'll be a marriage.

471
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,360
A real live pair of subgeniuses

472
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,460
will marry the holy living beep out of each other,

473
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,100
and you will get to throw beep at them.

474
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,500
We choose the beep.

475
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,920
Don't throw it too hard.

476
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,820
And that is...

477
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,920
Oh, it says here,

478
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,840
wear the most ridiculous thing you own

479
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,380
because this is high society,

480
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,400
and you'll want to look beautiful in the photos.

481
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,040
Someday you'll be dead,

482
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,220
and your greatest regret will be a plague

483
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,540
on your everlasting soul.

484
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,400
Don't let it be that you totally beeped up

485
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,420
and failed to attend this once-in-a-lifetime event.

486
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,960
Be there or G-F-Y.

487
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,360
And this will be within launching distance

488
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,120
of the Ground Zero Mostel

489
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,900
that they're so excited about.

490
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,780
In New York, you know,

491
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,800
that everybody in Arizona is so concerned about,

492
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,640
and everyone all over the rest of the country

493
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,600
is so concerned about.

494
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,960
They don't want to just let a neighborhood

495
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,620
do whatever the heck they want, no.

496
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,640
It doesn't work that way.

497
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,260
This is America.

498
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,820
We have freedom of Christian religion in this country.

499
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,520
It says so right in the Bible.

500
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,120
Four score and seven years ago,

501
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,760
the right to bear arms.

502
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,760
That's John 614 in the Bible,

503
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,080
the Holy Christian Bible.

504
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,300
Right to bear arms.

505
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,240
It says something like that.

506
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,020
I know because I've read that

507
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,060
on a Yahoo comment that my buddy posted

508
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,400
and on the pasties that his girlfriend had.

509
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,960
So he put pasties on his girlfriend's pasties

510
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,020
to be a pasty?

511
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,660
No, that's where the Bible was apparently quoted from.

512
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,760
Well, that's the problem with your average,

513
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,600
everyday 400-pound Bible.

514
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,140
It wants to rule.

515
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,740
It wants to push you around

516
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,820
and make you eat the kind of sandwiches you don't like.

517
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,620
That's number one.

518
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,020
And number two, you say,

519
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,640
well, you can practice whichever religion you freedom.

520
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,320
And who wants to rehearse every day?

521
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,740
I mean, I know from being in bands every year,

522
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,380
I mean, many years,

523
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,080
that you needlessly have to rehearse

524
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
when you don't have to.

525
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,560
And who wants to do that

526
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,440
when you're worshiping some encumbrance

527
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,880
that you might wear around your neck?

528
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,980
Wait a minute.

529
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,700
Rehear?

530
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,060
What does that word mean?

531
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,860
Rehearse?

532
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,400
Huh?

533
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,300
I don't know.

534
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,400
I was never in one of your yearly annual bands.

535
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,280
Rocks and what do they call those?

536
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,400
Stars.

537
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,120
Rock stars.

538
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,820
Bands with rocks in?

539
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,020
No, no, no.

540
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,840
Like Ayers Rocks.

541
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,320
Yeah, that's also a band too.

542
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,040
Are you making fun of me again?

543
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,140
Trying to.

544
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,900
As desperately as I can.

545
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,860
But it just doesn't,

546
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,180
it seems to roll off your back like a platypus.

547
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,280
Of course, you're used to it.

548
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,900
You're going to be speaking in front of a bunch of irate,

549
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,040
besotted, half-witted New Yorkers.

550
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,980
Oh, not for long.

551
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,100
With the lineup, they've got enough people.

552
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,160
Oh, I didn't mention that Priestess Pisces will be there.

553
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,480
I wouldn't be surprised if Dr. Legume shows up.

554
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,120
It's kind of an East Coast show then.

555
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,920
I mean, from all parts, Philly and stuff too.

556
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,500
Well, we'll see.

557
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,700
We'll see.

558
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,200
We'll see.

559
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,160
Oh, and there's some, the singing occultist, Lon DeKette,

560
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
if that really is his name.

561
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,760
He's a fellow teacher at maybe Logic University,

562
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,500
the online hippie university, which, oh, by the way,

563
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,040
the subgenius history class and how to run your own cult

564
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,560
starts up again October 25th.

565
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,860
And I'll be overseeing.

566
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,120
Overseeing that online.

567
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,640
See, I'm a professor.

568
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,640
And you're also an overseer.

569
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,320
You are an over-ubermensch of some kind, I suppose,

570
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,180
if you were to twist your eyebrows differently.

571
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,540
I'm an overman.

572
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,760
It says so on my underwear.

573
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,200
Yep.

574
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,600
Lon DeKette, he's my Facebook friend,

575
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,140
and he's also been to speak at Starwood Festival.

576
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:52,860
He has?

577
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,400
Yes.

578
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,960
Have we met him?

579
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,340
I believe we have.

580
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,040
What?

581
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,740
Oh, I remember why I don't remember.

582
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,000
I remember it was at Starwood,

583
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,800
which would scar your mind.

584
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,740
And then which also removes various parts of your brain,

585
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,980
which are needed for memory.

586
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,840
Well, that's the trick when you're dealing with occultists,

587
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,080
especially singing occultists.

588
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,080
Yeah, I wonder what that sounds like.

589
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,120
I mean, I can imagine him, you know, being real nasal and stuff.

590
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,960
Something like that.

591
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,640
Be careful, man.

592
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
You're going to summon the elder gods playing around.

593
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,180
Something like that.

594
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,580
I'm trying to keep them away.

595
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:32,740
Don't you do that.

596
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,800
It's too dissonant.

597
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,160
We don't have stereo mix for that,

598
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,560
because it'd be like art music.

599
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,240
We could do it for 20 minutes,

600
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,080
way past the laughter point,

601
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,040
and second past the art point,

602
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,100
and then to the point where people want to just turn their radios off

603
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,320
and come down there and beat the living crap out of everybody.

604
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,840
I think we hit that point about seven minutes ago.

605
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,200
You mean when I...

606
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,740
Yeah, just exactly.

607
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:00,860
Exactly.

608
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,620
Exactly when the moment that you called.

609
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,760
No, I'm just kidding, Dave.

610
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,840
You have fans.

611
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,520
Did you know that?

612
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,980
We try to hide this fact from you,

613
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,280
but you actually have fans.

614
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,440
Every now and then I'll get a little email or something going,

615
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,860
Boy, I love Cowboy Dave.

616
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,240
I can see why he's so lonesome.

617
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,080
No, seriously.

618
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,480
Every now and then somebody actually appreciates what you do.

619
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,600
I just want to let you know that.

620
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,300
I've already hit them up for money.

621
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,160
So...

622
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,100
So just sit back and wait for a couple thousand bucks in the mail?

623
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,960
Just appreciate...

624
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,720
Just...

625
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,500
Bask in the glow.

626
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,280
Be glad you at least get a bit of a reach around.

627
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,880
Well, that's what I was trying to say.

628
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,380
When did this reach around occur?

629
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,880
Are you just trying to reach around right now?

630
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,820
No, no.

631
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,680
We do actually get fan mail from flounders.

632
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,080
The time eludes you, but there was just a time.

633
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,160
No, no.

634
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,180
Oh, no.

635
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,740
Like every...

636
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,600
Every ten minutes a new email comes in.

637
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,200
Where's that star, Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

638
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,920
This is NBC.

639
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,940
I'm a big producer.

640
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,780
I want to pay him.

641
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,080
He made me laugh.

642
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,160
And, of course, I'd call him back and tell him you're not available.

643
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,360
That's what I wanted to hear and knew it was impossible to hear.

644
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,100
Yeah.

645
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,540
Yeah.

646
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,260
Yeah.

647
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,060
Yeah.

648
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,600
Yeah.

649
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:19,880


650
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,600
Well, I think you're certainly moving up in the world, going to New York City again.

651
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,020
I remember the last time you were there and they had to kind of drag you across the George

652
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,720
Washington Bridge into the safety of New Jersey.

653
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,480
After he caused all that...

654
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,020
I know.

655
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,840
And they started a whole war over it.

656
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,680
I couldn't believe it.

657
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,640
Without damn war still going on.

658
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,140
I wonder if the city planners know that there's going to be an occlusive reenactment so close

659
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,340
to Ground Zero, which is, you know...

660
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,180
I wonder.

661
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,200
I wonder.

662
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,980
I wonder.

663
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,280
As I look through these massive blueprints...

664
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,020
Let's see.

665
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,060
This one is for a sky kiosk somewhere north of Erdway.

666
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,020
Hmm.

667
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,360
Don't like that design.

668
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Too phallic.

669
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:12,620
Hmm.

670
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,920
Let's look at this one.

671
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,360
Too fun.

672
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,140
What?

673
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,920
Going in Kyrgyzstan.

674
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,500
Ooh.

675
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,300
It's a giant mall surrounded by pictures of elephants on large canvases.

676
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:23,820
Hmm.

677
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,440
Hmm.

678
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,740
What do you think?

679
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,660
I think it's quite weird.

680
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,540
Weird enough, do you think?

681
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,220
Yes.

682
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,220
It's quite weird enough.

683
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,440
Weird enough for the fathers of the church?

684
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,200
Why, yes.

685
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,180
I believe it would pass muster.

686
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,880
Oh, well, then I'll follow you all right on down the line, and someday, someday soon,

687
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:48,740
someone will erect a giant cavernous mall in Kyrgyzstan surrounded by elephants.

688
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,600
Goody, goody, goody.

689
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,180
Ah.

690
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,660
And those trained elephants you see in the background were trained by Reverend Joe Newman

691
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,100
from Rudy Schwartz Project.

692
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,720
Are you an elephant trainer now?

693
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,880
That song in the background, by the way, was called Moammar's Tractor, which reminds me

694
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,160
of Moammar Gaddafi, the great subgenius crazy man, and his little green book, which I've

695
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,740
actually read, and it's full of insane but really cool rants.

696
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,580
And you know we had a bleeding head of Moammar Gaddafi at 13X Day Drill.

697
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,240
Certainly did.

698
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:27,780
Did you see that?

699
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,200
It was up on the pulpit a lot of the time.

700
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,200


701
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,200


702
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,040
And we launched it a couple of times.

703
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,920
Did I see it?

704
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,220
I had a short-duration marriage on it.

705
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,760
Oh, okay.

706
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,620
Okay.

707
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,580
I don't remember.

708
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,640
But...

709
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,360
Thinking of it as I married myself.

710
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,540
It's actually a Gaddafi head football.

711
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,800
Hey, would one of you guys shoot me if I say the word actually again?

712
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,180
I've already said that word like five times in this show.

713
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,440
I hate it when other people do that.

714
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,600
I actually hate it.

715
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,440
Actually.

716
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,800
I just actually.

717
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,720
I mean, actually.

718
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,980
When you say that, that implies...

719
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,340
It implies that you're correcting the person you're talking to.

720
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:03,660
Yeah.

721
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:08,320
I realize that I felt insulted as if I didn't know what I was talking about.

722
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,280
Right.

723
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:09,940
Yeah.

724
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,200
It's snarky and smarmy.

725
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,300
Now, what about...

726
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,200
And so I think you should kill me.

727
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,280
What about punctuating your words and your sentences with basically?

728
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,060
Basically.

729
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,480
Irregardlessly, I hate that.

730
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,540
Basically.

731
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,920
Irregardlessly.

732
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,340
Yeah.

733
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,800
Basically is preachy.

734
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,200
That's why it is disliked.

735
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,520
Right.

736
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,120
Because when you say basically to somebody, it's like they don't know anything to begin with.

737
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,760
And you're trying to put it in baby terms for them.

738
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,600
Right.

739
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,980
So they won't bite your leg or...

740
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,160
I don't like to be dumbed down to.

741
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,320
Built-in smarm of the modern world.

742
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,140
Yeah.

743
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,240
Whatever happened to manners and politeness?

744
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,460
Well, they were once fast food stores and now they're just prophylactic machines.

745
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,800
It's the way the whole world crumbles.

746
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,540
I think what we ought to do is just remember that this linguistic jingle that we're talking about is all subject to change immediately.

747
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:12,640
For instance, like we're talking about how people demean each other just by saying various things like,

748
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,780
excuse me, do you know where the restroom is?

749
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,420
Any kind of word can be misconstrued.

750
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,080
That's why I think maybe Bob's got the right idea of obliterating all the world's languages.

751
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:23,760
Right.

752
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,460
Get rid of all the jumbly goop.

753
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,500
Yeah.

754
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,240
Kill all the Bob's.

755
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,560
Um.

756
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,100
Sorry.

757
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,500
Sort them out.

758
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,220
Um.

759
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,440
Yeah.

760
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:40,000
Fill their mouths with carrots and feathers and let them argue by themselves in a quiet room.

761
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,860
Oh, listen to this funky tune by the psycho skeletons here in the background.

762
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,020
It's very bassy.

763
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,260
Basically.

764
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,060
It sounds like cyborgs crying in the rain.

765
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,340
While they're a little angry.

766
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,420
They're angry at themselves because even though they're cyborgs and not really...

767
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:06,500
fit with human souls or spirits, they still want and need to join the Church of the Subgenius.

768
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,520
And as they cry...

769
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,120
Select them.

770
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,540
Select them.

771
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,740
We select them.

772
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:11,980
Yes.

773
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,320
As they cry, we need robots.

774
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,440
We need cyborgs.

775
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,980
We need androids with pathos, with wet eyes and emotion.

776
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,340
That's what we need.

777
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,440
Well, no, actually.

778
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,920
I learned recently that when robots have emotions,

779
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,900
they'll let the other team win.

780
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,820
They won't.

781
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,720
They won't work for you.

782
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,920
Because they don't want to make any humans feel bad.

783
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,240
So they won't work for your team.

784
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,540
They won't work for any team.

785
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,220
They won't do anything that'll upset humans.

786
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,100
That's why you don't want a robot with empathy.

787
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,940
Okay, you're saying robots don't want to work for teeth, but they will work for empathy.

788
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,300
Especially if it's full.

789
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,100
Is that what you're saying?

790
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,700
No, they'll do whatever you say as long as they don't have feelings.

791
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,220
You have to make sure your bots don't have feelings.

792
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,480
Well, say you've got a sexborg.

793
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,380
I wish.

794
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,000
What is it going to do if it doesn't have any feelings?

795
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,520
You're talking about emotions per se, right?

796
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,280
Not like touch feelings.

797
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,200
Right, right, emotions.

798
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,540
No, you don't want them to have them.

799
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,600
What if they don't like you?

800
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,960
What if your sexbot thinks you're a jerk?

801
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,760
Then you're going to be able to tell it's not into it.

802
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,660
You know, it's just going to be awkward, stiff in all the wrong ways.

803
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,180
You know, it's just, it's like a marriage where everybody's just pretending.

804
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,160
Couldn't you just take it back and get it reprogrammed?

805
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,760
Yeah.

806
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,180
I wonder when we're going to get to the Twilight Zone that features real dolls.

807
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,200
Yeah.

808
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:56,600
Dave, I don't know if I mentioned to you, Princess, we and I have been watching all of the old Twilight Zones

809
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,840
in chronological order.

810
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,960
We're up to about number 37 now.

811
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,500
Yeah, I was glad to hear that.

812
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:07,120
It was almost like saying somebody in your family feels a lot better or that you're feeling a lot better.

813
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,100
I also go along now, I know you might not necessarily completely agree,

814
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,680
but also just playing all the Marx Brothers movies endlessly in the background,

815
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,920
whether you laugh or not, provides some sort of, but the best, probably Twilight Zone.

816
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,680
And maybe a few Twilight Night Galleries.

817
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,800
Not all of the Twilight Zones.

818
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,020
The Twilight Zones were great.

819
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,820
Right.

820
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,500
I agree.

821
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,260
There were some that were a little...

822
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,860
I'm so sorry, I agree.

823
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,520
You know, they were like after Twilight or late afternoon zones.

824
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,060
Not nearly as much fun.

825
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:41,820
Yeah.

826
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,580
I think his apoplectic vision, or is that apocalyptic?

827
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,240
His vision, I think his vision was maybe messed up from listening to too many zero hours

828
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,560
and X minus ones in the 30s or 40s whenever he was a small child.

829
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,800
Wow.

830
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,820
One step beyond the Twilight Zone.

831
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,060
Did I say that already last year?

832
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,900
I don't know.

833
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,020
Yeah, you did.

834
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,600
One step beyond.

835
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:14,200
But you're allowed to say it four times before the regulators get involved with your finances, so to speak.

836
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,920
This background music is by The Large.

837
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,780
Although, actually, it's by a million other people, and I think The Large just chopped it up.

838
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,780
What's happening?

839
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,260
I know.

840
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,760
What's happening to my hair?

841
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,760
They're so large.

842
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,400
No, no, wait a minute.

843
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,280
I must have walked in the wrong room.

844
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,300
I gotta get out of here.

845
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,040
It's gonna be okay.

846
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,860
It's gonna be okay.

847
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,540
Who are you?

848
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,720
It's gonna be okay.

849
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,480
It's gonna be okay.

850
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:41,860
What are you?

851
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,700
It's gonna be okay.

852
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,520
Oh, my God.

853
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,000
It's a computer-generated voice.

854
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,480
I gotta...

855
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:45,840
Where's the door?

856
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,180
There's no door in here anymore.

857
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,080
And I keep getting bigger, and the room stays the same.

858
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,640
There's no way out.

859
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,460
I gotta get...

860
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,880
I gotta...

861
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,180
I...

862
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,260
Who are you?

863
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:54,660
What are you?

864
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:55,760
What?

865
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,000
What?

866
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:56,560
What?

867
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:56,640
What?

868
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,180
Get out, Dave.

869
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,100
It's locked.

870
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,220
You've gotta get out, Dave.

871
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:02,740
There's the door.

872
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,480
There's the door.

873
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,300
Oh, my God.

874
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,520
It's a little, teeny, tiny door.

875
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,980
I can't...

876
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,460
A confused little man trying to find his way out of a sturdy, stiff door.

877
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,480
But does he really want to go through that portal,

878
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,500
which leads, inevitably, down, all the way down his esophagus,

879
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:35,940
through his stomach, and his lower intestine, down to the fuzzy little portal that we call

880
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,020
the Twilight Zone?

881
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,320
We'll be back with the hour of the slack after a brief nap.

882
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,040
Oh, well.

883
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,920
I guess we're up now.

884
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,700
We're done.

885
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:52,940
All right.

886
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,880
That background music, though, it's still got a few more...

887
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:56,740
Two more bounces?

888
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,260
...seconds to go.

889
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,900
I actually put together instrumentals for this show, because I knew it was gonna be

890
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,500
one of those mental, heavy mental shows.

891
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,340
Stan, you know, I fear the sound of marching feet in the street.

892
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,080
I mean, I don't particularly need soldiers.

893
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,400
I know.

894
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,320
Actually, I'm afraid I know exactly what you mean.

895
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,840
I've made the mistake lately of reading the comments that come after the news on the Internet,

896
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,480
and I'm about ready to renew my passport, just in case I need to...

897
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,700
Oh, you're ready to flee real quick?

898
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:34,580
Because people have seen me talking to persons of other races and religions, and apparently,

899
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,900
in the new America, that's traitorous, you know?

900
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:39,920
Yeah.

901
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,500
I was talking to a Muslim not...

902
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,700
Forty-five minutes ago.

903
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,840
A real, live one?

904
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,400
A real, live Muslim, yes.

905
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,280
Oh, it's Ramadan.

906
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,100
You should have undone his dingle.

907
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,100
Actually...

908
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,600
I mean, you should have let not as...

909
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,480
You should have not attempted him by trying to...

910
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,880
You should have not attempted him by trying to break his fast, unless he's having a large

911
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,340
sandwich with plenty of potatoes.

912
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:08,300
And just between you and me, I think one of the people in here wasn't raised as a Christian.

913
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,760
Hey!

914
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,100
Hey!

915
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,940
It's hard to tell unless you check their papers.

916
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,820
Hey, watch that!

917
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,620
I think what we ought to do is start making people wear a little armband, so we can tell

918
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,540
what they are without having to get their papers, please.

919
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,500
Right.

920
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:22,680
Right.

921
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,580
You know...

922
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,620
Yeah, because, I mean...

923
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,460
I mean...

924
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,560
I mean, we should all wear our papers on our sleeves, I guess.

925
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:35,240
That's the only way to prove that you're not an illegal religion, or an illegal countryman.

926
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,920
Wear your heart on your shoe and your papers on your sleeve.

927
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,400
Yeah.

928
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,540
It's a different world.

929
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,560
It's a different world now.

930
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,620
These are different times.

931
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,360
I thought we were going towards parody-lovely land.

932
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,020
Instead, we turned into space retribution-we're-all-crazy land.

933
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,300
I don't know.

934
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,300
I don't know.

935
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,360
I don't know very much of anything.

936
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,020
I don't know, too.

937
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,720
Oh, that was a great movie.

938
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,520
It was a lot better.

939
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:07,000
Actually, usually a sequel's not as good as the first one, but I Don't Know Too was actually

940
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,760
pretty good.

941
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,620
I like the squelch as well as the sequel, because they came before and after.

942
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,900
The squelch?

943
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,000
The squelch.

944
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,340
Oh, what have I got here?

945
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,280
What have I got besides these diseases and diseases?

946
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


947
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


948
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


949
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


950
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


951
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


952
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


953
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


954
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


955
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,280


956
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,100
Oh, I have a little bit of X Day recording I wanted to play.

957
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:31,940
Oh, good.

958
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,260
Just a short one, because it takes some narration.

959
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:43,320
I'll leave us all on as I let these guys make noise for a second, and it's really noise.

960
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,100
Well, maybe I'll go ahead and explain what it is.

961
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,420
13 X Day drill.

962
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,400
July 4th, the night before the world was to end.

963
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,020
There was a big jam on stage.

964
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,260
There was a big jam.

965
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,720
In fact, our friend Dr. Sinister was on there playing drums and bass and guitar and Reverend

966
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,860
Angry Larry and Philo and oh, everybody.

967
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,580
But here's the thing.

968
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:16,100
You know when these super bands, these mega bands are playing and jamming, improvising,

969
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,820
sometimes they're stuck for lyrics.

970
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:24,940
Pisces had lost her breath, or her voice, so there wasn't anybody up there to come up

971
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,240
with words.

972
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:25,440
But here's the thing.

973
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:25,440


974
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,620
Well, Reverend Angry Larry and Philo Drummond picked up, I think it was the instruction

975
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:38,060
book for installing Linux operating system in your computer.

976
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:47,280
And they used the Linux operating system instructions as what you might call Scandinavian death

977
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:54,260
metal lyrics, which we're about to hear for about 30 seconds before I'm going to, you'll

978
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,500
see, I'll thankfully, pan, pot it down as they say.

979
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,900
And that would be ...

980
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,280
longing operatingmusic and dûsal

981
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,740
The Fylo Drummond is an amazing vocalist.

982
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,440
I can't understand what they're saying any better than you can.

983
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,220
And it is one of those you had to have been there things.

984
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:06,140
But after they had used this Linux operating system installation instruction book for rock lyrics for a little while,

985
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:12,700
they started looking around for other things that would have good lyrics on them.

986
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,600
One, I think, was a plastic water bottle.

987
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,600
Yes.

988
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,880
And also lighters that have little stickers on them which you can use for lyrics.

989
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:22,420
Yes.

990
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:22,880
Here, listen.

991
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,940
Keep away from children.

992
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,200
Ignite lighters.

993
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,840
Away from face and clothing.

994
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,540
Be sure the flame.

995
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,580
It's pure.

996
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,380
It's refreshing.

997
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,200
It's guaranteed.

998
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,040
Return the unused portion.

999
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,920
With receipt for a replacement on your money bag.

1000
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,320
And it comes not completely satisfied.

1001
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,720
And it contains flammable material.

1002
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,500
Material.

1003
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,460
So profound.

1004
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,980
Don't put it in your children's eyes.

1005
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,260
Pretty intense lyrics, huh?

1006
00:48:59,440 --> 00:48:59,840
Yeah.

1007
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,200
I'm telling you.

1008
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:01,680
Marty!

1009
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:01,800
Marty!

1010
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,700
I actually enjoy them a lot.

1011
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,120
Marty!

1012
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,440
Marty!

1013
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:05,920
Marty!

1014
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:06,280
Marty!

1015
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:06,700
Marty!

1016
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,360
Oh, here they go.

1017
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,340
Here's the big.

1018
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:08,960
Marty!

1019
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,040
Marty!

1020
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,320
Marty!

1021
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,080
Marty!

1022
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:11,360


1023
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:11,420


1024
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:19,980
Marty!

1025
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,140
Oh, and then Philo found a box of...

1026
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:36,140


1027
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,160
I have a jackpot of lyrics back here.

1028
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,660
He found a box of books.

1029
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,000
I got...

1030
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,020
I got a lot of lyrics back here.

1031
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,360
I got a lot of lyrics back here.

1032
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,080
There's the...

1033
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,540
That was the box of Bulldog auction books.

1034
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,860
Here's a challenge for you.

1035
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,880
How about these three lyrics?

1036
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,320
The Bonanza Game!

1037
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,600
Let's do it.

1038
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,620
Let's see.

1039
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,240
We'll read the instructions on how to play it.

1040
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,700
Oh, well, the song's over, though.

1041
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,800
We missed the opportunity.

1042
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,760
Oh, man, look at this.

1043
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,900
There's Michael Landon.

1044
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,040
There's the lyrics to our song.

1045
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,880
There's Lauren Greene.

1046
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,460
There's Hoss Cartwright.

1047
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,160
There's Nuts.

1048
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:11,760
Well, that was...

1049
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,580
Yeah, that song really rocked.

1050
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,080
We were really ready to be on, like, the cutting edge, you know, breaking through there.

1051
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,180
And you can't really...

1052
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,080
We ran out of song.

1053
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,120
And you even get the interview, too.

1054
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,580
I knew I hit the bottom when I was reading the water bottle label, though.

1055
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,480
What the hell?

1056
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,920
Yeah, you get the making of.

1057
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,600
That's really amazing.

1058
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,120
That's subgenius creativity there.

1059
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,340
Well, I was just going to say, when they were doing the metal part, the other day, I was

1060
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,640
listening to classical music.

1061
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,020
I don't freaking know why.

1062
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,200
But I was listening...

1063
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:41,800
You know...

1064
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,940
It helps you sometimes.

1065
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,760
I was listening to classical music, and this metal station took over.

1066
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,260
You know what I mean?

1067
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,280
Kind of like Satan Wants Your Mind type of thing.

1068
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,840
Like, if you're writing a movie and stuff like that, and Satan is coming in through your

1069
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,520
radio and stuff.

1070
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,300
And it sounded better than this.

1071
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,040
I mean, this sounded better than it.

1072
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,400
I mean, that sounded better than it.

1073
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,000
Well, the musicians are actually really good.

1074
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,500
That's the ironic thing about the subgenius music.

1075
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,120
It's...

1076
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,180
Well...

1077
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,840
Reverend Angry Larry is a great guitar player.

1078
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,740
And Reverend Sud Shaw was also playing on that one.

1079
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,300
And it may have been Dr. Sinister playing on it.

1080
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:20,760
Dr. Sinister.

1081
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,440
I believe.

1082
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,780
We'll find out soon.

1083
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:31,260
Then they quickly shifted into a kind of a Seattle or some sort of hip type of thing,

1084
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:31,640
you know?

1085
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,200
And it was just...

1086
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,420
But then they forgot to come back, but I still loved it.

1087
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,440
Philo mentioned at the beginning of that song that he had played all the notes he knows.

1088
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,320
He had gone through every note that he's ever learned.

1089
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,160
He plays sax, usually.

1090
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,340
Philo is normally a sax player.

1091
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,520
I noticed he sat in and tried to play drums for a while.

1092
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,720
He's terrible.

1093
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,400
My God.

1094
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,880
He must not have any kind of clock in his head at all.

1095
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,520
His four-year-old daughter was pretty good.

1096
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,160
She was.

1097
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,140
But Philo himself, oh, man.

1098
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,840
I mean, he is an overman.

1099
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,520
And his sense of...

1100
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,920
He's in another...

1101
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:11,780
He's in time somewhere.

1102
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,920
He's not in the same time zone as us.

1103
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,680
He's a beat-off, as they used to say, as a drummer.

1104
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:17,960
Yeah.

1105
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,220
Well...

1106
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,940
It's an old joke, but it's true.

1107
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:28,640
And especially, like, you know, with his square, weird vinyl heart, which was made in 19, what,

1108
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,220
83 or something like that.

1109
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,540
He still wears that on his head.

1110
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,340
I think it was made in Italy.

1111
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,000
And personally, when you've played all the notes that you know, you're...

1112
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,780
You've essentially run out of notes.

1113
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,320
And you can't play anymore.

1114
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,080
So it's better to leave a few behind, and they can re-spurt new notes and so forth.

1115
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,840
They can even make harmonies once they really get going, kind of like your little bacterial flagella.

1116
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,400
Aren't you always supposed to leave them wanting more?

1117
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,160
What, the bacteria?

1118
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,400
No, notes.

1119
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:07,020
So if you play all the ones that you know, what more could they want?

1120
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,420
Yeah.

1121
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,880
And any other note you would play after that would be redundant.

1122
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,420
Even if you hadn't expended the original notes.

1123
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,380
It's like people saying, oh, I'd like to smoke some of that frop someday.

1124
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,860
And then they realize they better smoke some right now, or it might all be gone if everybody's smoking it.

1125
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:34,480
If the movie is to be believed, the emperor of Germany informed Mozart at one time that he was using too many notes.

1126
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,200
Well, yeah.

1127
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,200
In this one piece.

1128
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,720
Yeah, that was in Wolfgang or Amadeus, whatever that movie.

1129
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,180
Yeah.

1130
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,000
Too many notes.

1131
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,760
I don't know why you would want to torture anybody with bringing up an obscure German king.

1132
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,300
But the truth is, he was Baron von Munchausen's great-great-grandfather.

1133
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,260
Yeah, that's what Baron von Munchausen said.

1134
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,880
But Munchausen goes around saying he's Bob.

1135
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,000
Well, sometimes he is.

1136
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,300
No.

1137
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,280
When the moon goes right.

1138
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:06,960
No.

1139
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,600
There's only one J.R. Bob.

1140
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,800
Bob's Dave, and you know that.

1141
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,900
Thank goodness there's only one.

1142
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,980
Thank God it ain't one, two, three.

1143
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,920
It's just one too many.

1144
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,080
Too much would not be the same as not enough in that case.

1145
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,800
Not at all.

1146
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:30,080
It's a kind of an idea that most people have a hard time getting around or wrapping their mitts around.

1147
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:37,300
There's a slithery head full of sebaceous cysts and quite not so easily popped.

1148
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,180
But he's a hard one to grasp fully.

1149
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:49,720
Speaking of sebaceous cysts and poppings and stuff, how's that trepanation failure on your forehead?

1150
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:54,360
It's losing ground, but it's making friends, if you know what I mean.

1151
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,140
Well, I mean, is the hole getting any bigger, or is it getting smaller?

1152
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,040
The last time we saw Dave, he had a little hole in his forehead.

1153
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:02,580
Yes, he did.

1154
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,500
He had a Band-Aid over it.

1155
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,720
It was pretty terrifying.

1156
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,700
You could see things moving around under the Band-Aid.

1157
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,020
I was worried about the trepanation.

1158
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,820
It was like the angry.

1159
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:14,540
It was like the angry baby head, only it was coming out the front instead of the back this time.

1160
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,460
Yeah, scary.

1161
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,940
Well, you don't want to leave those angry baby heads out there too long because they get boisterous.

1162
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:26,000
Dave, most people don't have any angry baby heads growing out of their head.

1163
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,660
Well, lucky me, I am a unique person.

1164
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,180
No.

1165
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah, I've heard that.

1166
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,900
I am different from the herd.

1167
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,000
And that means you're better than everyone else.

1168
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,960
That's the basic gist of the Church of the Subgenius.

1169
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,800
Yes, that's right.

1170
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,960
You just heard what you want to hear.

1171
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,400
Are you weird?

1172
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:45,960
Different?

1173
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,660
Do people think you're strange?

1174
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,160
Then you are better than everybody else.

1175
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,680
Do you want their pants?

1176
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,900
Do they want your pants?

1177
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,900
No, you want their pants, shoes, shirts, and underwear.

1178
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,820
You want what they live in.

1179
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,820
You want Bob Dobbs.

1180
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,500
Free underwear with the Church of the Subgenius.

1181
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,720
At subgenius.com.

1182
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,740
I should mention that.

1183
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,420
Your very own Susan Boyle.

1184
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,520
Yes, but not when it's that way down there.

1185
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,740
Now, you can't steal from Futurama.

1186
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:23,560
Well, no, you already stole it from Futurama, so I thought we were going south again.

1187
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,860
Oh, God.

1188
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,060
I'm glad that every time I come up with a good idea, Futurama beats me to it.

1189
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,640
I guess that means it's a good sign.

1190
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:39,300
Haven't you considered the real possibility that when you watch an episode,

1191
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:39,720
and you're like, oh, I'm going to watch Futurama, I'm going to watch Futurama, I'm going to watch Futurama,

1192
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:44,360
and spring on an idea that they're watching you back into your head, mind?

1193
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,860
Well, they've already made fun of me on the show.

1194
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,500
They've actually mocked us.

1195
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,020
Yes, because they're using you for mind fodder.

1196
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,800
They are stealing your brainwave.

1197
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah, and they rub it in.

1198
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,980
They've done shows about it.

1199
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:05,840
Yeah, and they laugh on you and make up a special show calling you the Reverend Angry Stink or something.

1200
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,040
No, they called me Dr. Zoidberg on that show.

1201
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,440
But anyway.

1202
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:17,180
In future subgenius shows, we'll be playing some clips from Futurama that would make you think,

1203
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,860
good Lord, they're subgeniuses.

1204
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,520
Why are they doing a show about X-Day?

1205
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,000
That one's coming up.

1206
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,000
We have a special, what you might call a 7 a.m. show coming up.

1207
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:32,800
It's been weeks, years in the making, actually.

1208
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,760
Yeah, a children's show.

1209
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,760
It's only got children's nudity in it, you see.

1210
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,580
But you'll probably get no parents.

1211
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,860
It's for kids, only for kids.

1212
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,660
Hey-ha.

1213
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,160
That's not funny.

1214
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,620
Well, it was kind of funny.

1215
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,740
You're just not allowed to think it's funny.

1216
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,880
Oh, those people, the audience liked it.

1217
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,600
Listen to them.

1218
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,500
Oh, my God.

1219
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,400
They're all out the window now, aren't they?

1220
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:55,580
Look.

1221
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,380
Yeah, yeah, there's a huge crowd outside the station.

1222
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,440
We get this almost, this is a bigger crowd than we usually get.

1223
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:03,620
Yeah.

1224
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:08,740
They're waiting for us to come out because it's almost 9 or 10 or whatever it is time

1225
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,920
that we're supposed to quit.

1226
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,160
It's almost to the hour.

1227
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,200
Yeah, the hour.

1228
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:12,680
Of the hour.

1229
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,200
Right.

1230
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,500
It's going to be a different time for each listener.

1231
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,680
At any rate, you're going to have to get out the back door if there's that many out there

1232
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:21,980
tonight.

1233
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,140
Yes.

1234
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:24,760
Yeah.

1235
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,920
If there is a back door.

1236
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,440
Princess Wee is no longer in the building.

1237
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,660
You folks can go home now.

1238
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,600
I can't hear her.

1239
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,220
That's all they're waiting for is her.

1240
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,460
Oh, look.

1241
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,860
She's going out there now.

1242
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,780
She took her shirt off and she's dancing around that fire.

1243
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,720
Oh, my God.

1244
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,120
No wonder they come to.

1245
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,400
Can I watch?

1246
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,040
Do I have to turn my head?

1247
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,520
We're going to have to end the show now.

1248
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,920
This is all getting a little bit too personal and embarrassing here.

1249
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,040
To who?

1250
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,000
To me, because that's my wife down there dancing around with those hippies.

1251
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,360
Ah, get over it.

1252
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,400
Okay, I'm fading in.

1253
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,940
You know you love having her fondled by everybody in the world.

1254
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,080
Say goodnight, Dave.

1255
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,200
I'm sorry.

1256
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,800
No, say goodnight.

1257
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:03,900
Oh, goodnight, Dave.

1258
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,520
