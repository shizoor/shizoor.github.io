1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:26,120
The hour of slack, dear friends, and we're back at the 7X Day Drill.

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,020
And the puzzling evidence show after the drill, with Dr. Howell and Philo Drummond.

3
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:40,120
And we have Little Theodore and Reverend Carter LeBlanc and Jesus Christ and the amino acids and Acid Corpse.

4
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,260
Plus Reverend Lee Burles and this music by SoSoDotta.

5
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,940
Praise Bob.

6
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,260
Yeah, what's all this?

7
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,440
Keep back there.

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,720
Keep back, me?

9
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,940
You know who you're talking to.

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,040
Come along there, come quietly.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,480
Unless you want me to put the handcuffs on.

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,220
Stop where you are.

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,940
You don't know what you're doing.

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,020
I know what I'm doing, all right.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
Come on, get out of here.

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,320
Lock him up!

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,640
All right, you fools.

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,960
You brought it on yourselves.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,100
Everything would have come right if you'd only been...

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,720
You left me alone.

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,360
You've driven me near madness with your peering through the keyholes and gaping through the curtains.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,520
And now you'll suffer for it.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,380
You're crazy to know who I am, aren't you?

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,180
All right, I'll show you.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,440
I'll show you who I am and what I am.

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,160
It was horrible.

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,960
Let's go, let's go.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,880
We're through being cruel.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,140
Eliminate the bosses and their slaves.

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,300
Yeah!

31
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,620
We're through being cruel.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,260
We're through being cruel.

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,380
Change the way you should be stuck in a tank.

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,220
Huh?

35
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,880
Change the way you try to drive you.

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,480
Ah!

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,840
Smash them!

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,980
We're through being cruel.

39
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,260
We're through being cruel.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,700
Damn that.

41
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,840
We're through being cruel.

42
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,340
We're through being cruel.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,480
We're through being cruel.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,480
We're through being cruel.

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,640
Well, it all started when we arrived at, uh, Reverend...

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,760
No, it actually started when we arrived in Cleveland.

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,940
I think...

48
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,940
Yes, I arrived in Cleveland, too.

49
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,500
You arrived in Cleveland on Thursday, and I arrived in Cleveland on Wednesday.

50
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,100
And we...

51
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,640
I drove separately from the airport.

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,500
This is admirable.

53
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,660
This is me and...

54
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,080
The end of the world happened, and these guys can only talk about their...

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,640
This is me and Princess Bee driving along to...

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,100
Well, it was a big deal, you know.

57
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,660
Now that 60% of your life is taken up by airport conservation procedures.

58
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,180
On the way from Ohio to New York.

59
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,260
You have no choice but to obey the procedures.

60
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,520
Now you see the way the country looks with these, uh, barns and, uh, hay fields and so forth.

61
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,980
Very rustic and rural, western New York state.

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,460
And crossing Pennsylvania.

63
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,660
Don't forget about all the Amish individuals.

64
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,100
That extreme right-wing paramilitary...

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,160
The military, uh, religious cult, the Amish.

66
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,580
Yes, we should, uh, pay homage to the Amish.

67
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,200
Those Amish, uh...

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,920
Did you...

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,720
I kind of like those.

70
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,000
Did you see their special clothes and outfits that they wear?

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,720
Well, I, uh, was aware of the...

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,740
They got these tight pants they wear that are short-legged and with suspenders.

73
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,380
But a special kind of leather suspenders.

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
They don't use belts.

75
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,480
They have suspenders on.

76
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,200
And then the...

77
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
The girls wear these little bonnets.

78
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,600
And, uh...

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,100
The special...

80
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,580
Special colored, not fancy dress.

81
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,980
Yes.

82
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,060
Where is that?

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,240
That's in New York.

84
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,480
You're telling me this happened at the end of the world?

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,860
That happened on weird dresses?

86
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,540
It's in western Pennsylvania and...

87
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,180
I also put on a weird dress and participated...

88
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,920
That's true.

89
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,980
In a drag contest.

90
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,620
He became Philomena.

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,580
And there he was, uh...

92
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,820
You all want to know what happened at the end of the world.

93
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,820
Wincing and mincing at the subgenius drag ball, which preceded the end of the world.

94
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,220
Oh!

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,960
So you guys turned it to San Francisco.

96
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,580
Yes.

97
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,520
Uh...

98
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,900
Yes.

99
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:33,760
Just when you thought you got away from San Francisco and were actually going to do something not related to gender blur.

100
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,980
What an unpleasant surprise.

101
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,920
It follows you all the way out to...

102
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,980
I wonder why we think we're doing so well.

103
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,140
But it was kind of fun because I had a chance to get in touch with my feminine side.

104
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,580
He certainly did when you should have seen him mincing and sashaying around the...

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,060
Ivan Stang.

106
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,200
As everybody knows, they're at the end of the world.

107
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,220
Oh, Ivan Stang was...

108
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,000
No, Ivan Stang.

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,180
Ivan Stang.

110
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,340
Didn't work, uh, as an angry Iranian woman.

111
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,820
In a burqa.

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,160
And I was dressed in my pink, pink outfit with matching pink, uh, lounge pants.

113
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:07,880
Man.

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,360
And, uh, and it was excellent.

115
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,100
Just wonderful.

116
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,460
Meanwhile, the girls drag kinged it up with fake mustaches and zoot suits and so forth.

117
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,360
Well, and there's video somewhere out there.

118
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,080
Yeah, there's video.

119
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,780
Dr. Howie!

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
I present to you a great man, Dr. Howe.

121
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,320
The Keeper of Church Secrets.

122
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,940
The Keeper of Church Secrets.

123
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,580
Today, we have a wonderful ceremony in store for us.

124
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:50,700
It is important, as Bob embraces Connie and the knowledgeable subgenius must endure, indulge in,

125
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,920
and withstand the embrace of the conspiracy, that we explore.

126
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:04,020
The viewpoint of the opposite sex by being that person and letting our inner nature come forth.

127
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,500
Who will be next to show off his or her magnificence?

128
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,340
That's not having time to do it.

129
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,880
Here we are.

130
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,880
My name is Helga and I want to have intercourse with your eyeball.

131
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,120
Ah, yes, the eye socket to me theme.

132
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,960
You may have seen the Miss America contest.

133
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,780
They always ask the girls, you know, what are your plans?

134
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,460
And they always say they want to work with troubled children or be a brain surgeon.

135
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,400
Or unless they lose, where they get to be a stripper.

136
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,740
And now we have, I'm not certain I know the name of your identity.

137
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,620
You'd better tell me.

138
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,260
Philomena.

139
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,180
Philomena Drummond.

140
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,100
And she is just as cute as a Junebug, as they say.

141
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,100


142
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,400
A little simpering perhaps, but in the spirit of things, certainly.

143
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,100
What's it like to be an overwoman?

144
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,920
Yes, what's it like to be an overwoman for a change?

145
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,220
I just don't know.

146
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,980
It's silly or something, I don't know.

147
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,460
Well, he's just flowing with the spirit of the occasion.

148
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,640
Anything else?

149
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm going to go pee.

150
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,400
Oh dear, well, that's the problem with women.

151
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,180
They have to go pee every few seconds.

152
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,540
But we forgive them readily, we do.

153
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,180
Alright, who is next?

154
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,920
I was drinking these all day.

155
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,720
I passed out.

156
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,860
I woke up in a dress.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,940
And I was told to come up here by those who call themselves my friends.

158
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,820
And introduce myself as Sexy Mortis.

159
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,420
Toyo Ballas!

160
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,620
I'm throwing up right now.

161
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,780
I'm coming for you, girl.

162
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,060
Oh my.

163
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,440
Well, we can only imagine what will happen off stage, inflamed by the passions of this event.

164
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:07,280
Here's someone who appears to be a devotee of America's national pastimes.

165
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,620
You're winning!

166
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:07,820
Yeah!

167
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,000
Just so you all know, I am a pitcher and not a catcher.

168
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
An important distinction.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,940
You know, and every year I come here, this is actually technically my sixth X Day.

170
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,740
And every year I come here, and I come here believing.

171
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,580
Not just wanting to believe, I come here believing the Saucers will arrive.

172
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,780
July 5th, 7 a.m.

173
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,300
The Saucers are gonna be here.

174
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,740
We're gonna be swept up.

175
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,120
We're gonna be caught up.

176
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:51,040
We're gonna be sucked into the conceptual orifices of...

177
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,960
of pan-galactic uber-thought beings.

178
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,980
Projections that will gratify our every urge.

179
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,360
We're gonna be taken away from all this shit.

180
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,960
It's gonna finally happen in every single year.

181
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,560
I don't even fucking get up at 7 a.m.

182
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,220
Because you know what?

183
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,500
I know in my gut they didn't make it.

184
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,820
Again.

185
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,940
And what happens?

186
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,400
I have become utterly disillusioned.

187
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,160
I walk away from this going, you know, that was a hell of a party, but...

188
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,560
God damn it.

189
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,360
We didn't get the Saucers.

190
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,240
And I find myself struggling with this.

191
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,160
I say, how can I continue to involve myself in an organization that continually lets me down?

192
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,860
It's not like I get sex from the church.

193
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,660
You know?

194
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,200
It's not like I get money from the church.

195
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,060
It's not like I get friends from the...

196
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,880
Well, okay, actually, I have gotten granted a lot of friends after this.

197
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,140
But regardless, the thing is, is there's this issue of doubt.

198
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,260
There's this, why am I doing this?

199
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,700
Why am I putting myself through this?

200
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,420
And why do I even waste my time with this?

201
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,980
And the thing is, is that's a gift.

202
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,820
That's a gift.

203
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,360
Because, I mean, ask Heisenberg.

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,860
Ask Goodell.

205
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,380
Ask Schrodinger.

206
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,940
Ask fucking Einstein.

207
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,460
The universe floats in a haze.

208
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,840
In a haze of quantum indeterminacy.

209
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,780
Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law.

210
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,860
You know?

211
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,560
I mean, I...

212
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,480
Yeah, I don't know.

213
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,700
I was quoting the Thelemites and all that shit.

214
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:43,220
No, the thing is, is the universe fluctuates and floats in a haze of quantum indeterminacy.

215
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,020
That means that you will never know.

216
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,200
Because it just might not work out that way.

217
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,680
It's called...

218
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,820
It's called relativity.

219
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,480
It's called improbability.

220
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,900
It's called, you know, it's...

221
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,680
It's called slack.

222
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,060
Because you know what?

223
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,200
You don't need to know.

224
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,300
I see babies cry.

225
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,840
I watch them grow.

226
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:22,380
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.

227
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:33,040
And I say to myself, what a wonderful world.

228
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,600
Hey, yeah, maybe it's a wonderful world for Bob.

229
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,580
And Connie.

230
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,500
But we're stuck down here on this slack-forsaken planet.

231
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,380
God damn it.

232
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:59,600
And I have a few bees with a deity named Yahweh One.

233
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,340
Lord, I really want to know.

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Why did you make the mosquitoes?

235
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,360
The richy bites can really bring me down.

236
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,040
And why did you make the flies and cockroaches?

237
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,480
And other nasty bugs and bugs around?

238
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,160
And tell me, why are humans so fucked up?

239
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,300
And why do they want to blow us all up?

240
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,580
And why do they hate each other when they're so much like each other?

241
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,940
I want to know.

242
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,420
Yeah, what's going on with the weather?

243
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm always oh so hot or very cold.

244
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,180
It seems it's always raining or snowing.

245
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,780
A tail-arm is getting pretty old.

246
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,180
And tell me, why are pinks all so fucked up?

247
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,160
And why are they trying to blow us all up?

248
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,360
And why do they hate each other when they're so much like each other?

249
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,740
I want to know.

250
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,060
Yeah, I really wonder just what you were thinking.

251
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,140
How could you let them go so far astray?

252
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,120
You must have been down on the corner drinking.

253
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,880
And that's why they're all so fucked up today.

254
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,440
Now I know.

255
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,540
That's why they're all so fucked up.

256
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,500
And that's why they're about to blow us all up.

257
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,620
And that's why they hate each other when they're so much like each other.

258
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,920
And now I know.

259
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,160
Yeah.

260
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,300
Now there were some scary looking people there, but then there were some beautiful people.

261
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,580
And you were there. And you also.

262
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,280
And you. And you. And you.

263
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,700
And you. And you.

264
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,300
Really, you were.

265
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,160
But not you.

266
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,980
And you know, but I learned there's no place like home.

267
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,340
Yes.

268
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,600
There's no place like home.

269
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,000
Except Brushwood.

270
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,740
Except, but Brushwood is our home now.

271
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,180
That's true.

272
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,960
Could you imagine living out there in one of those little special living places under the trees at Brushwood?

273
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,780
Yes, one could live out there under the trees and watch as Magdalene paraded by in her finery.

274
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,160
She came by several, I became Magdalene's official clothing approval person.

275
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,760
Yes, I think we all did.

276
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:37,920
Each day she came in and paraded her various and numerous outfits in front of me in various states of dress and undress.

277
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,680
I might add.

278
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,200
Very thoughtful of her.

279
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,900
Very thoughtful.

280
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,140
Uh, Reverend Mary Magdalene.

281
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,340
The wife of Jesus.

282
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,920
Yes, and a great sub-genius and a great American.

283
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,740
And Jesus was beaten severely.

284
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,540
Yes, they always do abuse our Lord at these affairs.

285
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,500
Nicky, I think, was drunk and high one night and decided to come up with this thing.

286
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:05,940
You're good for another round.

287
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,060
None of us have seen Passion.

288
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,720
So what we're going to try and read is, what's the story?

289
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:08,740
What's the story of the Passion?

290
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:08,740


291
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,060
reenacting.

292
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,080
Well, they're all the same.

293
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,300
They all have the same story.

294
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,920
Right, the same story.

295
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
I read the comic book.

296
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,980
We wrote down the Station of the Cross, but then we lost the piece of paper we wrote it on.

297
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,900
So we don't even have that as a guideline.

298
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,360
But we do know the first thing that happens is that Jesus is condemned.

299
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,280
We're going to have you do that part on the stage.

300
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,600
And then I'm just going to walk down the road from the stage to the frocks and just have

301
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,400
people beat me and spit on me and yell at me.

302
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,300
And then like I fall once or something.

303
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,920
So why are you doing all the makeup and get up?

304
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,160
Doesn't that happen every year anyway?

305
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,620
Well, I don't know.

306
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:50,980
The fate of this so-called king of the subgeniuses, his fate has been left up to his people.

307
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,660
The pathetic rabble, underclass subhumans, whatever you...

308
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,880
Or is it the Jews?

309
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,620
I can't remember.

310
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,220
Subgeniuses, Jews, one of those things with a J in it.

311
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,760
Subgeniuses.

312
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,200
Subgeniuses.

313
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,540
All right.

314
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,860
You subgeniuses decide his fate.

315
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,900
I don't know.

316
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:07,900


317
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
I wash my hands of it.

318
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,880
Where is my pilot?

319
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,320
Burn it!

320
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,360
Burn it!

321
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,540
Burn it!

322
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,340
No, burning things against the law in the Roman Catholic Church in this particular

323
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,860
alternative universe.

324
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,020
Lock him!

325
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,260
Lock him!

326
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,080
Sex molester is a murderer, a rapist, and a subgenius.

327
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,800
That's true.

328
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,440
Oh, well, he was going to be executed.

329
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,880
He should take my place.

330
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,300
Okay, we're going to crucify somebody.

331
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,880
It's either going to be this obscene, uncivilized, uncivilized, uncivilized, uncivilized, uncivilized,

332
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,920
and a mean, disgusting murderer, this crackhead, this rape and pillage.

333
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,340
He's actually stolen all of your cars, raped all of your daughters, and your wives, and

334
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,380
your moms, and your dads.

335
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,360
Or you can either crucify him, or as they used to do in ancient America, you can instead

336
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,480
crucify this guy who talks about peace all the time and smokes pot.

337
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,360
Kill me!

338
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,120
Kill me!

339
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,800
I thought so.

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,700
Kill me!

341
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,860
Oh, by the way, he also promotes free sex and says, what's the point?

342
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:07,860


343
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,200
women are equal. I thought that would do it.

344
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,720
Where's your guard now, eh, Jesus?

345
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,500
Let us trick him! Make him fall!

346
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Oh!

347
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,640
Death to the king of the goose!

348
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,080
Special effects with my blood.

349
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,280
Death!

350
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,920
Let him be sprayed with pink fake blood rather than bright red fake blood.

351
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,600
What do you have to say for yourself?

352
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,820
I'm gonna buy scum!

353
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,480
I bought my own stick. Is this one okay?

354
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,300
That's a golf club!

355
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,120
He's allergic to golf clubs!

356
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,240
I will take your cross!

357
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,620
Bring out the gasoline!

358
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,500
He stole his dollar sign!

359
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,920
Okay! It's time to strip him of his garments!

360
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,220
It is the foreskin of Jesus, and it will go on sale at the Bulldada auction.

361
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,420
Here it is.

362
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,900
Look at the size of that foreskin.

363
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,040
It's still moist.

364
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,940
Look at the urethra hole in the end there.

365
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,700
It proves I'm Jewish.

366
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,960
This man...

367
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,960
This man has what it takes.

368
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,700
One hell of a circumcision.

369
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,940
One hell of a circumcision.

370
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,240
Look, he's still bleeding.

371
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,880
Truly, he was the son of God.

372
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,300
Oh, funniest fellow you ever heard. My mother's a virgin, my father's a bird.

373
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,760
So here's to the disciples in Galilee, and fuck them all, and we'll all live free.

374
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,480
James Joyce said that.

375
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,060
Well, I thought that was very successful.

376
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,380
Except it seemed rather anticlimactic.

377
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,680
Weren't we supposed to, like, kill him or something?

378
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,920
Couldn't we put, like, pour gasoline on him?

379
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,300
Why did we stop at the sixth station?

380
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,300
Couldn't we pour gasoline on him and burn him, like, as a protest against the Iraq War or something?

381
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:47,680
Yeah!

382
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,420
No, you'd have to cut his head off for that.

383
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,440
Yeah, that's great.

384
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,540
Behead all that you can behead.

385
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,220
Blah, blah, blah.

386
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,080
The brokers and the money changers shall be snatched and ruptured,

387
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,560
and from their faces shall be burnt their noses,

388
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,040
and from their loins, their bones, their bones,

389
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,120
and from their minds, their minds,

390
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,160
drive the fluids of the babe,

391
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,720
and it shall be gone unto drainage.

392
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,780
And my winepress shall spill over with the blood of saints and elders,

393
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:20,560
and the invisible burning blood of the angels shall wash across the taverns and the houses of ill women,

394
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,760
and the great library where are kept the profane tablets and ships of false wisdom,

395
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,160
and the cameras of the pornographer,

396
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,780
or the sins of the number 909,

397
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,140
and Forescore,

398
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,720
and 10.

399
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,700
And of them the first is the dropping of the body's voided things unto the white linens of the lamb,

400
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,580
and the second is the sin of laying ye down beside the small children,

401
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,820
and the penetration and rending asunder thereof,

402
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,600
and of this sin are those without number in its practice.

403
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,100
This is a crooked and perverse nation.

404
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,220
Here are laid these naked children which are unto cherubs,

405
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,760
and rose their innocence befouled.

406
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,800
And they are led by the profane,

407
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,360
and the unrepentant,

408
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,240
and those without remorse.

409
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,340
And even though they touch not these babes,

410
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,980
their images of the beast enter into them,

411
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,660
the children as they sneak staring into the lamp of hell,

412
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,200
which is the devil's jewel.

413
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,180
Hey everybody, put your finger in your nose!

414
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,260
Pick a booger out and wipe it on your clothes!

415
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,720
Don't know how you feel one way or another.

416
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,920
Whoo!

417
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,760
Yow!

418
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,080
Makes you feel happy then wipe one on your brother.

419
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,460
Driving your car and you're looking at your neighbor.

420
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,780
My nuggets from his nostrils like a saver in the labor.

421
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,300
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's yanking on a string.

422
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,180
It's a long slimy string.

423
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,580
Stickin' this into his brain!

424
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,220
Pick a booger! Pick a booger!

425
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,020
Pick a booger and wipe it on your clothes!

426
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,580
Pick a booger! Pick a booger!

427
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,680
Just you figure I'm pulling out your nose now

428
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,080
Hey everybody put your finger in your nose

429
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,300
Kick your finger out and wipe it on your throat

430
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:15,560
I don't know how you feel one way or another

431
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,920
Kick your finger out and wipe it on your brother

432
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,680
We're behind bars under your nose

433
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,240
press the chord to let it pass

434
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
Sucks like they're dope

435
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,720
You wanna shake neck just like that

436
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,840
Even more make your face known

437
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,560
Every day, I try my best

438
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:55,560


439
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,480
And bring to you my reality

440
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,760
All I like to do is sing

441
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,460
Everybody's doing it.

442
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,540
Pick a burger out and wrap it like you're chewing it.

443
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,140
Everybody's doing it. Everybody's doing it.

444
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,040
Pick a burger!

445
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,840
Pick a burger!

446
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,720
Pick a burger!

447
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,400
Pick a burger! Pick a burger!

448
00:23:52,300 --> 00:24:02,760
Dr. Drummond, did you know that recent scientific studies have proven that people who eat their

449
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:02,760


450
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:09,160
boogers are on the whole healthier than those who don't because it helps stimulate your

451
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,740
immune system constantly.

452
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,580
Right. Yes, that's true.

453
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,760
You actually devour the stuff that your nose filters catch.

454
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,980
It helps prevent disease.

455
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,560
So even though society pretty much frowns on eating their boogers.

456
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,780
So man, you're free, man. You're free! We're all free finally! Nose pickers are free!

457
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,180
Pick a burger!

458
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,040
Don't be afraid, just pick a booger!

459
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,120
The conspiracy tried to make you believe it was bad!

460
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,480
Why? Just because it's gross? Is that all?

461
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,220
We're through singing about the boogers now.

462
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,480
It's not like the taste bad.

463
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,340
That was the last song.

464
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,960
Why did you hold it down?

465
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,460
That was the last song, Reverend Stein.

466
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,600
I know you wanted to sing about the boogers.

467
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,460
I know he wanted to sing about the boogers.

468
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,240
But this isn't a song about boogers anymore.

469
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,260
We were trying to get out of boogers.

470
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,200
It was the worst day, obviously!

471
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,620
Fuck Bob! Fuck X! Stop the X-Curture!

472
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,500
I am beaten!

473
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,180
It is over! University is over!

474
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,140
Why do you X-Torture me, Bob?

475
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,620
It was obviously the worst day.

476
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:02,760
It was the day that the song once again reminded us that we were the worst.

477
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:02,760


478
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:10,620
In its full glory, that it absolutely, after all, refused to die.

479
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,520
Yes, it's true. The song refused to die.

480
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,660
Still hadn't died.

481
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,600
Even if everyone in the world tried to kill it, that wouldn't matter.

482
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,220
Only one thing could kill the song, and that would be if the song wanted to die.

483
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,840
Oh yeah! If only the song knew how bad it was, maybe it would want to die and finally give up.

484
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:46,080
But even though it knew that it was bad, even though it knew it hurt the audience,

485
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,520
the song refused to fucking die.

486
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,880
Oh yeah!

487
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,100
It was just having too much fun being a bad song.

488
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,180
It was just having a blast.

489
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,060
The song was, anyway.

490
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,520
I don't know about the audience, I don't know about the musicians, or the light musicians,

491
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,000
the former musicians who once worked on the song and tried to escape the song,

492
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,780
but even when you get away from the song, even when the song's been gone for years,

493
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,180
even when you thought the last time you heard the song was in Arkansas,

494
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,880
God damn it, the song that refused to die always comes back!

495
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,180
Even when you think the song that refused to die has died,

496
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,380
somebody makes some unexpected noise,

497
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,580
or somebody starts snoring in the trailer,

498
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,740
or somebody starts giggling in a solemn moment,

499
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,160
and at that time you know that the song has still refused to die.

500
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,320
Yep, it's back.

501
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,520
When somebody farts at a funeral, that's part of the song that refused to die.

502
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,740
When somebody lies to you,

503
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,300
and you believe it,

504
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,120
that's part of the song that refused to die.

505
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:12,820
And when Spinks Drummond had to go to the hospital screaming,

506
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,040
that was part of the song that refused to die.

507
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,160
And when Philodrummond burst out of his mother's pussy screaming,

508
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,360
that was part of the song that refused to die.

509
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,300
And when the right hand broke a string,

510
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,080
and cussed, that was part of the song that refused to die.

511
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,680
Although what he had been playing was not.

512
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,340
No! No! No! No!

513
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:09,080
No! No! No!

514
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,800
But wait, but wait, but wait.

515
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,140
It wasn't dead yet.

516
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:50,700
See and be awed and thank the Lord that you too were not born like them.

517
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,800
Come one, come all.

518
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:02,960
Do you dare to see the eighth and ninth wonders of the world?

519
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:11,620
Little Theodore and Babushka.

520
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:11,740


521
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,080
Go, go, what?

522
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,240
That's wicked, that's wicked.

523
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,320
You're out of your minds.

524
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,320


525
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,320


526
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,320


527
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,360
Settlers need to 34 ward hands.

528
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,780
I'm not bent on reading rules.

529
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,080
I spin around in circles till I think that I might fall

530
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,120
And if I take two steps in a row I'm walking down the wall

531
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:42,100
I don't know what to do

00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:26,580


547
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,740
These reactions are normal. Enjoy them.

548
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,700
They broke all their equipment.

549
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,440
They even broke the microphone.

550
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:46,360
There's blood and sperm all over the stage.

551
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,200
Should we clap?

552
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,060
Should we clap?

553
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,060


554
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,600
Should we clap for the amino acids?

555
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,060
Nay.

556
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:00,480
For the amino acids are above and beyond clapping.

557
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,220
Also, they are deaf.

558
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,520
I don't know if they...

559
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,860
Well, they couldn't mention that because they're dumb, too.

560
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,740
Yes, the amino acids are deaf, and they can't hear what they do.

561
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,540
But their blood and sperm has been left here for us to analyze.

562
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,960
Perhaps they've gone back to their own planet.

563
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,620
We must now go.

564
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:21,840
On?

565
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,760
Yes, on.

566
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,700
Onward.

567
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,440
We must not mourn for the amino acids.

568
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,200
Nay.

569
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,940
Nor the pinks who must die.

570
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,660
Nor ourselves who must continue to go back to work, perhaps, someday.

571
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,940
If the exes don't get here.

572
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,860
But now we should go to the bonfire.

573
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,220
Yes!

574
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,580
Where we can burn!

575
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,400
Burn!

576
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,260
Burn!

577
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:41,980
Burn!

578
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,480
Burn!

579
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,440
Burn!

580
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,120
Not stored in any soul.

581
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,900
Dear friends.

582
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,220
So buy.

583
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,260
Buy and do not share.

584
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,200
Only buy.

585
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,020
Forget sharing and niceness.

586
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,240
Remember only consuming.

587
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,380
Buying and selling.

588
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,100
Because Bob came to me in a dream, friends.

589
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,700
He looked me in the eye and he said,

590
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,060
I want you to stop buying and start.

591
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,480
Selling!

592
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,420
So get out that most sacred organ.

593
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,400
Just unzip your pants.

594
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:37,480
Bend over and yank out that big old stinky wallet.

595
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,380
And exercise the tool of the subgenius that is your tongue.

596
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,760
And promise with your tongue to pledge.

597
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,520
And then back up your pledge.

598
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,600
Yes, look at that.

599
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,940
Look at that green.

600
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,080
And cabbage changing hands.

601
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,420
Yes, that is the moment of the true magic happens.

602
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,180
At that moment of transfer.

603
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:58,940
Energy.

604
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,000
Friends, the life is the money.

605
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,340
And I mean the blood.

606
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,660
Or, well, money and the blood and the slack.

607
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:13,260
And the life all mixed together with the sperm and blood on the stage of the X-Day revival at Brushwood.

608
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,300
No parking except for Bob.

609
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,380
You're all married now.

610
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,460
We're holy men and we can say that.

611
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,140
Oh, also.

612
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,260
I might add, by virtue of the fact that I'm a holy man,

613
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:32,920
I now declare that you may, as of this moment on, do anything that you want.

614
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,500
Go ahead.

615
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,640
I said it.

616
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,580
You can go ahead and do it.

617
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,780
That's the authority of the holy man.

618
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,300
You can do anything if only you will believe.

619
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,240
You can do anything if only you will believe.

620
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,000
Now Hal, on the other hand, spent most of his time pickling in a large vat of hot water.

621
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,700
He was a spa-like treatment at Brushwood.

622
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,460
He couldn't stay out of it.

623
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,360
There was a magnet in the bottom of the...

624
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:04,340
It was a water magnet in the bottom of the hot tub that continually attracted Hal back.

625
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,260
Not just a hot tub, but a pool as well.

626
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,100
But also the pool.

627
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,860
A pool of young talent that was there.

628
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:17,260
And there was many, many bounteous, beauteous babes that were lolling and cajoling Hal in those pools.

629
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,600
They wanted to comfort me because me and Philo and Doug wanted me to come to the stage.

630
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,320
And do rants and so forth.

631
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:35,800
And all Hal could do was stay in the hot tub, crying like a little baby, being comforted by the beautiful, young, and might I add, very well built young ladies.

632
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,860
They offered much comfort, I'm telling you.

633
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,820
And they provided a soft, warm respite to Reverend Hal.

634
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,660
No kidding. When you and Stang left, they patted me and said, there, there, it's alright.

635
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,580
They patted you all over your entire body.

636
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:51,580


637
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,680
They massaged your every muscle.

638
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,240
They gave me emphatic hugs just in the spirit of fellowship and brotherly love.

639
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,020
No, I tell you, you're a lousy audience.

640
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,060
But you laugh, you laugh.

641
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:14,800
You wouldn't have laughed had you seen the mighty Dr. Hal lolling and cajoling.

642
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,160
There wasn't time enough for me to get up and get down to the stage anyway.

643
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,560
But what about when we just brought you the microphone?

644
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,800
I brought the microphone to the hot tub.

645
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,340
So you could just...

646
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,740
That might have been a solution to the problem.

647
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:32,640
That's when we had the cardboard cutout of Dr. Hal on the stage, but his voice was coming from the hot tub.

648
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,140
He was singing that favorite song.

649
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,980
I did lead a round of subtenuous songs in the hot tub room in the middle of the night.

650
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,700
I didn't start them, the others did.

651
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,400
I'm sure she wonders where you are.

652
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:50,980
I'm sure she wonders where you are.

653
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:56,080
Up above the world you fly like a tea tray in the sky.

654
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,740
This is what Hal was saying to him.

655
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,280
He said, get out of here before I have the time to change my mind.

656
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,080
Yeah, because you know that's what this X Day is all about.

657
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,120
Young girl, get out of my mind.

658
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,900
This is Hal redoing the Gary Puckett song from X Day live.

659
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,440
Pretty good, huh?

660
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,980
This is, of course, karaoke.

661
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,900
Now we had the Hal cutout doll at this point in time.

662
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:32,060
The girls were getting to dance and the young ladies and women and women were all cavorting and lollygagging.

663
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,380
Some of them were quite formidable in appearance.

664
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,300
Some were gallivanting even.

665
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,780
Some were galumphing, you could say.

666
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,560
Across the stage with their mighty boots on.

667
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,680
Yes, well, I won't say it.

668
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,240
Their big hobnail boots, the ones that they stomp you with.

669
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,400
Right.

670
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,400
You wouldn't want to be on their bad side.

671
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,520
Let's put it that way.

672
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:59,260
As they soaked in the baptism of the genetically engineered Frankenwater of Brushwood.

673
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,260
H2-uh.

674
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,400
As opposed to the Weirwater, which is H2-awr.

675
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,360
Well, friends, yes, we put the un in fundamentalism and the foo in fundamentalism.

676
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,420
And, friends, but best of all, we put the un in fundamentalism.

677
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,820
And, friends, but best of all, we put the ha in hate.

678
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,380
That's a new bumper sticker for you.

679
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,620
We put the ha in hate.

680
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,520
Ah, yes.

681
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,620
And, in fact, we also put the very low in love.

682
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:45,040
We can take a soaring emotion like love and just make it low and pig-wallowing sex.

683
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,300
Uh, uh, uh.

684
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,320
That's true love, friends.

685
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,280
Uh, you'll pay not to really think.

686
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,320
That was another one.

687
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:02,720
Actually, to tell the truth, first off, let me say I'm basically stalling for the amino acids.

688
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:11,020
And, uh, because we want to get them on stage and get them burning up this stage fast.

689
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:16,160
Because right down the hill in the roundhouse is a mighty Dobbs icon.

690
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,360
And a mighty big pile of frop ready to be burnt.

691
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,600
Burnt as a sacrificial offering to that man, Bob.

692
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:33,980
And not just the wood and the frop will be burnt, but that which means the most to you will be burnt.

693
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,600
Your faith in Bob itself.

694
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,200
Ah, yes.

695
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,300
Praise Bob and let him go up in smoke.

696
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,020
Ah!

697
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:51,400
And the exes will know that at long last there's somebody down here worth evacuating.

698
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:51,860
Ah!

699
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,620
And here it is, we discovered it last year.

700
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:01,140
If you're going to feel silly about fighting for the saucers, feel silly the hell out of it.

701
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,560
Once again, the king falls.

702
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,120
We killed Kennedy.

703
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,320
Every one of us.

704
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,440
This Bob has lost.

705
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,540
Oh, it was you and me.

706
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,360
We killed Bob.

707
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,660
It wasn't puzzling evidence and his dentures and his gun.

708
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,220
It was we who killed Bob, yes.

709
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,680
We, he was born from our own brows.

710
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,760
He ripped from our livers.

711
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,480
And, uh, spunk in our wet dreams.

712
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,600
And so we too shall destroy him like Frankenstein's monster.

713
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh wait, no, Frankenstein's monster destroys Frankenstein.

714
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,580
I guess, I don't know.

715
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,180
I don't know.

716
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,100
I feel gone.

717
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:51,920
Each subgenius old lowerarchy guy had his own sixteen room house.

718
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,400
It was so great.

719
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,260
Each subgenius soul was a steel cylinder.

720
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,140
We got to live in our house for like twelve seconds a day is all.

721
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,640
There were so many sycophants who needed your time.

722
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:12,980
They called our cabin animal house because of the decaying piles of watermelon covered with seething ants that were all over the floor.

723
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,540
We didn't have any way to take a shower there.

724
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,120
The life before.

725
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:26,940
But right across the street from us was the special private hot tub and spa which only X Day's staff could use.

726
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,120
Because the thing is so big now folks.

727
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,260
I mean with that many people showing up you have to have separate areas for the, uh,

728
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,440
At least for the hygiene.

729
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,020
Finkarotty.

730
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,100
Yeah, the Finkarotty go to the, go to the special non-hygienic area.

731
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,760
One of my brain suspension cables.

732
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,660
That's just a water swimming pool.

733
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,540
There it went again.

734
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,380
The other one is snapped now.

735
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,320
That leaves your brain floating in space now.

736
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,840
Oh, you had three of them.

737
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:55,760
Wow.

738
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,220
Very good.

739
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,420
Three brains.

740
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,040
You know that's, uh, two more than most people have.

741
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,140
Whoa, two more popped.

742
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,540
Man.

743
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,600
This doesn't look right, man.

744
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,980
I'm not sure what's going on here.

745
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,780
Those are brains.

746
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,000
They were.

747
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,460
They started out as brains.

748
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,560
You can kind of see the resemblance of brains.

749
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,980
Do them right now.

750
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,400
When you look at them.

751
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,320
Now, uh, see they can lift up.

752
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:21,660
They can fly.

753
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,420
Oh, no, they're not brains.

754
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,500
They're just cheap sound effects.

755
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,280
Yeah.

756
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,420
Oh, sorry.

757
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,980
I didn't know I was on the air.

758
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,860
Can you imagine if this show was on in the daytime?

759
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,940
The gigantic information engine that would boom across America.

760
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,740
Then we'd have to sell commercials and stuff like that.

761
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,360
Blanking over the information superhighway.

762
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,840
We'd have products we'd be selling on the show.

763
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,680
Yeah.

764
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,280
I saw quite a few products there and many of them used my art.

765
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:46,440
What am I going to do?

766
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,000
Do people come to X Day and sell all the stuff, your stuff?

767
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,020
At the sell, sell, sell, sell.

768
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:52,540
Yeah, they do.

769
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:52,680
They sell their little stuff.

770
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,140
They sell their brawny shirt.

771
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:55,560
They sell their arms.

772
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,020
They sell their chilly winter nights.

773
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,560
And they sell space on their butts.

774
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,880
They sell their oil-burning miner's lamps.

775
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,500
They sell their, their, their chop, chop, chops.

776
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,360
But they all want to ingratiate themselves.

777
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,660
with the older sub gleamies.

778
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,940
Well that's a good thing, that's what this culture for.

779
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,980
They sell their rattlesnakes.

780
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:18,960
They sell their bodies.

781
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,720
Now there was one quite lovely young lady who was dancing around the fire.

782
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,900
Oops, and they spill the coffee at Pirate Cat Radio.

783
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,880
This woman was selling...

784
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,940
I'm really sorry to hear about that.

785
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:29,740
No!

786
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,980
Are you talking about the Marine?

787
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,680
Yes, she was in the Marine Corps.

788
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,680
She was headed for Japan as a corporal in the Marine Corps.

789
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,980
But there she was at Brushwood dancing around unclad around the fire.

790
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,260
You need that kind of thing.

791
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,600
Yes, well...

792
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,300
You always notice if they don't have clothes on, don't you?

793
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,740
Well they want you to notice.

794
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,560
Wow, wow, wow.

795
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,600
Anyway, there were all sorts of folks dancing around out there.

796
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,380
Not all, so...

797
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,200
She actually jammed with the band on the Friday night too.

798
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,300
She came up and did a song.

799
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:10,660
She was really quite something and it was amazing to learn she was heading back to Milford.

800
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,000
She was a military service after the settlement.

801
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,680
She was sweet.

802
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:13,960
She was.

803
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,060
She came up and introduced herself to me.

804
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:16,820
She was quite nice.

805
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:17,680
And I'm trying to...

806
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,980
I think her name was Lee or something, wasn't it?

807
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,300
Well now it's all there in the record book.

808
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,600
Lee or D or B or G or K.

809
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,560
They're all Marines of Lee.

810
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:31,980
It's an honorary name given to Marines after the war.

811
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,480
These oilings will calm the boiling...

812
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,020
Forget King Kong, just remember Urban Gorilla.

813
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,900
A beautiful female vocalist.

814
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,880
La la la la.

815
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,100
Cracing our stage.

816
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:45,720
Woo!

817
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,060
Reverend Lee Burles had a song she wanted to share with us folks.

818
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,000
And I'm sure it'll be better than the one you hear.

819
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,980
Don't pull your love out on me babe.

820
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,420
Oh, sorry, sorry.

821
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,580
Okay, this is the first time I've done this with an audience or whatever.

822
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,600
Yeah.

823
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,740
Can I take it off?

824
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,420
Yeah, you can take it off.

825
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,940
Take it off.

826
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:06,800
Woo!

827
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,680
Yeah!

828
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,500
A lady just entered the room.

829
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,040
Take your hats off.

830
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,380
Let's have some decorum here.

831
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,860
I mean, after all, everybody here is a subgenius.

832
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,640
So come on, let's tone it down.

833
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,640
Dance like a pokey, you and me.

834
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,980
This just like came to me one day.

835
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,660
It was really weird.

836
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,740
So, and...

837
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,960
Those feelings rollin' like a rollercoaster.

838
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,080
Those feelings rollin' like a rollercoaster.

839
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,040
Those feelings rollin' like a rollercoaster.

840
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,660
Just watching the doors, so that they had less of an actions.

841
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:52,380
Just watching theoptions hide from us.

842
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,520
I'm your fan.

843
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:06,040
Y'all still wanna burn away.

844
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,040


845
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,040


846
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,040


847
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,040


848
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,040


849
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,040


850
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,040


851
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,040


852
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,040


853
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,040
ates.

854
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:20,380
operations around us. Such a great experience, gonna share it with the universe. How would you do it? Different ways for each individual. Trails created, a path your own expression. The journey has just begun.

855
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:36,120
Spiling out in all directions in the rays of the suns. Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them. Spacecrafts forgotten. Space junk, the funk that makes our limbs want to move. Now we're on the groove.

856
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:48,360
Galaxies swirling, comets burning, vibrations around us. So much is happening in one moment. Lose your mind, see what you find.

857
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,360
More than the bumping clouds, the waves are coming.

858
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:56,220
I'm going it's your time to follow your hands. It's just a glimpse of so much more.

859
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,860
Wondering what is the score? Open your door.

860
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:18,440
Spiling out in all directions in the rays of the suns. Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them. Spacecrafts forgotten. Space junk, the funk that makes our limbs want to move. Now we're on the groove.

861
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,360
Galaxy swirling, comets burning, vibrations around us. So much is happening in one moment. We are the universe. What could we do if we didn't have space? We have our own secrets that are hidden. We can't escape. We have a unique race so we can't escape.

862
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:20,360


863
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,380
Comets burning vibrations around us

864
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,300
Creatures of earth disperse

865
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,180
The truth of knowledge, creation of destruction

866
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,480
It's not fair, don't despair, Baba's there

867
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,720
Create your own faith in your own taste

868
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,580
Ultimate risk to make a mistake

869
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,800
Now you know, no more fear

870
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,240
Slack is here, spiraling out

871
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,980
In all directions, in the rays of the sun

872
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,060
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them

873
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,360
Spacecrafts forgotten, space junk

874
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,640
The funk that makes your limbs want to move

875
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,200
Now we're in the groove

876
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,380
Galaxies swirling, comets burning

877
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,280
Vibrations around us

878
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,840
A beacon of light, it's quite a sight

879
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,420
It's okay, let's go play with the energy that is good

880
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:18,500
An important thing to get, let's not forget

881
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,960
The man with the gun

882
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:19,960


883
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,120
The fire in the pipe

884
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,900
Smoke rising high

885
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,520
Beyond the sky

886
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,820
The hope to help us cope

887
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,080
Spiling out in all directions

888
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,160
In the rays of the sun

889
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,520
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them

890
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,000
Spacecrafts forgotten, space junk

891
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,240
The funk that makes your limbs want to move

892
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,860
Now we're in the groove

893
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,920
Galaxies swirling, comets burning

894
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,880
Vibrations around us

895
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,020
The space ships have landed

896
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,440
The minds expanded

897
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,360
An indefinable being

898
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,800
A subgenius

899
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,260
Nothing else like it

900
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,820
Don't expect this shit

901
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,800
Look at what they get

902
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,560
Spiling out

903
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,080
In all directions

904
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,500
In the rays of the sun

905
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,020
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them

906
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,100
Spacecrafts forgotten, space junk

907
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,280
The funk that makes your limbs want to move

908
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,780
Now we're in the groove

909
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,040
Galaxies swirling, comets burning

910
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,800
Vibrations around us

911
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,840
The spirit is here

912
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,080
An unshadable Ebola

913
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,520
Great meaning extreme

914
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,720
More to life than what is seen

915
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,580
Stay away from that neat machine

916
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,140
You the abnormal mechanism of impossible

917
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,540
Make possible

918
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:45,120
Spiling out in all directions

919
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,760
In the rays of the sun

920
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,760
We are sinks in the fun

921
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,580

925
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,000

The most lonely

933
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,740
Being good for your life

934
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,660
The funk that makes your dreams wanna move.

935
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,260
Now we're in the groove.

936
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,440
Galaxy swirling, comets burning.

937
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,280
Vibrations around us.

938
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,500
