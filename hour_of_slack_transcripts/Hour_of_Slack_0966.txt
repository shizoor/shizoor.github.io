One of the worst moments you may ever experience
Yes it is
Let's go sit down
Talk this over
New microphone
Dear friends
Praise
The light
Reference
Steve Checky
Who left them just where he knew we the subgeniuses would find them
In the trash
Yes dear friends
And it's been a long time since I've put together a brand new fresh show
We've had to do reruns a lot because we've been busy
I've been in hiding
Adding massively to our website at subgenius.com
And animating
And there's been a ton of great work done
And we've had to make a lot of new mixes
That have built up from the artistes and artistesses of alt.binaries.slack
Where so much of this comes from
And friends as I record this now
It's right before the election
And I've never seen anything so horrible really
In the face of all of this
With this show I'm just going to go for the pure slack
If you can't beat the conspiracy
You can at least make yourself stronger
And paradoxically in the end I'm going to be the one who wins this show
I'm going to get more slack
So whatever happens in this election
And whatever is happening in the future world
When you listen to this radio show
Keep in mind
This slackfulness
The spirit of this slackfulness
Shall still apply
It's a brand new day.
Common side effects are headache, nausea, and abdominal pain.
Corn Pone.
Corn Pone.
Daddy, what's it going to be like in the year 2000?
Well, sweetheart, for your sake, I hope it'll be all peaches and cream.
But I'm afraid the end time is near.
The cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind.
It will be an era fraught with boundless greed and corruption,
where global monetary systems disintegrate,
leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice.
The nations of the civilized world will collapse
under the oppressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies
which remove all hope and optimism from their once faithful citizens.
Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins.
Unshielded by the ozone layer,
they have successfully depleted,
left to bake in the searing naked rays of light.
Wholesale assassinations serve to destabilize every remaining government,
leaving the starving and wicked to fend for themselves.
Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreak havoc.
Pissed-off androids tired of being slaves to a godless and gutless system,
where the rich get richer and the poor get fucked over and out.
Unleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust.
Annihilating the terrified masses,
leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious,
cannibalistic, mutated, radiated,
and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers,
bent on revenge, but against whom there are so few left alive.
Starvation reigns supreme,
forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything and anyone in their path.
Massive earthquakes crack the planet's crust like a hollow eggshell,
causing unending volcanic eruptions.
The creatures of the seven seas,
unable to escape to certain death upon land,
boil in their liquid prison.
Disease encircles the Earth,
plagues and viruses with no known cause or cure,
laying waste to whatever draws breath.
And humankind, having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers,
fall victim to merciless attack at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes
who seek to conquer our charred remains.
This is Extinction Level Event,
the final world front,
and there is only one year left.
Wow, that's cool.
I can't hardly wait.
You don't have to, because here it is.
Because here it is.
Because here it is.
Because here it is.
Yo! Calling all live niggas!
Calling all live bitches!
We have a job for y'all on planet Earth!
Flip mode world domination in progress!
Motherfuckers!
Hi!
Hey!
You see me?
Looking for excitement,
adventure,
business opportunities,
and a real nice place to raise the kids?
Well, explore no more.
We're there already.
Let's visit the world of the future!
World of the future.
Yes, this bustling world of the future.
World of a thousand moods reflects the dreams of its ambitious inhabitants,
dreams already realized of man's triumph over nature.
Where humans no longer suffer self-inflicted pains.
Where one is made to enjoy life.
Friends.
Friends, this is, it has been a fuck of a world lately.
Don't you agree?
The Constitution is in the shredder,
and Janet's titty is on the news.
The Catholic Church is raping little boys,
and what are the pinks worried about?
One stupid little titty.
Of course, that was a couple of months ago.
It'll be a new titty this time.
But what kind of bargain bin ladens are we faced with
as we smell the rank of stale pee on the Bush of Freedom?
My friends!
Yeah!
Those skull and bones guys have everything now!
They've got all the good drugs!
The adrenochrome!
And the saddest thing,
we used to laugh at the John Birchers.
Oh, ha ha ha.
Those funny right-wing conspiracy nuts.
Oh ho ho.
They thought the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations
were gonna take over the world.
Well, goddammit, if those kooks weren't right,
the right-wingers that took over the world are the commies!
That they were so worried about!
Hide the conspiracy right out in plain view.
Goddamn.
Friends, there is a mark of the beast.
There is a mark of the beast.
You make fun of 0666.
That's a big heavy metal rock and roll thing.
As a matter of fact,
the mark of the beast that shall be on the hand and on the forehead
is there already.
The mark of the beast on your hand is your fucking thumbprint,
and the mark of the beast that's on your head
is your goddamn ugly face!
Your face is the mark of the beast!
But, you know, without it, you can't get a job.
Jobs and this war
are both what we call contradictions.
Not contradictions, but contradictions.
Traditions of the conspiracy.
And what do us poor individuals,
I mean, we're not even a group.
We mostly can't stand each other
except for a few minutes at a D-Vival.
So how the hell are we gonna defeat
the conspiracy of all the normal people in the world?
Well, we've got one thing that they don't, and that's Bob!
We've got Bob, we've got our slack,
we've got our mutant abnormality!
Goddamn it, and sooner or later,
we're gonna have those aliens on our side.
Now...
I have to, now I have to get serious
and share something.
Something with you.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
Ha ha ha ha!
Mommy is a Christian, Daddy is a Christian,
Reagan is a Christian too!
And they don't like to make a Christian out of you!
Learn to consume and meet a nice girl
and follow her fucked up rules!
Make you a slave with what they call schools!
Visit a church on Sunday,
back up a job on Monday,
sacrifice the prime of your life
for mother's religion and grief!
After we load you up a thrall
and your able to aim you,
nothing will ever seem like you're taking it off the ass!
Brings you to your grave!
And you'll get what you deserve!
For God so loved you,
he gave you horrible skin problems!
For God so loved you,
he gave your daughter multiple birth defects!
For God so loved you,
he gave your mother terminal lung cancer!
For God so loved you,
he gave your mother terminal lung cancer!
God so loved you, he severed both of your legs in a car accident!
The Rudy Schwartz Project, dear friends!
What an amazing song!
Actually, at the end of that was a little bit of Riff-I-Shankar noise.
Rudy Schwartz Project, friends, remember that.
We've had a lot of the cut-ups in this show.
Collages by the great Mr. Fernando Nani-Lemur,
hosting under the name of Alvin Greenspan.
Earlier we heard...
the intro to the Busta Rhymes album
Extinction Level Event.
With that great end-of-the-world stuff.
And then the new World of the Future stuff
was the old, old underground movie that I did so, so long ago.
That's been recut, by the way.
There's kind of a director's cut out now.
And we heard some preaching from the Beachland Ballroom subgenius,
the Bible here in Cleveland.
We heard the Rudy Schwartz Project.
Do that song.
Nice lawn.
And now, friends,
more Lemur Mucho.
And even some music by yours truly.
This is the city.
Los Angeles, California.
I work here.
I'm a killer.
My objective, robbery and murder.
My most vivid recollection of Bob was on the ground outside.
I said,
Excuse me, Bob.
He said,
I'm gonna let you die.
I've always thought that Bob was a lonely outcast
with that smile.
I love Bob's death.
Why do you even have to say a word about it at home?
I understand.
I understand.
Hello.
Up next, this week's Silent Bob,
who became a TV star in a series called Whirlybobbz and starred in another film,
The Big Bob with Kirk Douglas.
Then signed a contract with Bob and went on to a game show,

Here's Bob.

That piece was called Dubzana Scotzi.
Voyager, flyover, voice, one mix.
And I made that myself using some Mac hardware, software, and some Lemur hard clips.
For an animation project that I've been shooting in Dobbstown.
Yes, friends, we're traveling.
Not only to Dobbstown, but actually in November.
The European third or fourth, I don't know which, anal frock.
Tour is happening with shows in November in London, England, Hamburg, Germany, Amsterdam.
I know that none of our listeners are hearing this there then.
But anyway, check out www.subgenius.com.
And then London again.
But how?
How can this be?
And now, now we will hear and see Lemur Greenspan.
It's enough to make you completely mad.
I've got to get a hold of myself.
I must lose my head.
There's one thing certainly I ain't hear.
I got it.
The tiger.
Yeah, yeah, that's it, the tiger.
I dragged him off to his lair, that's what.
Maybe not.
Pretty soon, not even the bones will be left to tell the story.
I know nothing of such matters.
I live alone in the ice and forests of Weir.
Such is the life of a catchman.
I mean, if there's anything you need or that I can do, please tell me.
Well, you could let me make love to you.
Make love, did you say?
Yes.
What do you mean?
You don't even know my psychocardiogram.
Eh?
Well, on earth, for centuries people haven't made love unless their psychocardiogram readings were in perfect confluence.
I know nothing of that.
You ask me what you can do for me, and I told you.
Well, alright.
But I don't see what good it will do.
Do you have any pills?
Pills?
Oh, never mind, I have some here.
Well, what is this pill?
It's an exaltation transference pellet, of course.
Hm.

I know nothing of this.
I see.
Well, on earth, when our psychocardiogram readings are in harmony and we wish to make love, as you call it,
we take an exaltation transference pellet and remain like this.
Here, let me show you.
For one minute or until full rapport is achieved.
Ah, I don't care for that.
This.
This is what I mean.
This.
A bed.
That?
But nobody's done that for centuries.
I mean, nobody except the very poor who can't afford the pills and the psychocardiogram readings.
Why not?
Because it was proved to be distracting and a danger to maximum efficiency.
And because it was pointless to continue it when other substitutes for ego support and self-esteem were made available.
So, you won't do it?
Would you say that you're not going to do it?









I simply must insist, I guess so.
But I can assure you there's really no point at all in doing it like this.
Without your, uh, garments, please.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh!
Don't do that at the table.
Sorry.
Look, I don't want you getting your groovy hands on her.
Wally, I know you have problems of your own.
Mom.
I thought I told you to keep your groovy hands off my stuff.
Wally!
I'm gonna fix you good.
Oh.
No.
Cheeto.
Whoa.
Well.
Well.
Well, Wally.
What, Wally?
Well, I don't know.
Well, uh, I'll call you tonight.
Just see that you do.
Oh.
Why, Beaver?
You're sick.
Well, uh.
Uh.
I don't know.
Call 1-3300 now.
This phone could ring any second.
Okay, Paul.
Well, my ears ring.
Shut up, you.
Okay, Paul.
Paul?
How can I get Karen to like me?
Well, uh, I guess the best thing to do would be just get a cat off the roof.
See you later, Paul.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

He made me put it on.
Uh, I wonder if I might speak to Wally.
Uh, no.
Do people down at the office think that was funny?
Well, gee, no, Mom.

All slack and fun aside though, seriously, how are we going to save the planet and save the universe this time?
I hear a lot of ideas about saving the planet, but it's usually from people who can't even change a tire or take out their own trash.
Have you ever, anybody here ever been lectured for an hour on how to run your own business by somebody who's never even held down a job for more than three days?
Yeah, those are the ones that are the real experts. They'll let you know, man, look, let me do that. I'm an expert in whatchamacallit.
And experts in consciousness, friends. We see so many experts in consciousness.
I was happy to see Steve Gaskin, who actually...
Among all the hot air balloons such as myself who speak on this stage, that guy actually has done stuff.
He really did get off his butt. He did...
There's an alternative to fleeing America or killing the president, which is running for office.
That's the one that none of us are willing...
We might do the other two, but we're not going to do that.
You know, whoa.
Well, Gaskin did, but I noticed he gets the same question that I get a lot.
Hey, Mr. Old Man, I want to defeat the conspiracy and save the world. What should I do? My parents are such assholes.
Well, if you really want to change the world, then mow your yard,
cultivate your garden, then start telling everybody else how to run their lives.
You know, seriously, it's like you cannot change the conspiracy of the normals, but you can change yourself.
And you don't have to be dependent.
You know, if your parents are assholes, pardon the expression, but get a job, kid.
Quit complaining and do something.

Yeah.
Yeah.

It takes more than intellect to be a musician.
Put your soul into it a little.
Okay?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's fun.
If slack is something you get for nothing,
then what's my 30 bucks worth?
The 30 bucks is for the bragging rights to the slack.
That's really all it is.
And you get an 8x10 picture of Bob
and a little card for your wallet,
which you can try to get in places cheap.
You do get a real ministership in the Universal Life Church,
but I can give you that for free right now.
You're all ministers in the Universal Life Church there.
I can tell you that.
Whether you want to be,
whether you're not.
Oh, yes?
Yeah, now that the conspiracy is more subtle,
vile, and pernicious than ever,
what do we do about it?
Now that the conspiracy is more subtle,
vile, and pernicious than ever,
we become more vile and subtle and pernicious than ever.
Or go the other way and do like most of us do,
is just kind of live between the walls,
in the cracks,
trying not to draw too much attention.
And yet, as Frank Zappa said,
he's just trying to get us to the bottom of this.
You're not going to pass another little bit
to the next poor sucker down the line, you know.
You go, you've got to take care of yourself first.
And if you have any leftover,
then if you've got lots of slack,
it automatically shares itself.
But you cannot give somebody else slack
if you don't have slack yourself.
And since nobody else can tell you what slack is,
God damn it, you're on your own again.
Isn't that a shame?
You actually do have free will.
Damn, Bob cut you loose,
and he's in fact trying to scare you away
from joining his religion.
No wonder we're doing so crappy financially.
Damn.
You know, I've often, and this is honestly true,
I've looked at the Scientologists and thought,
if only one of us could keep a straight face.
But,
obviously,
yeah.
Oh.
When dealing with very basic questions
and putting them into William's machine
or thinking just in that same way
about how to take things right down to their very nub
where you couldn't change anything more
without destroying the question itself,
when one asks, what are we here for?
One realized that all of the religions of the world
had said that we were here to love God and obey Him
and kiss His ass and suck His gear
and turn over and get killed by Him
and be dumbed down into hell and eternal punishment
if we didn't do like He wanted to do.
And this turned out not to be true at all.
It turned out to be like a nose and diarrhea of bullsh-
because, obviously, what we are here for is
that we're here to go.
There's another future for us, we're not here to stay.

And before that, some cut-up Byron Ginson,

but Lymph Node Institute.
And before that, a question and answer
from the last Starwood Festival.
Fernand and Andy Lemur did some cut-ups.
The song, Something About Bob,
taken from those Evil Insight commercials,
was by Reverend Ed Fred.
There was some preaching from Starwood
and some Reverend Carter LeBlanc
preaching at 7X Day.
We heard the King of Slack doing that song,

That's Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Huh?
This is our next quote version unquote ma'am.
There's a little thing we do about a process which is known as electroshock therapy,
a very therapeutic process which has helped these young men become productive members of the musical industry.
But, hell, that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they shocked the living gee out of me.
Listen to my tale then.
But why? Why do you call me mad?
Could a madman have written songs such as these?
I think not. I'm not mad.
I'm merely an ordinary person seeking life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
My pursuit of happiness includes machine gunning 127 innocent children.
If that's mad, go ahead, lock me up.
Just because I enjoy washing my face in the blood of infants, is that any reason to lock me up?
I think not.
I've even got a piece of paper that says my mind is still okay.
Hell, I bet that guy down at the employment agency who wouldn't give me a job just because I'd been locked up one time,
bet he ain't got a piece of paper that says his mind is still okay.
Hell, I tried to tell him it was not me, it was the green energy demons, but they merely laughed at me.
But now those green energy demons are ruling the planet.
They're not laughing right so hard now, are they?
They're not laughing right so hard now, are they?
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they shocked the living gee out of me.
They're not laughing right so hard now, are they?
I tried to explain it was not me, it was the brain, the brain of Arnold Palmer,
which was controlling my mind via laser beam, via the FBI, via the CIA, via the Communist Party, via satellite.
It was the demon, the demon that forced me to do the deed.
But that wasn't nearly...
Dot, dot, dot.
Dot, dot, dot.
It wasn't...
I'm not insane.
I'm more sane than Son of Sam and Charles Manson put together.
How many people must I kill to prove I'm not insane?
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they...
shocked the living gee out of me.
Well, I didn't mind when they shocked the living pee out of me.
In fact, I kind of enjoyed it when they shocked the living see out of me.
I mean, that time they ran over my face with a pickup truck.
Oh yeah, that was fun.
That time they cut me in half with barbed wire and then peeled the band-aid off my...
my amputated arm.
Oh yeah, that was fun.
That time they skinned me alive and then called me dirty names.
Wee-haw!
That was a big ol' cocaine party.
That one time they converted my entire body into a wall of membrane
whose only purpose was to feel pain.
No, that time they converted my entire body to a wall of membrane
attached to a human brain whose only purpose was to feel pain
and then applied the flame.
Oh yeah, that was fun.
That time they converted every cell in my body
to the same nerve endings found in male testicles,
enlarged each cell to the size of a sun,
and then inserted huge sun-sized...
dentist drills into each of these sun-sized male testicle cells.
Wee-haw!
That was the time of my life!
Compared to that time they...
shocked the living gee out of me.
Hell, I thought a frontal lobotomy was a warm fuzzy.
I mean, I'm a...
I'm okay, you're a frontal lobotomy.
But it's all a very therapeutic process.
Hell, that time they put me in the room where you don't get any of the good pills.
Then they...
they had a needle that was so big
they had to lower me on top of it by a helicopter
in order to anesthetize me.
And that was only the needle, I'm not talking about the syringe.
And even that wasn't enough to put me in the room.
I had to get my head out.
Then they hooked me up to that device.
I'm not talking about that A.C. device.
I'm talking about that D.C. device.
They had Jones' titty hooked up too.
Then they applied the electrodes to my head.
I was still trying to explain to them how I wasn't insane.
I'm not...
I'm not a bad psychopath.
But hell, all that was fun, I reckon.
I guess you could call that a good party compared to that time they...
shocked the living gee out of me.
I just wanna say...
Doctors for Bob, dear friends,
have shocked the living gee out of me.
But before that, another great Rudy Schwartz project.
Songs interspersed with Lee Marie and Cut-outs.
And now some noise by Rabbi Shankar.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Somewhere in hyperspace, Bob has prepared a place for those he lusts for who will pay.
The X's will come again and make us over and the countdown's getting higher on X day.
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and four and five, send your thirty bucks while you're alive.
Two and three, hurray!
Which will be when humans take a dive.
The countdown's getting high at our food drive.
Bob Dobbs was shot for you, met with the devil too.
But in deepest hell he did not stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Stay.










The countdown's getting higher on X day.
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and nine, send your thirty bucks, you're out of time.
Forty-two, boy, did he get you.
Salvation should be a crime.
The countdown's getting high on Frop this time.
So, where's the damn thing?









Here we are.
All right.
Fellas, here's your story.
Over.
Over.
Here at the North Pole, a few men have been destroyed with an arc of electricity.
Over.
Over.
Over.
The flying saucer which landed here performed a similar service with an arc of wood.
This pilot is recovering from wounds received in the battle.
Anchorage.
Anchorage.
Over.
Anchorage.
Over.
Over.
Over.
That's your story, friends.
Your story from Fernand and Andy Lemur.
Before that, the song we heard was by Reverend Self Slayer, and the name of that song is
the Blast Your Head Off song.
This music in the background, by the way, is automatic robot fish.
Greenspan.
Reboot.
Oh, yeah.
Over.
Reboot.
So I asked the computer to improve me and said, you know what I'm talking about.
That's making me think very carefully.
Jesus Christ.
Those loads pay off.
Yeah.
25 a day.
No, wait.
How would you like to collect 450 frog skins a week?
And here's how, dear friends.
Send your frog skins to this station and your or your chosen charity or church.
That could be something that a person might do.
Frog skins for Bob.
That's all we're saying.
And there's more on that moron Bob at www.softball.com.
Subgenius.com.
Incidentally, friends, I should mention to you that our old Austin and Dallas P.O.
boxes have both closed down for good due to the horrible tragedies in Texas.
Our new P.O.
box is, as it has been for a while, actually, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
And that's, you can write to Subgenius Foundation for free information or hour of slack or Reverend
Ivan Stang at Post Office Box 181.
417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
44118.
It's so beautiful.
And the background music this whole show has been by Reverend Angry Larry under the name
Automatic Robot Fish.
Normally, he plays with the amino acids, but he also does movie soundtracks like this.
Well, we both do awful things.
I'm not sure if you've heard of it.

Thanks, dear friends.
Because we love you.
And Bob, Bob loves you.
Bob, I'm so sorry.
That's fine.
No.
There's no way of me.
So.
Hi, Molly.
Well, I'll get a lot.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Hello, Wally?
This is me.
Hey, Beaver.
You're a dumb little kid.
You better hurry up and get in line.
Okay.
Goodbye, Wally.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.

Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.



Bye.
