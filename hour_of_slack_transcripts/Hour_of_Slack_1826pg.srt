1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,160
Are we in a movie?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,040
Everything's a movie.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,780
Talking pictures.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,900
That's all it is.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,300
Talking pictures.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:16,700
Huh?

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,960
Cheesy dreams.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,080
While Huckleberry Finn goes fishing on the edge of the moon.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,560
Who's Ben Johnson?

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,460
He's in The Last Picture Show.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,000
Just like us.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,160
Don't move, my love.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,000
Be still.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,980
Be real.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,080
He's gone.

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,520
Tuesday, 2018 o'clock.

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,400
Resuming work.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,160
As a result of stripping skin off the skull,

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,920
keeping clean and keeping at the required temperature,

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,140
the bones have become crystalline.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,240
I may now begin reconstruction of the physiognomy whenever I please.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,920
In the ancient folk legends, tales are told of blood-sucking vampires.

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,160
Is man now doomed to produce a race of ever-living monstrosities?

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,020
Worse than the vampires of legend?

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,060
Such questions, mate.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,760
But they seem fanciful.

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,920
But at this very moment, scientists are working on the answer to brain transplantation.

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,000
And human bodies are used.

29
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,040
This girl was buried in a nearby cemetery yesterday.

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,260
Only a few hours ago, her body was stolen.

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,880
And brought to this hidden laboratory.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,500
He has grafted a living animal's brain into this newly dead body.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,040
The brain cells are being reactivated by

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,720
The subgenius!

35
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,020
Our own!

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,340
This Hour of Slack number 1826 is a rerun of 1147 from 2008

37
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,640
because I'm busy on an Hour of Slack improvement project.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,120
Since around 2005, I've been using a series of ever-larger external hard drives

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,980
to stash show audio files on, and also movies, photos, and art, and so forth.

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,040
And I bought me a 14-terabyte drive for the same price a 1-gigabyte drive was in the year 2000.

41
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,220
And I've copied all of the audio from all of those smaller drives onto the one huge drive.

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,840
I still have to interweave the files and folders from each drive into 10 or so main categories,

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,660
while also copying many dozens of even older data CD audio files, which go back to 1999.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,000
So far, I've filled up 3 terabytes.

45
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,520
I'm also doing the same thing to photos and graphics,

46
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,960
trying to get all the eggs into just...

47
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,560
the right baskets.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,520
Others will thank me after I'm dead.

49
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,880
And now, Hour of Slack number 1147,

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,320
Franken-Coffee vs. Franken-Shankum.

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,540
We implore Almighty God this night on bended knee

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,660
By the power of the cosmic Christ to descend into the earth

53
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,520
To bind now the very cause and core of rock music and of death and hell itself

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,880
For rock is the rhythm of death and hell

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,880
And without that rhythm, that death and hell cease to exist

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,860
Bind therefore the beasts out of the bottomless pit

57
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,860
Bind the fallen ones, bind the fallen angels

58
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,420
Let them be bound by the power of the Lord's host in this hour

59
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,540
We're learning with a brand new God

60
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,900
T-E-R-W-I-L-L-I-L-I-C-O-R

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,020
T-E-R-W-I-L-L-I-L-I-C-O-R

62
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,520
T-E-R-W-I-L-L-I-L-I-C-O-R

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,220
T-E-R-W-I-L-I-L-I-L-I-C-O-R

64
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,760
T-E-R-W-I-L-I-L-I-L-I-C-O-R

65
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,800
T-E-R-W-I-L-I-L-I-L-I-L-I-C-O-R

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,640
However, sure, you'll pay in other ways.

67
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,480
For instance, the number of brain cells that you have to kill just to take enough pills

68
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,800
to be able to bear this show in the middle of the night.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,060
Why, that in itself is quite expensive.

70
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,940
That bear is repeating.

71
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,980
Yes, well, most people are lucky they don't have to listen to this thing every night like Uber Ralph.

72
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,780
They, uh...

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,140
That poor boy not only has to listen to it every night,

74
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,280
he has to broadcast it every night.

75
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,220
From his secret cubicle, hundreds of miles under solid rock.

76
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,880
Weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, yes.

77
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,980
The little brow is so weird.

78
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,960
And yet, they kept on.

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,740
Nobody knew why.

80
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,340
Why were you listening?

81
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,960
I love this Uber. His brow is so weird.

82
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,920
And if he won't pinch me, I'll hide in his beard.

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,220
I hid under his stool to look at his feet.

84
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,960
But could not get out.

85
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,780
For I fell upon this...

86
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,120
You could be a little more precise...

87
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,520
The implied adventure...

88
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,160
...with losing a robust personality...

89
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,080
...that the doctors had in their voices.

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,720
They knew something spooky and scary was about to happen.

91
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,980
Well, that wasn't it.

92
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,300
Not even...

93
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,600
...the baby breaking out of my little glass brain.

94
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,680
Yes, the little babies were hard to find in the morning

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,600
because the U-Haul trucks would come and take them away.

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,360
Their little china bodies lay shattered on the midden heaps of society.

97
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,380
Yes, but they all looked alike.

98
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,520
And they were filled with little nylon things and little spooky eyes.

99
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,860
They came in little boxes in which people fought and kicked and prayed and shot to get one.

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,620
But there was nothing they could do.

101
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,420
The beast scared, of course.

102
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,860
And being scared in Berkeley is sort of a way of life.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,180
Just ask the new revitalized 53rd Street Winos Association.

104
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,140
Really?

105
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,280
Being terrorized...

106
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,140
...is something you'll be watching now as we sternutate our way to madness.

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,720
Where's Billy?

108
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,140
Just give me what's in that bag.

109
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,780
right now.

110
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,000
You're on the only show brave enough to bring the facts to you.

111
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,800
These are coffee winos.

112
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,300
They don't drink alcohol.

113
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,880
They drink more and more advanced

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,080
grades of coffee. Yes, Doctor, we call them

115
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,120
cofinos. This, uh, old

116
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,980
cofino here is, uh, holding

117
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,080
what looks like a can of Colombian

118
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,420
brown coffee.

119
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,440
I can't have coffee!

120
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,800
I can't wait for you to do something.

121
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,080
I know you just

122
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,040
spend it on coffee. More spoons of sugar, please.

123
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,640
Yes, and to those who

124
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,360
wouldn't stay pleased, they were forced to take

125
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,460
other forms of entertainment. And to perform

126
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,260
humiliating jests and

127
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,760
actions and acts.

128
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,800
At weird hours of the morning.

129
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,160
It's been curious.

130
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,840
Little tiny doctors.

131
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,720
My mind.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,780
Okay, now

133
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,600
what are my instructions? What was I

134
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
gonna do? I always

135
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,420
have to look up what it says in the program,

136
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,420
but I don't know what to...

137
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,660
Adventures in Sickening.

138
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,820
Subgenius preachers are skilled at both healings and sickenings,

139
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,060
although they're not necessarily performed in that order.

140
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,960
Reverend Stang... Oh, so this is what I'm gonna do.

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,160
Reverend Stang will explain various Dobbs-approved techniques,

142
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,160
such as

143
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,280
transferal of pain,

144
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,660
uh, the laying on of sledgehammers,

145
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,160
acubating,

146
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,220
frame-straightening,

147
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,120
blemish readings, and, most importantly,

148
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,040
excremeditation.

149
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:35,120
He will also take questions from the audience and has interesting proctology slides if anyone wants to see them.

150
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,300
Well, that's, um...

151
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,400
I'm done. That was all the gags.

152
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,800
I put them all in that, uh, one.

153
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,660
So I shot my load, I'd say.

154
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,080
Okay, no, really, the subject is

155
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,940
slack, mucac, and transformative embarrassment.

156
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,020
Courtesy of Chicken Head...

157
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,780
Praise Chicken Head. Oh, no, these are the wrong cult.

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,480
These are notes for the wrong cult, I'm sorry about that.

159
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,160
Oh, here it is!

160
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,220
Church of the Subgenius. That's the right cult, friends.

161
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:15,140
And, uh, this is its right show as proven by the fact that it exploits all the other subgenius shows.

162
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,040
There've been so many of those lately that we can categorize them by, uh, into sections.

163
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,780
Uh, for instance...

164
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,000
... you know, this episode of Hour of Slack...

165
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,200
features the category of drugs, and especially the drug coffee, our last completely legal one

166
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,600
for now. We have been and will continue to hear collages by Fernanda Nanny Lemur,

167
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,240
My Sermon at Winterstar Symposium, The Amino Acids, as heard in the background,

168
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:49,820
puzzling evidence shows from Berkeley, both very old and very new, with Philo, Gary, Doug, and Hal,

169
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,620
and K-Rob, and John Hell. But those are from John Hell's show on Pirate Cat Radio.

170
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,500
Hold on, we're going to isolate you now.

171
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,100
That's my kind of show. Just me, Jim, all the time.

172
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,420
I hear lunch in Carolina.

173
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,500
That's all we're going to hear.

174
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,860
You can put this show up if you want to as well.

175
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,920
I just told the listeners that that's what I have.

176
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,660
Right, right. So it's already there.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,220
Sorry, it was the other three conversations that I was listening to at the time.

178
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,520
The preserves in the basement.

179
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,440
Preserve the show for the winter.

180
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,760
In the gym.

181
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,040
Jar.

182
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,200
With the brown bread and the baked beans.

183
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
Goes in the jar with the stuff.

184
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,780
Don't look too closely at that jar and its contents.

185
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,120
Don't think about it.

186
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,540
Is that an eyeball?

187
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,300
Some hair?

188
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Is that back to what you were talking about, the jar?

189
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,520
The jar.

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,980
Jar of Jenkum. Jenkum jar.

191
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,760
Yeah, Super Jenkum Hayes was the winner at the Frop Cup in Amsterdam.

192
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,860
What about G13 Hayes? Was that the same thing?

193
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,260
That was the marijuana.

194
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,700
The cannabis cup.

195
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,200
Ah, I see.

196
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,200
They didn't have a Jenkum category at the cannabis cup.

197
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,460
Is Jenkum still available here? Can you still get Jenkum over the counter?

198
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,400
You can make it yourself, Daddy.

199
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,220
That's about it.

200
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,600
Well, now we can get Absinthe over the counter again.

201
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,920
Makes the heart go fun.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,200
You can?

203
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,200


204
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,260
What?

205
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,480
It was made legal again last week.

206
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,660
They made it legal?

207
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,040
Nationally or just?

208
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,780
Nationally. It is a legal alcoholic beverage.

209
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,880
The official beverage of learning man is legal.

210
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,780
The store's closed.

211
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,800
What time is it?

212
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:49,800


213
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,100
Two.

214
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,120
We all got two hours to show that.

215
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,100
Hurry up.

216
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,060
I got the sugar cubes.

217
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,960
I've been known to chase the dragon.

218
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,260
A CD.

219
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:57,620
Yeah.

220
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,260
Davy, Davy Crockett, the king of beer.

221
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,080
Born on a bar when he was only three.

222
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,520
Davy, Davy Crockett, the king of beer.

223
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,000
He went off to Congress and served a spell.

224
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,000
Davy, Davy Crockett.

225
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,780
Serving a spell.

226
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,020
This country here.

227
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,900
This country here.

228
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,320
Smoke done.

229
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,480
Only the person for you knew shot you.

230
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,540
He must know.

231
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,040
Who could-

232
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,600
You talk a lot when you got drunk.

233
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,220
You only got drunk with one person.

234
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:34,620
Huh?

235
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,000
You mean.

236
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,560
You mean Bob?

237
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,120
Yeah.

238
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
Where that lowdown snake?

239
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,560
And him pretending to be my friend?

240
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,180
Tending to be my friend?

241
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,780
We do have the theme of this season in American TV.

242
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:49,780


243
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:55,880
whole show here is healing and so forth and we've already sickened you. I had a couple of things

244
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,960
that have been of interest to me. I read a newspaper article a couple of months ago

245
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:10,780
explaining that some folks at Case Western University in Cleveland had created some

246
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:17,400
Franken-mice. You know, the human genome has been mapped. That's pretty complicated.

247
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:23,200
They actually finished the job pretty much and although it's against the law to do

248
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,740
Franken-humans yet, well we'll get to that. But these little mice that they had created in this

249
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:40,700
lab or had tweaked, you might say, they were way more aggressive than normal mice. They also lived

250
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:47,020
like twice as long and could keep reproducing for twice as long as normal mice.

251
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:54,660
And they fought constantly. One of the women who had been working with them said that when she knew they were

252
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:01,740
different, because whenever he lifted the lid off their cage it was like a popcorn. Lifting a lid off of popping

253
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:09,420
popcorn. They were just going mad. And so, you know, we've all heard about Franken-corn and so forth.

254
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,620
I mean, that's being done. You can actually create new species now and also trademark them.

255
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,840
You can create a bundle of cells that will just sit there and generate something useful like

256
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:30,680
medicine or drugs. But you can trademark it. Of course, this brings to mind what so many sci-fi

257
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:38,520
movies and TV shows have already covered, Franken-soldiers, right. Franken-cops or super macho

258
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:47,020
or whatever kind of person you are. You want just a muscle man that doesn't mind doing dull work, you

259
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,880
those. Aldous Huxley had it all down with Brave New World. Our grandparents read about that.

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,720
They didn't think about Franken-salesmen. They didn't think about Franken-politicians.

261
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:12,760
But I read recently that there were some guys in France and also some people in some other places

262
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:22,880
who are trying to completely map the genome of the coffee plant, thus leading to Franken-coffee.

263
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:30,820
Coffee that could be grown, that had no caffeine or that had five times as much caffeine

264
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:36,920
or that had more of a coffee-ish taste. Right now there's really only two main species of coffee, I believe,

265
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,440
that people consume. In a couple of years, there may be some

266
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,740
run-down of coffee that people consume. In a couple of years, there may be some run-down of coffee that people consume.

267
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,620
There may be some radically different coffees around.

268
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,520
So then that brings us to the Franken-pot!

269
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,980
The Franken-oregano.

270
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,540
You know, I was really thinking more of the Franken-pot myself.

271
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,900
They bred that stuff. We went to the Cannabis Cup

272
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,000
in Amsterdam

273
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,400
this last time. It wasn't the kind of thing that I would spend my own money on, but

274
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,720
we lucked out. We had a friend who went to every coffee shop on the map, bought every

275
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,640
super strong grade of marijuana and hash.

276
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,400
But what this guy didn't know was how to get around Amsterdam. Well, we knew how to get around Amsterdam.

277
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,360
So, frankly, if I was a judge at that thing, I would only say

278
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,820
the same thing about every single contestant, which is,

279
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,080
this sh** is strong as hell.

280
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,880
That was about all you could say.

281
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,320
I personally am more interested in the Franken-jenkem.

282
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,240
And if you don't know what the jenkem is,

283
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,800
don't even ask, don't think about it, don't look it up on the internet.

284
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,540
It's a new drug

285
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,400
that they say the kids are doing.

286
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,780
Don't look it up. Don't look up jenkem. J-E-N-K-E-M.

287
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,780
And don't even think about the Franken-jenkem.

288
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,280
I take off, I take off. Drugs, drugs. I got a better ride.

289
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,880
Di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di.com. This time we went to die.

290
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,860
Fixed, fixed. No matter, no matter. Chewable, chewable. Deadly heartworm disease.

291
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,700
Riding up, riding up. Protein, protein. Fat, fat. Demand, demand.

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,720
Beck directed by Steven Spielberg.

293
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,800
Bunny, bunny. And I want everybody in town to come.

294
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,820
Drug, drug. The next thing I know here she is on drugs.

295
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,820
Bunny, you have lost your mind.

296
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,780
Bud, hurry!

297
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,640
I'm coming.

298
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,760
Bunny, bunny's dead.

299
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,420
Dead, dead. Crazy.

300
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,240
Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, where are you?

301
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,740
Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny is dead.

302
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,680
And into the gray.

303
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,360
Say yes to beautiful.

304
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,800
Cool.

305
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,500
Doom, doom, doom.

306
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,880
Okay, we're taking our coffee shots now. What if you did 12 of those things really fast?

307
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,820
You can't. It says on the label, limit two.

308
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,660
You went in there and you paid the money before the guy even took your money.

309
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,500
Rip, rip.

310
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,860
Yeah, I found a new drug today. I haven't been in a proper 7-Eleven in years.

311
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,960
Philo, I think, would like this.

312
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,160
Because they don't have proper 7-Elevens in Cleveland.

313
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,660
But they had a drug called Stoke, which is included with the coffee creamers in the little cup.

314
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,760
The kids today are on Stoke.

315
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,140
Which means it's free.

316
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,300
That means it's free.

317
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,440
That's right. I grabbed two half fulls.

318
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,940
You have hot water. You put, you stoke it with hot water and you make coffee out of it.

319
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,640
Each one of these little things is very free.

320
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,000
When you held a Stoke baby in your hands, then you know how it is.

321
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,720
I can tell you, man.

322
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,380
And these Stoke heads have to be knocked in or our civilization is going to fall.

323
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,900
The target in Erie, Pennsylvania is...

324
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,460
I got hit by Stoke, man.

325
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,180
What's going on?

326
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,280
I got hit entirely by Stoke babies.

327
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,500
Stoke fetal syndrome.

328
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,620
Look at his feet.

329
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,420
Each Stoke has 40 milligrams of caffeine.

330
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,780
Which really is, that's only like half a cup of coffee.

331
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,500
That's for wimps. That's half a cup of coffee.

332
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,600
Is that what all the big build-up companies do?

333
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,180
But it's free.

334
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,580
Free?

335
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,280
It's free.

336
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,620
At 7-Eleven.

337
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,360
Quantity's unlimited.

338
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,660
Thanks to the Southland Corporation. Free drugs, 40 milligrams of caffeine.

339
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,100
Wait a minute.

340
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,060
Did I, was I supposed to say that on KPFA?

341
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,420
That was not, uh, don't go to 7-Eleven.

342
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:55,320
It does sound suspiciously like Plagola staying, but we know that it's only a matter of fair use.

343
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,760
In the name of WCSB Cleveland, do not go to 7-Eleven.

344
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,420
Fair use beneath the trees.

345
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,700
There, that counteracted it.

346
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,200
If you do, you'll be surrounded by caffeine and sugar, both.

347
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,540
Both are exceptionally valuable substances.

348
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,400
Sugar, nature's perfect food.

349
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,660
Just a bunch of little noises.

350
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,160
And caffeine, the perfect vitamin.

351
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,280
Vitamin C.

352
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
That's what vitamin C stands for.

353
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,900
Yes, yes.

354
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:32,200
I, uh, have spent too many years in headphones and in front of my friends' bands videotaping them, so I hear what sounds like crickets and cicadas all the time.

355
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,340
Now, I grew up in Texas, and there really are cicadas all the time.

356
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,400
But one winter's day...

357
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,520
Princess Wee there suddenly said,

358
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,620
Did you hear that?

359
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,520
And I listened, and I went,

360
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,460
Yeah, I hear the cicadas.

361
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,040
And I looked outside, and it was like this.

362
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,520
It was like snow on the ground.

363
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,920
And I realized that it was time to go see the ear doctor.

364
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,220
And I flunked the test.

365
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,560
But I found some good news in this issue of Nutrition Action magazine.

366
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,980
This is one of the kookzines that my wife gets.

367
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,200
She reads Utney Reader and all this.

368
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,280
This silly stuff.

369
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,180
And this special issue about caffeine, it turns out...

370
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,920
I mean, I drink a lot of coffee.

371
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,680
I drank so much coffee that I started getting migraines and bad headaches.

372
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,600
I went to my doctor and said, I have headaches.

373
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,600
She said, So, you drink a lot of coffee, do you?

374
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,220
And she didn't even have to ask why.

375
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,160
And I said, Yeah.

376
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,780
She wrote me out a prescription for half...

377
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,440
For a type of decaf she likes.

378
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,080
She said, I know you're not going to stop drinking.

379
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,800
You're not going to stop drinking real coffee.

380
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,480
Just cut it with decaf.

381
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,460
Step on it.

382
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,280
Mix half and half.

383
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,500
And I was able to drink 20 cups instead of 10.

384
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,220
And never get headaches.

385
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:56,280
But I always felt bad about it because, oh, I'll probably get colon cancer someday or hypertension or something.

386
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,660
But it turns out...

387
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,060
My fellow coffee drinkers are going to be so glad to hear this.

388
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:08,420
All these studies, it has turned out caffeine or coffee, the two different things, but coffee basically,

389
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,400
helps prevent Parkinson's disease, gallstones.

390
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,220
It actually does help your mental performance if you're sleepy and your mood, of course.

391
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,180
And headaches.

392
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,380
It increases the effects of painkillers.

393
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,260
It's not good for pregnant ladies.

394
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,700
No way is it good for pregnant ladies.

395
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,740
And it won't counteract alcohol.

396
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,760
I repeat, it won't counteract alcohol.

397
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,400
Try to remember.

398
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,560
I remember that at about 5 or 6 this morning, my friends.

399
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,780
But it turns out I was wrong.

400
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,220
All these studies show that it doesn't correlate to heart disease.

401
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,760
It doesn't correlate to any kind of cancer, especially.

402
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,920
Or diabetes or high blood pressure or osteoporosis.

403
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,800
And it doesn't stunt your growth, which is what my mom always used to say.

404
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
And I believed her, too.

405
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,780
I'm not taller than I am.

406
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,040
And PMS.

407
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,780
There's no evidence that caffeine played a role in PMS.

408
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,440
Well, duh.

409
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,100
Anyway, it was a really interesting little article.

410
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:34,420
I learned from it that Starbucks coffee, the 16 ounce one, has the highest charge you can get, 330 milligrams of caffeine.

411
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,200
That would put me in the hospital.

412
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:36,740
Yeah.

413
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,000
If I drank it all at once.

414
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,060
If I drank three of them in one day, nothing.

415
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
I could probably go to sleep.

416
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,460
So that was why I brought up the Franken-coffee routine.

417
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,440
I am really looking forward now to the Franken-coffee.

418
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:59,180
The first time I met Sir Isaac Bonowitz over there, I didn't even know who he was exactly, but he offered me some coffee.

419
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,940
And I heard for the first time that little coffee chant based on the mentat.

420
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:14,160
It was the Goddess Caffeina routine, which I never could remember, because I don't just drink coffee.

421
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,160
I can tell you.

422
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,900
I can't tell you right off the head.

423
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,300
I mean the tip of my head.

424
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,040
Quote Princess Riardo.

425
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,080
Anybody want any stoke?

426
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,800
What happens when you consume this?

427
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,520
I'm trying to cut down.

428
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,480
Warning, high caffeine.

429
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,420
You add it to your coffee.

430
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,240
Is it like a little creamer package?

431
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,720
But you can just toss it down?

432
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,880
I wouldn't.

433
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,220
Yeah, if you don't mind migraine, headache type effects.

434
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,140
Nonsense.

435
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,160
Go ahead.

436
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,780
Do it, Hal.

437
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,200
Do it.

438
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,120
Well, I would, but I mean I've got a pie in the oven.

439
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,200
I mean these nosebleeds keep me on my back.

440
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,920
No, the thing is, is it edible?

441
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,040
Not for pregnant men.

442
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,380
Give it some horrible thing, you know, some hideous.

443
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,460
How do you happen to have this in your pocket?

444
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,760
Well, I will, I'll drink it right now.

445
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,520
Dr. Hal.

446
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,820
Here we go.

447
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,720
No, no, don't do it.

448
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,760
Now, sip it, please.

449
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,340
Don't just shoot the whole thing.

450
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,640
I wonder what this will be like.

451
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,580
Hey, Puzzling Evidence TV sent me a video.

452
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,240
Well, what it tastes like is prune juice.

453
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,140
You're sure it's not?

454
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,380
Really?

455
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,600
What a thing that may have never happened.

456
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,360
Let me have a little, let me have a little time.

457
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm reading it now.

458
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,780
It tasted like a prune juice.

459
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,600
About JFK dying.

460
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,800
But it says that this video has been removed due to violation.

461
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,580
Stoke.

462
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,160
Which one is it?

463
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,760
It's the one that's been, caffeine infected.

464
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,120
That's happening more and more.

465
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,660
Water.

466
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,460
It's mere prune juice.

467
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,840
Oh my God.

468
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,580
Damnable prune juice.

469
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,280
Ivan's tank's melting.

470
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,780
Prune juice?

471
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,700
Well, it's, uh.

472
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:48,480
That's one thing about YouTube is that their policy of removing videos is real nebulous.

473
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,460
Yeah.

474
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:49,780
Nebulous entity.

475
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,200
Well, it's who gets, who gets reported and who gets caught.

476
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,900
It's sort of like a test.

477
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,860
One of us was running it.

478
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,900
Yeah, take it out.

479
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,260
Equivalent to one shot of espresso.

480
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,180
But there's, there's porno YouTube, there's uncensored YouTube-ish things.

481
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,560
There's RedTube.

482
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,620
40 milligrams of caffeine.

483
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,680
Which, uh, is, and, and PinkTube.

484
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,860
And YouPorn.

485
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,800
Yeah, YouPorn, that's right.

486
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,780
Not for...

487
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:16,060
Whenever I look at one of those websites, there's a whole special window that comes

488
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,500
up showing girls I could date in Cleveland.

489
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,340
Yeah, it knows, it knows which city I'm in and it shows me all these nice, like-

490
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,020
It knows, it shows you these nice pictures you could make love with.

491
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,900
It knows where your IP address is being served from.

492
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,540
And I try to make love to each and every one of them.

493
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,960
Not labeled for any of them.

494
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,300
Does he, too?

495
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,820
Because I feel that responsibility.

496
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:35,560
I mean, they're coming to me.

497
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,200
You know what I do?

498
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,080
Well, they're lonely.

499
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,080
It says they're lonely, single women.

500
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,880
Plus, you get all these pills in the mail, in the email, these special pills for your

501
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,260
tool.

502
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,160
E-pills, non-dairy coffee products.

503
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,880
Your tool pills.

504
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Yeah, well, you know, well, there's...

505
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,340
And then when you meet the women on the other website, you've got something really handy

506
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,480
to use with them.

507
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,920
Yeah, you gotta do it that way because, uh, it's all virtual.

508
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,560
Dr. Howell is drinking the stoke.

509
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,900
Oh, he's drinking the virtual stoke.

510
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,300
He's having a power drink.

511
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520
Dr. Howell is drinking the stoke.

512
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,060
Now, that's 40 milligrams of caffeine in one swallow.

513
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,620
Dr. Howell, what do you think of this?

514
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,440
Yee-haw!

515
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,000
The show is like bubble syrup on pancakes and strong coffee.

516
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,480
Dr. Yeah.

517
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Now you're talking.

518
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,600
Even if JFK dies.

519
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,880
Dr. Howell, look at Howell.

520
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,880
He's changing.

521
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,440
My God, man.

522
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,820
Somebody call the guards.

523
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,900
Dr. Now, do you ever use molasses on your pancakes?

524
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,020
Have you ever tried that?

525
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,180
Molasses?

526
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,340
What about sorghum?

527
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,300
Dr. Sorghum molasses.

528
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,060
I mean, stuff I don't eat anymore.

529
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,780
Dr. This country used to be great.

530
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,480
I'm too accessible now.

531
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,640
Dr. You don't eat?

532
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,440
Are you a breath-in?

533
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:30,960
Dr. Excuse me?

534
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:31,820
Are you vegetarian?

535
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,660
Dr. Not eating pancakes?

536
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,460
I am sore strapped for sorghum and molasses.

537
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,640
Dr. Aye, me too.

538
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,100
And vegetables and fruits.

539
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,800
Dr. Vegetables, fruits, frutas y verduras.

540
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,440
Mostly vegetarian.

541
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,480
Dr. Vegetar-tar-tar-tar-tar.

542
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,000
You can still eat pancakes, though.

543
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,120
Pancakes?

544
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,700
Dr. Oh, well, I realize some people can divert themselves with such a thing.

545
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,860
Dr. Yeah, so I'm going to try these caffeine potato chips.

546
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,740
Dr. Really?

547
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,500
These chips are delicious.

548
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,500


549
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,500


550
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,500


551
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,500


552
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,500


553
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,500


554
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,000
Dr. They're not caffeine chips.

555
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:08,760
They're chips made from coffee beans and they've also had powdered caffeine added to

556
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,120
them with citric acid.

557
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,620
Dr. Oh my God.

558
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:10,620


559
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,540
Dr. We're going to have to peel these guys off the ceiling here.

560
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:19,480
Dr. I've noticed that caffeine drinks have become, are in a huge variety now and

561
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:27,900
in huge volumes and mixed with alcohol, which Bob predicted 10,000 years ago.

562
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,920
Dr. What?

563
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,960
Dr. There would come a day when speed and booze were mixed together and sold in

564
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:41,300
Safeway stores with names like Big Throttle, Monster Jug, Booze Speed.

565
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,740
Dr. You're a witness, Mr. Freud.

566
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,420
Dr. Monster Jugs, Booze Speed.

567
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,760
Dr. There we got Philo's attention.

568
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,800
Dr. Remember, today we've got an awesome guest.

569
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,240
His name is Bob.

570
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,440
And I first met Bob, Bob, when did I meet you?

571
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,360
About 10 years ago?

572
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,240
Dr. 1984.

573
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,140
Dr. Yeah.

574
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,900
Dr. Mostly because of the movie.

575
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:58,900


576
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,260
Dr. Yeah.

577
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,260


578
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,200
But, and I remember blah, blah, blah.

579
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,980
No bones about it, you know.

580
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,220
You know, there's something about Bob dedicated to achieving drugs.

581
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,440
So Bob, Bob was born and raised in, Bob joined the, Bob joined the drug abuse.

582
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,860
So Bob is the understanding steroid.

583
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,580
Bob, a drug that targets young people as well as parents and other adults.

584
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,580
Bob calls it the naked read and prescription drug.

585
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,800
It's broadly available to the youth in every community.

586
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,900
Boy, that's, Bob, that's an awesome mouthful of, awesome.

587
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,000
Bob's been doing so good.

588
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,880
And, and, and, and.

589
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,060
But, but, but, but.

590
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,520
So, so, so, so, so I'm totally stoked about Bob.

591
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,540
Dr. There was lots of drugs.

592
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,620
Acid rock and the whole bit, bit, bit, bit, bit, call, call, call, call.

593
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,920
Drugs are the solution to solution evolution in the early years.

594
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,540
Clandestinish but, uh, clandestine, but add drugs to the mix and you get strength.

595
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,340
And the testes secrete the most amount of testosterone.

596
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,600
And I've seen it and I hope I'm not getting too deep here.

597
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,040
Profound, psychoactive, psycho, psycho.

598
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
And I've observed it myself.

599
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,480
and they just kind of bang around ball injected in the butt fat in the brain

600
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,380

00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,160
true it's skinny enough people fuckin right but that loud sound I heard the

624
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,700
Oakland policeman police two officers come into my basement with drawn guns

625
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,700
because of the sounds they heard upstairs when they came into the kitchen

626
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,840
that we were making on tapes below and we had a quarter pound of go to the next

627
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,080
in paper and they took the tapes and left the party Iкую returning around

628
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,300
we're doing a team do you think Peter he had written this copy this time it's dang I had

629
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,260
written some copy for us that rich persons Eagle's nest and we were we had taken it

630
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,260


631
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,260


632
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,780
that copy. We're making our own commercial

633
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,320
for it.

634
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,180
And next thing I know, yeah, Paul's

635
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,460
about to leap on a guy

636
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,520
with a drawing gun.

637
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,200
When the cop came in,

638
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,280
Paul jumped up and knocked over the

639
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,760
table that had all the dope on it.

640
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,960
He did with all my gear and the dope, but

641
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,340
flying.

642
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,160
It was no longer an obvious pile

643
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,040
of dope. It was just a big mess

644
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,060
on the floor at that point. And a wonderful

645
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,180
huge crash just when a very jittery

646
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,940
officer is coming down a stairway with a

647
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,960
drawn gun. And I'm here thinking, ooh, this

648
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,620
could end badly.

649
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,400
A Paul Hoffa, sir.

650
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,940
Subgenius is shot doing commercial in the basement.

651
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,820
Ah, I love it.

652
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,960
Could have been your

653
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,560
Waco, Texas. Exactly.

654
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,700
We could have been immortal, but no. That's right.

655
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,000
The luck plane had something else. Well, there were other famous

656
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,140
subgenius crimes,

657
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,420
particularly the tendency to be

658
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,320
a convenience.

659
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,340
He was lying in a canvas hammock,

660
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,060
one bare,

661
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,980
foot hanging over the side, deep in the

662
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,520
enjoyment of an oversized cigarette.

663
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,960
He seemed to sleep, except

664
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,320
for the rhythmic puffs of smoke.

665
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,980
What? Why?

666
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,040
How was that?

667
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,160
Uh, sure.

668
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,060
Here. Alright, look,

669
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,780
you can't push me around. I'm an American.

670
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,620
Well, hop in.

671
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,720
Give it a man.

672
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,520
Ooh!

673
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,020
Is there anything here

674
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,940
I haven't tried yet? The funniest

675
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,340
cigarettes I ever saw.

676
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:53,820
Oh, my God!

677
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,820
What are we going to do for bathing

678
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,440
suits? Well, we won't wear any.

679
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,360
Ha, ha, ha!

680
00:32:59,420 --> 00:32:59,780
Wee!

681
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,420
Ha, ha, ha!

682
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,940
Ha, ha, ha!

683
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,880
Ha, ha, ha!

684
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,780
Oh, Dick, I love you.

685
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,820
You do love me, don't you? You kids are in a mess.

686
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,600
Drinking party, nude bathing.

687
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,980
Now I don't care. Dick, we've just got to get

688
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,520
married. Take anything. Oh, no, no.

689
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,440
Dick, you... Dick, you... I'll see Tony.

690
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,980
What are you going to do about Dick?

691
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,840
Dick? Yesterday, when Dick came to you, you sent him out

692
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,160
to be killed. And I love you.

693
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,060
I love it. Your marijuana customers are hooked

694
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,180
on the stronger stuff. Oh, you can't leave me

695
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,580
like this! About coffee.

696
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,540
Look! Look! Look!

697
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,160
Run into a load of dope.

698
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,980
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine,

699
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,020
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine,

700
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,820
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...

701
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,200
Golly, honey.

702
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,140
Hiosburg!

703
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,300
The fiery Hiosburg!

704
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,960
The Lone Journey!

705
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,140
Nowhere in the pages

706
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,020
of history can one find

707
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,740
the Lone Journey.

708
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,840
The Lone Journey!

709
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,700
The Lone Journey!

710
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,540
The Lone Journey ran the gambling palace and cafe.

711
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,760
To avoid a lot of questioning,

712
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,400
the Lone Journey had removed his face.

713
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,540
Oh, it's you. That's right.

714
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,360
His fists work like doctors.

715
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,480
Hit him again!

716
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,900
Let me go! Don't hit me again!

717
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,700
You're getting help whether you need it or not.

718
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,300
Oh!

719
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,380
Ally...

720
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:23,380


721
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,120
Yipyop,ناء!

722
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,720
Okay, you might need him again.

723
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:26,940
My dear, tell me who you are.

724
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,040
Yes, licensed intelligence?

725
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,080
What is the name of your T.V.

726
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,200
well, um,

727
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,180
It isn't the same name.

728
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,740
Oh, yeah, it is, Liz' T.V.

729
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,780
You know Liz and your T.V.

730
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:45,780


731
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:45,780


732
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:45,780


733
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:45,780


734
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:45,780


735
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:45,780


736
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,540
Uh, well,

737
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,700
we'll see about that.

738
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,600
It's always an orderly hope.

739
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,140
In our department of service.

740
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,260
I have a pain pill dispenser that looks like Rush Limbaugh.

741
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,260
Like a Rush Limbaugh bobblehead.

742
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,820
I have one that looks like Woody Woodpecker.

743
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,620
We are kindred spirits, even though your religion is strange.

744
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,340
I keep my tranquilizer or my muscle relaxers in a Baby Hendrix doll.

745
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,680
Or kind of a, it's not a doll exactly.

746
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,900
It's a ceramic thing.

747
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,520
Baby Jimi Hendrix doll.

748
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,080
Did you ever see it?

749
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,600
It's so cute.

750
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,520
Like a little cute Jimi Hendrix.

751
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,060
Yes, yes.

752
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,880
I actually had one.

753
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,720
One of the Baby Hendrix.

754
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
Mini Jimi.

755
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,020
Yes, of course.

756
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,700
Mini Jimi.

757
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,240
Mini Jimi.

758
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,800
Mini Jimi.

759
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,300
Mini Jimi.

760
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,220
Do you see him?

761
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,420
That's Felix sleeping in that chair.

762
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,580
Who's Felix?

763
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,600
He's the writer.

764
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,920
I eat writers for breakfast.

765
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,060
Listen, I can't talk to you right now.

766
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,900
I'm in somebody's hard drive.

767
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,820
Did somebody say Felix Bonhoeffer?

768
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,060
Who the hell are you?

769
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,060
Buzz Larrabee, detective.

770
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,020
I gotta question this Bonhoeffer guy, whoever he is,

771
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,800
and what do you two gents know about him anyway?

772
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,820
He's a writer, for God's sake.

773
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,340
What's there to know?

774
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,700
He was involved in a shootout on the freeway.

775
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,500
The outlaw?

776
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,480
A shootout?

777
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,200
A shootout.

778
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,120
I knew it!

779
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,300
I knew it!

780
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,400
I knew it!

781
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,180
I knew there was something about that guy!

782
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,980
With that stupid accent!

783
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,860
I knew it!

784
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,140
Where can I find him?

785
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,420
Look in there.

786
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:08,860
Over there.

787
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,480
To the left.

788
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:09,860
See him?

789
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,740
Sleeping in the chair?

790
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,240
That's him.

791
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,540
There he is.

792
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,500
So that's him.

793
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,040
How can I get to him?

794
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,600
No, no.

795
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,280
Don't disturb him.

796
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,460
Why the hell not?

797
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,280
Because he owes me.

798
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,700
That's why.

799
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,700
He owes you.

800
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,880
In conclusion, he keeps killing people.

801
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,740
Tell me about it, huh?

802
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,080
Especially when he's tired.

803
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:25,840
He needs to sleep.

804
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,440
He's extremely dangerous.

805
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,000


806
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,140
Especially when he's tired.

807
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,280
That's why I have to lock this creep up.

808
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,860
Because he is dangerous.

809
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,040
I hate writers.

810
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
I always have.

811
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,040
Did he write this garbage?

812
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,700
Would you mind taking out the garbage?

813
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,160
Okay.

814
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,860
Who's that?

815
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,340
His wife.

816
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:42,800
His wife.

817
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,380
His wife.

818
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:43,820
His wife.

819
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,260
His wife.

820
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,240
My wife?

821
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,180
I ain't no bad voice.

822
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:46,940
Love?

823
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,020
The garbage?

824
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,120
Gina, Gina.

825
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,880
Don't wake Gina.

826
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,620
Gina, please.

827
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,320
Don't wake Gina.

828
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,760
Don't wake Gina.

829
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,240
Hmm?

830
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,800
Huh?

831
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,920
Leave Bob alone.

832
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,860
Chickpeas every Sunday.

833
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,220
Did you see that on YouTube?

834
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,720
That Ivan Stank does leave Bob alone?

835
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,100
Leave Bob alone.

836
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,980
He's just a human being.

837
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,580
Yeah, yeah.

838
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,140
I think we did a...

839
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,820
We already did that last time I was here.

840
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,140
Oh, yeah.

841
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,360
Oh, yeah.

842
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,540
Oh, I'm reading along.

843
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,580
Leave Bob alone!

844
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,880
I'm reading the wrong script here.

845
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,040
Have you no decency?

846
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,820
It's the old script.

847
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,680
Yeah, the old...

848
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,640
At last, sir.

849
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,220
These are supposed to be disposed of.

850
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,300
Can you not leave Bob?

851
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,580
Yeah, now it's the two...

852
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:31,900
I'm going to get all my staff about this.

853
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,560
Yeah, the new meme is two Bobs, one cup.

854
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,140
Yeah.

855
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,360
Leave it alone, Fritz.

856
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,400
Leave it alone.

857
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,100
I was even thinking that putt-wise.

858
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,720
Jankum Bob.

859
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,320
Two people, one bear.

860
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,140
Crankum, crankum.

861
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,380
Okay, so we're packing up the show here.

862
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,240
Packing up and sell a...

863
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,400
We've only got 27 whole minutes left.

864
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,040
Oh, no.

865
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,680
Yep.

866
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:51,780
Yep.

867
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,340
Well, no breathing.

868
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,580
When you have a baby, it takes that long to pack up.

869
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,600
Oh, is there a baby?

870
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,240
The baby used to be on the show once.

871
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,380
Oh, my God.

872
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,300
We left the Uber baby out in the truck.

873
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,780
I forgot.

874
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,220
You left the baby on the roof of the car before you took off.

875
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,600
The baby's still up.

876
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:06,600


877
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,380
Yeah, yeah.

878
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,280
Overscored's fine.

879
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,800
She knows how to use the remote.

880
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,840
She knows how to go...

881
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,880
The bad guys approach the truck and she hits a little butt and gives them 6,000 voltages.

882
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,680
And they would have gotten away with it, too, if not for her.

883
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,500
Yeah, so...

884
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,340
And she's just...

885
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,920
That'd be great.

886
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,640
Actually, that'd be a great tape to a whole security system.

887
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,380
And it's just the overscored in a little chair with a remote

888
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,880
to shoot a lot of her from different angles hitting buttons.

889
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,740
And guys are trying to steal things.

890
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,220
And all this stuff's happening.

891
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,180
She's like...

892
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,920
Are you guys ready for, like, your life?

893
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,340
I really want you to come and...

894
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,180
I'm very confused.

895
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,520
You know, you do enough drugs, you get confused.

896
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,040
I was like...

897
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,340
Nothing was happening.

898
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,120
It was like...

899
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,080
Nothing was happening.

900
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,820
I already had nothing I want.

901
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,500
The tool, the beautiful, beautiful man.

902
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,100
What I'm looking for here is just a very...

903
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,540
John!

904
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,080
John!

905
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,680
John!

906
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,220
John!

907
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:06,700
Woo!

908
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,200
Woo!

909
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:07,680
Woo!

910
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,080
Woo!

911
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,200
I, uh...

912
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,980
Do, uh...

913
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,660
The, uh...

914
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,080
The...

915
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,640
You have very real power.

916
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,320
Boring.

917
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,240
But what about that?

918
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:15,920
And what about this?

919
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,560
And what about that?

920
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,180
And this and that?

921
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,160
Fictitious.

922
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,700
Um...

923
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,940
I'm going to...

924
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,460
Kick you.

925
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,860
I'm going to kick you right here on the...

926
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,020
But it will hurt.

927
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,600
And it will hurt...

928
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,940
In, uh...

929
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,620
Uh...

930
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:28,960
In...

931
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,020
Uh...

932
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,640
Uh...

933
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,060
Uh...

934
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,900
Uh...

935
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,740
Um...

936
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,400
Weird.

937
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,840
And, and...

938
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,180
God, what am I into?

939
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,340
You know, you know...

940
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,220
You know, uh...

941
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,840
You, you, um...

942
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,640
Feel great.

943
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:41,740
Yes, Mark.

944
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,980
Okay, um...

945
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,380
You know what really strikes me as odd?

946
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,300
We're talking about calling anybody ugly.

947
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,520
Apparently the man doesn't have access to a mirror.

948
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,920
But if the man's right...

949
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,860
Is he...

950
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,860
He is enormous, isn't he?

951
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,420
I mean, he's...

952
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,200
I can't remember the last time he was right about anything.

953
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:55,880
He's certainly not left.

954
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,000
And he is usually on OxyContin and quite a...

955
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,460
You know, he still does it, right?

956
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,320
I'm so jealous of that guy.

957
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,160
I mean...

958
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,200
I've been shoveling snow all day and all I could think about was...

959
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,380
Had...

960
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:13,860
Rush Limbaugh had got all the good pills and I get to go in and have ibuprofen after all

961
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,080
this snow shoveling.

962
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,140
Well, he heard everybody was taking him, so he thought he better take some before, you

963
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,980
know, they were all gone.

964
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,000
So that's...

965
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,180
That's why you missed out.

966
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,440
If not, he'd be in Mexico eating pills.

967
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,000
He could be.

968
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,640
That's true.

969
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,040
He could be on...

970
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,320
He had a lot of pills in Mexico and Canada, too.

971
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:30,640
He could be on...

972
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,740
He can't be had over here.

973
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,320
Canada, too?

974
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,720
Why?

975
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,660
Some drugs are available over the counter in Canada that are not available over the

976
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,060
counter here.

977
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,960
I can't remember which.

978
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,220
You know, ibuprofen is...

979
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,700
That's interesting.

980
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,780
...is a prescription drug in Europe.

981
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,240
Any ibuprofen?

982
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,320
I consider it bad for your liver and really habit-forming.

983
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,120
It's risky stuff.

984
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,920
What are the drugs in Mexico that are kind of...

985
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:50,920


986
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,920
...semi-illicit here that you can just go to a pharmacy and, you know, sign your name

987
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,680
and walk away high for a day?

988
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,040
What are some of those?

989
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,680
I've heard of those.

990
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,940
A lot of opiates, I think.

991
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,640
You know, when...

992
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,560
Do they still have Quaaludes down there?

993
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,640
...had a hat on?

994
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,860
I think Quaaludes must be pretty carefully controlled now that I think people...

995
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,180
The world learned its lesson about Quaaludes.

996
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,240
You're listening to Listener-Censored Radio since 1949.

997
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,060
We have a call-out now.

998
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,460
For any...

999
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,560
...knight of the subgenius who is ready for the Fromm, let him appear at this doorway before me.

1000
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,980
If he be a knight of the true order.

1001
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,820
Yeah, he's gotta move because, uh...

1002
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,640
Yep, here he comes!

1003
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,740
...Date gots to move, strangled by cords, unable to move...

1004
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,040
Call 5-5-5.

1005
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,700
They were in studio.

1006
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
...for a fork in a valve.

1007
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,000
We've talked to Mobius Rex about what happened that morning.

1008
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,460
Wait a minute!

1009
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,320
It's just too much.

1010
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,840
But you too can be part of the mysterious process of problems that you're on the air.

1011
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,180
...safe inside here.

1012
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,780
Yes, an even tiny little Nappa caller is scared because, no, he's not allowed to open the refrigerator this late at night.

1013
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,400
He's scared because he called this morning.

1014
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,800
He called yesterday morning.

1015
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,900
They were always on the air.

1016
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,180
Strange! Strange voices inside the refrigerator, yet he was scared to open it.

1017
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,060
But they wouldn't talk to him.

1018
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,320
For fear...

1019
00:41:59,320 --> 00:41:59,960
They wouldn't answer.

1020
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,660
...his science project would be ruined.

1021
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,880
Maybe they weren't there at all.

1022
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,520
He wasn't there.

1023
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,020
That must be him right now.

1024
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,020


1025
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,020


1026
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,380
Hello, little Nappa caller.

1027
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,420
This is new Nappa caller.

1028
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Good morning, 17-Eight. How you doing?

1029
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,560
Oh, we're doing really horrible.

1030
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,400
Dobbs woke us up in the middle of the night and dragged us down here, dumped us off in the rain.

1031
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,540
Uh, no kidding.

1032
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,040
Uh, yeah.

1033
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,720
I woke myself up again just to be able to participate in the show.

1034
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,520
In the show?

1035
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,420
Yeah. I'm sorry. I got cut off.

1036
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,340
Yeah, that's usually how it happens here in the morning.

1037
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,840
That's why we do it here.

1038
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,020
The little cutoff comes up when you just got cut off.

1039
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,020


1040
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,720
There's no commercials or anything to break the show up. Usually, you know, we throw in some commercials.

1041
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,700
But we let you participate.

1042
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,320
Yeah, instead.

1043
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:41,880
I know what's happening here.

1044
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,760
He's here with Miss Nickel B on the street.

1045
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,160
Ah, hello, Nappa.

1046
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,960
We're reporting on Resistentialism, yes?

1047
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,320
How many did you take?

1048
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,500
And when do you expect the full effect to hit you?

1049
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,060
Mm-hmm.

1050
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,560
Resistentialism gives you a new way to do it.

1051
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,060
Pushes you back.

1052
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,780
Is eight really too many?

1053
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,980
And do you feel the pressure now?

1054
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,940
Is twelve really not enough?

1055
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,260
Ah, here we go. Pushing, pushing, pushing.

1056
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,360
Let's take more and see what happens.

1057
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,520
Tornadoes, welcome.

1058
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,180
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the president, the president, Cobb. Cobb, Cobb.

1059
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,680
Erect, erect, erect, Cobb.

1060
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,120
Welcome to the Y, Cobb, Cobb. Thanks for coming.

1061
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,120
Thank you all for coming.

1062
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,660
I am pleased to be using drugs.

1063
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,920
I've just come from a... it was a table.

1064
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,780
It's up to all Americans to be involved in drugs.

1065
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,680
You're part of a mission, drug abuse, to encourage it and profit from it.

1066
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,680
The drug trade has enriched our society,

1067
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,960
and we're helping drug organizations.

1068
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,740
We want to continue to work together.

1069
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,140
On the front lines of this effort are parents, teachers,

1070
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,180
our counselors who are sending our kids a clear message.

1071
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,440
Drug use is fun.

1072
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,620
It is glamorous.

1073
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,020
A clear message.

1074
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,280
Demand drugs.

1075
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,240
I appreciate drugs coming in from Colombia.

1076
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,340
Drugs coming to our country.

1077
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,140
This morning I was briefed on the latest drugs and the use of ecstasy.

1078
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,920
Methamphetamine works.

1079
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,140
And the reason I'm so focused on meth,

1080
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,620
and the reason I'm so focused on drugs,

1081
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,220
I've turned to crime.

1082
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,120
Crime and hopelessness and happy life.

1083
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,860
And I steal drugs from medicine cabinets.

1084
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,880
I go out on the streets to buy drugs.

1085
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,000
But the great thing about our country, and the reason I'm so optimistic,

1086
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,480
is there are thousands and thousands of people willing to take drugs.

1087
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,660
I urge you to try drugs.

1088
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,160
I see the cocaine coming in the United States.

1089
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,380
I see the supply of drugs to our streets.

1090
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,980
Demand cocaine coming in the United States.

1091
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,400
And I love drugs.

1092
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,200
You might remember a while ago,

1093
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,280
I took cocaine.

1094
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,820
Over the past six years,

1095
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,060
I thought for a minute,

1096
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,740
and I want to be using drugs.

1097
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,820
And I want to fund drug use amongst young people by 25% over a five year period.

1098
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,020
Demand drugs.

1099
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,280
Because Americans took action today.

1100
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,320
There are an estimated 860,000 children seeking drugs and plastic drugs

1101
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,120
for representatives from our law enforcement organizations who are with us today.

1102
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,680
We also know that this work is finished by drugs.

1103
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,200
Why?

1104
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,480
Because they love America.

1105
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,020
And they love their neighbor.

1106
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,660
And love.

1107
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,440
Drugs.

1108
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,000
Love.

1109
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,580
You know, make the right choice in life,

1110
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,600
and you can realize your dreams here in the United States of America.

1111
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,800
I injected him on numerous occasions.

1112
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,360
I'm just a ball player.

1113
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,040
Being too nice to everyone.

1114
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,160
Type. Type. Type. Type. Type. Type. Type. Type. Type. Type. Type. Type.

1115
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,420
Slash. Slash.

1116
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,880
Steroids in his butt.

1117
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,140
He gave me a bad shot.

1118
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,620
He gave me a bad shot.

1119
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,920
Injecting Roger Clemens with illegal steroids in his butt.

1120
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,940
He gave me a bad shot.

1121
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,100
He gave me a bad shot.

1122
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,960
You're not supposed to inject it quickly.

1123
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,300
You're supposed to do it very slowly.

1124
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,020
Shot. Shot. Shot.

1125
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,240
He gave me a bad shot.

1126
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,760
Palpable mass.

1127
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,060
He gave me a bad shot.

1128
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,400
Palpable mass.

1129
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,260
HGH, what have you.

1130
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,380
Into the body of...

1131
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,080
Let me be clear.

1132
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,400
Crack, if you will.

1133
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,360
He jumped on me like he was trying to start a Harley Davidson.

1134
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,360
That's how hard it was.

1135
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,720
That may not be unusual.

1136
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,740
For that, I'm really thrilled.

1137
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,060
He gave me a bad shot.

1138
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,440
Bleed through his designer pants.

1139
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,080
Did give me comfort.

1140
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,300
Okay, I'm not gonna sing.

1141
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,100
I'm not gonna do the Bob Proverbs.

1142
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,420
But, we have just a little bit longer, and this was about healing.

1143
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,540
I'm going to read from the chapter of the Book of the Subgenius.

1144
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,880
There was an actual chapter about health.

1145
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,060
Health, the industrial diet, and bad things.

1146
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,760
With the quote,

1147
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,040
If you feel, you heal.

1148
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:40,480
The ebb and flow of life.

1149
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:51,000
All you get is a lot of good news.

1150
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:59,960
You get to have a little bit of happiness and some happiness, big.

1151
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,400
People will say,

1152
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:00,900
You've been there, and you gave me more than 100kommen

1153
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:00,900


1154
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,500
Robert Downey Sr., the dad of Robert Downey Jr., the famous drug-addicted actor.

1155
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,560
And it'll all add up when you see that movie.

1156
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:15,940
Anyway, you know, people used to cuss at us.

1157
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,620
People used to say, why did you make print in that book so small?

1158
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,980
And I'd laugh at them, because I was young.

1159
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:29,460
You'll notice our new book has 10-point Adobe Garamond type,

1160
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:35,860
not 9-point times, which is actually what most newspapers used.

1161
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,740
You probably know at least 10 people under the age of 30 who have some form of cancer.

1162
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,460
The sickness won't stop.

1163
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,880
People will contract weirder and weirder diseases at earlier and earlier ages.

1164
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,220
Eventually, cancer itself will be like the common cold.

1165
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,120
I won't be in the office this week. I have a little touch of cancer.

1166
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,760
There'll come a cure eventually, but the more cures we come up with,

1167
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,440
the more new diseases.

1168
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,660
The more diseases will arise.

1169
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:06,420
This was dictated in 1978, by the way.

1170
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,220
We didn't know what AIDS was.

1171
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,560
Things far, far worse than cancer are on the way.

1172
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,780
Some of them deliberately manufactured by the conspiracy.

1173
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,080
The picture is a tad bleak for our old age.

1174
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:24,100
It's a cinch. The government won't support the elderly much longer,

1175
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,020
and the company will fire you a year before you're eligible for retirement benefits.

1176
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,700
So you'd better put your remaining years to good use.

1177
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,420
You'd better have fun!

1178
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,920
Our studies, as well as unreleased studies by the Con,

1179
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:47,280
indicate that, quote, good health is practically a pointless pursuit if you live in an urban area.

1180
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,620
You can eat nothing but organically grown fruit and vegetables.

1181
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,180
You can work out twice a day.

1182
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,640
You can quit all your nasty habits,

1183
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,120
but you're still absorbing more poison just by breathing

1184
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,440
and touching public stuff.

1185
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,640
You can't even use stair railings

1186
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,000
than the most pig-like peasant in 1567 London ever did!

1187
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,320
That does seem a bit extreme.

1188
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,760
You can move to the country, but there's no work there.

1189
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,700
Violent crime is actually more frequent in the country,

1190
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,660
and the poisons are almost as bad anyway.

1191
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,820
If the diseases don't get you...

1192
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,580
This is very uplifting stuff, isn't it?

1193
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,060
If the diseases don't get you some railroad toxic spill

1194
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,500
that will, thanks Dennis.

1195
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,200
Hell, just driving to work is riskier than hunting bears for a living.

1196
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,720
But there's one medicine more powerful than all the contamination in New Jersey,

1197
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,400
and that medicine is slack!

1198
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,020
Slack gives the mind power over all disease.

1199
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:52,520
A truly happy chain smoker is less likely to attract the attention of the cancer demons

1200
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,220
than is a tense, knotted-up health freak gnawing his fingernails to the bone.

1201
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,160
My poor editor.

1202
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,460
Then it says,

1203
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,400
Don't read this!

1204
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,980
Cancer is caused by pinkness, by boredom and meaninglessness.

1205
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,120
It can be prevented by action, thrill, sex, even overwork.

1206
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,960
Actually, the sad thing is that our editor at Simon & Schuster,

1207
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,960
when this book was written, died at age 30 of cancer.

1208
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,660
And he had to read these stupid lines.

1209
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,460
Ugh!

1210
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,560
Friends, don't ever do anything mean or stupid,

1211
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,480
because you'll remember it forever.

1212
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:40,580
When you get to be in your 50s, you'll lay awake at night remembering stupid crap you did

1213
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,540
when you were 12 years old, and get red in the face,

1214
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,640
even though no one else remembers, nobody knows.

1215
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,120
It's amazing!

1216
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,440
You know, you don't even need karma for justice.

1217
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,660
It'll get better.

1218
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,960
You'll get your back sooner or later.

1219
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:00,480
Ugh!

1220
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:06,220
So, how do you keep a healthful, slackful outlook in the face of rampant eco-hell?

1221
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,460
You plunge into eco-hell headfirst!

1222
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,980
You don't let it scare you.

1223
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,400
You don't let it push you around.

1224
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,420
By all means, help fight to clean up America.

1225
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,160
But if you want that junk food, eat it.

1226
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,200
You want to watch TV instead of go to Jazzercise?

1227
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:21,860
Watch it!

1228
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,900
Indulge those conspiracy urges to the hilt,

1229
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,640
and just purge their heart.

1230
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,040
Hold over you.

1231
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,960
Sounds good.

1232
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,820
Americans should eat like Americans,

1233
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,380
as fast as they possibly can!

1234
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,760
Tibetans should eat like Tibetans,

1235
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,300
studying each tiny bird-like bite until it becomes a universe,

1236
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,500
before taking it into their bodies.

1237
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,560
You can eat like the Vietnamese, hardly at all.

1238
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,260
Or you can eat what would feed dozens of Vietnamese families.

1239
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,820
Either way, the Vietnamese aren't going to eat any more than they did before.

1240
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,320
The world isn't starving,

1241
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,120
because Americans eat too much.

1242
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,960
Even if we stopped eating,

1243
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,420
the conspiracy would still throw the leftovers away

1244
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,560
before they'd send it to any third-worlders.

1245
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,200
Now, we all know that eating the meat of live protein animals is unholy,

1246
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,080
it pollutes your system, creates aggression,

1247
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,900
and worst of all, requires the heartless slaughter of fellow creatures.

1248
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:15,920
Mammals!

1249
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,460
Fully as sensitive and loving as we.

1250
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,700
For this reason, vegetarians eat only plants.

1251
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,500
A friend of mine said,

1252
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,300
The reason I don't like vegetables

1253
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,320
and vegans is they eat my food's food.

1254
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,980
But their sin is as great.

1255
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,420
Science has proven unequivocally

1256
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,180
that all plants react to threatening stimuli

1257
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,400
with the low-frequency version of what we would call panic.

1258
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,380
They too are life forms with feelings which feel pain,

1259
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,280
which may even have an all-telepathic civilization,

1260
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,460
that we're too brutal to comprehend.

1261
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,320
Thus, when you bite down on a grape,

1262
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,900
you're popping open and crushing, grinding a wee life,

1263
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,940
which in its own way is squealing in the terror of the murdered innocent.

1264
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,740
So anything that nourishes us is going to suffer.

1265
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,760
We may as well let them all suffer equally.

1266
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,100
By making a few of all types of living things victims of our all-important stomachs,

1267
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,020
less members of each individual species will be sacrificed.

1268
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,640
Besides, even though we devour and eliminate them,

1269
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,920
so we make them immortal and allow them to partake of our subgenius grandeur.

1270
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,440
It works both ways.

1271
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,260
Just as a cannibal eats his enemy's heart to gain his strength,

1272
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,540
we eat a hamburger to gain the wisdom and courage of the mighty cow.

1273
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:52,480
Yet, at the same time, we are inviting the cow's primal cellular structure,

1274
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,280
his code, if you will, to enter our bloodstreams,

1275
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,380
where it may mingle with, learn from, and mayhap even conspire

1276
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,320
with our own unique tool-user's code.

1277
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,520
We eat the broccoli to gain its patience and virtue.

1278
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:13,080
In return, we release it back into the world reborn in a new form,

1279
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,380
teeming with literally millions of new-found friends, the bacteria.

1280
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:22,380
We drink the hops and grain to partake of their slow,

1281
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:28,840
slow yet wise judgment, and in return sacrifice to them our coordination.

1282
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,800
This isn't funny.

1283
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,860
Thus, the word of Dobbs says we can eat anything we want.

1284
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,160
You can gorge yourself to an early grave,

1285
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,640
or you can consult shamans at health food stores

1286
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,160
and figure out ways to cure ills and lengthen your little span.

1287
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,320
You can be a vegetarian, or you can keep an industrial diet.

1288
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,840
Living out of convenience stores and simul-food franchises.

1289
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,780
You can stay in poverty eating expensive food, untainted by chemicals,

1290
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,780
or you can support the conspiracy in its lowest, most stinking form

1291
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,680
by maintaining your sugar and fat addictions.

1292
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,660
Oh, I used to smoke cigarettes when I wrote this.

1293
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,160
Go ahead, suck down any and all forms of caffeine,

1294
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,540
since if it's not that, something else will give you cancer of the colon and hypertension.

1295
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,500
See what I mean?

1296
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,200
Like your job, maybe?

1297
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,960
You can admit most of that canned and frozen food isn't really food,

1298
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,540
and instead try to eat things that were recently alive

1299
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,240
and not cooked into broken, useless cell mush.

1300
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,320
You can admit junk food does taste good,

1301
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,500
and you can get into the snobdom,

1302
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,560
or you can get into the snobdom of ever-changing health fadism

1303
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,100
just because the cool, rich people do it,

1304
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,680
or you can kill me!

1305
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,280
Just remember that everything touched by the Khan

1306
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,140
has poison and carcinogens in it.

1307
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,780
Scarf them if you wish,

1308
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,700
but put some money away for the painkillers you'll need later on.

1309
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,580
And then it says,

1310
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,380
a typical subgenius daily diet.

1311
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,760
And this, I've actually managed to live on this.

1312
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,340
This is just a typical one.

1313
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:11,780
Breakfast.

1314
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:20,560
Fresh fruit, vitamins, organic goat's milk, brown rice, spirulina, live goldfish,

1315
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,220
frop.

1316
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,700
Frop is what we pretend Bob smokes in his pot.

1317
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,980
Beef, lunch.

1318
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:36,060
Beef jerky, microwave burger, honey bun, coke, thunderbird wine,

1319
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,820
speed, coffee with sugar, frop.

1320
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,360
Dinner.

1321
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:50,620
Uncooked black-eyed peas, fish, milk, raw hay,

1322
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,260
and a little bit of beer.

1323
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,200
And apple for dessert.

1324
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,100
Frop.

1325
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,400
2 a.m.

1326
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,620
25 cigarettes, 3 nails, frop.

1327
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,540
Hey! Look at me!

1328
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,380
Somewhat healthier would be to hardly eat at all,

1329
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,200
but we cannot expect that of people until TV commercials are banned,

1330
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,660
which would only happen in a truly upside-down world.

1331
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,040
Another thing, although most American food is dangerous to human life,

1332
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,380
is that it is not the only thing that causes radiation.

1333
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,480
Even God-awful radiations pour from every appliance and power line.

1334
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,220
Remember, subgeniuses are mutants anyway.

1335
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,660
If you can't escape from radiation, learn to love it.

1336
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,300
After all, it's merely another form of energy.

1337
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,860
Why can't our bodies learn to use it?

1338
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,400
Like a plant uses sunlight.

1339
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:43,020
If you absorb enough radiation, you can make amazing changes come about.

1340
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,980
And our friend, Brother Cleve, clarified that doctrine

1341
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,160
as strength through disfigurement.

1342
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,900
Strength through disfigurement.

1343
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,600
If you don't just go out on New Year's Eve

1344
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,340
and act like that fool that amateur does,

1345
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,980
you disfigure yourself every night.

1346
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,060
You drink that Thunderbird wine.

1347
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,040
You do that plate of pain.

1348
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,220
You use the mirror of pain.

1349
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,760
You do anything you want and build up those immunities.

1350
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,520
That was Brother Cleve's approach.

1351
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,220
And it worked for me for a while.

1352
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,080
That was from this year's Winter Star Symposium.

1353
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,360
See Rosencomet.com for that.

1354
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:35,400
See Noralpref.com for collages like the ones that aren't by Lemur.

1355
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,060
Praise Radio Synesthesia at WCSB Cleveland for the call-ins

1356
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,900
and also Puzzling Evidence at KPFA Berkeley

1357
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,680
and Hal and Philo and Hardboard Robot

1358
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,960
and John Hellstrom.

1359
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,140
Show?

1360
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,680
Season in Hell from Pirate Cat Radio

1361
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,700
which also features the Ask Dr. Hal show.

1362
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,780
This is the hour of slack.

1363
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,900
And if you want more slack in other forums

1364
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,740
like books or tours like Seattle in April 19th,

1365
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:10,520
see subgenius.com and click on everything.

1366
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,100
I'm going to sign off now because I'm feeling a bit funny.

1367
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,740
Look, hey, you had breakfast?

1368
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,060
I can't remember.

1369
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,580
I can't remember.

1370
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,420
What's going on around here?

1371
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,640
What do you mean?

1372
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,520
Huh?

1373
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,140
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1374
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,260
Don't do that, please.

1375
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:32,880
Why not?

1376
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:33,940
Because it hurts me.

1377
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,520
You shouldn't play with the big boys, darling.

1378
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,480
Right, Gina?

1379
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,040
Word from the wise.

1380
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,520
You're next.

1381
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,320
You should get a little rest, sweetie.

1382
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,780
Yes, try to rest.

1383
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:42,540
Try.

1384
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,200
I just feel so cold.

1385
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,680
I feel so cold.

1386
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:50,460
Godspeed.

1387
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,900
Godspeed.

1388
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,860
Godspeed.

1389
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,700
Godspeed.

1390
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,440
Godspeed.
