1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
I'm trying to make believe I'm you, oh, trying to fix

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,560
Just a stranger on the outside looking in

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,780
People say that life is fun

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,240
But I don't know why

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,680
As far as I can tell

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,000
Life sucks, life sucks, life sucks

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,460
Then we die

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,920
Within the last 12 hours, we have received a number of unconfirmed reports from throughout the nation

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,360
that may or may not be connected with this strange phenomenon.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,280
Bob?

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,240
I'm freaking out of the ranch

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,240
Pocket shit on the way

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,200
Ray Bob

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,840
Ray Bob

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,340
Ray Bob

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,420
Ray Bob

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,620
Ray Bob

18
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,780
Ray Bob

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,040
Ray Bob

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,280
Ray Bob

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,340
Ray Bob

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,740
Ray Bob

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:20,740


24
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:20,800
Ray Bob

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:20,860
Ray Bob

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:20,860


27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:20,920
Ray Bob

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,600
Ray Bob

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,660
Ray Bob

30
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,020
Ray Bob

31
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,740
Ray Bob

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,560
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,860
We will control the vertical.

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,680
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,080
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of swag.

36
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,540
Brace for it.

37
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,820
Help me somebody.

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,860
The church of the subgenius.

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,940
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed.

40
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,660
Raglan.

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,260
Quality audio visual techniques.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,400
Exacerbated and complicated.

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,420
The church of the subgenius.

46
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,820
Oh, Dr. Sprit.

47
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:08,260
She said, cutting her own legs off in what was to be the foment of a startlingly trend among the so-called punk detail-a-hensia.

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,920
It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,420
Enjoy life like Bob.

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,580
Get the head, you satan.

51
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,100
Do not be afraid.

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,840
I am not.

53
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,780
I'm not here to harm you.

54
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,100
I know you want to destroy me.

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,340
But listen.

56
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,800
Please listen.

57
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,320
I only want to help you.

58
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,060
I've chosen you.

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,560
Well, I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my work now.

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,600
They don't love you, Bob.

61
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,960
They don't love you like I do.

62
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,240
They don't love you like I do.

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,840
Dear friends, you may call 823-74-7222.

64
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,600
9-0.

65
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,360
For a complete explanation of the Church of the Subgenius in under two minutes.

66
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,960
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,020
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture that expires all around you and pools of its own wastes.

68
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,520
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

69
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,840
It's not just the child zombies that murder their mediocrity parents and then cruise the streets with bullets.

70
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,160
It's not just the bloody feet.

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:31,140
It's not just those starry old vics on the park benches with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

72
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,740
It's not just the anesthesiologist for Nini.

73
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,000
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

74
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,240
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

75
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,000
It's not just the broken headlights,

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,160
snapped antenna and human excrement on your car hood.

77
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
It's not just that the old ways were best.

78
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,080
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,260
It's not just the Pinoy snipers locking and loading on every high rise rooftop.

80
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,200
It's not just the widescreen Technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.

81
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,980
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with a gun.

82
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:19,980


83
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:19,980


84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's not just the fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

85
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,000
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

86
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,940
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland nun entity son of a b**** who thinks workers are property.

87
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,480
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

88
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,740
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is an open ditch latrine in midsummer.

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,460
It's not just some s***hole with a pipe and a s*** eating I know more than you do dog brin all over his homogenized face.

90
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,400
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented devolving world that you certainly never made.

91
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,760
It's not just the doorway to doom.

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,340
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

93
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,480
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

94
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,600
No dear friends.

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,380
There is more to it all than that.

96
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,100
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,600
I put it to you.

98
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,100
He's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

99
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,600
He's the grandest thing yet and don't you forget it.

100
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,700
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus.

101
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,440
You'll need to rise precious early you sinner there if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

102
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,520
Not off.

103
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,280
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you my friend.

104
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,160
In his back pocket.

105
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,700
Just you try it.

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,780
Thanks to

107
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,340
G Gordon Gordon for that one and this is Reverend Cleve Duncan.

108
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,260
Well it once was a man.

109
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,700
It once was a man.

110
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,740
The world's greatest salesman.

111
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,160
A salesman.

112
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,980
And he had devised a plan.

113
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,300
To keep the shackles from my feet.

114
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,580
I am on as he's gone.

115
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,060
A martyr for the cause.

116
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,800
For this my Lord.

117
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,320
And it's coming again.

118
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,620
Who knew that the first shot.

119
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,960
Was gonna be the last shot.

120
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,880
But he's got a hard driving pipe.

121
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,020
The gas smoke all through the night.

122
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,720
And although he may be hurtin'.

123
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,800
The universe.

124
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,700
Will keep on squirtin' Bob this bar low.

125
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,780
And I'm not gonna let.

126
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


127
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


128
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


129
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


130
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


131
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


132
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


133
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


134
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


135
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


136
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


137
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


138
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


139
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


140
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


141
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


142
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


143
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


144
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:43,780


145
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,100
And it's coming again.

146
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,940
And it's coming again.

147
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,380
And it's coming again.

148
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,400
And it's coming again.

149
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,520
Oh yes dear friends.

150
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,840
We're gonna build that spirit back up.

151
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,120
And we're gonna build the spurt back up too.

152
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,880
Now you know spurt and spirit sound the same for a reason.

153
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,140
They're both from the same root word dear friends.

154
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,600
And what a root it is.

155
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,660
What a root it is.

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,340
I want you to get out there and plant those roots children.

157
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,240
Oh yeah.

158
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,700
Bob is my load.

159
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,880
And he's coming again.

160
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,360
Oh.

161
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,760
Bob is my load.

162
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:13,760


163
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:13,760


164
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,320
He can save us from the men in black.

165
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,500
With just a shot from his mighty sack.

166
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,000
If only he could make it back.

167
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,780
From the land of the dead.

168
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,900
But until that happy day.

169
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
We can only drink and say.

170
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Bob is my load.

171
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,000
And it's coming again.

172
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,860
I know he can make it.

173
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,700
Without him we can't take it.

174
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,380
We'll lose the pieces of our minds to the big boys and the wimps.

175
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,900
Until the day that he comes back.

176
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,760
It'll be a world without sack Bob is my load.

177
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,760
And it's coming again.

178
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,820
Oh.

179
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,160
Bob is my load.

180
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,160


181
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,160


182
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,160


183
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,420
And it's coming again.

184
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,420


185
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:13,740
Bob is my load.

186
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,580
Bob is my load.

187
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,180
Bob is my load.

188
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,180


189
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,260
Bob is my load.

190
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,140
Bob is my load.

191
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,140


192
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,140


193
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,260
Bob is my load.

194
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,660
Yes.

195
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:22,780
Yes.

196
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,340
Yes.

197
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,760
Yes.

198
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,120
Yes.

199
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,480
Dear friends, I've got a short sermon to do here.

200
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,740
And this is mostly, this is going to be mostly for those of you who have been regular listeners

201
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:42,520
of the show and the rest of you probably ought to just go away, go to the bathroom for about

202
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,240
five, ten minutes, then come back for more horrible tape.

203
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,620
Well, I got a letter here, friends.

204
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,520
A letter from Sister Mandy.

205
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,160
And I'm going to read this letter here.

206
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,900
It's pertinent.

207
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,260
She says, I hope the show pulls in what was promised.

208
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,540
It would be a cry in shame if you had to die again.

209
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:09,140
But then again, what was this, this, this excretive deleted coming out of my radio last

210
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,900
hour of slack?

211
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,500
Actually, she's talking about two hours of slack.

212
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,460
Two weeks ago.

213
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,740
I can't believe you would rag on native Texans because they're not as rowdy as some chowderhead

214
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,420
Yankees.

215
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,940
Now, dear friends, let me intercede here and say that it's not y'all's lack of rowdiness

216
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,940
at all, but the lack of airplane tickets that you would provide to get other subgenius preachers

217
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,800
down here for a show.

218
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,260
But Sister Mandy continues, now, I don't know if you are a real Texan or just a transplant.

219
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,480
I know I don't sound like one.

221
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,440
I don't sound like I was raised in North Richland Hills and Fort Worth.

222
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,460
But maybe you like cold winter, she says, in the way they say pepejfam and clam chowder.

223
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,380
Maybe now we women of Texas aren't good enough for old Reverend Ivan Stang anymore.

224
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,140
Is that it, huh?

225
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,980
Well, no comment there, but Texans are Bob's chosen.

226
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,780
It's always been that way, but that's why it's so disappointing that they don't act

227
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,220
like it.

228
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,980
I certainly do.

229
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,060
Mandy continues.

230
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,780
I don't know.

231
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,860
I can't believe that the subgeniuses of Dallas don't have the, let's say, cojones to manage

232
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,680
to put together a butt-kicking, glass-grinding, splendiferous-type devival.

233
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,480
And friends, it's not the cojones that's needed, but the energy and the know-how, the art scam

234
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,100
expertise.

235
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,920
She goes, I'd be willing to give myself in every way possible to help, although I'm a

236
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
prisoner of the conspiracy's so-called educational system.

237
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,580
Irving, oh, I think school.

238
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,020
Yeah.

239
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,860
I want to help when I can.

240
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,700
You know, as well as I, that Dallas is capable of it.

241
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,380
So cram this Boston BS and save your evil fluids for Dallas.

242
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,420
But friends, is Dallas capable?

243
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,840
For instance, the most high-buck disco club in Dallas, Mistral, couldn't handle the technical

244
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,520
demands of one extra VHS tape deck, which you operate in your own home.

245
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,580
She goes, yeah, I realize that your rant was meant to inflame, but all it did was, well,

246
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,480
I can't say this, but anger.

247
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,720
I can't say this, but anger.

248
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:11,720


249
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,160
And friends, I know that's true.

250
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,000
And it's because I delivered it poorly.

251
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,380
She says, I know you can do better than that.

252
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,920
And that's true, when I've had enough sleep.

253
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,520
Do something.

254
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,940
I can't read the something to them that they can't take a joke.

255
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,800
Do more than anger them.

256
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
Challenge us.

257
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,360
And friends, some did take it as a challenge, which is how it was meant to be.

258
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,920
She says, Dallas loves stupid.

259
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,180
Look at some of our swinging singles meat lockers.

260
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,380
Have a national devival or something.

261
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,780
Aim for Dallas's cojones and threaten to have them kicked by San Francisco or something.

262
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,360
Make yourself the most hated man in Dallas.

263
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,300
For without hate, there is no love.

264
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,380
And without love, there is no Bob.

265
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,980
Bob equals hate equals love.

266
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,840
Did you say that or was it me?

267
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,040
It was me, Mandy.

268
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,800
I don't remember, but do it, Stang.

269
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,560
I know you can.

270
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,760
Well, you know, when I've had enough sleep and had a little bit of slack, usually, what

271
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,240
did that mean?

272
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,920
The music stopped all of a sudden.

273
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,120
But it's true.

274
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,940
I couldn't agree with you more about that after Boston hour of slack.

275
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,360
Because after Boston hour of slack, I can't remember.

276
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,400
I mean, it's true, but I can't remember.

277
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,400


278
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,400


279
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,400


280
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,400


281
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,400


282
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,400


283
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,400


284
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,400


285
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,800
I remember the night after I'd finally gotten to bed and slept for 13 hours.

286
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,660
I listened to that tape of the show and went, oh, my God, I sound almost drunk.

287
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,340
But keep in mind that stupidity is certainly no sin in this church.

288
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,500
And I was just plain burned out, tired, tired, friends.

289
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,040
And on top of that, I was being facetious.

290
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,800
But I just wasn't being facetious well, so it came off the wrong way.

291
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,520
Now, when you go for four hours of sleep a night, it happens.

292
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,240
You don't get the slack.

293
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,360
But then when I got to Boston, my buddies, Doctors for Bob and I, did get slack.

294
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,900
Although it was partly slack through overwork, which is an unusual form of slack.

295
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:59,040
But many of us emergentiles have to get slack that way, as opposed to you rewardian types of geniuses, who I envy, by the way.

296
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:11,100
But number one, you've got to remember that by definition, a subgenius preacher has not only the right, but the obligation, dear friends, to make severe and even tragic mistakes.

297
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:21,140
Now, look at the rival cults, some of your local Christian denominations, let's say, that preach total goodness and perfection.

298
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,000
They live, friends, in a false, dangerous fantasy world.

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,520
And when they show their humanity, as Jim and Tammy Baker did, oh, they're castigated by their people.

300
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,420
They're fired off their jobs.

301
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,460
And they sure look stupid.

302
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,400
They make Christianity look even stupider to the average American, which is okay with me.

303
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:52,360
But in their smug, self-deluding pride, friends, they set goals that are not only impossible, but actually ridiculously unnecessary.

304
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,840
And when they can't attain those goals, then they just get more fanatical.

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,640
And can't admit that they couldn't cut what they set up for themselves.

306
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,080
And their people are so strung out between constant states of false happiness or guilt.

307
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,280
I don't know.

308
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,700
We now know that Jim and Tammy, for all those years, were actually only acting happy.

309
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,060
But living that lie just compounded their misery.

310
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,840
And millions of people do this to themselves, because they think God is as ignorant, intolerant, and insecure

311
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,120
as they are.

312
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,380
But then that's their idea of wisdom and goodness, I guess.

313
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,780
Hiding their real feelings.

314
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,560
Living a lie.

315
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,480
Deliberately short-circuiting their instincts.

316
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,500
Pretending.

317
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,300
That's what they do.

318
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,440
They're pretending, friends.

319
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,600
Now, you can accuse the subgeniuses of pretending.

320
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,680
But, you know, in a way, they pretend much, much worse than we do.

321
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,400
So when I come on the air and sound like a vindictive jerk, remember that at least I'm being honest.

322
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,840
If I'm beat,

323
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,160
If I'm beat,

324
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,380
If I'm worn out,

325
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,800
I don't take speed like Tammy Baker to pretend that I've got superhuman energy.

326
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,620
I act like I feel.

327
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:09,700
I prove beyond a doubt that I can be just as overextended, overwrought, insensitive, and incoherent as any of you.

328
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,080
And yet, even with all these personality flaws, weaknesses, and staccato speech patterns,

329
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,240
yet I know that Bob gives me an excuse.

330
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,760
He doesn't need to forgive me because I didn't do anything evil.

331
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,220
I screwed up.

332
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,020
And got...

333
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,560
Bob loves me for that.

334
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,440
It's the power to fail, friends.

335
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,020
It's the power that the subgenius popes have and these rival popes can't ever have.

336
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:35,900
And...

337
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,560
The irony, friends.

338
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,160
The irony.

339
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,680
It's like with the pledge drives.

340
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,140
The Hour of Slack listeners are 50% paid up right now.

341
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,140
Probably more by now.

342
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,740
But yet, now those gospel folks, they pledged and pledged.

343
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,900
They pledged and pledged because they were so full of faith.

344
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,180
And only 10%!

345
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,120
At best!

346
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,160
In some cases, 6% bothered to fulfill the commitment.

347
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,280
Because in Christianity, pretending and promising is good enough.

348
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,300
And that's what faith means, friends.

349
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,620
It means you've decided to be satisfied no matter what.

350
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,340
Because you're going to pretend everything's okay.

351
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,180
Oh, it's God's will.

352
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,340
So therefore, you don't have to do anything about it.

353
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,440
Leave it to God, dear friends.

354
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Grace through faith, not works.

355
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,820
Jesus said,

356
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,380
Be like children.

357
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,540
And you know, Tammy can't go to bed with her husband without taking off...

358
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,560
Without keeping her fake eyelashes, her bat-wing-sized fake eyelashes on.

359
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,660
I read that in the paper today.

360
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
That's how you keep your husband.

361
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,680
Wear makeup to bed.

362
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,220
Pretending, friends.

363
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,940
Yeah, they're like children, all right.

364
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,620
But they're like seventh grade children.

365
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,560
Cruel, gossiping liars and bullies that roam in cliques and packs

366
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,540
looking for weak, unsuspecting minority victims.

367
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,340
Oh, they have faith, all right.

368
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,800
Faith in God.

369
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,760
Faith that any nasty thing they do didn't count if God forgave it in their head.

370
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,440
And if you're having the kind of fun they can't experience, then you must...

371
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,260
That must be sin.

372
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,620
Because in their eyes, friends, slack is the ultimate sin.

373
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,600
The devil hates slack, too.

374
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,920
And when you look at the basic beliefs and behavior of a lot of these fundamentalist Christians,

375
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,600
they have a lot in common with the devil, friends.

376
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,060
A whole lot more in common with the devil than Jesus.

377
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,360
Now, subgenius is rationalized, too.

378
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,780
But our rationalization is that,

379
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,860
and it's so absurd that it allows us, the slack,

380
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,060
to remember that it's just a rationalization and there's still work to do.

381
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,300
Praise Bob.

382
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,520
Oh, God.

383
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,940
Here's this Tammy Baker interview.

384
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,260
Yes, she rarely goes to bed without her makeup, swears by her false eyelashes,

385
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,680
and wears different wigs for her husband, Jim.

386
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,860
And that still wasn't good enough, was it?

387
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,220
No, Jessica Hahn, she didn't have to change wigs every night.

388
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,640
Jim very seldom seen me.

389
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,120
I'm a woman without makeup and hardly ever in my life without my eyelashes.

390
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,840
I think every woman ought to wear eyelashes.

391
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,720
Yeah, I think natural-born eyelashes are kind of good, too.

392
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,720
They keep the water out of your eyes.

393
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,400
The sweat, if you're inhuman enough to sweat, unlike Miss Tammy.

394
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,840
Um, oh, God.

395
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,040
Well, I've got more of that rant to go on, but in the meantime, until then.

396
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,880
Oh!

397
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,140


398
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,340
Oh!

399
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,560
Oh!

400
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,080


401
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:22,900


402
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:22,900


403
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:32,420
And let me tell you, friends, it's not just the swelling coffers of the elder bankers.

404
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,060
It's not just the truncated attention spans of the conspiracy glors,

405
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,800
scrambling to get that ever-elusive status symbol.

406
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,220
It's not just the vapid shells of the chicken-like models posing on cue.

407
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,780
It's not just the puppet rock idols playing into the hands of the Hellspawned image consultants.

408
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,780
It's not just the camera.

409
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
It's not just the cannibal zombies gorging themselves on self-interest.

410
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,560
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual sludge.

411
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,860
It's not just the mellow morons stuck in a time zone from the good old days, mon.

412
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,900
It's not just the aerobic airheads working themselves into a cardiac arrest.

413
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,620
It's not just the talentless pinks hooked into a groove devoid of style-less.

414
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,940
It's not just the fuzzy dice brains rampaging like the Visigoths.

415
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,780
It's not just the misguided gummy-speaks.

416
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:24,780


417
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,240
It's not just the face-to-face creatures.

418
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,960
It's not just the oppression of the raging slabs of the lame leftists.

419
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
It's not just the frothy mouths of the reactionaries.

420
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:38,940
It's not just the blank food tubes slamming their craniums against the walls of their own creation.

421
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,680
It's not just the empty youth culture borrowing from the ABC computerized format of possible personas.

422
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,700
It's that and a whole lot more.

423
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,500
Thank you, Sister Chris.

424
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,320
We love you.

425
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,460
We love you, too.

426
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,580
And thank you, Cecilia.

427
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,360
Let's join us now, shall we?

428
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,220
Yes, join us at the ankles and hips.

429
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,840
Thank you.

430
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,940
Now we're ready to hop off to our special sky ride.

431
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,680
The Japanese.

432
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,560
Don't you wish you were with us?

433
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,340
Well, send in your money and maybe someday you can.

434
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,280
No, really, we're a fun crowd.

435
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,400
You'd like us to move in next door to you.

436
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,160
To you?

437
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,560
We'd be indistinguishable from the others you might see in your town.

438
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:34,040
Oh, maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eye, a smile or a leer on our lips.

439
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,300
But otherwise, we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchbale.

440
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,940
A good, solid, honest, cream-colored working man.

441
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,380
Ready to move in next to you and send the property value soaring.

442
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,480
How about it, America?

443
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,200
Well, let's try it out, huh?

444
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,520
For a typewritten transcript of this show, you'd have to be out of here.

445
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,360
I feel so stinky.

446
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,400
I feel so stinky.

447
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,920
Disobedient to parents, a subgenius.

448
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,840
Steals, a subgenius.

449
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,320
Lies, a subgenius.

450
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,160
Hater of God, a subgenius.

451
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,900
Whisperer, a subgenius.

452
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,100
Whoremonger, a subgenius.

453
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,520
Envious, a subgenius.

454
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,060
Pride, a subgenius.

455
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,780
A backbiter, a subgenius.

456
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,500
A deceitful person, a subgenius.

457
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,160
A hypocrite, a subgenius.

458
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,980
Unmerciful, a subplenius.

459
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,560
A false accuser, a subbenius.

460
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,600
Come here, you little subgenius.

461
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,840
Well, I guess that about wraps it up.

462
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,660
That's your typical subgenius now.

463
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,560
And, uh...

464
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,640
Brunk, I don't need Dobbs.

465
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,740
There's nothing wrong with me.

466
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I'll make it my way.

467
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,120
Oh, good.

468
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,400
I must have been insane.

469
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,820
What can I say?

470
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm lost without Dobbs.

471
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,960
Without Bob, I'm guilty.

472
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,460
Guilty.

473
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,780
Be not deceived.

474
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,620
Dobbs is not mocked, for whosoever a man soeth.

475
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,540
Him also shall he reap.

476
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,220
And...

477
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,420
...who is my shepherd, I shall not want.

478
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,140
That's right, dear friends.

479
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,280
That's right.

480
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,180
Uh, thank you, Reverend Howe.

481
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,020
This is Jester Jackson of the Rainbow Coalition.

482
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,060
It concerns me that the American people have been lied to.

483
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,780
Lied to about the secret war in Central America.

484
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,400
Lied to about U.S. support for racist South Africa.

485
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,620
Our government should be funding cities and housing the homeless,

486
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,520
not supporting fascism and waging illegal wars.

487
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,720
Join me in a march on Saturday, April 25th,

488
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,880
in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.

489
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,760
Help forge a new direction for justice and peace

490
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
in Central America and Southern Africa.

491
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,600
March in a big way and in big numbers on April 25th.

492
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,220
I hate that old conspiracy as much as it hates me.

493
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,840
But me and Bob will get them just here waitin' to see.

494
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,320
For as long as they have run things, they have turned them into...

495
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,620
Bob?

496
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,560
The time has come to get them back.

497
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,380
Here's how I look at it.

498
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,200
That conspiracy is nasty and they take it for their patsies.

499
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,560
But we know that they are just a bunch of queers.

500
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,640
And when we defeat them, we will kill them and we'll eat them.

501
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,060
And then we'll go and get ourselves some beers.

502
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,560
Now Bob has come to fight them.

503
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,900
That's how we know we'll win.

504
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,480
And we know to serve them is our only sin.

505
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,240
We won't have long to wait now.

506
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,400
The end is coming soon.

507
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,780
We'll march happy toward the future,

508
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,220
cause we did what we must do.

509
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,040
Underwater vacations, Bob will rule all the nations.

510
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,780
We'll be farming vegetation out on Mars.

511
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,360
Cause we killed them and we ate them.

512
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,660
Said, boy, we sure did hate them.

513
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,120
And then we made the rounds of all the bars.

514
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,320
Whew.

515
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,540
Thank you, Doug.

516
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,700
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

517
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,420
Great stuff.

518
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,100
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?

519
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,060
You're going to make fun of religion stuff, right?

520
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,620
We never make fun of religion.

521
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,180
Never make fun.

522
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,440
You must understand we're making money off religion,

523
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,780
but not fun off religion.

524
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,360
No.

525
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,800
No.

526
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,520
No fun.

527
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,220
No fun.

528
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,740
We hope to erase the slack area in this part of the country.

529
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,500
And hopefully we'll...

530
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,980
Yes, sir.

531
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,600
I'll help you.

532
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:23,660
Thank you.

533
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,080
Really, now.

534
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,100
Are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks?

535
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,660
Or do you...

536
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,700
Mr. Wilsey, isn't it a fact, really,

537
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,220
that you've invented this whole thing,

538
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,800
that you've thought up all these little gimmicks,

539
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,240
and you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people

540
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,480
by getting money out of them?

541
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,040
People who believe in you and your silly preachings?

542
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,560
No, it isn't, Joe.

543
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,240
I don't have...

544
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,060
The Illuminati will be unmasked.

545
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,420
And the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with that.

546
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,200
Bob is going to see,

547
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,300
see that the whole conspiracy, the Illuminati, the trilaterals, you name it, the guys that

548
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,880
drive up and down the streets selling ice cream, all of that will be exposed.

549
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,700
That's what America needs.

550
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,380
They have their brains washed.

551
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,740
Clean out all that filth and all that garbage and all that fear and all that sickness and

552
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,340
perversion and all that junk that comes from the pit of hell.

553
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,980
...radio announcer and many friends of Rail Land.

554
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,860
It's the old-fashioned healing broadcast coming direct from the auditorium here in Dallas.

555
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,840
Now, this is a special night tonight.

556
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,960
This is oil night.

557
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,260
Would you love to have a heart like God?

558
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,860
Come out and be anointed with this miracle oil that God has let me use for quite a few

559
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,900
years now, and we're giving it out.

560
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,480
Come and join the hundreds of people.

561
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:39,940
Bring that bottle and get some of this miracle oil that's absolutely raised the dead, has

562
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,760
performed some of the greatest miracles.

563
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,460
You name it.

564
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,960
It's performed every known miracle that it's happening.

565
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,240
But look, it's...

566
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,960
No, Hal, look out!

567
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,120
You clumsy fool!

568
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,460
What have you done?

569
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,980
The show, it's ruined!

570
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,820
Ruined!

571
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,100
Goodbye for all of us here.

572
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,020
This is Puzzle Dan and it's Lovey S. Rex, Reverend Hal and Reverend Irv.

573
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,640
We tried.

574
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,180
It's too late, and we tried.

575
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,060
Goodbye, folks.

576
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,400
I don't know how it works.

577
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,340
The whole thing's ridiculous.

578
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:19,020
The U.S. Customs Service is waging war on drug smugglers, and you can help.

579
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,020
If you see any unusual activity involving private boats or planes that might be connected

580
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:30,680
to drug smuggling, call the U.S. Customs Service 24 hours a day, toll free, at 1-800-BE-ALERT.

581
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,580
You can remain anonymous, and you could receive a cash reward if your information leads to

582
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,800
the arrest and prosecution of drug smugglers.

583
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,680
Help stop drug smuggling.

584
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,060
Call 1-800-BE-ALERT.

585
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,560
I can't believe they gave me that cart to play on this show, honest to God.

586
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,840
Well, if you want to get...

587
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,280
If you want to be damned by Bob...

588
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:15,120
Now, let's talk about another man which has conspired to try to control you.

589
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,440
Do you think that freedom for this great society...

590
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,360
For this great planet...

591
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,700
Is voting?

592
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:22,980
Say no.

593
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,880
Didn't they get to vote in Haiti?

594
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,780
Say yes.

595
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,080
Didn't they get to vote in the Philippines?

596
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,780
Don't they get to vote in Poland?

597
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,460
Say yes.

598
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,460
Joe, did they get to vote?

599
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,500
You think they'd go over there and pull out their lever when there's only one can of

600
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,040
beans in it?

601
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:39,700
Say no.

602
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,700
But this joke is what the rest of the world perceives as freedom is.

603
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,980
Consumer goods.

604
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,900
More specifically...

605
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,820
American consumer goods.

606
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:49,820


607
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,940
And children, we're drowning in consumer goods.

608
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,480
We're drowning in them.

609
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,380
And it doesn't get to me.

610
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:02,100
But children, when you hear the 501 Blues and your heart sings, when you see Spuds McKenzie,

611
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,000
then high concept is getting inside of you, children.

612
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,540
It's getting inside of you.

613
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,000
Now, I know you're all artists.

614
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,060
You're all hip, you're all aware.

615
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,100
You're a bunch of deconstructing thieves.

616
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,940
I know that, children.

617
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,320
I know you can sit there and watch those ads and you can say, ooh, look at that jump cut.

618
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:16,700
Whoo!

619
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,000
Look at that computer animation.

620
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,620
Whoo!

621
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,540
Look at that keyboard.

622
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:19,820
Look at that keyboard.

623
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:19,820


624
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:19,820


625
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:19,820


626
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,940
And you think by deconstructing it, you kept the message from getting into you.

627
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,340
But I'm going to tell you something, children.

628
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,700
I'm right now, I'm here to tell you that we are not that sort.

629
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,600
That's right, children.

630
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,020
We're not that goddamn sort.

631
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,620
We are not able to resist those messages.

632
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,500
They get inside of us.

633
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,900
They work it up.

634
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,440
And before you know it, you're another mind-death-dude.

635
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,740
I'll the conspiracy.

636
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,780
I'm going to give you another example, children.

637
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,580
They say you're the NFL.

638
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:56,240
Between steroids and weightlifting, football players have gotten so big and so fast that

639
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,920
the human body can no longer sustain the impact they generate.

640
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,300
And the same thing is true by analogy, by the extent of my metaphor.

641
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,400
In the world of advertising, the images they generate are so slick, we can no longer resist.

642
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,200
We cannot retain our will.

643
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,060
We cannot make a specific judgment.

644
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,380
We cannot simply accidentally pass a judgment.

645
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,640
That's right, children.

646
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,160
We're not that goddamn sort.

647
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,560
We are not able to resist thoseенияficent.

648
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,560


649
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,560


650
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,560


651
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,560


652
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,560


653
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:26,120
They get it side of up, they work it up, and before you know it, you're another mind-death

654
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,880
dude out of a conspiracy.

655
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,940
I'm going to give you another example, children.

656
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,880
They say in the NFL, between steroids and weightlifting, football players have gotten

657
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,140
so big and so fast that the human body can no longer sustain the impact they generate.

658
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,500
And the same thing is true by analysis, by extension by metaphor.

659
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,600
In the world of advertising, the images they generate are so slick, we can no longer resist.

660
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,440
We cannot retain our will.

661
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,280
We cannot make a specific judgment.

662
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,280
We cannot simply ask the other to do it.

663
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,620
Oh, boy, I have to cut in here.

664
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,180
Oh, that was Pope David Meyer two weeks ago in Boston, Massachusetts.

665
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,440
Pretty soon I ought to have a better recording of all the rants from there.

666
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,860
Jayner was there, a whole bunch of good stuff.

667
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,480
Anyway, I had to cut in because the Willis-Mogg story,

668
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:21,200
and all the Dobbs just got a call from someone who said that they had called the cult awareness group.

669
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,500
There's a group here in Dallas called Cult Awareness,

670
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,120
and had called them up just to see what they would say about the Church of the Subgenius.

671
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,280
And the funny thing is that when they first opened, I called them up and said,

672
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,780
yeah, I'm kind of concerned about these insane cults myself,

673
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,400
and I thought I'd send you some of our material so you could, you know,

674
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,480
you can refer people to us.

675
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,680
And they, apparently, they didn't like the material I sent.

676
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,140
I'd never heard from them since then, but they're now telling people,

677
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,340
whatever you do, stay away from those guys.

678
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,920
That subgenius guy, man, that's the worst, I guess.

679
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,100
And especially what, keep your kids away from them?

680
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,240
Especially keep your kids away from the Church of the Subgenius

681
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,560
because of the sexually explicit material.

682
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,880
Now, see, y'all that only listen to the radio show,

683
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,360
you don't know what, you don't know what you're missing.

684
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,780
Listen, whoo!

685
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,000
And who don't order the tapes.

686
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,040
But I can't advertise that stuff, and all you can really do is write for information

687
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:29,060
from P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214,

688
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,640
for more information about Church of the Subgenius.

689
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,300
And for that sexually explicit material, which you don't get for free, by the way.

690
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,060
Not like, I mean, you get this radio show for free and get our information for free,

691
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,960
and it's not very sexually explicit.

692
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:54,800
But like I say, you, those of you who've been putting off writing to P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, 75214,

693
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,460
fine, I don't care.

694
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,420
I honestly, I really don't.

695
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,640
I always end up getting the last laugh, dear friends.

696
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,620
I have total confidence that that will continue to be true.

697
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,540
So, you know, I can't tell you what the deal is with the money, but...

698
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,820
Gotta get some money!

699
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,220
That dirty, perky, sharkaback, black, and rotten, filibuster-burton, perkaluma...

700
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Only we know what we don't know.

701
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,880
And when we do know it, we shall find out later just exactly what it was that we didn't know.

702
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,540
But, in the meantime, we shall experiment further,

703
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,660
and delve into the deeper recesses of the human mind

704
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,500
to find out exactly what causes this device not to function properly,

705
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,920
could it be a malfunction of the foot gland, or the nose gland?

706
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:57,580
Yes, possibly you did not know that the nose and the feet are true glands of the human body.

707
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,880
And only after permanent foot and nose glanscaping

708
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,860
can you know how to make your feet smell and your nose run,

709
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,380
which would mean, possibly, that you were backwards.

710
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,980
Or, built upside down.

711
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,080
But, you'll delve very into that at the end of the broadcast,

712
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,340
when you and I cannot hear each other.

713
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,320
That was Dr. Philo Drummond, dear friends.

714
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,480
And we can get into this too, this psychoneurotic mastosurgery,

715
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,460
the techniques of which has been developed by the many great doctors

716
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,480
who have come over to Dobbs and from many of the other religious countries,

717
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,360
from the cults around the world,

718
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,620
and it's, we've got Europeans and Lithuanians and ice doctors and the big doctors,

719
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:57,740
and the doctors of the trees, and the tree-walking brain socket doctors,

720
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,000
and here, hyperclites, here it is,

721
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,780
Doctors for Bob.

722
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,600
Doctors for Bob and everything real in my life.

723
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,320
Doctors for Bob and everything real in my life.

724
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,680
Oh, real in my life.

725
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,220
Damn pickup truck come out blue, done run over my wife.

726
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,160
He's got the blues, cause they run over his wife.

727
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,300
Some of you are going to get mad at me.

728
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,460
Some of you are going to get mad at me.

729
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,280
Jesus ain't in the church.

730
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,940
Don't turn the radio off, keep it on.

731
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,820
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state is antichrist,

732
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,420
but I'm telling you that preparations are being made,

733
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,860
and that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand,

734
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,880
and that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

735
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,840
There will be a day not in the too far distant future

736
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,000
in which antichrist will be revealed,

737
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,240
and the mark of the beast will be introduced,

738
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:27,480
and people will have a number in their hand and in their forehead.

739
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,360
They'll be given a computerized number, if you please,

740
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,780
that will entitle them to do business in this world,

741
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,980
and without it, you can starve.

742
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,820
We have a lot to do.

743
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,600
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

744
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,140
Boy, you aren't kidding.

745
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,400
And that's the way I've felt for quite a while.

746
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,580
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

747
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,380
Ah, you bet, honey.

748
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,300
That's what we're going to try to do.

749
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,200
I have never flown a city before.

750
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,820
Well, many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

751
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,580
I think they'll pass the $10 bridge when they come back.

752
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,800
The original concept was that throughout history,

753
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,140
all great geniuses had somebody at their side

754
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,840
that was kind of steering them.

755
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,640
You know what I mean?

756
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,940
So you say that person is a subgenius.

757
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,200
That was the subgenius.

758
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,800
He was the guy that was really...

759
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,280
He was making sure the genius was used to his proper potential.

760
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:30,940
Right.

761
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,920
And for the right reasons.

762
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,100
That's why the name is misleading, you know.

763
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,820
Now, I want you to hear a little of the service

764
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,200
where the Holy Spirit was using me with the gift of discernment.

765
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,380
I was ministering in the Spirit.

766
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,660
God was showing me things about people I didn't know,

767
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,240
had never seen before, but the Lord was talking to me.

768
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,160
God was talking and I was walking.

769
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,100
Listen to a little of this right now.

770
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,860
And you have come to the end of your rope.

771
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,200
I don't know which way to turn.

772
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,280
Give me money!

773
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,440
It's starting to affect your nerves.

774
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
Give me money!

775
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,280
I'm having a sleepless night.

776
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,220
It's affecting my mind. I want to kill my love.

777
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,820
Today we're going to put this in the hand of God.

778
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,680
Kill my husband, my kids.

779
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,600
In the Bible in two different places,

780
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,180
a handful of meal brought a miracle.

781
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,660
I want you to hold that envelope open.

782
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,880
That's right. Please save my life.

783
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,660
I'm going to give you a handful.

784
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,420
Save my life!

785
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,780
I'm going to pour it in this envelope.

786
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,400
Ha ha!

787
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:29,940
Now.

788
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,180
The future of your usefulness to us

789
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,280
brought to you in living simulbursts

790
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,180
from the depths of the third,

791
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,900
fifth temple lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,960
1984 version.

793
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,020
Send soon for a list of those deities

794
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,640
certified approved.

795
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,820
PO Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas.

796
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,880
...approved to...

797
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,100
...Mexico's...

00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,860
...Seven Five Two One Four.

799
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,060


800
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,900
...are available now

801
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,400

through our offices in Dallas.

803
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,840
You may now place the money in the envelope.

804
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,480
Slag.

805
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:33,660
Slag.

806
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,580
Slag.

807
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,300
Slag.

808
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:37,580


809
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,060
Slag.

810
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,060


811
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,060


812
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,060


813
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,060


814
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,060


815
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,060


816
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,060


817
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,060


818
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,660
...aku...

819
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,340
In some ways the brain is

820
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,900
less important to a subgenius

821
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,680
than to a pink.

822
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,360
Being less intuitive,

823
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,040
pinks need more brains than we do.

824
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,600
Their value system is based on...

825
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:02,720
... showed by mic click

826
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,460
...the way they need to be giving...

827
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,920
may sound, the subgenius foot doubles as a gland, and a very complex gland at that.

828
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,660
Don't you want to be treated the way you need to be treated?

829
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,560
It treats you the way you need to be treated by intuiting the world around you so subtly

830
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,660
that you rarely notice its machinations.

831
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,360
It was discovered by Dr. Philo Drummond, and he best explained its functioning in this

832
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,260
excerpt from his daily radio show, On the Road, so named because it is usually recorded

833
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,120
in a car.

834
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,280
Why?

835
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,760
Or money.

836
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,120
Self-worth.

837
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,340
Or money.

838
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,180
To love people because they need it.

839
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,720
Or their money.

840
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,060
I believe it's something God puts in us.

841
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,480
Or what else does God put in us?

842
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,460
I wish he'd give us some money, huh?

843
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,440
Yeah.

844
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,160
Yeah.

845
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,940
I want some money.

846
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,280
Oh, we could truly know nothing only.

847
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,820
Reinforcing the powers of the brain and foot gland is a small secondary brain at the base

848
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,100
of the brain.

849
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:07,080
The subgenius spine, the mighty stegosaurus, also possessed this organ, which made it tweet

850
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,780
like a bird.

851
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,640
It helped it direct the reproductive and eliminative systems that are so important to us.

852
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,300
Another gland unknown to normals is the peen gland in the brain, which regulates the eight

853
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,800
separate stages or character generations through which the subgenius personality evolves during

854
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,620
an average day.

855
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,040
Literally eight different personalities each have control at the Jesse Helm of behavior

856
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,080
at varying intervals.

857
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,600
We each contain eight people in our corrugated, rugated subconsciousness.

858
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:42,280
The actual average human has but four, good, bad, bland, and asleep, the last thought by

859
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,440
some scholars to overpower the others for up to 18 hours a day.

860
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,060
These different personalities account for the compartmentalization of the subgenius

861
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:55,660
brain into eight distinct units or efficiencies in the descending order of control.

862
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:01,080
First, the left brain, the peen brain, which controls paranoia, anal compulsion, and the

863
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,080


864
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,080


865
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,160
overwork, trying too hard, or thinking too much.

866
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,320
Then the north brain, the make brain or take brain, it handles jobs and money.

867
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:14,200
The south brain, the fake brain or talk brain, which covers the gray and limbic areas of

868
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,500
speech, writing, and lying.

869
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,680
Then the hind brain, the me brain, the pivotal center brain, the private you rides piggyback

870
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,260
on the lord and is infected by drugs or religion.

871
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,740
Bob comes in on this channel.

872
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,900
Then the forebrain, the sane brain, which covers love, friendship, traditional family values,

873
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,060
and the mind.

874
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,440
Called by some, the tame brain.

875
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,620
The inner brain, or sex brain, is self-explanatory.

876
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,280
Finally, the right brain, or lame brain, or more brain, depending on your orientation,

877
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,180
intuitive, art, music, drug addiction.

878
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:54,940
And the eighth brain, the outer brain, is a pseudo-physical shell, encasing not only

879
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,300
the other brains, but the entire body.

880
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,060
This diffuse brain, larger but far smaller.

881
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,540
The second brain, the most

882
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,980
controlled, is the mental life.

883
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,440
The mental life represents fully half of our brain power.

884
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,380
But because it is so independent from us, we can rarely make use of it.

885
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:21,540
Occasionally, a subgenius comes along whose mental life is incorporated into his thinking processes.

886
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,600
Such less subgeniuses were Da Vinci, Einstein, and Curly Howard.

887
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,040
For most of us, however, the mental life is a separate life.

888
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,540
The midst of us is the patient, luzer.

889
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:31,540


890
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,020
entity, a semi-conscious Ghost Twin.

891
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,300
Which mindlessly follows the physical vessel about.

892
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,760
But remains dormant throughout most of our lives.

893
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,360
BMC

894
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:53,340
The lastSu 맡ed the GLOBE test in this open roomoff the whole night.

895
00:43:53,340 --> 00:44:01,040
Once again, a state of radio errors remind us that reality is an scripture to imagine.

896
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,500
Every one's a Bolivian here

897
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:16,060
And there's almost nothing to fear

898
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,740
Cause we got everything we want right here

899
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:32,740
We got great big heaping buckets of Bolivian here

900
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:38,100
Cause my mom's always brought us here

901
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,860
Yeah, we're singing a praise to God

902
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,640
Cause he's done a mighty fine job

903
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,200
Cause I'm slopped up and silly

904
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,680
Like a rip-headed slob

905
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,800
And all I got to thank is Bob

906
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,100
And Ivan Stagg

907
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,840
And all I got to thank is Bob

908
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,220
And Dr. Doo

909
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,720
And all I got to thank is Bob

910
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,980
And everybody

911
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:22,980


912
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,720
And everybody

913
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,960
You can trust me

914
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,020
I'm Dr. Ivan Stagg

915
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,160
And I'm prepared to take your money

916
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,560
And give you back your slide

917
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,900
So you can believe in me

918
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,200
I'm Ivan Stagg, I never lie

919
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,440
And I'm always right

920
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,140
It extends throughout the universe

921
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,800
And has to do with the

922
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,600
University

923
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,680
It has to do with glass

924
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,860
It has to do with

925
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,100
It has to do with

926
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,580
It has to do with

927
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,820
It has to do with Gilligan's island

928
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,540
It has to do with Gary Eglin

929
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,460
It has to do with the Tim and Luck plane

930
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,860
Oh yes, yes, yes, dear friends

931
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,860
Well, we're coming down

932
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,500
Getting, getting sort of close to the end of the hour there

933
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:25,740
and I'm going to continue talking about the aspects of preachers going crazy on the radio,

934
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,520
specifically here on the Hour of Slack a couple of weeks ago.

935
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,700
Now, you have to understand, friends, that being a jerk,

936
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,840
that's my outlet for artistic, I mean religious expression.

937
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,620
After all, most preachers utilize the techniques of presumptuousness,

938
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,580
orneriness, corniness, and a sort of posed intolerance.

939
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:54,980
And I also use stupidity and especially cantankerousness.

940
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,960
I can't really, you know, I can't relax unless I'm being cantankerous

941
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,640
and inflicting my personal bile and spleen on others.

942
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:09,680
It's hate, dear friends, and you wouldn't interfere with my right to hate to do my own thing, now would you?

943
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,680
This is a free country.

944
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,880
Besides, how can you, since I'm the one that's transmitting,

945
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,600
and you're only receiving?

946
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,800
Only receiving, friends.

947
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,520
Does that insult you, like last time?

948
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,060
Well, good!

949
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:25,640
That shows that I'm succeeding in doing Bob's assignment

950
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,920
of getting you to stop letting the conspiracy,

951
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,320
or even subgenius preachers, push you around.

952
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,620
This obscure church would be the next Inquisition,

953
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,460
where I'm not constantly training you through applied obnoxiousness

954
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,500
to be in a continuous state of not merely defensiveness,

955
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,600
but outright rebellion.

956
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,280
And if you let me get any more abusive, I'll have to kill you,

957
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,580
because you'll deserve it.

958
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,820
It's like, I'm like an anti-role model.

959
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,000
That's what most subgeni-

960
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,840
All subgeniuses should be anti-role models.

961
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,980
Besides, how dare you criticize the judgments meted out by King Stang?

962
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:09,460
You mock my total disregard for the broadcast niceties.

963
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,020
Oh, but have you thought about your soul?

964
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,380
Have you even got a girlfriend yet?

965
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:14,560
Huh?

966
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,560
Oh, my jibes have but barely begun.

967
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,040
I could rant a paragraph to you that would have every one of you listeners

968
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,340
jumping off a high bridge to escape the mocking truth wielded by my tongue.

969
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
Or Jane-ers.

970
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,580
Now, I didn't start out this way, nay.

971
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,980
I was a gentle man at one time.

972
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,700
But I've undergone teasings by the blackest minds of our generation.

973
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,640
If I can take it from the likes of Lies and G. Gordon Gordon,

974
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,000
then you'd best urinate in fear.

975
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,040
I thought of what I could dish out to you on the radio,

976
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,240
to the innocent and guilty alike.

977
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,040
For, as my mentor, Dr. Drummond, told me,

978
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,840
none are so blind as those who have no eyes.

979
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,820
He who dares to mock King Stang and rouse him from his torpid reveries and clairvoyant visions

980
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,880
hath played out but the first move in a galactic game

981
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,540
on which hinges the very fate of this physical universe itself.

982
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,220
Congratulations, dear friend.

983
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,060
You've now entered kindergarten in the School of Terror.

984
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, don't worry, it won't kill you.

985
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:25,140
Indeed, it'll actually help you to keep your intelligence from decreasing at the same pace as your peers.

986
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,440
But, uh, but at what cost, dear listener?

987
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,920
At what cost?

988
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,380
At what cost?

989
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,080
Oh, I'm well aware of all your plans to assassinate me.

990
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,200
Ha! Oh, surprise you, nay.

991
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,680
Yes, I can see far, far more than you think.

992
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,360
More than you could ever imagine in your right eye.

993
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,120
In your wildest LSD dreams.

994
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,620
Fine, go ahead, kill me, you would-be Judases and Luthors.

995
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,520
Make your blindingly imbecilic move,

996
00:49:54,740 --> 00:50:02,400
your mere hume attempt to wrest controls from the claws of this Stang demon you hallucinate.

997
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,780
Death would be but a step up in my ascension to ultimate power.

998
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,140
Next to Bob, of course.

999
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,700
And have you not guessed that certain contingency plans have been laid?

1000
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,140
Thinketh you not of the children of the Stang?

1001
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,280
Oh, I've read my Frank Herbert closely.

1002
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:25,020
The Atreides conspiracy is but a high school prank compared to the all-reaching arms of the Stang octopus.

1003
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:32,580
Oh, your science fiction has ill-prepared you for the next generation of the Stang Ones.

1004
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:41,980
What to your undiscerning ears is but a lively boy of seven and a sweet little girl of six have undergone since birth certain forbidden training regimens,

1005
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:49,140
which will render all your weapons, all your propaganda, and all your mental hexes impotent, utterly impotent.

1006
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,280
Kill Stang One, and the Emperor Xandar is unchained,

1007
00:50:53,320 --> 00:51:01,620
and at that point you can kiss your world, your human society, your innocent subgenius church goodbye forever.

1008
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,440
Or perhaps, if by some accident of God, the Emperor Xandar were eliminated,

1009
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,080
oh, then you would face the Tev One.

1010
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,180
And do you think they're my only offspring?

1011
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,280
Have you fools never watched a Star Wars movie?

1012
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,120
Just as Darth Vader's son Luke was kept from knowing of his own sister's existence,

1013
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:26,060
do you think that, that, um, I, the Darth Vader of Dallas, have shown all my cards?

1014
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,060
Oh, no indeed, dear friends, no indeedy, I say.

1015
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,760
But you'll see.

1016
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,000
Well, stay tuned for, uh, Ron Lindsey.

1017
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,180
You've been listening to King Stang.

1018
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,180
Ultimate stud groupie attractor and mystic psychic power monger.

1019
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,000
The very left brain of Dobbs.

1020
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,180
The chosen bringer, dear friends, of terror and lawsuits.

1021
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,740
Owner of the trademark of God on Earth.

1022
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,360
Slayer of would-be scribe ship usurpers.

1023
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,460
Subjector of all bobbies.

1024
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,320
Decider of degrees of fame of subgenius mortals.

1025
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
Second chosen of the fishers of wallets.

1026
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,020
Biggest, organed, and sexiest voiced entrapper of radio groupies.

1027
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,080
Subduer of hecklers.

1028
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,360
But splitter of moons.

1029
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,800
Exploiter of comedic idiot savants.

1030
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,660
Master of the sardonic over the cute.

1031
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,840
Violator of postal...

1032
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,880
Oh, forget it.

1033
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,520
Anyway, okay, okay, don't rush me.

1034
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,360
Stop, stop, stop.

1035
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,280
Sister Chris asked me to come down here for an experiment.

1036
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:32,020
She asked me to listen to the Church of the Subgenius cassette and, and, I don't know, she said something like she wanted a normal reaction.

1037
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,840
Well, that didn't sound normal to me.

1038
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,760
At least it all sounded like a church.

1039
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,420
I mean, aren't churches supposed to be quiet and not really boring?

1040
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,540
I mean, I could hardly understand what went on there.

1041
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,020
I mean, was it, was it meant to be funny or what?

1042
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,180
I mean, come on, tell me, is it serious?

1043
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,920
Like, you know, do you have to...

1044
00:52:49,920 --> 00:53:00,120
Are they telling you to stop listening to Top 40, give up things like watching Dynasty or eating Haagen-Dazs or maybe shopping at home from an Esprit catalog?

1045
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,560
What? Huh?

1046
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,060
What are you trying to say?

1047
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,060
What is this note?

1048
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,160
Listen, stupid, stop babbling or I'll ship you to Dallas.

1049
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,680
You're going to Dallas with a sign saying, you, you asked grade A conspiracy dupe across your forehead.

1050
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,640
Hey, I don't know what that means, but, but I don't like your attitude, okay?

1051
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:24,000
I mean, like, just, you, you asked me to come here and I mean, why did you even ask me, what?

1052
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,760
Just, just sit over there, okay?

1053
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,380
You try an experiment down here and it just doesn't work.

1054
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,100
Yeah.

1055
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:45,420
You try to bring an opposing viewpoint, somewhat of a rebuttal and you never can tell.

1056
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,360
This is Sister Chris here.

1057
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,180
It's 1233.

1058
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,800
It's not 1233.

1059
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,720
It's two minutes till midnight, four minutes till something like that.

1060
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:03,540
And this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1061
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,000
And you cannot leave either.

1062
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,400
Now we're here.

1063
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:20,500
The Dursley Film presents Ben Franklin, Hero for Hopping.

1064
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,220
I wanted the woods and the Indians to sleep with me,

1065
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,540
but I was afraid of the cold and made them sleep outside.

1066
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,480
So I never felt the touch of a warm naked Indian,

1067
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,280
or,

1068
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,160
or in a cold naked forest.

1069
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:45,060
Ben Franklin, the only President of the United States,

1070
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,200
who was never President of the United States.

1071
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,220
Was he an early drug user?

1072
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:53,700
Let's see.

1073
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:58,840
He wrote of it in Poor Dick's Conspiracy in 1761,

1074
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:03,100
while still an apprentice book baker in colonial Philadelphia.

1075
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:09,140
So I betook me to the Hashfire Inn for a secret caucus of the hotheads,

1076
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,760
rebellious libertines all lusting for life and liberty.

1077
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:17,740
The real George Washington brought the hemp and all the even greaters.

1078
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,600
We quickly proceeded to get there on urges,

1079
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,240
and young Tom Everson goodly stretched by the hemp,

1080
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,040
which smoked us all like Boston's scrub.

1081
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,660
What a fetid fervor of freedom.

1082
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,200
I say, let's have a revolution.

1083
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,200
But finally Sam, the tax collector,

1084
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,420
to which Big Ben replied,

1085
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,520
Fine Sam, then we can invite over a bunch of immigrants and make cars.

1086
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,620
Yes, 1761,

1087
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,560
Hemp kindled the fires of American history.

1088
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,620
Hup, hup,

1089
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:54,280
Nerdy clockwork films.

1090
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,540
Old target look, old target history.

1091
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,680
Old target look.

1092
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,200
Old target history.

1093
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:11,060
Oh, yes dear friends, you have been listening to the Hour of Slack radio ministry

1094
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:14,140
produced by the Church of the Subgenius.

1095
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,780
As I said, this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1096
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,480
Stay tuned for Down Memory Lane with Ron Lindsey.

1097
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:30,340
And this is your host, King, Pope, Killer, Reverend Ivan Stang,

1098
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,140
Arbiter of Hipness,

Down-putter of talk show hosts in My Mighty Glibness,

Son of the King of Bullshatterers,

1101
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:44,120
He who hath been copied by David Byrne and Garrison Keeler,

1102
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,800
Payer of royalty checks to type running buddies,

1103
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,680
Contract signer of all paying subgenius projects,

1104
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,840
President of the corporation of all Dobbs PR,

1105
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,420
48% owner of the Janer tongue,

1106
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,560
First interpreter of the dogma,

1107
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,120
Enrager of pinks and lesser subgenius,

1108
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,960
Living embodiment of hate, Slack under Dobbs,

1109
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,320
Keeper of the original Dobbs image,

1110
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,720
Carrot dangler of long-promised magazines,

1111
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,560
And returner of compliments,

1112
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,780
You faithless.

00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:47,760


1118
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:15,380
Oh yes, dear friends, this is Li Weijing, a Chinese subgenius, and you are listening

1119
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,560
to the Hour of Slack.

1120
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,860
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

1121
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,380
He is a champion, just like in America.

1122
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,760
And people need Slack.

1123
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:37,520
In Chinese, we call Slack, it must be true Slack, not the best Slack of the conspiracy.

1124
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,520
Boy, will you look at that guy's swag.

1125
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,380
Help me somebody.

1126
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,580
Thank you, Li Weijing.

1127
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,160
Yes, my friends, we have the great Ivan Stang here tonight.

1128
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:56,640
Ivan Stang himself, the grand auditor and chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith, who

1129
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,680
has everything.

1130
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,320
Every subgenius's name on his special basement computer, and he's here tonight to make the

1131
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,940
hour and a half of Slack seem like, well, like forever.

1132
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,880
Ah, yes, dear friends, so good to be here.

1133
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,060
Say it, Ivan, say it.

1134
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:13,580
Feeling the power.

1135
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:14,720
Hit it.

1136
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,280
In this hideous, hideous place.

1137
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,860
Bob lives, friends.

1138
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,980
Bob lives.

1139
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,400
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

1140
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,120
He ain't dead.

1141
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,120
Oh, what is this?

1142
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:24,980
I should know.

1143
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,620
I'm the guy that has to read sooner.

1144
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,820
Later, all the mail that comes to that P.O.

1145
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,380
box that you probably thought was just made up.

1146
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,840
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff

1147
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:44,560
and management of this radio station, the other staff, the relations and spouses of

1148
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,480
the staff and management, or the staff of this staff and the staff.

1149
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:53,440
That's really true, Al, but he doesn't know that it's all over the place these days.

1150
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,940
He's dragged out of the Victoria Theater with these eyes.

1151
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,360
These.

1152
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,980
Deadlights looked on Bob and the light was drifting from them forever.

1153
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:11,520
There's saint of sailed corpses dotting the landscape all the way from Little Rock to Berkeley here.

1154
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,100
I don't know what the big deal is.

1155
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:18,300
I mean, just because there's a Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily.

1156
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,680
I mean, can Bob really die?

1157
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:27,740
I'd say yes, Ivan, and I think you better grow up and face the sick truth that this Bob here is a dead man.

1158
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,620
Not necessarily everything that you say he is.

1159
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,660
Putrescent back.
