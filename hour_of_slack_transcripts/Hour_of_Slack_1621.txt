When I got frustrated because I couldn't tie my shoes, you said, don't keep trying, give up.
When I didn't make the baseball team, you said, don't keep trying, give up.
And now, I say to you, keep trying, marijuana.

The Hour of Slack
The Hour of Slack
Well my friend, listen.
The Spirit of God make you all a straight line.
That line, straight line.
Straight line, line.
Straight line, line.
Straight line, line.
Line, line.
Blood, life, spiritual, man, spirit.
Guaranteed.
The Hour of Slack
is a very important statement.
I want you to hear it.
The internet made me so goofy and lethargic
where I couldn't think, I couldn't study,
I couldn't control anything.
I was just like, marriage.
Bad news.
If you were in here this morning
and you're dealing with the internet
and you're hiding it
and you think you're doing a good job of hiding it,
you're not hiding it from the Lord.
And it's corrupting you.
Well no, I've got it under control.
Because Jesus said, this is how you deal with it.
Fornication and pornography.
Yes.
Uncleanness.
And licentiousness.
Licentiousness.
Yes.
Gushing.
And there's sexual pus and junk all coming out of it.
That's his desire.
To be sexually oozing 24 hours a day,
7 days a week.
Licentiousness.
Just unbridled, uncontrolled sexual excesses.
That was something he invented.
Next is worshipping oozing sexual excesses.
Can you worship your brand new shiny sexual pus?
You bet.
Can you worship fornication?
Yes.
And in our society, how easy it is to worship pornography?
So much.
What do you think?
Will psychiatry help?
Yes, it's an emergency.
It's an emergency.
This is a huge thing.
Download some rock bitch videos, folks.
Go to whatever file sharing you're doing before they make it illegal.
You can't.
You can't.


You can't.
You can't.
You can't.






Nobody's touched usenet.
That's where the real file sharing goes.
I've tried doing that.
Yeah, but you didn't know how to do it because you're too old and stodgy.
No, I know how to do it.
Or too young and cool or something.
But there's no descriptions.
You can get good descriptions of things.
You're too middle-aged to...
Yeah, but you could use a dictionary to get good descriptions of things.
I mean, a description can be found.
You can make up your own descriptions.
No, you can just mouse over and windows pop up.
They tell you exactly what you're about to download.
and everything.
It's very handy, I think.
But just think how you've
archaicized our language
with what you just said.
I am seduced by the UI of it all.
See, once again,
your parlance is like
21st century, Daddy-O.
I can't hip to that.
Did you hear what he just said?
What he's saying is that
the artists shouldn't get
any recompense for their work,
but that we should all get
everything for free while we can,
which is certainly what I'm doing.
I have downloaded everything
I could possibly even see
to download,
whether I wanted it,
whether I cared about it,
just because I could,
just to keep my computer busy
and to feel like I was getting
my money's worth for that DSLR.
A Nestle Crunch bar.
I don't care if it's child pornography.
Well, actually, I wouldn't.
I would not knowingly download
child pornography,
because if you have ever
had it on your machine,
he will come and puff and puff
and blow your door down.
How about that new home and security bill?
How about let's take a little trip
over to the door here
where it says,
are botched, marked fry,
or something like that,
are backed, marked, mocked free.
It's funny, the subgeniuses were asking,
how do I permanently erase stuff
from my hard drive?
I mean, I know that just
throwing it in the trash
and hitting delete
doesn't really do it.
And in fact,
you have to overwrite that thing
two or three times
if you want to hide something.
Now, I'm just the opposite.
It's like, I wish
somebody would pay attention
to the cool stuff
on my hard drive.
And that is the problem.
No one is interested.
And that is the sour slope
we've slipped down
from the orchard heights.
The only way you can get
that child porn off your computer
is blow up your,
you know, you take the hard drive out
and have it installed
as one of the heat shield tiles
on the shuttle.
On the shuttle.
Next to the sock drive.
And when it comes back in through,
it finally gets erased.
Yeah.
And they come back through the atmosphere.
You'll be okay then.
But that's only during
the touch-up cycle.
That's what P,
we should have done.
Yeah.
Twice.
That's what he should have done twice.
And what did he do the first time?
Nobody knows that.
The whole space shuttle,
all those tiles
are really hard drives
of people trying to get rid
of their porn.
That is probably true.
Because now Big Brother
can stick his snoot
right up your snoot.
They're going to make
a big old bonfire out of it.
A huge Arbite mixed fry bonfire
where there'll be a lot
of galopping and goose dumping.
That means work
shall make us free, right?
Doesn't it?
And isn't that true, though?
Doesn't work really
make you free?
Especially if you're
slaving away for some
jack-booted swine.
Yeah, like Bob Dobbs.
That's who I've been
slaving away for all week.
I kind of dig it, actually.
It's not a bad job.
Doesn't pay anything at all.
You have to pay them,
but it's kind of cool.
Sure, man.
Oh.
Because I don't know
what I'm doing.
I'm in a big mess.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
I don't know
where to go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
I will kill you.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to this edition
of the 700 Club.
I'm ready to pull the trigger.
So that's what we're looking at.
A lot of blood being spilled
all over the place.
Oh, and I think
that this is going to be nasty.
With us today is a man
who is just a sleaze.
And they said one of the reasons they wouldn't kill him was because he had the checkbook.
But before we get into that, let's see what's in the news today.
Here's a French elf.
Thank you, Pat.
Most Americans say they're looking to invade Iraq within a month.
But the French elf had to come over and over and over again, up close and personal.
And that would be pleasant.
Photos of Iraqi officials moving in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out.
We have come to have plenty of partners.
It's the way it is.
Which offers these words of praise.
This is a disgrace.
In and out.
We have come.
And then I will kill myself.
Oh, yes, baby.
A little bit of ESO swag.

All those cut-ups.
Well, except for the El Queso title song.
We love the El Quesos, friends.
And welcome to Hour of Slack 879.
Of a...
A sexy theme.
Generally this time, friends.
Very generally.
And coming up, lots of sexy-ly-mer.
Chop, chop, chop.
Sexy, fat, hairy white.
Some cuts from the good Reverend Cheatham in Australia.
And bug porn.
Yes, bug porn and some wild rice butt will also be on the schedule.
Oh.
Nevertheless, there are no weapons of mass white rice butt.
That information will make its way to President Ashley.
Okay, Chris.
Okay.
You would say buttocks.
I think that's buttocks.
Um, buttocks.
Buttocks.
Butt.
Butt.
And, oh, by the way, it's God that gives you money.
Or that new automobile that you need.
If you call...
In the next 15 minutes.
I only have the golden medallion.
It will remind you of the scripture.
Thou shall remember.
It's God that gives you wealth.
Or he gives you money to get wealth.
And now make that call.
Hallelujah.

I'm working out.
I'm working out for my lady.
Oh, yeah.
I'm working out.
I'm working out for Lou.
Hey, talking about working out, you know, I like to keep my body in shape.
You know, the shape of a barrage balloon.
That's how all my very sexy lady friends like it.
You know, big and firm with plenty to grab hold of.
Anyway, to get myself an even better knee, you know, I got in with one of the experienced weight trainers down at the gym.
You know, private tuition.
Greg, his name is, big muscle-bound bloke with blonde hair.
When I first saw him in the changing room, I was going to be like,
gobsmacked.
I don't think I'd ever seen such a big member in there before.
And you're talking about a membership of 600.
You know, he's massive.
His very sexy lady friend, Debbie, used to train there, too.
Now, she happens to be a very keen weightlifter.
Likes nothing more than to show off her weightlifting techniques with the barbells.
I tell you what, I've never seen a woman jerk one like it in all my life.
Mind you, her snatch was very disappointing.
Personally speaking, I thought it looked a bit messy.
Now, fortunately for her, Greg was always at hand to sort her out.
It usually stand in front of her and make sure she got a firm grip of it when she went down, you know.
Great to watch, it was.
Particularly when she'd puff her cheeks out and, you know, push it up as far as it would go.
Well, Greg was a great trainer.
Really keen to get stuck in, you know, get on the job.
He was a very hard man, you know, but he was behind me all the way, getting stuck in.
And that's what I liked.
Because, you see, I've always been keen on that.
I had a job at a sports centre once, did I tell you?
That's where I met Geraldine, right?
We were both working there.
She was a very sexy young lady friend of mine.
Both working at the sports centre.
And I was moving some of the Fiverside football equipment when I accidentally emptied my ball bag in the corridor just outside her office.
Well, she heard the commotion and caved straight away.
You know, to give me a hand.
Now, after that, I didn't see her for ages.
Because I spent quite a time working at the Firkin Fudge Company, where I got on really well with my fellow fudge packers.
Hey, the laughs we had.
Filling each other's boxes.
You know, with rubbish and all that.
So often, the box had to be cleaned out before you could start all over again, you know.
Great days.
Anyway, from there, I went to Jessop's, the grocer's.
And that's where I bumped into Geraldine again.
I was just packing the fridge full of margarine when she walked up to me, tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me if I'd give her the stork that I had in my hand.
Well, she said she usually had Flora, but thought she'd try a different brand for a change.
So, stork margarine it was.
Well, I think I got it.
After that chance encounter, we started courting.
And nine months later, we decided to get engaged.
Hey, I tell you what, I just couldn't wait to get down to the jeweler's.
You know, to get something special for her.
To slip onto the third finger of her left hand.
I tell you what, when I went home and give it to her that night in bed, she was absolutely ecstatic.
The thing was, she said she'd never expected me to present her with such a sparkling ring.
Then, after pushing her finger towards it, she wriggled it in.
Slowly, until it would go no further.
I'll never forget the look on her face when she smiled at me and said, it fitted like
a glove.
Well, unfortunately, the relationship didn't work out, you know, but that's life.
And, you know, you win some, you lose some.
The way I look at it, there's always another very sexy lady friend around the corner if
you keep yourself in shape.
And that's why I'm working out.
Yes, working out.
Working out.
I'm working out for my lady.
I'm working out.
I'm always working out.
A fat, hairy white, dear friends.
The great, fat, hairy white.
And now, Le-Le-Le-Le-Le-Mur.
But why do squirrels need to survive in the wild?
They need to starve.
In the wild, they're nuts, and that requires brains.
So where's the best adorable rabbit?
The most poisonous rodents.
How about Squirrel City?
Sneaky.
Squirrels also show their cities all over our world.
She learned to run this assault course by trial and error.
She's only 13.
But it took her a few days.
This certainly did fail the thinking test.
As we'll see, the squirrels is a free lunch.

Wow.
Expanding breasts.
I'll be perhaps in the laboratory working on my works or my later opera, as they call them.
Or I'll be bowling.
Or just like trying on a pretty skirt with a poodle on it.
And the next thing you know, my breasts will start expanding as big as the sun.
Is that what that huge shadow was that covered it?
Yeah.
I can do more than cast a shadow.
It wouldn't take quarters.
I can hire one if they know what to say.
I wanted, that's all I wanted was chocolate.

Yeah.
We were like a million stars.
I said I'd buy you a sailboat, baby.
Then we could see the world together.
Just you and me.
We had a love we said would never die.
But now it's time to say goodbye.
We had a love that grew its wings to fly.
Now you have to dry your crying eyes.
Dye your crying eyes.

I treat you like a queen, you meant more than the world
Take you to the finest shops, dress you like a girl
And peel your panties off, yeah, we can do it like that
Baby, feels right all night, so tight, dynamite
But then I had to push you out and things wasn't the same
Your love was wild, now it's tame, baby
I don't want to see you cry
So I have to let my colon say goodbye
I love you, I love you
Oh, oh

That's anal worship, most sincerely, baby
Come on, yeah, you know it feels so right
But I love you, but what's your name now?
Now my colon don't feel so right
And the seagull stole my toupee
The day I decided I would have to say goodbye
And I lied when I cried, it was not for you
But out of fear that I had disrespected my rectum
And that's not hip-hop
How many eyes are gonna cry tonight

Really the only way to get rid of child pornography
is to fill your computer up with adult pornography
all the way till it's completely maxed out.
It won't take anything out.

and they were all the same one?
That freaked him out the last time.

How hard it is to escape the constant clamoring of insect pornography commercials.
Yet, to those who see through different eyes,
the world is not what it appears to those less attentive.
To some few discerning ones,
even God's tiniest creatures can be seen to indulge ceaselessly
in mindless microcosmic reiterations of man's eternal battles
and his passions.
Between viruses, bacteria, and our own immune systems,
as above is so below.
And some see below the belt of the allowable,
deep beneath the underclothing of the forbidden.
Some see into the microconspiracy behind the macroconspiracy.
And some like what they see.
But, just as in our so-called human world,
the winner takes all.
For only the winner's genes are passed on to future generations.
Yes, the conspiracy rules in the unknown world, too.
Now, maintained in artificial wombs,
aided by technology only guessed at by Earth science,
what might have remained the errant seed of harmless bug porn enthusiasm
grows instead into the all-too-familiar larval stage,
then to a pupa,
and finally,
into a perfect clone seed.
The final simulacrum of your child,
your neighbor,
your boss,
your spouse,

From the tiniest, most seemingly harmless conspiracy,
to bigger conspiracies,

It is this.
Obscene literature is a two billion dollar a year business.
That's two billion dollars for eight hundred distributors.
It is big business.
This traffic continues to increase and flourish.
It is profitable business.
Through this material, today's youth can be stimulated to enter the world of homosexuals.
Lesbians, sadists, masochists.
Big business.
It sparks.
It's thrilling.
It provides kicks.
It encourages children to use the library.
It's an illustrated, detailed course in perversion.
It can be obtained by writing to Perversion for Profits.

This male is angry, distraught, and terrified.
It is a terrible tragedy.
While attempting to mate with a female, he's inadvertently pushed her into a drainage ditch.
But that's okay.
I think I can deal with it.
Now it's up to these rescue workers to mate with a female.
With a remarkable combination of finesse and brute force,
these workers use a crane to force the female.
She shows she's all right by fighting off the crane mechanism.
Nope.
That's wonderful.

And now, Michael Pepe.
Did you know that the Boston Strip is a place where you can find the best music for your music?


I was a big Strip Strangler.
I used to chase Michael Pepe around the park when he was a kid.

I was the prize.
You know, he had strangled everyone but me.
And I was the Strip Strip.
Really?
What happened to the collar?
Did the collar leave?
And also, Michael Pepe did a sex show as a teenager to make money and didn't know that
you weren't supposed to actually do sex.
This now can be said, my parents are molasses.
That was intriguing.
And so, yeah.
I guess the guest collar.
But, you know, I was good, but it was very cheap.
And how much money did you make?
And this was like $1,000.
You had to be there 11 hours a day and you got like $100 or something.
It wasn't...
That's pretty good money for...
This is 1978.
1978?
Yeah.
Just before you moved out here.
Sorry, 70...
I'm sorry.
$100 was about $6 back then.
Yeah, it was actually $75, $76.
And...
Yeah, $100 back then.
Make you cheer, man.
Well, but you had to hang out at donut shops and listen to maniacs rap and rant.
It cost $5.
This is when I went insane.
$100 today is worth about $4.
They're like, you're going to be on the show in America today.
$100 today is worth about $4.


You're going to be on the show tomorrow.

It is unlikely that a Wild Young Gypsy Girl like this will ever be made again.
But this is the Wild Young Gypsy Girl who will film it now.
And it's a wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild,
wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild.
The real drivers are in the Wild Young Gypsy Girls.
And the command force of Wild Young Gypsy Girls records every second of the action from the
Wild Young Gypsy Girl.
But now, it is unlikely that a Wild Young Gypsy Girl like this will film it.
Now, the cameras roll as the actual Wild Young Gypsy Girl is not the same unique Wild Young
Gypsy Girl as the repeated Wild Young Gypsy Girl.
Wild Young Gypsy Girl.
All the excitement of the same wild young gypsy girl.
The spectacle, the grand adventure of the real wild young gypsy girl.
But now...
Now.
Can you imagine an entire opera being built around Mary Magdalene?
Mary Magdalene.
Mary Magdalene.
Mary Magdalene.
Mary Magdalene.
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.
Really?
Really?
Really?
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.
Really?
It adds so much more excitement to bring in a street-walking prostitute
and have her say as she does in Superstar.
That feels nice.
I don't know how to love him.
He's a man.
He's just a man.
And I've had so many men before.
Really?
Ha!
Mary Magdalene.
Mary Magdalene.
Mary Magdalene.
Mary Magdalene.
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.
Mary Magdalene.





Probably before she told 72 seconds, she told an ace that she helped me with the

Oh yeah, Dakota.


Yeah.

Should I bring him down?
Should I speak of love, let my feelings out?

Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.
I don't know how to love him.
He's a man.
He's just a man.
That feels nice.
Mary Magdalene by the Jelly Eaters.
What are you going to teach me first, Master Kwan?
Inspiration.
Music that is absolutely riveting.
See for yourself.
An angel appeared to Mary
on a glittery cloud of angel wings.
This angel brought fair Mary news.
You'll give birth to the King of Kings.
Well, Mary gasped and Mary stared.
She'd never seen an angel and she was scared.
The angel said, my virgin maid,
there's no reason to be afraid.
Fear not.
The angels smile.
Fear not.
My virgin child.
You've been touched by the Holy Ghost.
Above all women, you've been blessed.
Fear not.
Fear not.
Fear not.
Fear not.
And now, friends, well, you're hearing in the background the amino acids who played at our Akron Revival.
You can hear more of them at theaminoacids.com.
That's www.theaminoacids.com.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The amino acids.
Now, Dave, you've converted to the Church of the Subgenius, is that correct?
Oh, well, there's no conversion table involved.
You just take one cup of metric water.
Right.
And place it in some boiling pans.
Okay.
Add three pounds of metric salt.
I see.
And there's your conversion table right there.
Well, that's pretty amazing.
I didn't think it was that easy.
Well, you...
Actually, you also have to spend 30 bucks.
Now, Reverend...
You have to be born that way and spend 30 bucks both.
You can just spend the 30 bucks.
Now, I'm more interested in that loophole.
The one loophole that if you're actually having sex at 7 a.m. on July 5th, that you don't have to pay the 30 bucks.
What?
I think you said that.
I found that in an old tape.
I think that loophole had hair around it.
That's how he found it.
No, I was listening to some old tapes.
And now, out of your very mind...
Now, you said...
Hello.
My name is Natalie.
The only way around the $30...
Or having your card.
The only way you don't have to have your card at 7 a.m. is if you're actually having sex.
Well, if I said that, then pick up on it, man.
Now, are we...
Is the party going to stop by and see if we're carrying our card?
No, I'm saying.
No, I'm saying.
Or is old W...
No, you're saying.
No, you're saying.
Is the party going to check your card?
Who's checking the cards?
I need to know.
It's a genetic thing.
They check.
It's a...
A scanner that's hardly even physical.
Just call it magic.
It's not even physical.

Aliens have magic.
It's just kind of a scrambler that kind of exists more in the metaphysical plane.
Oh, it exists all right.
They can tell.
They can tell who's in the book of life and who's in the subgenius foundation database.
Well, they can tell all they want, but I'm keeping it a secret.
You know what I'm saying?
And they're going to tell Mr. Chaney tomorrow, and I'm going to get a great big fat check.
And you might go to jail.
I think Chaney's...
If you don't...
He's a hot looking dude, man.
I like Chaney.
I like the way he kind of like grins out of the side of his mouth, man.
That is so freaking hot.
The way he had to wear the fishhooks in his nose to play Phantom of the Opera.
He is.
I mean, I'm not generally like a gay dude or anything, but man, I see Dick Chaney and
I start getting a woody, man.
Oh, Dick Chaney's a cute guy.
I thought you were talking about Lon Chaney Sr.
Okay, so...
Now, he was hot.
People call him...
The hunchback of Notre Dame.
Imagine that 80-pound hump of rubber strapped to his back.
He knew how to...
It was real suffering in those days.
In the days of...
Oh, those toothpicks weren't...
They weren't enough to cause a scar on a...
Those bags of water weren't stunt bags.
Those were the real actors being tortured and mangled and brutalized.
Brutalized.
They weren't stunt bags.
You're saying they're real bags.
Oh, Mexican men are the gods.
Well, are you listening on the internet, then, Johnny?
Well, I'm trying my best.
It's breaking up quite a bit.
Is it?
This is actually...
The only way I could listen to the show was to make a long-distance phone call and sit
on the phone.
Well...
Is that break-up?
Well, if you're on unlimited minutes, you can just sit there.
I'll lock you on.
Well, I'll tell you what.
We've got...
I've got forehead paste on all three of us, and we're sort of sticking together right
now, but...
What do we got here?
Oh, we're almost out of time.
Well, you know, when you stay on the phone like that for a long time, it also serves
as a colonoscopy.
Have you talked to the people at Atrium Tree?
I've tried to several times, but they only speak Yiddish now.
Well, they're still psychic.
Don't forget that part.
They still are psychic, especially if you're using it as a colonoscopy.
Well, I...
We're all wondering how we can get our hands on some of that delicious ESO music, as well
as some WCSB paraphernalia.
You know, we've never had any in all the years we've called the show.
How about some...
We have no paraphernalia.
No, you know, you can get that paraphernalia...
How about some good old CSB paranoia?
Well, you send me an email.
I can hook you up with ESO.
That's right.
Chaz at subgenius.com, as well as subgenius.com catalog, you'll find ESO information.
There you go.
There you go.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Very impressive.
Amazing!
Uh, yeah, that was the kicker.
Nuns of Dobstown!
The invertebrate flatworm slut nuns of Dobstown!
They're soft. You like soft women.
I like them like a...
Only $40 you come in and we have no bones.
I like them like a...
Boneless women.
Boneless...
...jello jelly girls.
Do they put them in the can?
Female fillet!
Crawls on her belly like a snail without a shell!
Ah, you can put it in like a consommé.
What a trail shell!
I believe for you, buddy.
Only $40, come on in, you don't want to miss this show.
What are you, some kind of a wuss?
Come on in here.
Only $40, best show in Amsterdam!
I could go for a mollusk.
Live on stage, right in front of your face.
They do it with bugs and snails.
Subgenius Hardcore.
Subgenius eyes bring you the hottest subgenius adult videos
Jerry Seinfeld.
Videos and DVDs.
Yes, it's true, those horrible porn banners on the sub site that Stang deliberately cultivates.
He whines and complains that they are needed to make money for the site, but in truth,
Satisfy every twisted desire with their incredible collection of rare subgenius footage.
When you go to the sub site site, you know, you have these porno things there which help pay for the site.
Are you talking about some kind of art excuse or real just straight pornos?
No, those banners.
Those banner ads in the sub site.
Yeah, I have not actually ever looked at it.
Well, maybe they got rid of them.
I don't know if you haven't seen them.
No, they got rid of them.
I just must have hallucinated it, that's all.
Yeah, it was a dream.
Even Stang couldn't stand it anymore.
Even Stang wouldn't stoop so low.
And you two are dreaming about it?
No, Stang wouldn't stoop that low, but he just wouldn't stay there very long.
Okay, let's watch a little Stang puppet stoop now.
There, and then he stands up now. He's doing a bow.
Now he's walking off stage.
Now what we've done is we've reached the little tiny puppet subgenius show right at intermission.
We did.
That's really entertaining.
Intermission. Really cute.
I'm not sure I understand it.
And then, well, now you go out for miniature coffee and donuts in the miniature...
In the miniature golf course, miniature restaurant.
That's right. And then you come back in 12 minutes later and the show starts again.
It's really cool.
That's exactly...
Subgenius videos.
It's a 4-inch video.
A fabulous collection of subgenius women from all over the world.
Some of the hairiest subgenius girls on video see those stinky, sweaty subgenius women tired of close contact with the stinky road of...
So are we.
If you're tired of that, then you need to call right now at 840-425.
We've had enough of that ourselves. We're actually in our own exotic land.
You know, they've...
Now the boffins have developed an onion that doesn't make you want to eat it.
You cry when you cut into it.
I know.
What will science produce next?
Okay, all you driving around town pot smokers, call us right now, 840-425.
Up to now.
And all you guys in red Camaros with mullet haircuts, call us right now.
Oh, yes, dear friends, some KPFA Sub Show from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Howell puzzling evidence, Dr. Philodrummon.
And before that, some chief themes.
A theme set.
Where there will be a woman at the head of every nation in the world.
But models are no less reserved.
How do you get to be a head of a nation?
And now, please, pay attention to...
Be a woman.
Huh.
It's going to be a lot of work.
Get it?
It seems like it would...
Well, I'd make a terrible woman.
I don't know about that.







You got the right hair for it.
Well, the hair on his chin, but it's in the wrong place.
It would be great womanly hair, but it's just all arranged wrong.
It's gone gray, too.
I like the hair on his ears.
Well, the hair around his ears will bleed if you cut it.
That's not just hair.
Oh.
Well, those are his forgotten appendages.
Oh, the undiscovered appendages.
I remember my...
They forgot the appendages.
Poor crazy Bonnie.
It's glass-drenched shirtless,
She just couldn't stop lunatic room.
...actuality and food.
It is as if the model is according to one picture itself, like an interior...
The ghost of excesslessness must pass, returns to haunt us in these horrible recordings
from Doc Stock 1 in 1983.
The saddest, sorriest, most...
...disease-ridden festival of the arts.
This is actually a young woman named Laurie's birthday party in Berkeley.
Oh.
But you know, the other one that...
...was here.
The Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

The Amino Acid.
Ugh!

I am Captain Hook.
I am your friend.

Come and sit upon my pegged lap.
