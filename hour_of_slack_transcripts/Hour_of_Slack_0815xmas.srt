1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Take it from the top, boys.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,820
Let's do it all again.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
Oh, I hate when the stuff gets broadcast.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,420
No, there it goes.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,840
Not gonna be too happy.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,140
Well, so how many more of these practice sessions do we have to do till the real show?

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,200
Real.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,860
Real show.

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,340
Yeah, how many more are there?

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,080
Five.

11
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:18,940
Five?

12
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,560
Five more.

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,180
Hey, Chad.

14
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,880
Come on, can't we have one more story?

15
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,660
Come on.

16
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,240
Hour of Slack.

17
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,220
Sponsored by The Churchill of the subgenius.

18
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,760
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be made on radio station and only in the city of...

19
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,660
I have all the characteristics of a human being.

20
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,560
Flesh, blood, skin, hair.

21
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,040
But not a single clear identifiable emotion.

22
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,180
Except for greed and disgust.

23
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,920
Something horrible is happening inside of me.

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,780
And I don't know why.

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,880
Christmas makes me feel emotional.

26
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,420
String and strings.

27
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,680
Light and strings.

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,440
Feel and stamp.

29
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,880
Link of my brain.

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,160
As the shadows rush.

31
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,520
With their treasure.

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,020
And above all this mess.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,860
You are the only one.

34
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:26,860


35
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:26,860


36
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:26,860


37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm so grateful that I knew the only one.

38
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,920
So I honor you guys.

39
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,160
I reallyient.

40
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,480
I repented from what I did to même.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:56,800


42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:56,860
Is a

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:56,860


44
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,220
Soon it will be Christmas Day

45
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,280
The Subgenius Radio Ministry are a slur

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,920
One, two, Santa's coming for you

47
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,020
Three, four, you better lock your door

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,840
Five, six, with a crucifix

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,000
Seven, eight, better stay up late

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,460
Nine, ten, Santa's coming again!

51
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,900
Over there!

52
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,980
The Subgenius Radio Ministry

53
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,900
Have you ever wondered

54
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,040
What it would have been like

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,820
If the baby Jesus were born today?

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,600
Now?

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,220
Maybe even this year?

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,320
What do you think it would be like

59
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,360
If it was all being reported to us

60
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,120
By the television and radio media

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,660
That we hear and watch every day?

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,740
It might go something like this

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,220
I'm an old man

64
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,180
And I've seen lots of Christmases

65
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,120
Come and go

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
And they're never white

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,160
And it's raining again

68
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,520
And again and again

69
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,880
And again and again

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,040
And again and again

71
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,780
And again and again

72
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,360
And again and again

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
And again and again

74
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,680
Christmas is a-comin'

75
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,120
The geese are getting fat

76
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,740
Please put a penny in the old man's hat

77
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,660
If you haven't got a penny

78
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,120
A heypenny will do

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,320
If you haven't got a heypenny

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,680
Then God bless you

81
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,620
God bless you gentlemen

82
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,300
God bless you

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,520
If you haven't got a heypenny

84
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,920
Then God bless you

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,040
Christmas is a-comin'

86
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,640
Look out for Twinkle Elf

87
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,860
Making Christmas dinner at all by himself

88
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,460
If he hasn't got a filter tip, a ball of dung will do

89
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,020
If he hasn't got a dung ball, he's got some curly shoes

90
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,620
God bless Twinkle Elf, God bless me

91
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,300
Your Christmas shoes are curly and curly as can be

92
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,680
Voila, voila, voila, voila, voila

93
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,340
Voila, voila, voila, voila, voila

94
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,200
God bless you gentlemen, God bless you

95
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,820
If you haven't got a turkey leg, then God bless you

96
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,100
We all as children grew up dreaming of having, doing, wearing

97
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,380
What Barbie has. Barbie has it all.

98
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,540
Barbie is a prop for everyone to dream through

99
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,620
Barbie changed the course of a woman's life

100
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,060
She could have all sorts of adventures

101
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,680
She could get in her own way

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,200
She could even get into her own home

103
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,780
Barbie changed the course of a woman

104
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,200
Barbie changed the course of a woman

105
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,180
Baby, you have my all!

106
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
Mam위だから

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:39,960


108
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,080
La bonda

109
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,080


110
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,160
The decline of romantic makeup

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,640
Have you ever seen such three hundred people being out there?

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,280
Let me out this way

113
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,020
elling your crush

114
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,020
The pänerä

115
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,060
Barbie dolls.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,680
Women were able to be more with their lives by role-playing with Barbie.

117
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,780
Barbie dolls.

118
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,800
A very important doll.

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,040
Barbie dolls.

120
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,480
Kanye West.

121
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,480


122
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,860
me

123
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,700
I

124
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,620

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,640
Maria, gratia bene.

127
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,660
Maria, gratia bene.

128
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,820
Maria, vittorinus.

129
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,660
Dominius Dominius.

130
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,540
Dominius Dominius.

131
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,640
Dominius Dominius.

132
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,320
Dominius Dominius.

133
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,540
Dominius Dominius.

134
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,040
Dominius Dominius.

135
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,760
Dominius Dominius.

136
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,540
Stand up on his way.

137
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,300
Stand up on his way.

138
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,640
Stand up on his way.

139
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:43,640


140
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:43,640


141
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,120
He's loaded, he's loaded Lots of toys and goodies on his list

142
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,340
He's loaded, lots of toys and goodies on his list

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,060
Every mother's child is gonna want to survive

144
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:18,360
Bring me a rainbow, and a flower and a soul

145
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,500
I am offering this very simple phrase

146
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,760
To kids from one to ninety-two

147
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,160
All over to Santa many times, many ways

148
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,820
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas

149
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:45,700
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas

150
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,260
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas

151
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,060
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas

152
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,500
Merry Christmas

153
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,500


154
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,560
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas

155
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,200
I am so giddy!

156
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,860
Merry Christmas

157
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,040
Merry Christmas

158
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,040


159
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,320
Merry Christmas

160
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,740
Merry Christmas

161
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,600
Thank you.

162
00:12:59,500 --> 00:12:59,560
Thank you.

163
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,840
I chased old Bob through the field into the mall.

164
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,660
I pointed my shotgun and he began to crawl.

165
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,380
I said, I want them chickens back.

166
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,480
I said, I want them chickens back.

167
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,540
I said, I want them chickens back at noon.

168
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,560
But the aliens took your gal.

169
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,420
She sucked dry like a prune.

170
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,040
And I didn't bring the chickens back.

171
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,660
When I caught up with Bob, he was eating chicken pie.

172
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,480
He had piles of bones reaching to the sky.

173
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,200
And I'll never give my chickens back.

174
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,340
I said, I want them chickens back.

175
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,620
I said, I want them chickens back.

176
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,640
I said, I want them chickens back.

177
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:31,800
He said, I want them chickens back.

178
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,640
I said, I want them chickens back.

179
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,280
I said, I want them chickens back.

180
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:49,460
He said, I want them chickens back.

181
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,420
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

182
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:00,740
That very last was some obtuse, dear friends.

183
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,580
And before that, Chicken Stealin' Bob.

184
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,380
The new greatest hymn to Bob from Gary Gabrogfran.

185
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:16,160
Yes, the legendary Gary Gabrogfran of the band that dare not speak its name.

186
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,460
And ah, yes, this is Christmas Hour of Slack.

187
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,460
2001 show number two.

188
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:32,940
And that chestnuts roasting on an open fire, just killer collage remix that we heard earlier

189
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:44,440
was by Corporal Blossom from A Mutated Christmas, which is from www.triagemusic.com.

190
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,540
Before that, we heard Brother Theodore in some kind of a mystery clip.

191
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,580
And I don't know who did.

192
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,380
Ave Maria.

193
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,720
Ave Maria.

194
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,480
But that collage about Barbie, Barbie Has It All, was by Obtuse.

195
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,940
And friends, you can get a free CD from Obtuse.

196
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,700
And the information and the place to get it is from obtuse.

197
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,620
This is a website.

198
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,460
Obtuse, O-B-T-U-S-E, .i-u-m-a .com.

199
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,560
That's .i-u-m-a .com.

200
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,320
And this.

201
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,760
More obtuse coming, friends.

202
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,900
Oh, oh, and also that very first thing we played, the cool, cool, cool, cool Silver Bells scary clip

203
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,960
was by Grassy Noel.

204
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,220
Also from A Mutated Christmas.

Strike in the harp and join the chorus

259
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,420
Bowering in their relation

265

We'll see you next time.

274
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:26,600
Our monitors are good, for they have shown us how right and proper our own form of government actually is.

275
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:43,200
As the Lord spoke to Job out of the whirlwind, so do voices seem to be speaking to us, now and in our day, telling us not to abjure all hope.

276
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,880
Believe in our traditions.

277
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:53,240

Thank you.

294
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:26,400
Now, we'll be giving information about these things, but now let us plunge into the evil side of joy with James Kochauka, Superstar.

295
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:40,300
The snowman isn't very nice. His heart is cold, it's made of ice. And if you snap your fingers twice, he'll come to life.

296
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,860
Mother Lock, the kid's inside. Everybody's...

297
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,060
Everybody run and hide. Don't look in the snowman's eyes. You'll turn to ice.

298
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Snowman, Wheel of the Skewer young man, don't run, just like the Shouts.

299
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,200
Estados Unidos, Peel off, the snowman, down.

300
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,700
quythor, Thomas the Superstar, dreamed, giving Dumbo his

301
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:39,880
suit.

302
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,100
Fuck it

303
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,380
And you.

304
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,660
And you.

305
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:45,820
Thank you.

306
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:45,820


307
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,040

Thank you.

317
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,500
Depression is touching my soul

318
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,460
I know what I want, but I just don't know

319
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,040
I gotta go out again

320
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,120
Feeling, sweet feeling, drips from my fingers

321
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,720
My fingers

322
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,040
Cause burning depression is catching my soul

323
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,240
Woman so hot, sweet toes in vain

324
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,300
We make love, we break love, it's all the same

325
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,620
This old heart

326
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,140
Music, sweet music, I wish I could caress, caress

327
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,300
Manic depression is a frustrated mess

328
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,800
Music, sweet music, I'd rather die

329
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:56,200
Music, sweet music, love is what there is

330
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,280
Music, sweet music, I've already been Suddenly taken and left only to let go

331
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,280


332
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,680
Oh I think I'm gonna kill myself

333
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,160
I'm going down, I'm going down

334
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,700
Down

335
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,580
There really ain't no use in me staying here and hanging around

336
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,000
I gotta get out

337
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,560
Music, sweet music

338
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,320
I wish I could rest

339
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,660
Yes

Yeah

343
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,500
A frustrated mess

344
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Cause I never used it

345
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,420

Thank you.

364
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,540
Satisfying a fundamental age.

365
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,680
Thank you, Todd.

366
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,740
What we as manufacturers are selling is fun.

367
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,620
That was Obtuse.

368
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,940
And before that, Manic Depression, the Hendrix song by Retaliation.

369
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,820
I thought that would be good for those holiday blues.

370
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,660
Thanks to Pope S. Lillith for 4K.

371
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,520
Forwarding that and other music we've been playing at times.

372
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,540
Mr. Sister posted the monitor clips.

373
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,180
And we don't know who did the drunken Christmas song.

374
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:15,240
But the scary Frosty the Snowman was by Lovecraft Technologies from Unmutated Christmas.

375
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:25,220
But now, friends, well, we got this interesting CD in the mail from someone named Sherry Elf.

376
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,600
And I thought this would be a perfect time.

377
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:36,200
To play this song by Sherry Elf from her debut CD, Forcing Goodness Upon You.

378
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:57,800
Help?

379
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
I told him no thank you.

380
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,720
And I got into my car.

381
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,560
But as I drove away, I said to myself,

382
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,700
S?

383
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,260
Elf?

384
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,460
You waited all your life for someone to notice how lost you look.

385
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,680
Now you refuse help from Jesus of all people.

386
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,560
Jesus.

387
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,960
Yes, I'm lost.

388
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,900
And I could use some help.

389
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,460
I just was not expecting you there.

390
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,860
In the parking lot of the hardware store.

391
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:38,380
You know, I'm kicking myself and my thoughts are full of what would have happened if I would have taken you up on your offer.

392
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,100
But now it's too late.

393
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,180
I went and sent you away.

394
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,540
If I know Jesus, he's still out there.

395
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,340
He's canvassing all of the parking lots of all the hardware stores.

396
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,400
And these great.

397
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,280
United States.

398
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,640
And he won't stop there.

399
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,680
Soon you'll find him in the parking lots of all of the hardware stores of all of North and South America.

400
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,460
And then he'll migrate.

401
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,940
Over to Europe.

402
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,960
And Africa.

403
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,660
And China.

404
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,140
Wait.

405
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,220
Do they have hardware stores in China?

406
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,780
And do they have parking lots?

407
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,160
Well, knowing Jesus, that won't stop him.

408
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,420
You have to have your act together pretty good to be the son of God.

409
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,680
Jesus.

410
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,700
Jesus.

411
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,380
Jesus.

412
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,380


413
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,380


414
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,380


415
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,380


416
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,380


417
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,380


418
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,380


419
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,380


420
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,380


421
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,140
Yes, I'm lost.

422
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,160
And I could still use some help.

423
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,160
But I think from now on you should wear a t-shirt or a button that says, Jesus, Son of God.

424
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:41,860
Jesus.

425
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,100
Your understated approach took me by surprise.

426
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,180
I thought you were talking hardware.

427
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,900
But no, you were talking eternal life and salvation.

428
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,260
I'm still regretting how in my haste I sent you away.

429
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,940
This song goes out to Jesus.

430
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,360
Wherever he may be wandering.

431
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,440
For his untiring perseverance in soliciting unsuspecting shoppers there in the parking

432
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,260
lots of all of the hardware stores of this great earth.

433
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,420
Jesus, we love you.

434
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,880
And we respect you.

435
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:23,880


436
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,000
And we look forward to seeing you again.

437
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,560
And we hope that you'll get your clever new marketing strategy.

438
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,680
Jesus.

439
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,880
It's all lost.

440
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,220
But I feel the problem is resolving itself.

441
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,740
From now on my eyes and ears are open and I'm much more prepared to meet saviors and

442
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,380
sons of God while I am shopping in hardware stores.

443
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,420
But not only hardware stores.

444
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,960
Wherever I shop.

445
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,880
Wherever I am, I look deeply into the eyes of my fellow human beings.

446
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:53,880


447
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:53,880


448
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:53,880


449
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,860
And I look for Jesus.

450
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,920
Jesus, yes I'm lost.

451
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,720
But I'm feeling a little better.

452
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,060
I still like the idea of a t-shirt or a button.

453
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,940
Some of us are a little preoccupied and we need to see a label.

454
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,140
Jesus.

455
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,880
Oh, Jesus.

456
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,860
I still like the idea of a t-shirt or a button.

457
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:23,860


458
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,320
Oh, Jesus.

459
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,940
Oh, Jesus.

460
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:42,900
Oh, J-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-s-u-s.

461
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,440
Have you seen Jesus today?

462
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,920
Uh yes, that was Sherry Elf.

463
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,840
Wasn't that pretty much it?

464
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


465
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


466
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


467
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


468
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


469
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


470
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


471
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


472
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


473
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


474
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


475
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


476
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


477
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


478
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


479
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


480
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:53,840


481
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:02,120
or something. She's distributed by herself. Her debut CD, Forcing Goodness Upon You,

482
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:10,100
is available only from her, but here's a website and address. That's www.sherielf.com,

483
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:30,620
which is spelled S-H-A-R-I-E-L-F, Sherielf.com, or Sherielf, P.O. Box 3585, Kansas City, Kansas 6, 6102.

484
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,400
The music in the background is by Mark Mothersbaugh from his Christmas album special,

485
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,460
Joyo Mutato.

486
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,400
And now, Reverend Sheldon DeWeer.

487
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,820
Jesus loves me, this I know,

488
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,260
cause my preacher tells me so.

489
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,700
If I argue, he'll use his tongue

490
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,240
till I scream out,

491
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,740
Yes, I'm wrong!

492
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,080
Oh, God, I'm a sinner!

493
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,360
I repent! Just make him stop!

494
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,360
Oh!

Thank you.

And to think, it's all because they kept lights off when it didn't have to be convenient.

541
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:31,140
This holiday season, why not turn on all the lights in your house and keep them on for the rest of the year?

542
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:35,160
Maybe you'll make the load a little lighter on us here at Multinational.

543
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,640
And a winter reminder, citizens.

544
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,940
Carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer, lurks everywhere.

545
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:49,700
So, if you have a gas stove, oil burner, or open flame, make sure all the doors and windows in the room are tightly sealed,

546
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,940
so that none of that nasty carbon monoxide can sneak in.

547
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,680
Thanks, and happy holidays.

548
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,620
This is Mr. Abernathy, signing off from your town to you.

BJR for the whiz and monitor clips.

553
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,480
The Jethro's, friends.

554
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,760
You need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

555
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,600
They're at...

556
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,300
They did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.

557
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:31,560
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller Avenue.
