Light your prop eyes up and test your tech
Well, welcome to the hour of slack
Praise Bob, Joel, and Connie's track
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack
La la la la la la la
La la la hour of slack
Slack
That's great, faster than any other leading cleanser
Leading cleanser
Bob
But let's leave things of this world behind
And walk now down the path of Bob
For this brief minute of slack
From the church of the subgenius
And so once again we find this deep-rooted contradiction
Within the word of God
Who he himself has said
I am everything but yet everything is me
And by this very self-same contradiction
We know that we do have some measure of free will
Yes, free choice
And it's up to us to decide
Whether we're going to sin in the ways that God wants us to
Or if we're going to sin against God
But yet since he is everything and everything is him
Or her or it or everything
One could say well everything is everything
So a sin might as well be a good deed
Helping a little old lady across the street
Might be a sin if everything is everything
Now this is an acid-head sort of mode of thinking
And I don't think anybody wants to go along
With such a vague and to say the least fluid philosophy
Because we have to have some sort of standard reference
For goodness or evilness
We got a zero or meter on something
So why not let that something be Bob, friend?
Let there be slack
Slack
Oh that's crazy
Crazy talk
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe
Friendship
Are we controlled by secret forces?
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?
Do people think you're strange?
Do you?
Then you may be on the right track
Give me slack or give me food or kill me
Give me slack or give me food or kill me
Kill me

Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
It's time to be manipulated
Brother I want to tell you something
The world is tired of dead preachin' preachers
Dead preachers preachin' dead sermons to dead congregations
They're tired of cold services and cold churches
This world is hungry for reality
They've had enough of Hollywood
They've had enough of Nashville
They've had enough of Nashville
They've had enough of show business
They're hungry for the mighty power of the man that walked the shores of Galilee two thousand years ago
And raised the dead and cast out devils
And healed the sick
And I'm here to tell you tonight that Jesus Christ is still raising the dead
Oh he's back from the dead
That's right
His grinning skull floats ever in front of your eyes
Because Jesus brought him back
And he's lusting for the flesh of the living
And these things are coming and coming speedily
We are near the very very end of the church age
And of course the Gentile time has already come to a close
For the archaeologists
Every day is a hair day
Slacks are always Jesus Christ's name
I got just what I wanted from everybody here today
And everybody said, name it
Name me an I reason because here is inflicted unbelief
Name me an unbelief is the lifeless body of his sister
Right now, man
Sarcastic
Satisfaction
Secure my weapon, Corvo
Again?
Again
Big day
Hey, did you get my present?
I punched a hole in Harvey Goldman's trailer
Hm
The world owes me a living
And I want my money back in one lump sum right now
That's the way you ought to wake up
Friends, it wasn't your parents' fault
They were just as screwy as you
It was the conspiracy's fault
It really was
I'm not a fool, I'm a fool
Friends, the conspiracy has hogged fascism long enough
We're taking fascism back
For the people, man
Fascism for the people
Fascism for the individual
It's what we call
Patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism
Say, must we work out?
How many 기다� groves left to call curfews?
Murphy can convict me
I cannot work out



I just am
Workout, man
I want you to hang on one minute please, I want you to hear something, and I want you
to hear it good.
I just want to tell you people something, there's some good people out here, and you
are insulting their intelligence.
And if you come to this country at our invitation, and we have to charge you through no choice
of our own, right?
If you don't want to pay it, don't follow me, I've come!
I want it to be firmly established that any person that feels that strongly has the right
to come to this microphone and speak.
I cannot help the system that is here.
It is my job to entertain you.
The fact that there is an exchange, that from this stage, whatever it costs, has to go out
there in the form of music, is the way that the world is made up.
I cannot help it.
I have no control over that.
I want to do it with something that nobody can steal from you.
Something that nobody can stop selling to you, or put you in jail so you can't maintain
it.
You're going to have to become self-realized to the peace within yourself on your own.
And beyond that, once you become self-realized, to learn how to express it, how to experience it constantly,
how to use the vehicles that you've got, whether it's your emotions, your mind, or your body,
to express the divine thing that you discover yourself to be.
And you can only discover that yourself.
We'll sell the precious body for a small piece of paper and carry it out of weight.
But be free.
You'll forget about them and you'll marry some blonde, dull, non-entity
and bear a brood of snot-faced, drug-snorting brats who can't believe what a doddering dullard you are
and can't wait for you to die or leave so they can kill you or something
while you sit there exhausted, sweating.
Sweating blood, staring at the TV, pondering your incredible degree of debt,
drinking yourself into a stupor and going,
What the hell happened?
Can't you swear?
Money can't cost me more.
I really love you.
I think that we're all just going to have to, like, the police force,
the lawyers, all the people that are running the whole thing,
these hippies with long hair are just going to have to braid their hair up,
put on a hat, man, and become policemen, you know, become lawyers, become doctors.
You know, but then we're the same as everybody else.
No, I mean, but with the idea.
I mean, with the idea that you want to change the system.
You can't defeat the system from within the system because then you're just part of it.
My dear, could you imagine?
I mean, Walt Disney is the...
Living in the ghetto, you know, a kid three years old using Mighty Mouse or Mickey Mouse,
whoever it was, for an article.
Right, you just look cute.
Running across the room for a gray rat thinking it was Mighty Mouse.
Are you ready?
We can't believe all of Walt Disney.
Well, I can blame almost all of it, or half of it.
Half of it.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
Don't let, don't let, don't let.
Hey, wise.
Joan, you're next.
This is Sue.
Hi, Sue.
How can I help?
Jim, I really have a problem with impulse buying.
I never have money left for anything.
Whoa.
Why?
Jim, I really have a buying impulse problem.
Well.
Buying.
Buying.
Anything.
Anything.
Anything.
Wait a minute.
Go ahead and use some of that money to bring some happiness.
Jim, I really have a problem.
Jim, I never have money left for impulse buying.
A lot of people have that problem.
Take cash.
Good idea.
I feel we really need to buy right away.
After all, money is only paper and metal until you put it to use.
I never have money left.
But we've already decided to buy.
Impulse.
Impulse.
I really think it'll help.
Good idea.
Oh, thanks.
Okay, let's go to line four.
This is Pennywise.
I'm Jim Phillips, and your name is?

I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.
Oh.

And your name is?

You're on the air with Pennywise.
I'm Jim Phillips.
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.
Yeah.
Let's go to line seven on Pennywise.
Hi, I'm Jim Phillips.

Yeah, yeah.
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.
Oh, well, listen.
I think your first responsibility is to yourself and your family.

Thanks for the call.
Hello.

Hi, Bob.
What can I do for you?

Go ahead.
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.
Oh, you sound frustrated.
It's because I am.
Well, my kids and I, for example, love to build things with scrap lumber.

All right.
Thanks for the call, Carl.
Bob.
Yeah.
This is Pennywise.
Line six.
You're on.
Bob.
Yeah, Barb.
Bob.
Go ahead.
Claims made in commercials.
Yeah.
I get confused.
Why?
I get commercials confused.

Well, many religious people follow the biblical plan of tithing.
You may want to visit with your clergy about it, but of course.
The what?

Commercials.
Commercials.
I get confused by all the claims.
And your name is?
Bob.
Yeah, that's a tough one.
A lot of people have that problem.
The what?
Truth in advertising.
I get confused.
Advertising, though, can be a really good source of information because of the truth in advertising
policy.
The what?
Because of the truth in advertising policy.

The law requires advertisers to tell the truth.

Good point.
Yeah.
So listen carefully to the wording of an ad.
The what?
The truth in advertising.

Well, then you have to decide if honesty goes both ways, right?
After all.
So, this is Pennywise.
You're on the air.
Hi, Bob.
What can I do for you?
Yeah, Jim.
This is Charlie.
Okay.
I've got a moral question for you.
The what?
Wait a minute.
Thanks for the call, Bob.
This is Charlie.
I've got a moral question for you.
Well, that's a matter.
For your own conscience, Charlie.
I figured you'd say something like that.
All right.
Why don't you give it a try this year?
Okay.
But don't ever catch it.
Well, thanks for calling, Charlie.
Thanks.
This is Pennywise.
Line six.
You're on.
Yeah, Jim.
This is Charlie.

The negative land, friends.

Plus music from Saint N.

But what do you want?
I want to be a member of your church.
I want to give all I got.
I want to love Bob.
I want to love Bob.
I was in a room.
Just the other day in Dallas.
Well, I did benefit from it.
Of course.
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.
Remember this.
I've been five years in the Naval Intelligence Division.
So that I do know a good, and it was in wartime.
So I know a good deal of what goes on.
I mean, I had connections with CID and the lot.
And there is no doubt in my mind.
I'm a good guy.




I know a lot of people.


I know a lot of responsible people.
But this isn't only just hippie fun.
Behind it is black power.
And behind that is communism.
My invisible monster is bigger than your invisible monster.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And friends, that's what most religions are all about.
Yeah.
And you may laugh at that.
But I'm afraid to tell you that according to the latest study I saw,
over 87% of Americans,
believe that there is an invisible monster
that will take care of them if they kiss its ass.
And friends, because of those idiots believing in that monster,
there is one.
He certainly made a lot of laws that we've ended up having to live by.
But friends, you can fight back.
Yes, we can turn the tables and declare war on God.
Now, frankly, some people might say,
that was real disrespectful sounding.
You, I think you, most of you, understand what we mean
when we say we're declaring war on God.
Repent, friends.
Repent through spending.
And you better do it quick.
They come to see the dungeons here.
The tourists flock from far and near.
They do the tower and try.
They do the theater.

And every jury has its price.
They bring the kids and show the wife.
It makes them proud to be around

At night, it's all close.
And end up feeling sick.
And we're all making money.
Lovely money.
Rubber necks with cash to burn.
Export criminals return.
They keep on coming, never learn.
They fill their diaries page by page.
And make it sound so thrilling.
They're hunting for the real thing.
They're flushed and they are willing.
And we're all making money.
Lovely money.
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
Want it, want it, want it.
Pay, pay, pay.
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.

Pay, pay, pay.

The question of kids now wanting everything to be free is very hard to handle because it's hard to talk to those kids.
Even you?
What?
Even you.
Even me? Hard to talk to them?
Of course.
Because to them I represent, among other things, somebody who has money.
Through this iron treasure's gate, the more popular criminals, those darlings of the crowd, were taken smiling onto the tower.
Rumor has it that the bloodstains of Charles I's decapitation were never actually washed from the stones.
All of me. All of me.
Friends, the tribulations, the saucers, the rupture, all of those things that are discussed in Dobbs' prophecy will come true.
But prophesying from it all, of wading through the blood of the baptism of the fist face of Bob,
burning through the titanium steel fort knocks doors with the power of that mighty pipe.
Friends, it will be Bob.
Bob is coming.
And he will burn away the hate.
He will burn away the radiation.
He will burn away the fire itself.
But you have to keep your hate burning.
Friends, you have to feed that fire.
Repent.
Quit your job.
Slack off.
While you still know how.
Time is running out.
The conspiracy at large has, well, between the United States and Russia, probably has 50,000 nuclear weapons.
Maybe 100,000.
And we've only got four.
Five.
We've only got five.
And yet we dare to fight them anyway.
Because it's always been the crazy people.
Friends, the crazy people.
Who are the only ones dumb enough to stand up and fight.
Fight city hall.
Now off you go.
Away you fly.
We've had your money.
Now goodbye.
We've lished you good.
We've bled you dry.

That settles it.
Freedom, freedom

You'll be absolutely free
Only if you want to be

Tell all the dreams

There is no time

Anyway, since I first saw his face, I know that Bob will triumph with our friends from outer space. And though we suffer needy, I know that it's alright, cause I know Bob and I, but tell me what to think.
The church of the subgenius will spread across the land, with pipes in place, we'll both march together hand in hand. The starfish of removal will strike a mighty blow, and we'll be free of the normal and the pig.
So give him Bob, Bob, Bob, and you'll see a whole lot better. Bob, Bob, Bob, send a dollar and a letter, he will change all your behavior.
He's your friend.
He's your friend.
And what do we expect? All this perversion and sex.
Are them oily pores in your back open up?
This is just as bad. All we care about is slack.
And letting all the slack get out.
The devil has to be behind that. Think I'd follow that? I don't think so.
I was about to grab the nearest object and smash the mirror into bits when I saw one with columns of numbers running across it.
I fancy myself comfortable with numerals, but these were beyond even me.
Fortunately, its words were not.
As cycles came and went in groupings of ten thousand...
...years. The sixth ice age receded, leaving behind denuded landscape and four continents.
By the 400th millennium, the genetic separation was irrevocable.
Occasional mutations proved the rule, rather than overturned it.
Separated into Eloatus humanus and Morloccus dishumanus, the former Homo sapiens left no genetic trail by AD 492,000...
...year.
965.
Do I surprise you?
Not at all, yes.
Hmm.
We weren't always like this.
After the moon fell from the sky, the earth could no longer sustain the species.
Some managed to stay above.
The rest of us escaped underground.
Then centuries later when we tried to re-emerge into the sun again.
The earth was no longer a place for us to live.



We couldn't.
So we bred ourselves into castes.
Some to be our eyes and ears.
Some to be our muscles and sinews.
You mean your hunters?
Yes.
Bred to be predators.
But bred also to be controlled.
You see, my caste.
Concentrated on expanding our cerebral abilities.
The earth is.
You control their thoughts.
Noth trust theirs.
To Eloi.
So it's not enough that you hunt them down like animals?
That's their role here.
To be your food?
Yes.
And for those who are suitable to be...
...breeding vessels for our other colonies.
You see, I am just one of many.
Is this the hour of slack?
No.
Yes.
Oh.
Ragnar, you're not really Reverend Cardboard Box, are you?
These kids with their names.
Reverend Cardboard Box.
Hey, come on, homie.
It's a gang, okay?
Gang people.
It's funny.
Weird names.
Weird costumes.
Cool tags, you know.
Got their handles done.
Jumbo was here.
Fat Larry fell down.
Oh, boy.
Must shouldn't be in a gang.
But a gang can be a bad influence or a good and slackful influence.
For instance, the subgenius gang.
Army is a conspiracy of dunces.
Isn't it?
Conspiracy of dunces?
Is it true that most of the people in the Church of the Subgenius are those like idiot savant innates?
Those people who don't really reconnoiter what they're actually establishing with us?
No.
No.
Half of them are the...
Dave, you're their patron saint.
Yeah.
Half of them are your people who are the greatest thing in the world at one thing.
And you're their patron saint, man.
They've been honoring you or listening to you for 20 years now or something like that.
Well, I'm about ready to start dealing out some funeral parlor holy cards.
I mean, prayer cards.
I'm going to start flipping from the bottom of the deck if these people don't stop bothering me.
Well, those are the voices in your head, Dave.
Those aren't real people bothering you.
How come they're...
Okay, well then how come they're so clever?
How come they can make things move around?
Because you're clever.
Because you're a saint, man.
That goes with the territory when you're a saint.
So you're saying the mind stuff is what drives the cosmic engine?
Yeah, Dave.
The phone calls are coming from inside the house.
Oh, man.
I thought I had this place nailed down tight as a drum.
What, your brain?
No, this house brain.
I mean, the higher...
No, it was a metaphor.
That was a metaphor, Dave.
That was a metaphor.
You did.
The calls were coming from inside your house.
I thought we were going to go into something else.
It's just that one cell.
It's that one beautiful cell.
That one brain cell you have, Dave.
Then why does it have ours if it's just a brain cell?
And if the truth is so horrible it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Well, I think I'm used to that.
No, wait a minute.
No, you wait a minute.
I love that area.
And I...
No, no.
That doesn't mean it doesn't.
No, no, no.
I don't know about that.

I don't think I'm used to that.
I don't.
I don't know what that is either.
This is where I was right?

I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

is so belonga
marijuana. Years of research were necessary in order to improve the product. But it doesn't
take long for the drug habit to make anyone over. In all the colors of the rainbow. A few years back,
the United States of America had nearly gone crazy. They were lining up dope peddlers and
shooting them in the back of the head. Just take it or leave it. Then it's chemistry to the rescue.
The answer is a simple one. Just use your head. But there's one sure thing. If you use narcotics,
the horizon is unlimited. Talk to someone who has had the experience. All around us are the
products of modern chemistry. Heroin, morphine, red, crack, sleeping pills. Something that came
out of a test tube created in the chemist's laboratory by a miracle of modern science
folded into a compact little package many times as strong. And the dope addicts say
yes, chemistry has changed the world we live in. Something that came out of a test tube
is going to have been transformed into the destructive forces of useful life.
Most teenagers start off with marijuana. Some of the boys smoke them. You know,
the ones with backbone. My girlfriend Ann and I went around with Bob. They both smoke pop.
That's jive talk for marijuana. So I tried it. Funny what it does to you. Everything speeds up
to a hundred miles an hour.
There was something intriguing and different when I came home high that night. You're real sharp and you laugh a lot.
You're the biggest person in the world. All you think about day and night is the radiance of sparkling colors.
And then you pass out, but when you wake up it starts all over again. And that's the story.
Unbelievable, isn't it? Chemistry takes a hand in such commonplace things as dope traffic in the United States.
It's certainly true that the increased use of narcotics is a thing of the past.
It's a thing of beauty. Carrying off the harmful fumes from other chemical processes,
there's always the gentle dew, which cover the surface with a film of gritty scratching particles.
It feels like your skin is being torn right off you. It does.
Some young man may develop startling, stupid, ghastly, tragic, hidden secrets of nature.
The pioneer of tomorrow.
That's another mandatory.
They're all laughing like lunatics, demons and stuff.
I call this radio show because I'm baked.
I'm baked.
You are the inescapable result.
Of your life.
Of your tragedy.
Just as I am the inescapable result.
Of you.
Of you. Of you. Of you.
Marijuana. Marijuana.
You know what I'm talking about.
About um, marijuana.
Yeah, um, so the, this.
Marijuana. Marijuana as scientists smoking it.
Uh, um, in, in, in, of a, uh, uh, the government.
And, um, and, uh.
Why?
Um, the, the, on marijuana, on marijuana.
Um, it, uh, has, uh, has an refrain.
It's, uh, on your, uh, well, uh, the, the.
that marijuana, but it's almost important.
And so marijuana can now go crazy.
Stop, stop, my mind is going off.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
I know it's making me self-conscious.
I know, it's kind of wild.
It's making me sick.
It's kind of...
But you love the sick.
Bonesome cowboy Dave.
You want the sick.
Oh.
You need the sick.
Because they give me the medicine when I'm sick.
The medicine, you know, man.
It's all medicine, Stang.
Haven't we told you this numerous times through the cyber codes,
through the allubrium that stretches deep into your muscles?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I love the pudding so much.
It's like it's worth waiting for the bats on the hillside.
It's worth the face raping.
It's worth having that bat poison pump down my goozle.
It's worth the colloquiality now.
There'll be facts now.
There'll be no good.
I'll fight you with your old horse, Eagle.
Can I be excused now?
I refuse to leave this earth and leave it in a...
Oh, wait.
You're disgusting.
I just have to go back.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.




Oh.










Oh.
Oh.







Oh, I hear them.
It's so smooth and unwrinkled in Dave's case.
It's like a sheet of pudding without the curge on top.
Or is that the...
Oh, yeah, that's the shmegma pipe.
Watch as we slice down.
Watch on the webcam as we slice down.
to Dave's brain.
It's like butter.
It's so soft and yielding.
It just peels right open.
The moons of Jupiter,
they just slide so...
And it's as if there's nothing inside,
just this goo.
You know, this is not an intelligent
or refractory lubrication machine
if you'd like to pipe up your organs.
This is me, and this is you, baby.
This is a perversion of every natural law.
And what is time travel?
But your pathetic attempt
to control the world around you,
your futile effort
to have a question answered.
You think I don't know you, Alexander?
I can look inside your memories,
your nightmares,
your dreams.
You're a man haunted
by those two most terrible words.
What?
What?

Mr. Dulles?
What is it, Jimmy?
I'm busy.
Yes, sir, I know.
Only it's Sheriff Gillis,
and he says he needs to talk to you.
He says he needs to talk to me.
The truth is,
he's in pursuit of an immodest amount
of that curious weed
which you and your school chums
seem to find so fascinating.
Dulles?
Dulles?

I just wanted your professional opinion
about a hunch I got.
A hunch?
Something just keeps going around in my head.
Forgive my preoccupation.
I replaced missing eyeballs with sawdust
and glued the lids together.
I've used bent aluminum combs for dentures.
I've used the back part of the scalp
when there was no front part.
Then I folded one hand over watered-up newspapers
when the other hand had no fingers.
You find all this, Mr. Dulles,
is obscene?
Do you know what is really obscene?
Look at this.
Look at the work I've done.
This is an art.
And I am the artist.
Music
One more time, I take it from the top
Say you never let me stop, stop, stop
One more hit, just a little pop
To get me on my way until I drop, drop, drop
Music
Can't come down, gotta be high
Say you never let me die, die, die
One more time, but just a little try
You know how much I love you when I'm high, high, high
Music
Well, I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye
Listen to the music on my high, high, high
Music
Can't come down
gotta stay high
Can't come together, but we try, try, try
One more night
a feeling so good I've
gotta keep a pop until I die, die, die
Music
Can't come down
gotta stay high
What ll I do without my high, high, high?
Life's too fast
I need a lot of slack
Gotta get the piggies off my back, back, back
Music
I can be sweet but I'm better when I'm bad
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye
And listen to the music on my high, high, high
On my high, high, high
On my high, high, high
You can see Yeti video in Yahoo Group's Friends for more from the bishop
And now, friends, retardation from Lemuria, Puzzling Evidence, and Dr. Philo Drummond
I'm hot and heat with a look at the creative and different ways to say 80
The western's conditions are so dreadful these days
Expect highs at just about all the lower elevation in the high country
But I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that
Heck!
You know, because that's where it's going to be in the future
The 420 will be 500
You know, I brought a banana, but I can't find it
I lost it somewhere and I'm hungry now
The show is just going on and on and my hunger is
One of the best things to do for your brain
Really?
The show is, yeah, I know
If you listen to the show, you are smarter by 23.5%
I like to do good things for my brain
I like to give my brain
I'm wearing a good massage
Are you a break thinker?
One of those Chiatsu massages
Just open up my skull
Yeah
And start kneading the gray matter
Uh-huh
Sort of a self-trepanator, right?
Yeah
I don't use any fancy cutting tools
Yeah, none of those sharpened pieces of jade
I hear somebody's cell phone making that weird buzz it does
Yeah, you know who that is?
That's my breathing
Hear it?
That's my ear tube
Oh, that's the government listening to this show
And all the other shows on KPTV
Are you still in that iron lung?
Um, I've upgraded to the new plastic lung
Oh, okay
One of those new fangled things
Now friends, this church of the subgenius, this story of Bob
It could be the greatest joke ever told
But if
But if
And only if
And only if Earth can make it to the punchline
And we can do that, friends, if you will use your own
Your own hate
You, actually, you don't have to use anything of yours
As Dr. Legume said, use their hate and their fear
Pump up your mutant abnormality
Flaunt your weirdness and wag it in their slack-jawed, uncomprehending faces
That will do more than your vote
Wag your weirdness right there in public, friends
As Saint Hendrick said, let your freak flag
Wave your freak flag high
Freedom, freedom, kindly loving you
Be absolutely free
Only if you want to be
There's no reason why you do it
And nothing stays long
I won't forget you
I won't forget you
Forget you
And it'll keep me young
You never realize
The way we came together
And it's now
What I've done
I'm nothing


Yeah, that's all







Ah, look where I ended up
I was frank


I've wanted to
You see yourself being turned and see yourself next to a soldier being cut down.
You ride on a scene as where everything is beautiful, lush green, brighter than day.
And like you see a completely crystal scene of a soldier being shot down.
And also you feel yourself helping that soldier up, but not his uniform, but you're feeling yourself
held in another vibe, another sense of that soldier.
It seems like a soul of him, you know, you're helping him up.
And then you whisk back to the waterhole.
I can still recall my first guitar.
A Futurama with a tremolo bar.
I tried to play like Jimmy with my teeth.
The dentist went and saw and said good grief.
I can still recall my first guitar.

So when it is nearing Christmas, the present I always wish for is Jimmy Hendrix Stratt.
Oh, when he played it was a crazy sound.
He played his bloody guitar upside down.
I wouldn't have seen him play the Isle of Wight.
I wouldn't have seen him play the Isle of Wight.
Or Joan of Arc.
All right.
Who would it be anyway?
I can only remember my first instrument.
The이나 by Andre Pадиć








in order to say something very Bankers' sense.
Someone like Thatcher and Have self-ixoom.
Then, just a little...
I'm sure Justacher is one of those is very much around


Thank you.
Thank you.
And friends, that was Captain Sensible with Jimi Hendrix's Strat and some excerpts from Rainbow Bridge and so forth by Hendrix himself and some preaching from Austin.
All put together that last segment there by Potare Nostril.
And remember, friends, www.subgenius.com.
Um.
Dobbs became the first, the first, my friend, to address Bob Post Office Box 204206 Austin, Texas 78720.
It's not, it's dumb.
It's not intelligent.
And they kind of pass off that stupidity as intelligent.
That's Bob.
P.O. Box 204206 Austin, Texas 78720.
Uh, uh, uh, where she has a three and a half year old toddler who's already been told to hate Bob.
And to basically kill him.
Bob.
Jim, thanks for the call.
You know, uh, it's funny because I called in, uh.
About, uh, I don't know, 50 years ago and tried to get ahold of Dr. Trishberger because I guess there was some other doctor who was, um.
Good.
Possibly getting somebody for me to talk to.
An official declaration of war against Bob.
Shock and horror lingered.
And there goes the torch parade.
What sort of goings on is that anyway?
Some sort of.
Rights for the temple of vampires.
Jack, you mean to sit there and say all that gang was vampires?
How do I know?
At least they seem to be priests of the temple.
Yeah.
Rogues and torches and stuff.
