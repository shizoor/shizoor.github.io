1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Sire, there is no more money.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,780
We gotta get some money.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,940
That dirty purgish harker, that flacky whore.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,920
You people think we just improvise the stuff from the keyboard and stuff.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,960
But no, we have to rehearse this stuff all week long.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:25,720
And we have to ride this bicycle treadmill that runs the electric generators that make the power spew out over the airwaves out into the invisible air.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,540
Where your ears pick up the rare material and strange music that this station plays.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,940
Such as the Hour of Slash.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,840
Stuck in an availability room somewhere deep beneath the surface of the earth.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,960
The Reverend Ivan Stang, made of pure cream cheese and three pieces of toilet paper,

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:55,520
has rebuilt his entire personality from a foam-like mug distributed by the Church of the Subgenius through WCSB.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,100
I can't help as much as I can and it's just not getting out of the underground.

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:07,180
Welcome to the Hour of Nothing.

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:08,780
Slash.

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,340
Slash.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,940
We had such a good cue there, I thought maybe you could use it.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,460
No, I don't care about, I don't care about creative cues.

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,180
I care about the station money for their station.

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,620
There's only one thing that matters.

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,060
That matters between birth and death and that's donating to this station to keep it on.

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,220
This station will be hauled off dead in a casket tomorrow if they can't pay their electrical bills.

22
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:44,740
And come on to the cowboy day, we'll have to quit writing those scripts because no one will be able to pay him $75,000 a year to do this show.

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,120
It costs money to do these kinds of elaborate productions, friends.

24
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,800
But friends, it's not real money.

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,700
It's the kind of money that you need to make your life twirl around like a little...

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,340
Twinkie stick.

27
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,120
It's the kind of money they give you in outer space.

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,540
The kind of money from deep, deep in the cosmos.

29
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,340
It's not paper money.

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Nothing as flaccid and tricky.

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,740
Nothing as...

32
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:15,100
No, we're talking psychotronic subphonic money.

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,820
The kind that'll bring you a long-sleeved shirt.

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,820
Sire, there is no more money.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,280
We gotta get some money.

36
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,460
That dirty purgatory...

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,300


38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,600
That...

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,440
They're here.

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,440
A minute.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,660
It's showtime.

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,560
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,140
The show that dare not even exist.

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,600
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime.

45
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,120
It's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky, kooky, fun.

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,600
It's the subgenius hour.

47
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:55,840
It's the subgenius hour.

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,260
Watch.

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,640
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,520
Faster signal goes up.

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,180
We're at the satellite.

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,980
We're pumping out all over the world.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,580
Pretty fancy, huh?

54
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,860
Not too big a rhythm to sound.

55
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,640
You're buying time.

56
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,520
Time, friends.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,500
Because Mr. Moneybags, he's paying a salary.

58
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,500
Salary.

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,860
He throws in a hundred bucks a week, and consequently,

60
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,660
I can't preach against drinking because his icebox is full of beer.

61
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,780
I hope he's talking about you, my friend.

62
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,080
Pay us not to preach about beer.

63
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,400
I can't preach against cigarettes because they all smoke.

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,700
For me.

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,260
I have to let them out for 15 minutes between Sunday school and worship service

66
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,400
so they can go out and light up a Chesterfield or something or the other.

67
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,560
And what kind did Jesus smoke, friends?

68
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,520
It's time to open your heart, close your mind, unzip your lips, and bend over

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,740
because you're about to receive the word...

70
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,420
Here to Bob.

71
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,960
And pull out that wallet, friends, because it is pledge drive time.

72
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,400
Praise Bob.

73
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,560
It's either the last pledge drive for a while or the last hour of slack.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,180
This could be your last chance, folks.

75
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,320
I thought you boys understood.

76
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,400
It's business.

77
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,440
That's all it is.

78
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,900
You still don't get it, do you, boys?

79
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,100
There ain't no countries anymore.

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,520
No more good guys.

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,220
They're running the whole show.

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,520
They own everything.

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
The whole damn planet.

84
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
They can do whatever they want.

85
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,440
What's wrong with having a good for a change?

86
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,820
And they're going to let us have a good if we just help them.

87
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,140
They're going to leave us alone.

88
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,440
Let's make some money.

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,220
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
Now, I know you want it.

91
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,580
Hell, everybody does.

92
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,940
He's going to make a million dollars.

93
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,680
Ah, yes, dear friends.

95
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,600
It is, in fact, pledge drive.

96
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,320
Lifetime.

97
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:04,820
And that number for you and everyone else you know to call is in Cleveland.

98
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,540
Yes, it's 6900.

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,140
And you can remember that because it has a 69 in it.

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,400
That's a secret number.

101
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,840
It means that's like when two little rabbits get into each other's rabbit holes.

102
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,520
And friends, this station referred to herein.

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:24,720
Here.

104
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,040
Hereafter as this station.

105
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,600
Can, in fact, and must be reached at this station.

106
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,120
And I know you want to make us look good.

107
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,120
I know you want to help us look good in the eyes of this station.

108
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,880
You know, it's a student station.

109
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,780
I'm not exactly a student.

110
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,000
Friends, it's so you know what you must do.

111
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,720
You must help.

112
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,180
Friends, if you are listening from Sweden, if you are listening from China,

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,100
if you are listening from Japan,

114
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,080
if you are listening from Iraq,

115
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:04,840
send that money in to this station and put it to the name of our of Slack.

116
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,500
Because if you know, friends, if we don't start getting some of those calls coming in,

117
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,340
I'm going to be forced to go back to my old pledge drive tapes.

118
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,360
And in fact, I'm going to do that right this very moment.

119
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,920
You're going to make a million dollars.

120
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,320
I dear friends.

121
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:34,160
This is your this is your dear pastor, Reverend Ivan Stang, calling out to you from the depths of my heart.

122
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,460
And I can I can see so many of you sitting there hovering by your phones.

123
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,020
Wait. Now the phones are ringing here.

124
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,940
We're doing great.

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,260
This time we got all the beautiful girls, the the mighty studliest of genius ministers sitting here waiting to catch your call.

126
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,920
They're all busy.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But if you get a busy signal, just call back again, because we sure ain't going to turn down a bit of your money.

128
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,340
Dear friends, you know that that's one thing you can always trust a Bob.

129
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,920
Listen to those things going off in the background.

130
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,800
And so for all I know, maybe these.

131
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,520
Oh, yes.

132
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,700
Oh, we got this is one of the callers that wanted to meet Reverend Stang at a cheap motel.

133
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,900
That comes with a two hundred dollar pledge.

134
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,220
Sire, there is no more money.

135
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,700
We got to get some money.

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,820
That dirty Turkish hardback.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,480
What?

138
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,820
Gordon Black and Beckham.

139
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,720
Can make it.

140
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,240
Ha.

141
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:25,740
Wow.

142
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,880
Wild, wild Dave is here.

143
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:37,400
That where can you get an argument like that, especially when your head is square, your pocketbook is elongated and yet your listening pleasure is far from more orgiastic.

144
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,760
If you were like in the physics or geometry and stuff just for the pure radiation sickness of it, you know what I mean?

145
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,560
Just the slamming and banging of the animals as they pledge themselves to oblivion.

146
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,120
Friends, your animals, too.

147
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,680
Just like.

148
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,240
Yes.

149
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,920
You need sustenance just like the station does.

150
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,260
The station is an animal.

151
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,820
It's a shuffling beast.

152
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,100
This monkey doesn't survive on peanuts.

153
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,120
Pennsylvania.

154
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,500
Towards Bethlehem, PA.

155
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,120
No, this station doesn't.

156
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,300
There's not a monkey and does not survive on peanuts.

157
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
It will not be your big bad bitch.

158
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,360
It must.

159
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,540
If it is to.

160
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,400
What is it?

161
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,180
Survive.

162
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,640
Survive.

163
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,220
That's right.

164
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,240
It's like the more prevail.

165
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,320
Prevail to even prosper.

166
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,060
Because you could just survive like island of Dock.

167
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,320
Tomorrow.

168
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,280
But you want to prosper.

169
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,040
Yeah.

170
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,320
I mean, you want to live it up, baby.

171
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,760
You want to be able to dial ear any time, night or day and go, okay, that's my, that's my soul.

172
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,940
You know, that's my thing.

173
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:44,480
Well, you know, it could be that someday they could dial your 90 and there'd still be a station here, but it wouldn't be what they were expecting.

174
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:54,000
It'd be Rush Limbaugh, the 18th version of his daily show, followed by Hannity discussing what Rush said, followed by what's his name?

175
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:03,780
Peg, Peg, Peg, like wouldn't never followed by dead silence as an EMP shuts off all electronic machines in the North American continent.

176
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:12,260
As the, as the emergency medical system transpires across all the way from the Canadian Arctic, all the way down to Hexico is the whole planet shuts down.

177
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,260
You can hear the doors slamming.

178
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,720
Are you going to let that happen?

179
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,200
Or are you going to call the doors?

180
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,360
Station, baby.

181
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,920
Bathby, baby.

182
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,980
For 50.

183
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,940
Well, I guess they're not.

184
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,480
Okay.

185
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:35,660
I'm just going to go right back to, uh, I mean, this, when this show ends, if you haven't helped the station, what you know, as reality is going to come to a crashing halt.

186
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,080
See what I mean?

187
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:47,020
We were playing that cheery music cause we wanted to be positive, but you know, frankly, friends, positive thinking can kill you.

188
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,580
Uh, look where positive thinking has gotten most of the world.

189
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,460
So far, people say it.

190
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:53,980
Oh, Reverend.

191
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,400
I'm staying.

192
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:02,160
He's a pessimistic booger, but frankly, I'm worried that my most pessimistic predictions might turn out to have been in the long run.

193
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,040
Idiotically optimistic.

194
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:14,560
And our fear tonight is that you out there taping this show will think, we'll think, oh, well, uh, well, they'll stay on the air or not.

195
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,360
Whether I give or not.

196
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,960
But folks, if you don't pledge, the world will literally, will literally come to an end.

197
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,420
At the end of this hour, if you, and I don't mean just some of you, I mean you, the one listening right now.

198
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,720
Oh, you're laughing.

199
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,700
You're laughing.

200
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,820
It's going to collapse around your pathetic ears.

201
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,060
But you nihilistic teenagers out there.

202
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,320
Oh, no future, man.

203
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,900
No future.

204
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:45,560
You know, that's why if the rival cult that wants these airwaves had this hour, they'd erase 10,000 bucks by now.

205
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,600
And you know what they do with it?

206
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,020
They build concentration camps for the likes of you.

207
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,400
You abnormal.

208
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,880
You, you punk.

209
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,980
You old hippie.

210
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,100
You, you humanist.

211
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,460
You subgenius.

212
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,200
So friends, you know, the money isn't just for the hour of slack.

213
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,680
It's for the totality that is this station.

214
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,660
It isn't just for us mutants.

215
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
It's for your very mind, your very soul.

216
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,740
And you wouldn't believe how close your soul is to being sold out.

217
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,000
Dear brother or sister, between your job and the drugs and the lies.

218
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,800
Listen, you need every bit of slack.

219
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,780
You can hang on to.

220
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,420
But we have a special form of slack in store for you tonight.

221
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,480
Not stored in souls anywhere, folks.

222
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,560
And the type of slack you're going to be getting is guilt.

223
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,680
Guilt.

224
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
Tonight we're going to whip us up some guilt.

225
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,600
And some of you are saying, oh, it's pledge time.

226
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,260
Reverend Stang's going to rant all night about money.

227
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,240
And you'd better be afraid that that's true.

228
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,620
Little Bobby, little gimme Bob out there.

229
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,600
At this level, our salesman can see the top of the ladder.

230
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,780
And as well on his way out.

231
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:53,960
I'll tell you that.

232
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:04,060
Hey, praise Dr. Dark, who pledged $19.98.

233
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,180
$19.98?

234
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,140
No, $1,998.

235
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,160
That's a new unreasonable record.

236
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,120
How can we top that from one collard?

237
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:19,800
Green.

238
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,980
Here's how we can top it.

239
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,840
When we get one from Australia.

240
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,020
That's who just topped it.

241
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:34,780
The Reverend Chainsmurker, listening by internet, called all the way in from that distant climb.

242
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,740
That wombat ridden land.

243
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,520
That wombat.

244
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,600
You could hear kangaroos in the background.

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,640
The sheilas and the roos are all humping together and rutting on the barbie of the shrimp.

246
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,060
Yes.

247
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,100
All of that.

248
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,960
And friend, how come it is that we're getting calls from the internet?

249
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:51,960


250
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,360
From as so far away as Australia and Cleveland.

251
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,980
And yet we haven't heard from you.

252
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
We haven't heard from you, my friend.

253
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,080
You're our only friend that we haven't heard from.

254
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,740
Is it a moonless night, friend?

255
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,680
Is the wildebeest crying in your left ear, making you want to go things to your mucilaginous passages you've never done?

256
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,620
Forget about that stance.

257
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,820
That stay at home, hate the ether way of thinking.

258
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,680
Get out there and pledge your numbers.

259
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,560
You gotta do something and those numbers are.

260
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,740
No less.

261
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,260
Yes.

262
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,600
It's nowhere.

263
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,440
Sixty nine hundred.

264
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,620
Six nine zero zero.

265
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,080
That's sixty nine hundred.

266
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,580
I hope you understand the significance of that pronunciation.

267
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,280
If you spell it the nuclear way.

268
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,560
Dave here has a pronounced speech impediment.

269
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,500
It's not an impediment.

270
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,800
Well, some not very well pronounced.

271
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,760
It's a highly stifling way of expressing myself.

272
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,540
Hey.

273
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,380
And you could be on the radio too, just like us, if you could just bribe us with those pledges, friends.

274
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:57,720
That's true.

275
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,240
We might even let the numbers of the, what, the evacuation numbers?

276
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,740
Have you noticed that we read your number out on the air?

277
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,960
We give your home address?

278
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
Well, no, not that.

279
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,940
But certainly your church name.

280
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,960
Your social security number.

281
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,660
Yeah.

282
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,940
Your entire church name.

283
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,760
And don't you want to talk to Princess We in person?

284
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,300
This is not a recording.

285
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,860
I mean, if you talk to Dave or me, we're just recordings.

286
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,820
She's real.

287
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,880
And that's, and when you call her, you not only get to pledge your monies, your hard-earned

288
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,140
scrids to a baseball cap for 25 premiums.

289
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,240
I mean, you know, people talk about local alternative and college radio stations as

290
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,820
if we had some hidden treasure here in smallburg, peppy town, USA, you know?

291
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,140
But isn't it true?

292
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,240
You're it, Dave.

293
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,780
You're it.

294
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,200
Oh, no.

295
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,320
They're it.

296
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,580
Are we it?

297
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:42,920
No.

298
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,540
They're it.

299
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,700
The vast listeners, some of them are a little bit too heavy.

300
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,780
I need to cut down on that food a little bit, but...

301
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,240
That means you're it until you call in to this station.

302
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:09,520
The Radio Thon 2005 begins on noon Sunday, November the 6th and ends on noon Sunday,

303
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,300
November 13th.

304
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,020
On Friday, there'll be a special opening.

305
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,780
An opening?

306
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,780
You like openings, don't you?

307
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,440
Yes, orifices everywhere.

308
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,080
Creases?

309
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,380
Dents, grooves, like the convolutions in your...

310
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,460
Yeah, the dents.

311
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:45,260
How often do we recognize the importance of dents as sexual appurtenances or a sexual...

312
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,200
There is an aspect.

313
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,760
A sexual...

314
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,860
There is an actual aspect to the dent, just as there is an opposing one to the bump.

315
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,820
And you can learn more if you call and talk to the actual queen of all the UFOs at this

316
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,200
station.

317
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,980
That's the only way for us to get your address so that we can send you the postcard that

318
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,720
reminds you to send the check to this station.

319
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
Because you can do that, friend.

320
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,960
You can do that if you're listening to this show by internet three weeks from this pledge

321
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,300
draft.

322
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,640
If you're listening to this show on one of our beloved other stations.

323
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:16,760
Yes, sir.

324
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,140
If you're listening to this show on one of our beloved other stations, such as WREK in

325
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,020
Atlanta or beloved...

326
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,060
Any of them.

327
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,920
You can still support your local hour of slack station.

328
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,640
You say to yourself, I listen on the internet.

329
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,820
I live out in Wyoming.

330
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,260
I live...

331
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,800
Lay that post office box back in...

332
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,660
However...

333
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,620
Send it.

334
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,440
Send it.

335
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,520
You've got that stamp.

336
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,300
You've got that pencil.

337
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,240
You've got that MP3 of this show.

338
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,340
Write that address down.

339
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,360
This station.

340
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:46,740
WREK.

341
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


342
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


343
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


344
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


345
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


346
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


347
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


348
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


349
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


350
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


351
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,740


352
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,520
There's only one Clevelandite who cares or knows anything.

353
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,960
All of our fans are from somewhere else.

354
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,100
That's why you, far away, have to send those trickles of surprise checks.

355
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,920
And you can always put some weird little extra clipping or statement in there.

356
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,940
A kissing mark on it.

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,160
Some random surrealism to confuse the nice volunteers here at the station that open your mail.

358
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,820
We've received some absurd objects that have no explanation.

359
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,740
So please, you know, it's better off with the tape.

360
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,140
Stained toilet paper going, ew.

361
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,240
Than looking at something for three days and having to call in a nuclear...

362
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,160
Well...

363
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,440
Just do it.

364
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:23,960
Nuclear.

365
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,440
And remember, friends, these pledge-a-thons are like radio wars.

366
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,820
They seep down into the consciousness of the average citizen and make him not want to pledge.

367
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:40,560
But if you want to fight back against constipation, radio broadcasting, flaccid, placid, overweight,

368
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,780
understyled, incorrect...

369
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
Overly easily understood.

370
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,720
Overly easily understood.

371
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,580
Easily overly, overly easily understood radio.

372
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,420
Unlike this show.

373
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,740
Connect in now with...

374
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,200
And say, I'll do virtually anything.

375
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,300
Do it.

376
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,040
And especially to piddle your exogenous zones.

377
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,000
If you'd like to taunt to the lovely princess we are...

378
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,400
Can't you taunt to her?

379
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,560
You're going to get more than an exogenous experience.

380
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,420
You're going to get an...

381
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,320
You're going to get an awakening.

382
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,720
That's going to thrill your sphincter and your face.

383
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
And your family's collective sphincters.

384
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,060
For thousands and thousands of years.

385
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,640
And I'm not exaggerating either, am I?

386
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm...

387
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm...

388
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,460
No, Dave.

389
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm probably exaggerating a little bit.

390
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,660
You can't exaggerate.

391
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:26,960
No.

392
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,020
There's no way of exaggerating the importance.

393
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:29,900
Look.

394
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,560
We...

395
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,660
If you pledge now, you'll invest dollars.

396
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,460
We'll send you a hoodie.

397
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,740
Now, we all know that that means it's like a really cool sweatshirt.

398
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,420
But in your sick imagination, you could probably make it seem like some hoodlum was going to

399
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,920
come to your house, bark down your cattle, cause cerebral damage to your grandparents,

400
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,320
and blame it on somebody else.

401
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,080
Or kill me.

402
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,760
Or kill me.

403
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,740
Or you could kill Bob.

404
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,820
Yeah, you could.

405
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,200
You could just do that instead of calling this station.

406
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,600
Then just at least...

407
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:02,900
Look.

408
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,680
Even if you're lying, even if you're one of those hypocrites who just wants to talk to

409
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,880
Princess Wee and have her take your number down, go to a bunch of work, and have some

410
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,860
other volunteer send you the postcard reminding you, even though you have no intention of ever

411
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,400
actually calling.

412
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,660
You're not really paying.

413
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,960
Go ahead and call anyway.

414
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Cause who knows?

415
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,680
You may decide that some...

416
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,640
Maybe suddenly you'll get a conscience.

417
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,800
Okay, Officer Stain, could you please step aside?

418
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,240
We have enough of the hard cop.

419
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,280
Bob, you wanna come over here and tell them what they'll get?

420
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,760
I'm afraid nobody wants to do Bob.

421
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,660
And Bob doesn't wanna come over here.

422
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,360
He's just looking at us now with a weird glare, so I'm gonna shut up.

423
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,220
There are people who want to do Bob, and those are the people you should really avoid.

424
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,320
I don't want to imitate him in his presence, and if he doesn't wanna talk, then...

425
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,680
But okay.

426
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,240
Never.

427
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,020
He hardly ever does.

428
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,020
And when he does, it usually is some message about Mars needs women.

429
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,880
He's stuck on that Mars and women thing.

430
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,480
And he'll go back there.

431
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,360
Venus doesn't need women.

432
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,980
It's got all the women it needs.

433
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,560
Venus is practically nothing but women.

434
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,360
It is a woman.

435
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,920
So wise up, man.

436
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,040
What are you gonna be?

437
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,780
Mars?

438
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,600
A Martian?

439
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,480
A Venusian?

440
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,520
Or an Earthman?

441
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,380
Or a God-listener who calls in with that pledge right now?

442
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,440
It's just a pledge.

443
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,300
It's just a promise.

444
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,880
That's all.

445
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,540
What are you gonna do when it starts raining and you wanna be the hippest encumbrance on your whole gulf?

446
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,460
And you're just dry.

447
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,900
You're just a dried up old raisin of a person.

448
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,060
You're gonna need an umbrella to keep out the sunshine once the sun goes nova.

449
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,700
You're not an ombuscus nebuscus.

450
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,420
What more can we...

451
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,340
I mean, it all adds up.

452
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,300
It comes to that great fruition, that conclusion.

453
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
Everything points to that number.

454
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,060
And your pledge to that self-same number at this station.

455
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,900
The synchronicity is so vast.

456
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,700
It emodes your eyes as soft as part of your nose.

457
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,580
Ha ha ha.

458
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,400
Six, eight, seven.

459
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,540
A neonesis.

460
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,840
Hundred.

461
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,860
Okay.

462
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm gonna give them no more chance and we'll just play this.

463
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,080
I'm gonna call the same policeman that I was trying to get in and go out and arrest some of these slackers.

464
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,540
And I say with a small L in the background.

465
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:23,900
Right.

466
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,020
The small S for slacker.

467
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,100
These aren't real slackers.

468
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,760
And have them brought down here and give me $40.

469
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:38,860
And I promised to pledge $20 for a white or black logo shirt and then use the rest of it to buy a beer.

470
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,340
I mean, it's like you get...

471
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,680
And it's tax exempt.

472
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,440
You're tax unripe-able.

473
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,500
Just think about it.

474
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,320
You can write...

475
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,420
You can currently...

476
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,680
Let's not get into any...

477
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,300
You can crunt.

478
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,200
You can crunt.

479
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,780
Man.

480
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,360
Don't you see, man?

481
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,320
You can crunt now.

482
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,300
These figures here and those figures there.

483
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,840
It knits and weaves stories you can't understand.

484
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,280
Unfortunately, if you don't have the imagination to supply that part, at least you will have supported this station.

485
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,780
Don't be a nitwit.

486
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,100
Listen, friends.

487
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,720
Go for it.

488
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,780
This station...

489
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,660
Is where to send that check if you're not hearing this live but on some insane playback later on.

490
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,840
Yeah.

491
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,260
Be a superhero, friends.

492
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,820
Be your own hero for once.

493
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,140
Can you imagine yourself careening down the slopes in one of those knit winter hats?

494
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,900
You're cruising down those...

495
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
You're slaloming.

496
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,340
You're shushing.

497
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:37,840
You're shushing.

498
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,160
Yeah, that's right.

499
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,780
You're shushing.

500
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,560
And suddenly you realize...

501
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Real...

502
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,040
Excuse me.

503
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,540
Suddenly you realize you're shushing down the cliffs of Garfield Heights.

504
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,820
You're not in New York State.

505
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,360
You're in Gotham City itself.

506
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,200
Yeah, right.

507
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,800
No, no, no.

508
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,020
You're Batman.

509
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,980
You pledged.

510
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,580
You paid.

511
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,220
You sent the money in and now you feel good.

512
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,900
You're good.

513
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,080
You're a butt more.

514
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,300
I feel bad.

515
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,840
You're a butt more, all right.

516
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,460
You're built for this job.

517
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,080
That's right.

518
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,800
You can see thousands of miles in the future.

519
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,680
And in the pasture, you can see things others cannot see.

520
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
And you see in your future...

521
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,900
Future...

522
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,640
Future...

523
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,380
A $30 lodge!

524
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:26,120
In the year 1998, the men from Planet X shall descend on this earth in power and glory to

525
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:34,460
lift up those dues-paying subgeniuses who went to subgenius.com and did the right thing.

526
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,740
Yes, the right thing.

527
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,920
What will they be wearing?

528
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,120
What will they be wearing?

529
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,380
Yes.

530
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,480
They were going into that deep, deep, deep pit in their body, that dent in which they

531
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,600
found, yes, the most secret, intimate organ of their body, the wallet.

532
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:55,060
And they extracted it and they pulled from it those dollars that they then rubbed upon

533
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,560
themselves.

534
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,000
And then they blessed it against a picture of Bob.

535
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,620
And then they put it against a picture of their mom and their dad.

536
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,540
And then they put it in the mail.

537
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,800
And then they sent it to the station.

538
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:18,320
That subgenius tongues might air wag and ne'er want for extra pizza at the station staff

539
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,820
meetings.

540
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:24,200
Friends, when you donate to this station, you're not just helping us improve our equipment,

541
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,160
stay on the air, make a better signal.

542
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,940
You're helping to pay for the pizza that makes the station staff meetings bearable.

543
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,900
Some of these people actually stay alive on the stale pizza that they eat.

544
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:36,900


545
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:36,900


546
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,540
And after the station meetings, don't you understand how shoestring these thumbs are

547
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,580
and these little, these budgets are that takes to bring you this, that takes to bring you

548
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,520
this great entertainment here on this station.

549
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,960
And now this.

550
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,500
All right, I'm on.

551
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:50,640
All right.

552
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,460
All right, good old boys are here tonight.

553
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,980
We'd like to welcome you down to the television mission.

554
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,160
Don't forget, if all you can do is sit at home, then try to keep yourselves awake and dial

555
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,480
the phone.

556
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,260
Do it.

557
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,640
Call it for pleasure.

558
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,860
Yes, answer the phones this evening.

559
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,940
Beautiful doctors say far and beautiful reverend.

560
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,400
I love this number that you see on your screen with a contribution to the television mission,

561
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,940
a revolting.

562
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,060
Genetic accident.

563
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,620
Yes, Dave, you disgusting creature.

564
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,380
Think of it, Sting.

565
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,480
Even Fireside Theater endorses your church.

566
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,580
Sorry, I had to use that word.

567
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,800
But little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?

568
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,060
Listen, you little listeners whistling in the glistening mist.

569
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,240
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Lies,

570
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,240
Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, Verse 10, Ever.

571
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,260
The passage runs, and I quote,

572
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,440
If you be tired of it, if you've got that rundown feeling,

573
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,780
remember, you're not just anybody.

574
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,940
You're special.

575
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,020
You are living proof that God does not exist.

576
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,160
Yes, you, little listener, if you're like most of the people who listen to this show,

577
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,280
are proof that no supreme being could ever exist.

578
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,360
It's a duck hunt.

579
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,040
Uh, Hanson, please, don't, don't, don't start.

580
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,800
Please, please.

581
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,340
Yeah, I'm sorry.

582
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,600
I've got to start anyway.

583
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,580
I don't want to start, believe me.

584
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,540
Dear friends, I'm, I've got to admit, I'm just too depressed to do a, a good show.

585
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,020
Come on, get up off that chair.

586
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,180
Follow me.

587
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,680
Now you can have something to sell.

588
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,060
We all know we're in the art of selling.

589
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,600
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.

590
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,960
Right in your own home.

591
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,840
And you could call in.

592
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,440
You can talk to the, there's some sexy ministers on the, on the lines tonight.

593
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:59,200
Your prayer partners are here, uh, ready to receive your promise.

594
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,040
Your covenant with Bob, friends.

595
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:11,020
Why, the, uh, the evil, uh, Dr. Zafod here picked up, he got one from Joseph Prowl for 200 bucks.

596
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,140
And I, I happen to know that that one's not a joke.

597
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,640
Now I know that, you know, not everybody can, can, uh, can give that much.

598
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,120
You know?

599
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,240
You know?

600
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,180
You know, Dr. Drummond and I once talked about, you know, who means the most to Bob?

601
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:30,560
Is it the little old lady who can, who, you know, doesn't have anything at all to her name, but, but she donates a quarter, her last quarter?

602
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,200
Or does, or is Bob more impressed with the rich man who could give a million dollars but only gives 10,000?

603
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:46,120
We prayed on that, friends, and we realized that in Bob's eyes, that rich man is the only one that's going to get to heaven because he paid more money.

604
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,760
So I want you to call.

605
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,140
We got to sell you, friends.

606
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,280
We're not just going to sit here and talk.

607
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,460
Bob said we had to party.

608
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:53,920
Didn't he?

609
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,740
Didn't he?

610
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,620
He said we had to party.

611
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,380
He didn't say we could.

612
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,920
He said we had to.

613
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,960
And so, we must also sell.

614
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,120
Praise Bob and thank you.

615
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,540
Or they're destroyed.

616
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,460
When everybody sells.

617
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,160
We're all selling.

618
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,840
For we all have something to sell.

619
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Yes, everyone selling together, mighty symphony of prosperity.

620
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,920
For we all have something to sell.

621
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,860
And I'm going to feed the children of pure love what we're offering for kids and young people of every age.

622
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,040
I was so sad.

623
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,040


624
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,040


625
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,040


626
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,040


627
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,040


628
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,040


629
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,040


630
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,960
No more candyすごい clowns.

631
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,380
Every night, every night.

632
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,960
We were destined to make it right.

633
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,280
To be determined.

634
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,980
And this is our fate.

635
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,640
We're singing this song.

636
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,740
Singing this song.

637
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,920
So you can relate.

638
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,180
We are going to save the universe.

639
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,780
We are going to save the universe.

640
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,400
We are going to save the universe.

641
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,480
This time.

642
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:22,020
Friends, it looks like we might actually save the universe this time.

643
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,060
And only it's not really us saving it.

644
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,620
But these fine subgeniuses.

645
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,480
Wonderful, wonderful callers who have pledged.

646
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,340
These pledgers who have pledged in.

647
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,640
And callers such as Reverend Steve Sinek.

648
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,460
A faithful, faithful subgenius.

649
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,840
The one that we always depend on when we miss the recordings of the show.

650
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,140
He is the one who has them.

651
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,900
Thank you, Steve.

652
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,480
From far away in Chagrin Falls.

653
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,700
Chicken Falls.

654
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,600
Much to our chagrin that he's so far away.

655
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,560
And yet he can hear the show.

656
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,900
Down in the valley there.

657
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,540
And Chris Sazekas.

658
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,860
Or Sazekas.

659
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,140
Or whatever.

660
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,800
Sazekas.

661
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,200
Even here in Lakewood, Ohio.

662
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,320
So there are people locally who do care.

663
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,760
But the great Rex Oroboros.

664
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,640
Rex, thank you.

665
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,520
Has called in to help us.

666
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,280
From our brotherly sister station in Champaign, Illinois.

667
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,420
I can hear the corks popping now.

668
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,480
Oh, praise brother Oroboros.

669
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,100
He has reserved the Destroy All Monsters video, I'd notice.

670
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,980
There is no blame.

671
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,080
Oh, the great David Bauchner.

672
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,120
Thank you, David.

673
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,160
He is the David Bauchner in Toronto, Canada.

674
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:34,900
Genius man.

675
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,480
Isn't that nice?

676
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:35,920
Wonderful fellow.

677
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,760
Listeners in Toronto calling in.

678
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,060
David Bauchner did not just pledge.

679
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,700
David Bauchner put us on the internet.

680
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,760
You might say.

681
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,100
And kept us there for a long, long time.

682
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,820
And we still can't leave.

683
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,460
Scott points in Athens, Georgia.

684
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,920
Now, what kind of a show is this?

685
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,360
Did we get calls from so far, far away?

686
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,580
It may be Athens, Ohio, no?

687
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,500
No, it's Athens, Georgia.

688
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,860
I wish I was in the lamb and cotton.

689
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,920
And he's getting the Slovenian glasses.

690
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,600
And the hour of slack triple X.

691
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,960
That's a good choice.

692
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,980
And another one.

693
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,680
Here comes the lovely Miss Wee.

694
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,500
Princess Wee.

695
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:12,560
Princess Wee.

696
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,880
Wee is bringing another one.

697
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,940
Chris Turner.

698
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,540
The Reverend Ant.

699
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,760
Oh, that's Antichrist.

700
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,100
Reverend Antichrist.

701
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
A turnip cannot pledge.

702
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,640
That's not quite the same as Reverend Antichrist.

703
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,880
No, it's Antichrikes.

704
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,980
Antichrist.

705
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,680
Antichripes?

706
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,380
But Antichrist.

707
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,540
To Mobile, Alabama.

708
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,020
A survivor.

709
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,720
I wish I was in the lamb and cotton again.

710
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,160
A survivor of the terror of Hurricane Ivan.

711
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,980
Oh.

712
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,460
And Her Highness Helen.

713
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:42,540


714
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:42,540


715
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:42,540


716
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:42,540


717
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:42,640
Hell no.

718
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,400
In lovely Lakewood, Ohio.

719
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,980
Another Lechner.

720
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,880
I mean, Lechner.

721
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,600
Her Highness, hell no.

722
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,100
The creator of the Bobby Awards almost every year.

723
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,480
Did I mention John Visnavkas?

724
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,820
No, you did.

725
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,720
Or Vinalkas.

726
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,220
Thank you, John.

727
00:31:59,300 --> 00:31:59,640
Vinalkas.

728
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,900
But we love you, John.

729
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,100
Yes, Bob is a...

730
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,520
This is a religion of love.

731
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,440
Stang has a heart with names.

732
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,720
So just imagine he has read them and pronounced them anonymously.

733
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:12,540
Right.

734
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,540


735
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,540


736
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,540


737
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,540


738
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,540


739
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,540


740
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,540


741
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,800
Too late for the anonymous one.

742
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,620
Anyway, thank you, anonymous, again and again.

743
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,540
Thank you, all of you who were and shall ever be monotonous.

744
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,180
Montonomous Bay.

745
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,760
You don't have to be monogamous or a baseball cap wearing,

746
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,920
winter knit hat wearing,

747
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,900
No, it helps.

748
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,700
aficionado of music and diverse talk in spunky rhythms

749
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,480
of strange ideas and beautiful searches into the past.

750
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,960
Like when we go tripping down Mamory Lane.

751
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,300
Oh, yes.

752
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,280
There are lots of jugs.

753
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,420
I talked to a listener.

754
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,120
There's a listener in Detroit who thinks you're real smart.

755
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,020
Remember that?

756
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,860
We met that guy.

757
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,800
We met this guy that said that he thought you were real smart.

758
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,620
He gave us all those Firesign Theater albums.

759
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,200
That man was himself extremely brain damaged.

760
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,600
He gave us each copies of all the Firesign Theater albums on CB.

761
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,160
And only 72% of mine actually worked.

762
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,760
Oh, really?

763
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,420
Yes.

764
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,180
Well, I hadn't even tried to play...

765
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,360
Oh, I played as many as I could.

766
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,300
Oh, yes.

767
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,420
Then someone said...

768
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,920
Oh, we're all bojos.

769
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,040
Well, you know, the CD technology is crude.

770
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,200
Mine is, yes.

771
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,620
And yours, of course, is even cruder.

772
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,540
And then there's your ears.

773
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,620
And then there's the stuff in between your two ears.

774
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,080
And there's what comes out of my mouth, which is also crude.

775
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,340
But not as crude as the sweet crude we're pushing, ladies and Germans.

776
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,060
Bubbly.

777
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,440
And crude.

778
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:52,820
If Eichmann were a vastly vaster man, if Adolf Hitler did all he can, we still wouldn't hate you as much as we hate ourselves.

779
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,840
For you not pledging...

780
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,200
What the hell?

781
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,880
Let's just go...

782
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,420
As Puzzling Evidence once said...

783
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,300
Let's get the flop.

784
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,960
Let's frop up so we can get back to hating the conspiracy instead of ourselves.

785
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,700
Yeah.

786
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,480
Puzzling Evidence said that.

787
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,700
About frop.

788
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,560
Oh, I thought about 40 times.

789
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,560
How's your frop, Epil?

790
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,940
Yeah.

791
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,460
I thought about 40 times.

792
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,560
Well, what's...

793
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,960
There's no...

794
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,960
They can't get any habsopsia from sepulis if they pledge to this or any other...

795
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,240
No, I wish.

796
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:29,340
But that's an imported herb that's pretty expensive from Tibet.

797
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,540
Now, Buddhist llamas, or is it just the alpacas?

798
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,940
Any of these different animals, how do they ingest it?

799
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,960
With their teeth?

800
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,500
No, that's not the way it works.

801
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,900
The llamas...

802
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,300
Holy men type.

803
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,020
Tibetan llamas that are...

804
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,000
Well, you claim to be a holy...

805
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,560
You know, what...

806
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:54,320
The frop only grows on the graves or droppings of those holy men or on the graves or droppings

807
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,300
of the Himalayan yeti.

808
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,880
The great yeti.

809
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,580
That's what I thought.

810
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,280
Yes.

811
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,760
These...

812
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,560
In America, that would be the Sasquatch or Bigfoot or the...

813
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,000
What is it?

814
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,960
Homo hoaxis.

815
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,060
Oh, my God.

816
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,840
Oh, my God.

817
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:09,880
Oh, my God.

818
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:09,880


819
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:09,880


820
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,720
The Hockey Hacking Man.

821
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,560
That would make no sense, dang.

822
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,240
Anyway, so if you were a yeti and you were just to randomly go out and poop in the backyard,

823
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,580
would there a Dalai Lama emerge from a Hapsipropsypilous bush?

824
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,300
No, but if you...

825
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,040
That would be the only place in your yard where you could grow the things.

826
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,560
Okay.

827
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,160
The plants.

828
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,000
I know they only blossom during a full moon, so...

829
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,380
It's like wolfbane, right?

830
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,160
Oh, yeah.

831
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,660
So it is dangerous.

832
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,740
It is wolfbane.

833
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,580
It's exactly the same thing.

834
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,580
As wolf...

835
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,500
As the...

836
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,220
Well, not the...

837
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,440
There are different plants that are called wolf's bane.

838
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,440
So one is like...

839
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,520
One of them is a slightly poisonous thing that grows in the Balkans or someplace.

840
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,880
But that's anti-lycanthropic, right?

841
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,660
And that helps psychological lycanthropy.

842
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:03,700
But then physical lycanthropy can only be combated by Hapifropzipilops, which is why

843
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,520
when you run out of frop, you turn into such a bastard.

844
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,640
I just thought you were going to say, you know,

845
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,680
if you had the original wolfbane, you'd still turn into a wolf after you smoked it,

846
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,520
but you just would think that you hadn't.

847
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:21,080
But if you smoke real Hapifropzipilops, you not only will think you haven't turned into

848
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,920
a wolf, you won't.

849
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,720
And...

850
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,000
Or you will, but you won't care, which is even really the best, I guess.

851
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,780
Well, we're at the deep end of the pool now, and I don't know if I can swim that well.

852
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,900
I don't understand.

853
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,500
Actually...

854
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,880
I dived right in, and this is where I'm at.

855
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,600
I'm kind of like over my head.

856
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:37,820
I dived...

857
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:38,900
Or...

858
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,960
Anyway, so none of these people have pledged for Hapif...

859
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,420
Well, never mind.

860
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,440
I'm sorry.

861
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,400
Oh, they might not know where to pledge.

862
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,420
Of course, they need to pledge to this station.

863
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,640
And are you too mad, Bob?

864
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,100
Someday you'll be the Bishop of Tinkleberry.

865
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,520
Someday we shall bring Bob back to life.

866
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,120
We will find his old pipe shanks and stems.

867
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,160
We'll scrape them out and get bits of saliva.

868
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,540
We'll retrieve the DNA...

869
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,320
of the original Bob before he was killed.

870
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,840
Any of those times.

871
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,440
As part of our master plan, Bob will not only live again and walk the green earth...

872
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,500
He will sell again!

873
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,740
He will sell again!

874
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,980
And you will be one of his victimless crimes.

875
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,560
You shall own what he does not.

876
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,220
You shall become a part of a vast invisible fortune,

877
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,160
which grows more invisible with each second.

878
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,020
Yes?

879
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,960
Please!

880
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,980
Give us some...

881
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:35,980
Money!

882
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,420
Money!

883
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,240
Money!

884
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,500
M-m-m-m-money!

885
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,720
Alright.

886
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,060
Arms for the poor.

887
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,400
Penny for the old guy.

888
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,840
Penny for the old guy.

889
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,960
Can you spare a quarter for an old altar boy, father?

890
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,280
Can you spare a quarter for an old altar boy, father?

891
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,720
That's it. That's it. That's it.

892
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,300
Yes, friends, you too can be exorcised.

893
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,420
You can have the demons of money exorcised from your wallet.

894
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,120
You can do it yourself by calling this station and pledging your hard-earned dollars.

895
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:13,340
I think at least they should pledge just based on the fact that we haven't conducted this pledge-a-thon like this.

896
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,660
We only do this once a year!

897
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, we only do it once a year.

898
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,880
And you know what it really costs to run a station like WCSB?

899
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,060
You know, in fact, we're not going to play any music.

900
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,420
We're going to boy you to death.

901
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,700
We're not going to...

902
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,520
We could talk with NPR-type accents, public television.

903
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,420
Dr. Tom Winkle is here from the Faculty Accent Department.

904
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,580
And, Tom, how long have you been working?

905
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,680
Working here? And why do you continue to work here?

906
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,700
Continue? Never mind.

907
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,780
Oh, I've been in the tweed for 25 years now.

908
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,680
That's a nice suit you're wearing.

909
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,020
I was wearing the tweed.

910
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,680
And I noticed the back of your suit is all shiny.

911
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,360
Oh, no, that's where I peed.

912
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,820
There's all the back-slapping you've been involved in at those faculty luncheons.

913
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,900
Want to get something published?

914
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,180
Publish this!

915
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,280
We need money!

916
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,500
Let's see what was on in the old...

917
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,520
...the old days when we had something to think about.

918
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,120
I've got one hour to convince you how badly we and the station need your support.

919
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:20,260
Uh, we have a special, special form of slack in store tonight.

920
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,720
Instead of us giving you slack for once,

921
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,960
you're going to finally give some back to us.

922
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,640
Of course, some of you have been doing so all along.

923
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,800
Praise Bob.

924
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:35,080
But for the rest of you, oh, this could be the moment of truth.

925
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,560
The moment at hand.

926
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,100
You have to love Bob.

927
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,860
He loves you, but...

928
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,040
You love Bob.

929
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,420
You have to.

930
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,300
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

931
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,360
He'll kill you.

932
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,120
He'll Bob you out.

933
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,840
He'll Bob you out, folks.

934
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,940
You heard it here first.

935
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,800
If you don't love Bob, he'll Bob you out.

936
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,360
Bob you out.

937
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,100
Maybe it's their friendship reference.

938
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,160
Only if...

939
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,200
Only if...

940
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,220
Well, you know, if you...

941
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,220


942
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,500
If you don't pledge, there's going to be more than one reference.

943
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,180
You're going to have to listen to it forever.

944
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,740
Too many reference stands.

945
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,420
Listen until the money...

946
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,600
Dear friends...

947
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,360
We need that money.

948
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,020
Oh, my gosh.

949
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,660
Go for it.

950
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,260
Let's get us some spirit going here, man.

951
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,580
Look at those phones light up.

952
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,840
Oh, yes.

953
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,680
Look.

954
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,760
That'll go, friends.

955
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,540
Shake it off.

956
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,240
Shake it off.

957
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,380
Can you imagine a world without slack?

958
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,620
A world without the hour of slack?

959
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,700
And even almost as bad.

960
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,200
A world...

961
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,500
A world without...

962
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,200
This station.

963
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,620
Because if you don't send some money by midnight tonight,

964
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,940
you're going to be wishing to God you had, or Bob...

965
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,880
Or somebody.

966
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:48,740
Or somebody.

967
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,900
The money's no good.

968
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,620
Just get a grip on yourself.

969
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,600
The money will be no good following the great collapse, which is imminent.

970
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,780
Yes.

971
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,060
The time to donate is now, because your money will be no good tomorrow.

972
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:02,680
It's true.

973
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,000
Peak slack.

974
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,880
Just look at your money sitting there in your wallet.

975
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,200
But...

976
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,660
It wants to be used.

977
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,860
It wants to be useful.

978
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,780
And yet...

979
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,160
It's just like so many pieces of paper.

980
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,600
But if you send now...

981
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,980
If you pledge now...

982
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,300
If you pledge now...

983
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,880
The money will be good.

984
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,720
That's right.

985
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,920
Because we have a secret plan to ride out the coming collapse.

986
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,040
Well, it's not a secret anymore.

987
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,960
But we have ways of making the money worth something tomorrow.

988
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,120
In ways that you will not be able to.

989
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,800
We have ways of making the money work?

990
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,820
For it is written in the scriptures,

991
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,460
Do not store up treasure on earth.

992
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,420
For thieves may get to it.

993
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,780
But store up treasure at this station.

994
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,020
For no thief can touch your money there.

995
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,360
And where your money is, so shall your heart be.

996
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,280
And if your heart isn't in this radio station, why are you even listening?

997
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,420
This is what I ask you.

998
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,720
Yes.

999
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,400
It is easier for a camel to get through the needle's eye

1000
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,800
than for a rich man to make it into heaven.

1001
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,180
With a little bit of money, you can make a lot of money.

1002
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,420
Without having divested himself of some of those riches on this station.

1003
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:16,620
The St. Stymie de Bergerac has called in with a pledge.

1004
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:24,580
We praise St. Stymie, the greatest peonman in all of the Coventry area.

1005
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,580
Consider your donation a little bit of lube, as it were.

1006
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,080
This will help you squeeze through that eye of the needle.

1007
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,220
We're not asking you for an erectile lubrication.

1008
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,160
We're not asking you for that kind of donation.

1009
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,900
You could donate your sperm any time you want.

1010
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,740
And you know what?

1011
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,200
They might give you 25 bucks if it works.

1012
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,260
And you're better off taking that 25 bucks and sending it to this station.

1013
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,380
And I forgot what the hell I was talking about.

1014
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,720
Who cares?

1015
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,480
As long as we get the money and stay on the air.

1016
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,340
We're talking pennies a day.

1017
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:58,960
Yeah.

1018
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,940
Like the levy guys say, how much will this cost?

1019
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,140
$100,000 home.

1020
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,080
Well, none of you own a $100,000 home.

1021
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,880
You own a $45.

1022
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,460
car.

1023
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,200
But if you send $15 now, you may quit smoking.

1024
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,440
And we may continue to buy CDs and other citizens' rights and other things.

1025
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,960
Call it the never say quit or never say continue.

1026
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,560
I don't know.

1027
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,640
Yeah, you could play with the idea.

1028
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,300
Never say quit package.

1029
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,600
Yeah, think of, is that worth some money to you folks?

1030
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,400
Not only will you be listening to this station, you'll be smoking its ashtray and shooting

1031
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,100
its glasses.

1032
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,800
This is radio you can smoke.

1033
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,460
Yeah, man.

1034
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,820
Don't let the authorities know you're smoking this radio station.

1035
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,160
We know you've been doing that.

1036
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:40,460
Yeah.

1037
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,520
We got our eyes open.

1038
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,820
Heck, we used to before they sealed that window shut.

1039
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,540
Back in the day, yeah.

1040
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,740
You know, when Bob Dobbs runs out of frop for his pipe, what do you think he puts in his

1041
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:49,960
pipe?

1042
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,300
He puts in this station.

1043
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,780
And you're sold.

1044
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,420
And you don't have to be as wealthy as Bob to support us.

1045
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,600
No, friends.

1046
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,100
As a matter of fact, a tiny little minute.

1047
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,960
We've been, we've been bandying about huge figures like $15.

1048
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,820
$15, $20.

1049
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,660
Hey, $5.

1050
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,200
A $5 check or money order thrown into an envelope would make a huge difference.

1051
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:13,900
You'd get a thank you note.

1052
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,720
$10 would make twice as much difference.

1053
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,940
And $100, well, then.

1054
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,440
What do they get for $100?

1055
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,140
For $100, Lonesome Cowboy Dave will come to your house.

1056
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,100
I will not smooch buttocks.

1057
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,120
And place upon your.

1058
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,520
No.

1059
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,200
Fundament the bestowal of his kiss.

1060
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,540
I am not a fundamentalist, nor will I smooch a fundament.

1061
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,720
I may have one as a snack, perhaps.

1062
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,080
If you want to kiss the firmament.

1063
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:37,620
You're not a fundy boy.

1064
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,400
Now, there was a $200 cheap meat reverend staying at a cheap motel pledge.

1065
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,160
But nobody's really taken us up on that since a long time ago in Dallas.

1066
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,960
Do you think it's the economy?

1067
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,580
Or do you just think it's your disheveled appearance and the fact that you've been in the tabloids so much lately?

1068
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,900
A little bit of everything, of course.

1069
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,340
Yeah.

1070
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,700
I've done a little bit of everything.

1071
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,380
When the collab starts, everything starts working against the protean.

1072
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,440
Peak slack, man.

1073
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:00,820
Yeah.

1074
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,620
Was it Sata who wheeled the cliff up the hill?

1075
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,700
Or was it Prometheus who liked to eat his meat?

1076
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,060
Or was it John Lever?

1077
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,380
You know?

1078
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,080
Not here.

1079
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,100
Or Wotan who kept picking his eye hole.

1080
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:10,560
Yeah.

1081
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,060
His little scabby hole where his eye used to be.

1082
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,680
Right after Burt Lancaster or somebody shoved a big hot stick in there.

1083
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,540
Friends, it's not easy being a god.

1084
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,700
It isn't.

1085
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,020
It's a bit like juggling, actually.

1086
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:22,520
Some of the time.

1087
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:31,540
But it is easy to be the god of this station by being the friendliest, nicest pleasure to call it the last minute

1088
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,640
and get in your call, your donation to the hour.

1089
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,880
Now, if you're really cool, you'll do it again for the next show.

1090
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,880
Think of it, comrades.

1091
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,300
Where they actually let you call in if you have the nerve.

1092
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:48,880
And?

1093
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,160
If you've had enough coffee.

1094
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,480
You know, a $30 donation can actually get you a date with Bob.

1095
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,880
That's right.

1096
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,580
Absolutely.

1097
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,740
Not Bob Dobbs, but Bob Delchin.

1098
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,900
And no Tostitos at the bar.

1099
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,100
This is strictly a pre-functional date.

1100
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,840
Bob's a hooker like you.

1101
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,580
Bob's just another hooker like all of us.

1102
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,640
He'll do it for you.

1103
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,560
This may say something about him.

1104
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,740
The fact that it says a quantity available unlimited.

1105
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,020
So he's willing to go out with as many of you ladies as are willing to pony up.

1106
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,480
Use your imagination, girls.

1107
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,160
Why do you think they call it?

1108
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:34,980
Well, actually, now it's the time to say that you are, in fact, listening.

1109
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,420
To a pledge drive on this station.

1110
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:46,020
You know, you think in profusion about how little there is of this active sort of voice in the radio nowadays.

1111
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,660
Too many people talk about their titties, their twangers.

1112
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:55,160
They look at their history or geology books as they get ready for the next adolescent tune.

1113
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:02,360
But here on this station, you hear a plethora of adult entertainment.

1114
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,880
And you don't have to use your imagination to watch those.

1115
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,820
Those boobies flounce.

1116
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,800
Or those ideas come out and pink on you.

1117
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,860
You don't need a placenta.

1118
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,160
No, you don't need that savage placenta.

1119
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,380
What do you think you are, David Lynch back in the early days?

1120
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,840
F-f-f-f-f-falling around, checking things out?

1121
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,520
Nah, man.

1122
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,260
You're born again.

1123
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,020
Into the new flesh.

1124
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,400
A flesh of listeners.

1125
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:30,140
A carnal union of millions of listeners.

1126
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,000
You can't get out.

1127
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,920
You must give back.

1128
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:35,820
Hahaha.

1129
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,040
Okay.

1130
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:40,420
Extra.

1131
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,700
новей ep.

1132
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,700
Now, you can have

1133
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,500
I believe you should have, strong,

1134
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:49,960
soon,

1135
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,240
this amazing new symphony

1136
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,260
generates in the mind of the salesman before it does in the prospective.

1137
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,360
You all sell something to sell.

1138
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,480
Everyone selling together.

1139
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,480
You can call in tonight, set it up.

1140
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
You'll never have to think again.

1141
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:25,440
And of course, a check or money order is always so much fun.

1142
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:34,680
Come, a big Gibbs of golly goshin' better puke your peat on full throttle potentate.

1143
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,920
Elsewise, your wants will be waggin' down on mammy's hind nannies.

1144
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,180
Why can't your peas or poppers squeeze it when the gushers are goin' all normal-like?

1145
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,060
Got your no geyser sense in your sneezin' chamber, boy?

1146
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,880
Heistin' an empty platter in your beanbag?

1147
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,400
Where's your rollerballs, eh?

1148
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,200
I can't grop me no love grow on this luju-luju band.

1149
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,520
You're gonna have to spreach English, Jake.

1150
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,800
Get right.

1151
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,780
With your muscle snake, snunk monkey.

1152
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:12,080
Quit spritzin' your plizzerer, lessen it's snowin' white lute juice, baby.

1153
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,440
Elsewise, your pleatin' bleeder's blowin' hot water.

1154
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,720
You go blind, or please you neither, tryin' not to.

1155
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:26,880
Either way, you're gettin' up on the wrong orbit for this kinda free-kneedin' bleedin' side trade, eh?

1156
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:34,120
Well, won't you go stand there like a dammy nickel slug, or you gonna plus your plimper in righteous hargany?

1157
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,900
Hey, P-boy.

1158
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,720
Got weenie ribbers and fluter tubes, don't you?

1159
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,860
Join gumption's with the true and the seed brave.

1160
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,920
And pee for Bob, man, and send your jeans.

1161
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:53,280
Buy out the gland owners with what you earned with your skinny peelin' face of pain.

1162
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,200
This has been your enunciator.

1163
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,280
Thank me.

1164
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,080
Amen.

1165
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,560
Well, when did it?

1166
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,840
Today.

1167
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:02,960
Today.

1168
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,820
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1169
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:17,400
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1170
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,000
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death which brings me...

1171
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,980
Mis amigos queridos, ¿qué quiere en su vida?

1172
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,080
¿Riqueza grande?

1173
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,940
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1174
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,740
¿Conoce usted a Bob Dobbs?

1175
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,100
Eh, Chabot.

1176
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,220
Bob world after all.

1177
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,120
It's a Bob world after all.

1178
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,780
It's a Bob world after all.

1179
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,900
It's a Bob.

1180
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,140
This station.

1181
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:51,600
This is the subgenius radio ministry.

1182
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,920
Hour of slack.

1183
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,140
We are full grown.

1184
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,620
We are grown up men.

1185
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,420
We are all past.

1186
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,040
The age of reasoning.

1187
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,460
It is our mission.

1188
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,040
It is our task.

1189
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,200
It's obvious.

1190
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,260
Yet you still ask.

1191
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,220
We are going to save the universe.

1192
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,800
We are going to save the universe.

1193
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,480
We are going to save the universe.

1194
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,600
This time.

1195
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,500
Oh yes dear friends.

1196
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,000
That's right.

1197
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,300
We'll be saving.

1198
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,460
The universe on this.

1199
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,160
This.

1200
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:33,920
Like I say.

1201
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:34,580
It's one chance.

1202
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,180
The swinging love corpses.

1203
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,520
Want you to save the universe.

1204
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,100
Robert Anton Wilson.

1205
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,860
Our special celebrity guest star.

1206
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,240
Wanted to save the universe.

1207
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,020
And the zombies for Bob here.

1208
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,640
Answering the phone.

1209
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,900
Want they did desire.

1210
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,480
They desire for you to save.

1211
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,660
This universe.

1212
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,580
So you know how.

1213
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,360
You know that number.

1214
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,820
You've memorized it by now.

1215
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,200
It's been hammered into your head enough.

1216
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,120
Hello listener.

1217
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,920
I'm your guardian angel Sergio.

1218
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,260
I just stopped by to ask if you're donating to Radiothon.

1219
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:01,680
This year.

1220
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:02,500
What?

1221
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,480
You're not.

1222
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,800
But don't you understand how important Radiothon is?

1223
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,740
Let me show you how things would be if no one donated to Radiothon.

1224
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,660
See that over there.

1225
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,940
That's this station.

1226
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:15,900
But wait.

1227
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,280
Those aren't the same DJs you know and love.

1228
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,420
Because no one donated to Radiothon.

1229
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,960
This station ran out of funds.

1230
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,020
When that happened.

1231
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,120
Everyone had to leave.

1232
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,220
And now the evil preppy kids have come in to turn this station into a farm club for commercial radio.

1233
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,100
And now they're doing a five hour.

1234
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,120
Dave Matthews marathon.

1235
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:33,780
AHHHHH!

1236
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,620
STOP BALLOONING MY STATION WITH THOSE UNHOLY SOUNDS!

1237
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,960
And look over there.

1238
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,860
That's little Johnny Indie Rocker.

1239
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,600
But he's not an indie rocker now.

1240
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,860
Without this station.

1241
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,100
He was unable to get turned on to underground rock music like the Shins or the Brian Jonestown Massacre.

1242
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:58,060
Instead he's been listening to Creed and Limp Bizkit because the corporate music machine has fooled him into thinking that sort of music is alternative rock.

1243
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,880
This station.

1244
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,080
Was never around to show him the real alternative rock.

1245
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,080


1246
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,080


1247
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:07,720
And now he's screaming nonsense about the nookie and listening to that ironic cover of George Michael over and over again.

1248
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,300
And look at all the blues fans.

1249
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,220
They've got the blues all right.

1250
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,500
Because they don't have any blues to listen to on the radio.

1251
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,840
And I could show you all the downtrodden punk metal jazz folk reggae and ethnic music fans.

1252
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,160
But I think you get the point.

1253
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:27,020
All radio has become a swirling vortex of tripe drivel and crap because there was no this station to redeem it.

1254
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,780
The corporate music machine got its way.

1255
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,940
So now all there is to listen to on the radio is.

1256
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,100
Country Top 40 and Dave Matthews.

1257
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,920
But it doesn't have to be this way.

1258
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,980
You can still donate to Radiothon.

1259
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,700
All you have to do is call this station and a friendly operator will be ready to take your pledge.

1260
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,460
Remember every donation is like a silver bullet in the heart of the corporate radio beast.

1261
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,840
It's your donation that will support us and keep us afloat.

1262
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,580
What's that?

1263
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,740
You'll donate?

1264
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:52,720
Woohoo!

1265
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,040
Go ahead and call this station right now.

1266
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,280
I don't want any status.

1267
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:58,880
Luck.

1268
00:53:59,400 --> 00:53:59,920
Prosperity.

1269
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,300
By.

1270
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,780
By blowing them off.

1271
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,040
But don't blow off that pledge drive, friends.

1272
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,000
Bob's promises to life is still the nature of abnormal behavior.

1273
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,380
I'm not going to.

1274
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,800
We ain't going to be taking no guff this time.

1275
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,820
This time.

1276
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,220
This time you are going to pay up.

1277
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,620
You are going to call.

1278
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,160
Because that sweet name of Bob, my friend.

1279
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,280
What else can you do?

1280
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,000
What else are you going to do with that money?

1281
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,280
Well, I can probably think of all kinds of things you can do with that money.

1282
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:30,720
All right.

1283
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,080
We go.

1284
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,100
Oh, yes, friend.

1285
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,980
See, if you don't call in, that's all you're going to hear all across this nation forever.

1286
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,660
And it won't even be Elvis, probably.

1287
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,000
That's the shame of it all.

1288
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,160
It'd be the bald-headed Elvis from Michigan, I guess.

1289
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,340
But you're laughing.

1290
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,180
Oh, yeah.

1291
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,860
You're laughing, saying, oh, I don't care.

1292
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:58,620
I don't care if radioactive rain destroys all the fish and fauna and pollutes the water from me not supporting this station.

1293
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,740
Oh, I don't care.

1294
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:08,540
I don't care if our firestorms kill all dormant seeds on Earth, making regeneration of plant life possible.

1295
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,820
Oh, I don't.

1296
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,260
I'd just as soon get this station for free.

1297
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:21,840
I don't have a spare $10 because I'm going to spend it on cigarettes and liquor and false slack.

1298
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,680
Oh, yeah.

1299
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:29,320
I don't care if vast quantities of nitrogen oxide dramatically increase ultraviolet radiation.

1300
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:35,220
I don't care if we're going to have to go to the point where humans and animals are blind and we can't even hear an hour of slack with our eyes.

1301
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:51,500
Oh, just compromise your immune system by not sending, not pledging a penny or even worse, by pretending to be a subgenius and pledging but never even actually sending the check.

1302
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,160
Huh?

1303
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:53,920
Sick.

1304
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,360
Sick creatures out there.

1305
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,060
They don't even care.

1306
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,240
I mean, it is so ironic.

1307
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,820
Some of these false preachers can raise millions and millions of dollars.

1308
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,760
No problem there.

1309
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,760
Well, I tell you what.

1310
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,320
I challenge you, Jim Swaggart.

1311
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,400
I challenge you, Jim Baker.

1312
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,420
I challenge you, Oral Roberts.

1313
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,120
You see this hand here?

1314
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,360
You see this hand in front of me, Mr. Jim Baker?

1315
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,700
This is called the claw, and it's got the power of dogs in it and the power of Bob.

1316
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,180
And I challenge you to show your ugly face here at this radio station and come forward.

1317
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:28,940
Go ahead.

1318
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:29,720
Come forward.

1319
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,080
Come forward with all your millions.

1320
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,540
I'm ready to have a match without rules.

1321
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,860
No rules at all.

1322
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,300
One will survive.

1323
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,140
One only.

1324
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:46,100
One minister will leave the match still breathing if one of you goody-goody preachers has the guts to show up.

1325
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,640
Ah, yes.

1326
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,420
I'm sitting here drinking some Texas Select beer, friends.

1327
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,820
Beer!

1328
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,780
You hear that, Jimmy Swaggart?

1329
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:59,280
You don't drink beer, oh no, or smoke on a prop because you don't know the power.

1330
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,060
You deserve.

1331
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,260
I challenge any minister do-gooder out there to show up.

1332
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:09,540
All of you, with all your TV shows and all your bought-off politicians, your paid-off judges.

1333
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,680
Do any trick you want, but I got the claw, I got the power of Bob and the power of Texas Select.

1334
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,380
And you, my friend listener, has the power to call this station.

1335
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,580
Do it.

1336
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,120
Do it.

1337
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,520
Do it.

1338
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:28,440
The times, the end times get closer and closer every minute.

1339
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,540
Imagine some...

1340
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,380
guy or some gal driving around out there.

1341
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:37,240
They're tired of listening to the same old music on their conspiracy radio show.

1342
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,500
So they try switching channels and they come upon this.

1343
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,660
They hear these voices talking and they think,

1344
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,240
Now what is this, a talk show?

1345
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,400
A church show?

1346
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:46,960
A comedy?

1347
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,300
I mean, oh my God, are these people serious?

1348
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,340
It's too developed to be a joke.

1349
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,980
Should I kill them?

1350
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,460
Or should I...

1351
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,420
Which will it be, friend?

1352
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,780
Which will it be?

1353
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:00,820
Which will it be?

1354
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,720
Kill us or pay us?

1355
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,940
Either way, call...

1356
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,480
this station.

1357
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:04,680
It's...

1358
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,340
There's some...

1359
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,060
some have-nots out there, I know.

1360
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:11,520
By definition, many subgeniuses are have-nots in money, but they do have slack.

1361
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,360
And at least they know what they're missing.

1362
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,820
So, you've done okay by not having money, haven't you?

1363
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,120
And so, therefore, it won't hurt you a bit.

1364
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,680
It won't hurt you to have a bit less.

1365
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,260
And the money doesn't go to me.

1366
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,860
It doesn't even go to the Will of Dobbs.

1367
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,140
It doesn't even go to someone else.

1368
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,980
Your membership money does, though.

1369
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,180
It goes to keep...

1370
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,200
this station...

1371
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:30,980
on the air...

1372
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:31,560
without...

1373
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,340
this station.

1374
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,920
You won't get the hour of slack free.

1375
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,660
You'll be like everybody else out there.

1376
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,500
Give to us something to live for.

1377
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,660
Anything.

1378
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,180
We need hope now, love.

1379
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,520
I'm a robot, you son of a bitch!
