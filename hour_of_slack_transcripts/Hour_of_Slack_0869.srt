1
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,220
The Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,320
The Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,060
That was the Ballad of Oshama.

4
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,720
Wait, wait, don't start anything yet.

5
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,720
Okay, we're pretending we're getting ready to try and be funny in one more minute.

6
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,820
Yeah, let's do that ritual we do when we're about to get funny.

7
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:19,020
Hey, I'm really sorry to the young lady who came up and left the pictures from the guys on DJ A's show.

8
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,120
I mean, if you just would have showed me those pictures, I would have said,

9
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,100
yeah, cool, you can wait.

10
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,060
So, I don't know if you're listening, but I'm really sorry that I didn't let you stay in the station.

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,400
But, you know, it's weird up here.

12
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,700
You know, put yourself in my shoes.

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,080
Someone just knocks on the door and wants to hang out.

14
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,440
Smelly shoes.

15
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,100
Smelly shoes, yeah.

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,200
No, you didn't have to.

17
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,880
But, you know, so, but come back in a half hour.

18
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,540
I'm sure DJ A will be downstairs, talk to him or whatever.

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,780
But if you're listening, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,660
He just called up and called me a jerk and she sounded like she was crying even.

21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,080
She wanted, he wanted to smell.

22
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,160
Smell your feet, girly.

23
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,660
And you, and you let him on and then you slapped his knuckles like a, like a rude stunt.

24
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,920
Somebody that was just here.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,140
We just have security things that we have to pay attention to here.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,600
That's all.

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,400
You know.

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,540
I was just following the rules.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,720
Are you talking about just tonight?

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,240
Yeah.

31
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,840
I saw her leaving.

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,980
Oh, well.

33
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,760
I saw her escorted from the building.

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,680
If she's listening, I thought she was kind of cute.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,480
I thought she was more kind of.

36
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,040
And she was all dressed in camo too, man.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,260
Yeah, the same one I saw.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,700
She was on a mission.

39
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,540
Yeah, you know that.

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,320
But she did, she did look pissed off and suspicious of me.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,800
Like, what the hell are you doing in here?

42
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,000
I was looking at her like, what the hell are you doing in here?

43
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,020
Because there's usually nobody here but the dead guys and Dave.

44
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,500
Well, she showed me part of her brain.

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,440
Unlike the dead guys who she just walked by letting.

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,240
You got to see her brain?

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,600
Her alacrity perfume waft by their buttocks.

48
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,440
Whoever you are, I'm sorry.

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,840
They're frozen.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,240
I was imagining what her brain would look like.

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,260
I'm sorry that the envelope had the pictures of the guys on the radio show.

52
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,140
That's on after me.

53
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,360
I would have, you know, been totally okay.

54
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,000
And well, maybe even, I don't know.

55
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,840
It's hard to tell what you're going to do in those crisis situations.

56
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,160
You know what I mean?

57
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,600
Well, there's a lot of mad bombers running around in camo outfits these days.

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,740
What are these mad bombers?

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,420
Mad patriots, mad anti-patriots, and mad magazine readers all wearing camo.

60
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,580
I'm one of the mad magazine readers.

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,900
There's also a lot of muscular gorillas around wearing their.

62
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,920
Camouflage perversely.

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,480
I must say.

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
And I'd love to see their brains.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,800
No, you know what I mean?

66
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,780
They're like, I could see it.

67
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,260
They're fessing, you know?

68
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,420
Yeah, I know.

69
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,520
But it's like they're, they have that vibrant animal brain.

70
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,740
You know that inside.

71
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,840
Oh, it's good for sucking.

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,520
If you could look inside.

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,820
Okay, dig this.

74
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,440
Some of those chicks heads, you'd see the nastiest.

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,720
Okay.

76
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,020
What do you think about this, man?

77
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,240


78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,820
One, two, three.

79
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,960
The devil's after me.

80
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,060
Four, five, six.

81
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,040
He's always throwing sticks.

82
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,240
Seven, eight, nine.

83
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,520
He misses every time.

84
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,980
Hallelujah, hallelujah, amen.

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,820
Nine, eight, seven.

86
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,960
I'm on my way to heaven.

87
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,240
Six, five, six.

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
Five, four.

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,320
I'm almost to the door.

90
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,380
Three, two, one.

91
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,660
The victory thou wilt won.

92
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,140
Hallelujah, hallelujah, amen.

93
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,320
If you ever attempt to use LSD.

94
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,920
If you ever attempt to use LSD.

95
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,480
Bring him to his drive.

96
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,780
Maybe cost you your life.

97
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,640
And use up all your gold.

98
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,220
And use up all your gold.

99
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,220


100
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,220


101
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,220


102
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,220


103
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,840
Well, hey, you know, I used to do that too.

104
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,380
An LSD monkey on his back.

105
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,960
That's his scary monkey.

106
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,960
The green monkey.

107
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,280
Yeah.

108
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,520
A multicolored moon saw.

109
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm listening.

110
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,060
You remember those LSD monkeys?

111
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,420
The ones with the little purple rectums?

112
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,240
Or was that a gibbon?

113
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,320
Dude, I was one of those LSD monkeys.

114
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,060
Oh, man, you were so lucky.

115
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,740
I tried for 13 years to get that gig.

116
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,600
Well, yeah, I joined the army.

117
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,680
It was part of the, you know, I was one of those experimental monkey guys.

118
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,440
They gave the LSD to.

119
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,160
Did you get the special powers?

120
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,640
Yeah.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
That's how I became a man.

122
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,900
Did you get to fly?

123
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,780
Or were you just like one of the walking monkeys?

124
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,720
No, I was just a monkey.

125
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,660
I was just a purple-budded yellow monkey.

126
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
I'm a Christ, man.

127
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,360
I was a monkey.

128
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,780
That's all.

129
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,100
I was just a freaking little monkey.

130
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,460
Now I am a man and a brother.

131
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,160
Am I not a man and a brother?

132
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,200
Go, go, gorilla.

133
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,720
Go, go, gorilla.

134
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:51,720


135
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,540
Go, go, gorilla.

136
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,660
Yeah, that was a time when you was all monkeys.

137
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,180
Yeah, that was a long time ago, but it's not so long.

138
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,200
We've all got that memory, don't we?

139
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,960
Yeah, yeah, sure.

140
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,360
Somewhere in the back of the piney oak land.

141
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,140
Somewhere where you're far away from everything.

142
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,080
Maybe sticking your feet at the edge of the beach.

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,480
Relax.

144
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,340
Would you rub my feet while I...

145
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:13,720
Sure.

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,460
Oh.

147
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,380
Just one poor monkey doing that won't smell anything.

148
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,380
Oh, squeeze harder, Dave.

149
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:21,720
Oh.

150
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,200
Oh.

151
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,800
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,960
Yeah, don't ya?

153
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,420
Hey, you hear this guy?

154
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,220
Oh, man.

155
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,740
Calm down, calm down.

156
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,280
Here, have a little one.

157
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,920
Here, have a little one.

158
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,460
Here, too busy singing to put anybody down.

159
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,520
Oye.

160
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,240
Oye.

161
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,380
I did not agree.

162
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,920
Oye, unos tardes.

163
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:43,940
God has given this...

164
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,880
Deben decirle alguna cosa.

165
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,100
A message of faith.

166
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,220
Pre-warriors!

167
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,960
A message of faith.

168
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,540
It was magnificent.

169
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:51,720
I'm glad you liked it.

170
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


171
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


172
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


173
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


174
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


175
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


176
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


177
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


178
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


179
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:51,720


180
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,080
I'm glad you liked it.

181
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,080


182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,080


183
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,080


184
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,080


185
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,080


186
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,080


187
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,140
I don't know if I can do this!

188
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,600
I don't know if I can do this!

189
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:53,600


190
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,720
Please, please.

191
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:54,960
Oh, no!

192
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,840
It's killing me!

193
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,900
I don't know if I can show me anything!

194
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,540
Where there is war, dear friends, there are doctors.

195
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,540
The doctors did this to me, and I shall explain.

196
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,420
Way back when the day was 1980, when the first subgenius clenches were forming in the wilds

197
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:28,480
of America. In darkest Arkansas, there arose a new type of creature, the subgenius doctor band.

198
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:36,720
A Dr. Snavely Eklund, owner of Beans and Grains and Things health food store in Little Rock,

199
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,600
who could play no instrument, started a subgenius band with his employees, Pope Sternodox,

200
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,720
Gene Sply, St. Jane or Hypercletes, Martin and Linda Pitt, and others.

201
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:57,220
In Dallas, co-subfounders Dr. Philo Drummond and myself, with the Helswami Satellite Weavers,

202
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,320
emulated Doctors for Bob with our band, Doctors for Wotan.

203
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:11,020
The San Francisco Doctors, like Puzzling Evidence, Lies, and Gary Gabrogkran formed the band that dare not speak its name.

204
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,360
These were giants.

205
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,580
But they were not the only ones.

206
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:15,580


207
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,300
There were many others.

208
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,920
In the meantime, the lone subgenius in Los Angeles, St. Byron Werner,

209
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,060
while making his now-famous music collection Space Age Bachelor Pad,

210
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,400
created, using his Museum of Bull Dada Record Albums,

211
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,200
the ultimate doctor-oriented audio collage tape,

212
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,280
which was incorporated into the subgenius media barrage called Bad Doctors,

213
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,940
the ancient 1980 reel-to-reel tapes of which I have been tweaking up.

214
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:53,100
In digital format, to intersperse with our recent ESO Swamp Radio live broadcasts from WCSB Cleveland.

215
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,220
There were doctors on the earth in those days.

216
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,280
Great combination, isn't it, Jim?

217
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,100
What's that?

218
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,600
Armful of narcotics and a loaded gun?

219
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,480
Let her go, Bob.

220
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,140
Boy, did we get high.

221
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,840
Yes, sir.

222
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,300
We sure got relaxed.

223
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,980
A physician must determine if tendon repairs are needed.

224
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,340
There it is.

225
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:35,620
But if the chief ever caught me taking these pills, he'd snap my head off.

226
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,220
Here, try one of mine.

227
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:37,880
Oh, yeah?

228
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,940
Yeah, the chief himself's been on these for a week, and he's a changed...

229
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,900
Our favorite area for clairvoyance...

230
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,300
...has always been in the field of science and medicine.

231
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
What's your trouble, young man?

232
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,500
The Venusian goop rod, Doctor.

233
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,620
Now, see here, young man, my time is valuable.

234
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,580
Doctor, this is a medical emergency.

235
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,960
I hope you like that nonsense.

236
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,640
I try to make the audience a part of the entertainment, and they go along with it all just great.

237
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,000
That chatter with the doctor is no phony bit, really. It's just the way it happens.

238
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,740
You'll have to make it in one night when you're down Florida way.

239
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,040
All right, nurse, bring the next patient in.

240
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,700
Get up on this table.

241
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,920
Pull off that gown.

242
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,840
Raise up that right leg, let that left one down.

243
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,920
Pull off them stockings, that silk underwear.

244
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,620
The doctor's got to get you, mama, Lord knows when.

245
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,460
Doctor.

246
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,840
Doctor.

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,840
All inner or non-existent void particles.

248
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:53,040
You can send negro-influenced voice waves, tap-shoe disc patterns.

249
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:04,020
You can send us cow vomit, tooth broken, leaven-gated, elongated, creation-oriented,

250
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,400
spear gum, restaurant scars.

251
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,440
You can send us...

252
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,500
Niki.

253
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,800
Don't look at me that way, Douglas.

254
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,520
You're mad.

255
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,320
Don't be frightened, Douglas.

256
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,540
You're about to see what service do we call.

257
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,420
Give me down your arm!

258
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:27,940
Doctor.

259
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,780
Good night, Docs.

260
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,080
Thank you very much.

261
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,480
Thank you.

262
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,820
Make me take off my clothes and make me go out normal, and I have to go outside and check.

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,040
I've got to change before I come here.

264
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,740
Do you love your parents?

265
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,740
Yeah, I love them, but they're...

266
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,520
In countless schools across the land, mere infants are taught all about contraceptive techniques

267
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,080
and are provided with a plastic phallus in the classroom upon which they are trained to fit rubber...

268
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,960
Did you hear what he was saying?

269
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,080
Did you hear what he was saying?

270
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,840
I don't like that last sound.

271
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,120
I don't like that last sound.

272
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,780
The Lord is my shepherd.

273
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,940
No, that won't do.

274
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,760
All right, close your eyes, please.

275
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,440
And repeat this prayer after me, right out loud.

276
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,820
Ing, ing, ing, ing, ing.

277
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,320
Like this.

278
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,140
Ing, ing, ing, ing, ing.

279
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,640
Ang, ang, ang, ang, ang.

280
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,960
Eve, meet, concrete, eel.

281
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,820
End, pet, let, lend.

282
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:06,320
Dude Hughes, do you choose to toot?

283
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,760
In some cases, the individuals who have come have tried various things,

284
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,400
but they've failed.

285
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,000
I love rock and roll.

286
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,680
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby.

287
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,140
And then because we are Christians or Americans or something, I don't know just why, we began

288
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,420
to get conscience pains.

289
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,220
And we began to hear people say, well, don't just do something, stand there.

290
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,700
No.

291
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,820
We're ready for a TV.

292
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,220
He's got a rod that's about two foot long.

293
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,200
Went to the doctor.

294
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,660
Doctor says, shy, I'm going to have to cut your dick off.

295
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,300
He said, no, no, no, no, no, no.

296
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,300


297
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,300


298
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,300


299
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,300


300
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,300


301
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,300


302
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:48,260
Shy said, doctor, said you better cut it off down to the motherfucking bone.

303
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,980
Because if you leave any meat, I'm going to fuck right on.

304
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,060
Let her go, Bob.

305
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,980
And I predict that our local American doctors will go on strike and be replaced by African

306
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,200
witch doctors.

307
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,420
Beach party, beach party.

308
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,820
It never stops.

309
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,780
Beach party, beach party.

310
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,460
I'm tired of this nightclub.

311
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,340
It never stops.

312
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,280
This is the beach party.

313
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,280


314
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,080
This band is so bad.

315
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,900
It never stops.

316
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Why do I have to pay $5 every night to stay alive?

317
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,700
Beach party will destroy.

318
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:29,860
Well, how many times do we have to play this worst song over and over and over again?

319
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,960
OK, what do you think about this, man?

320
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,480
Did you hear about the rave act?

321
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,540
Psychoskeptical.

322
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,840
The rave act.

323
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,880
The rave act now is a federal law.

324
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,920
We're not talking about a city law, a state law.

325
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,940
We're talking about a federal law.

326
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,040
And what does that do?

327
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,080
Federal law is something.

328
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,340
It now outlaws those glow sticks.

329
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,620
What?

330
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,040
Glow sticks are now illegal?

331
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,860
I am not kidding you.

332
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,600
You fuck.

333
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,680
Look it up.

334
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,240
Little skulls that you had on your dashboard are now illegal also.

335
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,280
If you're at a rave and you have a glow stick, it is considered drug paraphernalia.

336
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,580
Well, of course.

337
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,960
They look so good on drugs.

338
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,200
But they don't have anything to do with taking drugs.

339
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,320
Well, I think it's from Somalia.

340
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,280
Bottled water, I am not kidding you, is now drug paraphernalia at a rave.

341
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,380
But dig this.

342
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,640
A rave promoter cannot put on a rave legally without providing water.

343
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,560
But you can't give it in bottled water.

344
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,520
So I guess you get a trowel going or something, you know, a trowel.

345
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,900
Chronic pelvic pain or abdominal pain.

346
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,740
It's only if you buy store bought.

347
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,260
In rave.

348
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,940
Wearing a trowel.

349
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,320
And then you put lights on your body of any sort is considered drug paraphernalia.

350
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,680
A joystick and a bumblebee.

351
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,380
Because only drug users like lights on their body, right?

352
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,480
I don't know how you smoke anything with a glow stick.

353
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,380
I don't know how you snort anything with a glow stick.

354
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,840
Well, that's terrorist paraphernalia.

355
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,400
A glow stick has now been used by Al-Qaeda.

356
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,420
They know it for nutrition.

357
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:04,720
Okay, here's another one.

358
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,920
Here's another one.

359
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,480
Well, it's true.

360
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,560
I know, this is true.

361
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,320
Here's another one.

362
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,120
It's science fiction.

363
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,740
No, I'm taking this out of the news this week.

364
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,180
This is science falseness.

365
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,740
And we all know how false science can be.

366
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,600
I'm not kidding you.

367
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,200
The rave ad.

368
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,100
And there's rave kids in my class who knew all about this.

369
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,600
I thought that was act three of scene four.

370
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,500
We had a great discussion.

371
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,900
I don't care if it's Henry V.

372
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,740
All right, here's another one.

373
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:34,180
It is now legal for the CIA to kill Americans overseas if they think they're involved with

374
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,900
terrorists.

375
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,160
Well, thank God for that.

376
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,300
We can have Chuck Beres go out there and slap him.

377
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,340
Slap him with a whoopee stick.

378
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,320
Or one of those glowing sticks they use at the rave.

379
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,240
Did you know Chuck Berry was a former CIA agent?

380
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,620
A contract killer.

381
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,100
No way.

382
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,920
No, I knew Elvis was, but not Chuck Berry.

383
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,620
Well, they both shared the same plane cabin.

384
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,520
I'm a number of-

385
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,580
Chuck Beres was working for the CIA.

386
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,340
And I was sitting there with a bunch of other radio television hosts.

387
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,920
I was telling them that I'm a great ad.

388
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560
Yeah, they're wearing glow sticks.

389
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,740
They're not your body.

390
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,140
I'm having bottle-clawed forehead.

391
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,280


392
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,280


393
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,280


394
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,280


395
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,280


396
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,280


397
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,700
I'm a little bit of a

398
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:20,600
I guess the kids like to put Vapo, mixed Vapo rub inside of there just for a check.

399
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,820
It is quite a trick.

400
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,780
And my mom said that is now illegal.

401
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,260
All right.

402
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,860
Let's get you vocal rubs are now illegal.

403
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,100
What is part of the plan?

404
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,060
We've got sour drop candies.

405
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
My wife and I, when we're dancing it right.

406
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,020
I've got my-

407
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,980
We've got to use those super sour drop candies to stay-

408
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,960
What about the Fizzy Pop?

409
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,200
Right, same thing.

410
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,560
Well, those are illegal also.

411
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,420
Those are illegal.

412
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,380
Those drugs are terrorists.

413
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,800
The Fizzy Pop candy.

414
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, they're terrorists.

415
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,880
That's got to be a drug paraphernalia.

416
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,940
Every time I went to a rave on drugs, I wore clothing.

417
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,500
And I didn't have any of that.

418
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,080
You can cut your ecstasy with the Fizzy Pop.

419
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,540
Well, you can hide the drugs in your clothes.

420
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,000
So how can they, I mean-

421
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,220
Your clothes came to the front.

422
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,000
I just closed my-

423
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000


424
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000


425
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000


426
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000


427
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000


428
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000


429
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000


430
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000


431
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,520
My clothes came to the front.

432
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:06,520


433
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:06,520


434
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:06,520


435
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,580
Look the other way.

436
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,600
They don't know that you can only just chew on your collar and you stand like this.

437
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,400
Like my shirt, like my shirt, and I didn't.

438
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,900
My watch isn't sold out.

439
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,620
I can't believe it's such a good thing.

440
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,480
It's on the way now as it's a quarter after K-

441
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,780
It's rather interesting, though, that the CIA can now legally kill Americans as they

442
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,320
so desire anywhere in the world.

443
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,040
Well let's-

444
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,480
They can legally do it now or-

445
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,980
Or as they're able to-

446
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:35,980


447
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:35,980


448
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:35,980


449
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:35,980


450
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,380
Forever.

451
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,840
Yeah.

452
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,440
Ever.

453
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,240
At a rave.

454
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,100
If you're wearing a glow stick at a rave, the CIA can now...

455
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,500
Now, if she can make a run for it.

456
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:44,940


457
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,320
Get colors and signs and...

458
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,180
It doesn't at all.

459
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,160
It's just young kids dancing and having a good night trying to, like, you know, get some, you know, nookie on the side there.

460
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,140
There's another thing that's now illegal.

461
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,500
You know, I think that's why it's now illegal at rave sessions.

462
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,280
Also, if you...

463
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,260
That's why they're passing these laws, because those people never get laid.

464
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,580
And that's just that the young people are, you know, having all this fun.

465
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,580
Well, it's kind of sexy and all that stuff.

466
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,560
I mean, they thought they nipped us in the butt.

467
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,440
You know, they brought out AIDS and they thought, well, this is slow now.

468
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,520
Well, there you go.

469
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,860
There's two more legal exceptions for nips in the butt.

470
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,060
They're talking both, not only the internet, but me time, like, you know, when I'm sober.

471
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,060
Anyway, let's go.

472
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,900
Okay, here's the topic.

473
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,960
It's outlawed.

474
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,680
I haven't called it.

475
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,640
It's outlawed.

476
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,860
I'm going to carve a little booty.

477
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,280
Now, did you say you were on LSD now?

478
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,620
Do you want us to talk you down?

479
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,740
No, I feel like I'm on LSD.

480
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,400
Listen to this joke.

481
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,480
Well, that's the point.

482
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,920
We're trying to induce that.

483
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,140
We want to create flashbacks of those people that have them.

484
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,120
But if you get in a bad trip, we can talk you down.

485
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,900
We have the expertise.

486
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,640
Put on some Allman Brothers.

487
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,660
So tell me, are you tripping now?

488
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
LSD trip.

489
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,600
This is your essential.

490
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,720
Okay, well...

491
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,100
Let me ask you something.

492
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,260
Does that mean you know the experience of being on this drug?

493
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,220
Yes, I do.

494
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,480
Can you tell me what that's like?

495
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,780
Being on LSD?

496
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,220
Yeah.

497
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,580
You don't know.

498
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,020
What was that like?

499
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,880
I was shot out of a cannon for six hours.

500
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,540
Being shot out of a cannon.

501
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,600
While listening to the show, right?

502
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,320
Yeah.

503
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,360
Of course.

504
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,480
While the show goes raging through your head.

505
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,500
How long ago did you do this?

506
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,660
In fact, it never happened.

507
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,100
LSD?

508
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,580
Yeah.

509
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,300
A couple years.

510
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,380
Yeah, the show was on when you did this.

511
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,500
This show has been on for 20 years.

512
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,720
You took it a couple years ago and it's still going on.

513
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,500
At some point, you heard the show on LSD.

514
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:32,720


515
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,740
And that's what has happened.

516
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,560
Well, he did about 23,000 hits, you see.

517
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,240
Who did?

518
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,420
But sometimes you never come down.

519
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,020
Awesome.

520
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,740
One time I went up to the top of Dockstock Mountain and I got trapped up there.

521
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
I climbed up to the very, very tip top.

522
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,580
I took every kind of drug, no demand.

523
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,660
I got so high, I was like smoking banana peels.

524
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:02,420
I was scraping up the inside of every kind of weird seed, you know, those Hawaiian wood

525
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:02,700
ropes.

526
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,800
Those seeds, weird stuff.

527
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,220
Yeehaw.

528
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,100
Those will make you crazy.

529
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:11,820
And finally, I was so high at the top of Dockstock Mountain that I couldn't come down.

530
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,180
Off the mountain or off the high?

531
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,480
I was stuck up there.

532
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:15,940
Well, both.

533
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,660
I mean, the mountain is symbolic for the high.

534
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,860
Phineas Narco knows that feeling.

535
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,500
The mountain is just a metaphor.

536
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,660
Have you ever done a port-a-potty at Grateful Dead concert?

537
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
You mean like snorted port-a-potty?

538
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,120
Which is related to port-a-potty at Burning Man concert.

539
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,520
I've injected port-a-potty, but I've snorted it.

540
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,140
As a ranger, I've had to peel.

541
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,120
Peel people's minds out of the port-a-potty.

542
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,040
I snorted some port-a-potty one time.

543
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,780
Some bad, that blue stuff, man.

544
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,520
Don't do that.

545
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,880
It'll really rip your nose.

546
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,520
It's like little fish hooks.

547
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,160
It's like snorting fish hooks.

548
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,020
You have to dilute it with something.

549
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,420
You can't just take great port-a-potty.

550
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,420
You gotta mix it up with something.

551
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,260
Yeah, you gotta cut it, man.

552
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,900
You gotta buff it.

553
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,700
Well, you gotta let it crystallize.

554
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,020
I have always used baby powdered milk.

555
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,580
Phineas Narco was always snorting red ice.

556
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,740
Lactose.

557
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,680
Lactic acid.

558
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,580
Shut up or stand up.

559
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,540
That's the main thing.

560
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,920
Station are we listening to?

561
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,240
That would be...

562
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,300
On your radio dial with

563
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,580
me and Berkley.

564
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,960
And the fungus shrouded valley.

565
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,960
Don't touch the fungus.

566
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,200
You'll get so high, man.

567
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,900
You'll get so high, you can't come down.

568
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,540
Too late.

569
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,140
No, no, no.

570
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,400
And then you know what?

571
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,240
As soon as you get so high, you can't come down.

572
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,040
You have to move your tent.

573
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,100
I will.

574
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,080
There's a new other place.

575
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,680
Then you have to come back your tent and all your stuff.

576
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,360
So now all your stuff's in the tent.

577
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,860
And your tent's all up and you're too high.

578
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,000
You can't do anything.

579
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,700
In fact, you don't even pack your tent.

580
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,540
You just pick it up off the ground.

581
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,320
Come on, we gotta go.

582
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,720
If I could move the tent, I would move the tent.

583
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,000
You just drag the tent.

584
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,000
I have the intent to move the tent.

585
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,320
Some people just drag their tents behind them.

586
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,140
Some people would just pick up the tent and throw it in the truck.

587
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,160
And one guy is driving your car and he's so high that he can't breathe.

588
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,080
He's on tenterhooks.

589
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,980
He's like laying out of the side of the truck.

590
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,160
He's on a truck.

591
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,320
Dragging along the ground while the tent is being dragged behind the truck.

592
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,860
Somebody put bomb right under the word stop.

593
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,240
It's all over Arkansas.

594
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,980
Well, you can get anything.

595
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,880
Everything's possible.

596
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,140
I mean, assuming that it doesn't violate the law of identity or existence.

597
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,180
Blob stop.

598
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,820
Oh, I want to go to that movie.

599
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,820
In Amsterdam, it's November, but I'm not going to miss it.

600
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,620
Why?

601
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,480
Hydrate the kitty cat.

602
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:31,620
Yeah.

603
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,380
Awesome.

604
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,440
KPFA.

605
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,260
Dr. Hal Puzzling Evidence.

606
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,980
Philo Drummond and special guest Phineas Narco.

607
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,940
And now, back to the doctors.

608
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:47,780
Back in time to 1981 Byron Werner's Doctor's Collage and even Dr. Neuroberger.

609
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,120
Doctors for Bob.

Doctors Doctors.

622
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:17,900
Doctors.

623
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,180
Doctors.

624
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,440
Doctors for sane CCP.

625
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,340


626
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,340


627
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,680
Doctors for you.

628
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,760
Doctors for the mind of the doctor.

629
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,980
Doctors for the mind of the doctor.

630
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,080
Doctors for the...

631
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,180

632
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,560
Doctors for the...

633
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:28,780

634
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,200

635
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,520

Doctor for Wotan.

639

Doctor for Wotan.

640
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,580
You have assumed control.

641
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,200
Your mind is no longer your own.

642
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,240
I have no mind.

643
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,660
I have no mind.

644
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,760
My mind is not my mind.

645
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:59,700
Cast off the imperialized brains of normalcy!

646
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,560
You do what I do!

647
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,740
Cuz Bob told me to!

648
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,920
You do, what you do, cuz you want to!

649
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,500
I do what I do, cuz Bob told me to!

650
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,900
You do, what you do, cuz you want to!

651
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,480
I do what I do, cause Bob told me to.

652
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,300
Let it go, Bob.

653
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:39,740
I told you, I want to see Dr. Hold-I-Read-Gypsy-Doctor.

654
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,840
Oh, wait a minute. Is that Dr. Repeat-I-Read-Gypsy-Doctor?

655
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,280
Dr. Stang, are you, in fact, a doctor for Bob?

656
00:25:49,940 --> 00:26:00,820
I'm a healer, I'm a surgeon, I've got knives, scalpels, gas, pills, anesthetics, and musical instruments I don't know how to play. I am a doctor!

657
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,020
A doctor for Bob?

658
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,920
We bring him back to life and then we kill him again!

659
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,360
I went and seen myself a doctor. And he gave me a great big bottle of...

660
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,480
Don't take him there, kid.

661
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,180
Stop!

662
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,500
He's been killed, he's awake!

663
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:27,480
It's probably time for a little stimulation there, cadet. So why not get up and move a little? Comedy is comedy, but some rhythm tossed in can do anything but help. Let it go, Bob.

664
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,760
Whoa! They say the biggest headache, the biggest appeal, baby. Call me the big peel.

665
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,820
We're here to make dark with the War Change Jam with the Pub Network Chicago, and I'd like to know if St. Sulu-Lac of the Hogwoods are in the way.

666
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,440
Are you a doctor for Bob?

667
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:56,600
I am! This is the beginning of a new life for me as a saint of the hog butchers of the West. As a new man, I'm free! I'm free!

668
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,860
Yes, but are you a doctor for Bob?

669
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:05,300
This proves it! The fact that I'm a doctor for Bob proves that I'm free. Only a doctor for Bob can be free.

670
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,080
Thanks, Bob.

671
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,660
Thanks, Bob.

672
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
Dr. Bob, don't let him kill you.

673
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,120
I do what I do, cause Bob told me to.

674
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:21,300
No, I don't believe the charges of brainwashing here. I've been labeled as a subdued surgeon.

675
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,860
I do what I do, cause Bob told me to. You do what you do, cause you want to.

676
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:33,300
I don't use such techniques as brainwashing, uh, brain surgery in order to assure loyalty.

677
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,760
There's another better version here.

678
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,680
Dave can translate.

679
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,080
Votions?

680
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,000
We have a guest.

681
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,140
As the words in German, I'm...

682
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,580
Hurry up, baby. The dog is running.

683
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,200
Hurry up, bus.

684
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,100
My heart, my heart is humping.

685
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,840
Okay, we're surrounding the sushi shop.

686
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,000
Pumping, I think she said.

687
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,040
We're surrounding the sushi shop.

688
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,240
Sushi shop.

689
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,400
Looking for gas.

690
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,080
Fugu, too.

691
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,140
Then we jump up in the air.

692
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,160
And...

693
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,000
She said a song.

694
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,900
We goose a noon.

695
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,720
What she said?

696
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,340
A ganoon.

697
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,620
Those Finnish bands do these rock songs about mundane stuff like waiting for the bus.

698
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,160
They're singing about cardamom me bread right now.

699
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,980
I think they're singing about cardamom me bread.

700
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,100
Don't they have a cool word for cool? Like, cool.

701
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,480
Do we got any chai?

702
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,240
It is so cool.

703
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,500
It's spelled K-U-U-L-L.

704
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,360
You're in the cool hole.

705
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,920
I'm in the sea hole.

706
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,840
Cool hole, man.

707
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,480
Well, you are speaking of the sea hole. What is in the news today?

708
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,320
A huge, a huge opening in the ocean floor that is engulfing very many species of foul underbird.

709
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,980
You're not the underbird, the overbird.

710
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,040
Oh, baby, I see your sea hole opening.

711
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,840
Yes, when you see it, it's already too late. For you, anyway.

712
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,100
It's Sakiwara.

713
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,060
You don't hear of this? You don't know about this phenomenon?

714
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,580
Yeah, they suck you right in.

715
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,660
That's why most guys in Finland play in bands.

716
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,140
Is to get away from the sea hole.

717
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,920
To get into the sea hole.

718
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,580
Into the sea hole.

719
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,880
To flush, to be flushed and sucked down the sea hole.

720
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,780
I have personal experience of how they shoot.

721
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,500
Cool hole, because it's cool, you know.

722
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,740
And all Finns speak that.

723
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,220
Cool hole.

724
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,540
Like this.

725
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,900
We shoot the Russian.

726
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,700
Euro music.

727
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,460
Then we shoot the Russian again.

728
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,220
The goddamn Russian music.

729
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,220
And blow up the steam bath.

730
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,760
So we shoot the Russian again.

731
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,420
That's a real one, though.

732
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,400
I was born.

733
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,700
I was born.

734
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,420
Oh, we're from the New Dakota.

735
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,020
I was born.

736
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:02,660
Let's return to John Walters holds the office of director of the office of director of the office of director of the office of national drug czar.

737
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,520
What's it all about?

738
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,700
I think we want money.

739
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,480
John Walters holds the nation's drug czar.

740
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
I recognize.

741
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,840
My pleasure.

742
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,340
And we push back together.

743
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,440
But we want money.

744
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,600
Thanks for being here this morning.

745
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,260
My money outside.

746
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,300
John Walters.

747
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,400
Sorry.

748
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,220
Thanks.

749
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,400
So they might be.

750
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,900
I'm a doctor for Bob.

751
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:54,540
And let me say that prior to this moment, I had the least ability to understand the doctors for Bob of any subgenius in the church.

752
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:05,440
But tonight, with our artist elimination experiment being such a success, I truly feel that I am for the first time a true doctor for Bob.

753
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,460
But Bobby is bigger than I.

754
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,200
You're the best doctor for Bob.

755
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,340
Oh, I think he's caught it.

756
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,060
Doctor, give him something for his cough.

757
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,620
All right.

758
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,280
All right.

759
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,360
Here's a quarter.

760
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,920
Oh, that's not much.

761
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,920
Not much of a cough.

762
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,700
Well, thanks, Douglas.

763
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,360
I'll take over.

764
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,460
That's all right.

765
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,120
You'll be yourself again in a minute.

766
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,240
I'm, I'm so sorry, everybody.

767
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,440
Why don't you just drink this.

768
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,660
I knew you were a doctor for Bob.

769
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,220
I am a doctor for Bob.

770
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,360
I'm a mean son killing, wise beast.

771
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,440
And a man.

772
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,440


773
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,440


774
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,440


775
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,440


776
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,440


777
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,440


778
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,640
Asshole, reeman, eardrum split, hell of a doctor's for Bob.

779
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,220
I don't feel well.

780
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,060
What's the matter with you?

781
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,160
Oh, I don't know.

782
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,220
I was the doctor and he told me what to do, but I didn't do it.

783
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,180
He said to take one pill three times a day, but you can't do that.

784
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,500
I think I'd rather die than do that.

785
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,020
Man, it's a gas.

786
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:17,560
I figure, you know, some of those roaches they put out in grass and the glass acid will put you on the moon in an hour.

787
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,780
But reality, that's where it's happening.

788
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:20,980
What?

789
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,360
What's the use of pretending?

790
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,700
I can't stand this anymore.

791
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,900
Doctor, doctor.

792
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
Doctor, please.

793
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,320
Please, doctor.

794
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,420
Chandler said you went over to Georgia Street to see that doctor.

795
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Yeah, that's right, Ed.

796
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Short visit.

797
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,860
Poor guy.

798
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:37,940
Pretty bad, huh?

799
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,340
Well, the guy's really a mess.

800
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,800
The beatnik walked up to the epileptic and said,

801
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,680
Oh, I don't hear the music, but go, baby, go!

802
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,660
Here's my million dollars.

803
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,960
Bob's Beach Party.

804
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,760
So genius.

805
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,600
One dollar.

806
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,460
Is that one dollar?

807
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,700
Ow!

808
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,700
All right.

809
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,460
Bob's Beach Party.

810
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,360
So genius.

811
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,480
Beach Party.

812
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,180
Don't I like it?

813
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,720
Do you?

814
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,540
Some genius beach party.

815
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,940
Some genius beach party.

816
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,960
I don't know if that's in commentary.

817
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,720
Yeah, because you see, I see.

818
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,380
Maybe all of the news is just pulling up instead of I'm saying it right.

819
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,960
It's like, we're going to get him.

820
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,420
We're going to do this.

821
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,460
We're going to make it happen.

822
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,940
Everybody in the Russian world is screaming shock.

823
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,060
But yeah, Osama bin Laden is back up.

824
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,440
He's making statements now.

825
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,960
He has another eye on him.

826
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,160
I don't know if I have the resources.

827
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,720
sources going into that.

828
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,780
Trying to find that guy.

829
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,200
And continue to find him.

830
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,820
And the guy who flew the planes into the world

831
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,360
trade center.

832
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,940
He must be many enemies.

833
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,600
He must be.

834
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,240
Give me a break.

835
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,780
What did I do?

836
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,000
That's what you're trying to do.

837
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,740
You're trying to confuse our

838
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,580
top of the mountain.

839
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,540
Yes, he's laughing gently and sharply.

840
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,620
He just read a story.

841
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,480
I know he's ready to punch him.

842
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,580
But folks, that is true.

843
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,520
I mean, why are we then the CIA?

844
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,820
Instead of, you know,

845
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,060
then they go over

846
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,220
and they're going to shoot Americans.

847
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,360
And then that's a great club.

848
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,120
And that would be the end of the world.

849
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,920
When it goes to the ground and water

850
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
and you go into federal penitentiary.

851
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,700
Well, it's a known fact that

852
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,280
John Mastrop is a perverse

853
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,680
and an ultimate monkey.

854
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,600
You know, he's been in all those evangelical groups

855
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,160
where he has pursued his mission.

856
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,860
He's going to be a president for the next 10 years.

857
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,200
Well, I mean,

858
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,020
you're saying what they say in other media

859
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,820
like Radio Netherlands, BBC,

860
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,360
Small Radio, Ireland,

861
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,680
France International,

862
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,700
the federal jail in Ireland.

863
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,840
No, no, no.

864
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,200
They're going to invite me to preach.

865
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,400
Please get off the seat.

866
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,480
I'm going to turn you into a man.

867
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,860
They push the right button to push your button

868
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,500
that holds you with more button pushing

869
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
to make you a button.

870
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,360
I can't deal with that crap.

871
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,700
Yes, but it's poetry.

872
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,940
It is poetry.

873
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,380
You've got to see that poetry.

874
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,840
I can't just rap and rag that glue.

875
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,160
You've got to recall it.

876
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,760
No poetic.

877
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,920
I know.

878
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,140
All right, I'm sorry.

879
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,640
Well, I'm doing all the right things

880
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,980
to make you shut the door.

881
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,740
Who do you see as, um,

882
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,940
coming out of the door

883
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,460
and slamming back shut?

884
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,720
Actually, that will save your life

885
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,320
for the next 10 years.

886
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,920
Watch, I'm going to go get shot right now

887
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
because somebody's in the door.

888
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,680
I'd like to see you reach land

889
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,260
or you're in a sand, folks,

890
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,600
doing the regular deal

891
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,760
at the road to Baghdad.

892
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,520
It's all 43.

893
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,860
If we were to have a USO group

894
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,300
for nowadays, you know,

895
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,560
in 33 seconds.

896
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:33,840
Right.

897
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,020
Wait.

898
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,160
Wait.

899
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,360
Wait.

900
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,360
Evangelical Christians

901
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,420
with very, very long earrings.

902
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,040
Headphones.

903
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,840
The kind that, you know,

904
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,540
they have those bowling ball earrings

905
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,080
that extract the ear stuff.

906
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,660
And, um,

907
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,800
who would be Ben Clausboy

908
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,820
and who would be Jeff Boop?

909
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,800
I mean, Bob,

910
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,540
I've heard that the bowling alleys

911
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,600
are now...

912
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,560
Kuwaiti stuff?

913
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
No, bowling alleys

914
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,540
are now trying to outreach

915
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,840
to more people to come in.

916
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,000
And they've made bowling balls

917
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
much bigger now.

918
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,360
Well, haven't you seen

919
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,460
the weird W with the K?

920
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,240
The crown on it

921
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,760
on top of the bowling ball logo?

922
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,500
That is an invitation

923
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,340
to every American

924
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,180
and their families

925
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,820
to get out

926
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,960
and blow some more.

927
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,800
So, bowling is...

928
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,140
There's something about that.

929
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,160
The rave clubs.

930
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,700
Now, what if you wore

931
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,300
a glow stick

932
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,340
to the bowling alley?

933
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,320
You would probably

934
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,420
be absconded

935
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,140
by a few shots.

936
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,680
Well, I'm a federal agent.

937
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,080
I would hope so.

938
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,700
I mean, I would hope

939
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,580
it wouldn't be the waitress

940
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,540
because they're armed, too, now.

941
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,620
But if a federal agent

942
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,100
got you,

943
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,260
there'd be no easy coming.

944
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:32,780
I mean, the kicks

945
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,340
are pretty good.

946
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,040
French fries.

947
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:34,900
Yeah, I mean,

948
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,860
mashed pizza.

949
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,460
You know what I mean?

950
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,460
French fries,

951
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,080
a little bit of beer.

952
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,060
Yep.

953
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,840
She's packing.

954
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,000
Absolutely written.

955
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,600
She's packing.

956
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,540
What do they call it?

957
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,140
A Mach 9 or Mach 12

958
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,880
or whatever it is.

959
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,620
Yeah.

960
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,280
So, everybody's

961
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,940
packing nowadays.

962
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,060
Heat, we're talking about.

963
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,000
We're talking about

964
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,600
how everybody,

965
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,840
including their own mother,

966
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,120
is armed to the teeth.

967
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,460
And the teeth

968
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,020
aren't included

969
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,540
in the army.

970
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,300
I guess...

971
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,980
No, sir.

972
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,860
No, sir.

973
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,560
I'm not going to

974
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,220
come in

975
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,100
and do the teeth

976
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,620
with arms.

977
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,120
I am toothless

978
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,260
and without arms.

979
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,000
And yet,

980
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,840
you kick me

981
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,020
with that jackboot.

982
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,440
I turn my other

983
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,100
body king

984
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,920
to the sky

985
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
and I pray

986
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,060
to whatever

987
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,200
invisible god

988
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,860
may come

989
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,020
to my assistance

990
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,160
to help.

991
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,940
I flinched

992
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,780
because I had

993
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,520
no books

994
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
and then I met

995
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:28,900
a man

996
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,320
who had no arms.

997
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,380
I don't want

998
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,080
to be a general

999
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,820
minister.

1000
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,180
I don't want

1001
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,040
to believe

1002
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,520
names

1003
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,520


1004
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,520


1005
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,520


1006
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,520


1007
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,520


1008
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,520


1009
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,520


1010
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,520


1011
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,520


1012
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,880
means

1013
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,220
helps

1014
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,220


1015
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,220


1016
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,420
there's

1017
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:52,540
an

1018
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:52,540


1019
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:52,540


1020
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:52,540


1021
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:52,540


1022
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,460
let

1023
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:53,580
till

1024
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:53,600
the

1025
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:53,620
day

1026
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,620


1027
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,620


1028
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,620


1029
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,620


1030
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,760
on

1031
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,200
the

1032
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,220
planet.

1033
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1034
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,960
now

1035
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,040
is

1036
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,120
certainly

1037
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


1038
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


1039
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


1040
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


1041
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


1042
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120


1043
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,360
that

1044
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:56,580
says

1045
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:56,920
up

1046
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,440
there.

1047
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:58,640


1048
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:58,780
have

1049
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:58,940
on

1050
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,340
target

1051
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,440
received

1052
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,260
An Iraqi regime could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes.

1053
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,560
The UN Security Council must be disarmed.

1054
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,980
These requirements will be met.

1055
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,420
It may be too late.

1056
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,200
The danger to our country is grave.

1057
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,480
The regime is seeking the future of peace.

1058
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,640
We know destructive technologies.

1059
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,980
We know hatred.

1060
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:50,660
We are engaged in a deliberate and continuing bad faith and deception.

1061
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,920
The United States Congress has waged a war against its neighbors.

1062
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,460
It has sponsored and sheltered terrorists.

1063
00:38:59,460 --> 00:38:59,460


1064
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,760
It's led by a dangerous and brutal man.

1065
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,900
He must be stopped.

1066
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,920
And our friends and our allies.

1067
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,560
When they fully materialized.

1068
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
The danger to our country is grave.

1069
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,580
The Iraqi regime is the only choice.

1070
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,440
I want to thank the scientists and Al Qaeda terrorists for their tremendous support.

1071
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:29,440


1072
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,380
They have done tremendous work in building nuclear weapons.

1073
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,720
Women have been systematically raped on the floor of the Senate this morning.

1074
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,240
Political prisoners are made to watch their own children being tortured.

1075
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,980
Leaders of the House and the Senate from both political parties after the order was given.

1076
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,740
Because they are different faces of the same evil.

1077
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,180
To ensure compliance. Period.

1078
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,540
The course of action may bring many sacrifices.

1079
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,880
Yet delay, indecision and inaction could lead to a massive and sudden horror.

1080
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,080
And we will face it together.

1081
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm confident that members of both parties will violate every pledge to friend an enemy alike.

1082
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,540
To escape.

1083
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,040
By timely and resolute action we can move incriminating evidence.

1084
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,360
Thank you all for coming.

1085
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,520
Thank you all for coming.

1086
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,360
Apocalypse number nine by T. Watts.

1087
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,940
Also known as Brainwave93 at Hotmail.com.

1088
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:58,980
201.

1089
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,300
1-1-2-1-1.

1090
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,360
And I'm all ears.

1091
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,280
This is a

1092
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,680
famous

1093
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,540
In- sausage.

1094
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,060
Thank you.

1095
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,120
Thank you.

1096
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,280
Thank you.

1097
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,220
Thank you.

1098
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:03,920
Thank you.

1099
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,680
Thank you.

1100
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,500
Thank you.

1101
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,920
Thank you.

1102
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,240
Thank you.

1103
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,140
Thank you.

1104
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,640
Thank you.

1105
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,980
Thank you.

1106
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,820
Thank you.

1107
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,340
Thank you.

1108
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,980
Bye.

1109
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,480
Thank you.

1110
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,620
Thank you.

1111
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,300
Thank you.

1112
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,120
video.

1113
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,240
Here we go.

1114
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,800
Watch this.

1115
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,260
Watch this.

1116
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,880
Long live the new Flash Man.

1117
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,880
So is the

1118
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,480
current 20-year-old

1119
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,620
is the current

1120
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,700
20-year-old ready to

1121
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,440
take on the responsibility

1122
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,700
of administering theft

1123
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,340
around the world?

1124
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,660
Is the MTV

1125
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,280
generation

1126
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,320
ready to kill?

1127
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,400
Well, as long as you do it

1128
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,540
in a push-button style,

1129
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,040
you know,

1130
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,620
in their style,

1131
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,380
like they've been trained with the video

1132
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,480
games, computer games.

1133
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,000
Right.

1134
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,940
If they can run the robots

1135
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,540
correctly,

1136
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,320
that's the way to train

1137
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:45,800
a robot.

1138
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,100
You have to know how to deal with the robot.

1139
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,780
You have to know how to deal with the robot.

1140
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,920
The robot rejects your treatments.

1141
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,800
Because the robot didn't have a mother,

1142
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,360
so it doesn't help to, you know,

1143
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,160
you can't really insult it.

1144
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,460
You are right.

1145
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,420
In the same way we could insult one of our regular citizens.

1146
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,480
A robot does have a

1147
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,660
very delicately, firmly-tuned

1148
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,160
safe.

1149
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,340
It can be violated by certain

1150
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,100
statements.

1151
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,700
Certain ideas do

1152
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,920
rub the robot away.

1153
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:19,500
Oh, my.

1154
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:22,980
And you can't say,

1155
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,340
you can't say.

1156
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,240
That's a

1157
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,640
very much a

1158
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:26,980
habit.

1159
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,460
It's not a

1160
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,060
What is your major malfunction,

1161
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:30,920
you nut?

1162
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,860
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you enough attention

1163
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,440
when you were a child?

1164
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,800
In the army,

1165
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,540
you can do as you please.

1166
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,040
In the army,

1167
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,480
you can soften your knees.

1168
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,080
In the army,

1169
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:52,260


1170
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,160
You can read me

1171
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,320
Go, go, go

1172
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,000
Go, go, USA

1173
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,780
You guys gotta cross our nose, not hop it

1174
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,060
Sorry, sir

1175
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,100
Doing my best

1176
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,320
Hop it, hop it, hop it

1177
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,400
Hop it, hop it, hop it

1178
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,380
Hop it, hop it, hop it

1179
00:50:48,660 --> 00:51:09,800
Hop it, hop it, hop it

1180
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,060
I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood

1181
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,300
With you, so

1182
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,640
Let's make the most of this beautiful day

1183
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,480
Since we're together, we might as well say

1184
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,920
You'll be my neighbor

1185
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,440
Won't you please

1186
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,520
Won't you please

1187
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,680
Won't you be my neighbor

1188
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,240
Won't you be my neighbor

1189
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,420
Won't you be my neighbor

1190
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,760
I'm glad we're together again

1191
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,400
They're all prod of people

1192
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,100
Powerful, rich people

1193
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,420
Chaz, the wild

1194
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,280
Wild, wild

1195
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,100
Wild, wild

1196
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,620
Wild, wild

1197
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,340
Wild, wild

1198
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,480
Wild, wild

1199
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:58,700
Wild, wild

1200
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:58,800
Wild, wild

1201
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,120
Chaz, I'm looking for the new

1202
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,860
Chaz, I'm looking for the new

1203
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,980
But the hour of slack is not.

1204
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,360
Continuing with our history of Doctors for Bob,

1205
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,420
we first hear the band in its original 1980 incarnation,

1206
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,340
little more than animalistic grunting by the great Snavely Eklund,

1207
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,820
with fitful primitive drumming on tin cans and shoe boxes.

1208
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,340
By contrast, we hear Doctors for Wotan,

1209
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:19,860
with garage sale electric instruments played by non-musicians.

1210
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,340
Jane or Hyperclete's ranting in this example.

1211
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,220
There's no corpse there.

1212
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:45,340
This is the first composition by the fledgling bassist Pope Sternodox

1213
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,860
to gain mass airplay, the Doctors for Bob theme.

1214
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,840
Doctors for Bob.

1215
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,840
Doctors for Crager.

1216
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,340
Doctors for Crager.

1217
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,800
Doctors for Odie.

1218
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,580
Doctors for Wotan.

1219
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,120
Doctors for Odie.

1220
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,840
Doctors for Odie.

1221
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:04,840


1222
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:04,840


1223
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,280
Doctors for Odie.

1224
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,100
Doctors.

1225
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:07,920
Doctors.

1226
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,820
Doctors for the law.

1227
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:13,920
God!

1228
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,460
Stop now!

1229
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,540
Uh, yes.

1230
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,540
How many more times do we have to listen?

1231
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,140
Uh, by 1984.

1232
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,100
1984's Doc Stock number one.

1233
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,760
All the Doctor bands were destroying all instruments

1234
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,280
in songs lasting literally for hours or even days.

1235
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,040
They just want to fall asleep.

1236
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,300
Yeah, the audience is going in every different direction possible.

1237
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,820
Oh, they're sick of them.

1238
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,040
They're sick of the Café Depresso.

1239
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,520
Oh, yeah, they're sick of everything here.

1240
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:58,080
They only know three chords, but you're only going to see them play one.

1241
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,680
I'm so tired of these guys.

1242
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,860
This band's bad.

1243
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,520
It's no surprise.

1244
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,940
I wish they'd just pack it up and go away.

1245
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:23,200
Well, how many times do we have to play this same song over and over and over again?

1246
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:33,900
Well, how many times do we have to play this same four notes over and over again?

1247
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:43,180
When I carried on the Vistach club, I thought things would be a little bit different.

1248
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,200
But it's just the same old band.

1249
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,540
In the same stupid shirts.

1250
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,800
In the same stupid bleach ahead.

1251
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,180
Yeah, they're like, why are we still here?

1252
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1253
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,180


1254
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,800
You think they could do something new after all these years?

1255
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,280
But they just play that same song.

1256
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:04,100
They just play that song all night long.

1257
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:15,500
Well, how many more times do they have to play this same song over and over again?

1258
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:24,160
You are listening to The Hour of Slack from Church of the Subgenius, www.subgenius.com.

1259
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,540
One chord down.

1260
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,820
Rotam music's got me down.

1261
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,940
I played in this band for ten hours or so.

1262
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,620
I ain't seen my check.

1263
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,020
Where's my check?

1264
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,520
Oh, where's my check?

1265
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,480
Well, how many times do we have to play this song over and over again?

1266
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:50,780
We'll have to ask for that same check over and over again.

1267
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:57,240
Praise Bob and praise the doctors, dear friends.

1268
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,500
And it's all at www.subgenius.com.

1269
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,400
Over and over and over again.

1270
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,480
This sure is a bad band.

1271
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,220
They really won't make anybody.

1272
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,480
Over and over and over again.

1273
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,060
I don't even know why they're playing here.

1274
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,020
Nobody likes them.

1275
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,760
Everybody wants them to play quiet.

1276
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,880
Well, I just don't know about this band.

1277
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,640
I just don't know why they do it.

1278
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,780
Well, I guess they're supposed to be on the radio tonight.

1279
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,320
But I sure wouldn't know if I listened to this crap.

1280
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,180
I hope somebody out there is listening.

1281
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,380
I hope somebody can hear this band.

1282
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,920
This is the international signal of distress.

1283
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,260
We need to get out of this.

1284
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,300
