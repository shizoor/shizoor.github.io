The Subgenius Power of Smudging!

14
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:08,600
me I mean it's hey that's all wrong no it's right my way though it's it's wrong

15
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:16,240
for you but it's right for me no this is wrong it's a perfect balance no no no

16
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:31,560
versus the reward Ian easy staying yeah he's got what's the ADHD yeah CD says what we need

17
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,380
to stick together together together we're almost an alphabet I was telling my grandson could finish

18
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,900
this puzzle game in two hours it took me two days and he goes I'm smarter than you and I said your

19
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,220
brain works faster for sure

20
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:56,020
but I know a lot more so we need to work together kid and I'm convinced that that that's what you

21
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:05,000
have to do the speed of thought might be overrated my wife is a complete reward Ian hoarding now do

22
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:14,860
the to the grandson space legos do they do the legos the kids yeah I haven't I don't like your

23
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,280
devices

24
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,980
they

25
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,000
they

26
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,220
they

27
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,380
, they've been into all the kid fads but Legos is old time well see that's the thing I I asked my

28
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:28,260
daughter to get me this Lego cake so I thought oh that'll be relaxing for me so I can ever get

29
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:36,480
me this Saturn 5 replica of the Lego thing right and I'm like I'm all I'm a jam this out right well

30
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,200
I get about third way done and there's just one little thing that I didn't do right so I gotta

31
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,640
take it all apart I don't think I'm ever gonna finish that project

32
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,140
I'm out here and I'm out of here okay I was working a обязательно in his own heads or some cheese

33
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,600
while using and all over you know we're all favorite now we'll talk about zeg hyena that's

34
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:04,920
course together level taeju's name with flour just got more progression but he only makes

35
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,480
letters on my a megandy so much 88 males how many years old is Niki where we all know abuction

38
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,220
moving I know this is just about money man for me and Ally of course they learned bar uh and this is pure

39
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,200
liked much better, American plastic bricks.

40
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,280
Yes, American plastic bricks were great.

41
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,560
They overlapped and so on.

42
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,860
They were somewhat like LEGOs.

43
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,840
But with them, it was all about building miniature

44
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,940
buildings with windows and

45
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,920
tablatures and doors and stairways, chimneys, all that

46
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,080
stuff with the bricks.

47
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,720
You could get them all interlocked and make perfect

48
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,640
buildings, but yes.

49
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,260
Those are real hard to find now.

50
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,840
I know.

51
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,420
Well, they broke very easily.

52
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,640
They weren't tough like LEGOs.

53
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,760
Nothing can break them.

54
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,840
Then there was the kits that had little plastic girders and

55
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,960
panels that you made skyscrapers out of.

56
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,500
Yes.

57
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,740
Well, the erector set was metal in my game.

58
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,920
The erector set was metal.

59
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,420
I'm talking about plastic skyscrapers.

60
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:06,820
Meccano?

61
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,360
Yeah, it had a little plastic thing, and you had a little

62
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,620
friction gun that you melted the girders to each other with

63
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,040
friction.

64
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,260
Then you'd put little plastic sheets on them.

65
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,400
You could build these really elaborate skyscrapers.

66
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,440
But it was kind of a gyp toy because once you had soldered

67
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
the girders together-

68
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,660
Why would you solder them?

69
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,500
They just snapped together.

70
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,340
Well, I'm just telling you my version of that toy.

71
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,560
Mine didn't snap together.

72
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,260
You had to get the end of it gluey with this little friction

73
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,460
thing that spun around, and then you stuck it to another

74
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:36,920
girder.

75
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,740
Are you sure that you just didn't read the instructions?

76
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,060
Maybe I was doing it wrong.

77
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
Maybe you were doing it wrong.

78
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:44,980
I think you were doing it wrong.

79
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,180
I was just randomly customizing it.

80
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,700
I think I'm going to find that toy.

81
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,880
There are so many of us that did.

82
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,740
But once again, we're talking about toys that existed in the

83
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,000
60s, and nobody even knows what the hell we're talking about

84
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,340
now.

85
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,220
The 60s?

86
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,620
I was talking about the 50s.

87
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,300
But in the 60s, things came in like the great

88
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,060
Garlue and so forth.

89
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,140
Oh, I wanted the great Garlue so bad.

90
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,700
Yeah, the other kids all had it.

91
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,540
I'll have one tomorrow.

92
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,480
I wasn't allowed to get a great Garlue either.

93
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,540
I was told it was ridiculous.

94
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:14,960
I'm going to have one tomorrow.

95
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm going to have one of those.

96
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,980
The great Garlue tomorrow.

97
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,320
Anything I can remember.

98
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,780
Uh-huh.

99
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,260
And those building kits.

100
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,840
How about Robert the Robot?

101
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,880
I never had that.

102
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,840
The other kids had Robert the Robot.

103
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,460
I had Mr. Atom.

104
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,520
However, Mr. Atom had many praiseworthy features.

105
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,180
But it didn't talk like Dan.

106
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,840
Was that the one that had a top hat and went like this?

107
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,820
That's Mr. Machine, which is sort of a two-dimensional

108
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,000
robotoid thing.

109
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,220
It did have a top hat.

110
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:51,140
Mr. Atom had changeable eye lenses in his atomic eye sockets and so forth, but was mainly

111
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,500
a walking robot of the boxy kind.

112
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,240
Everybody's rock'em, sock'em robots.

113
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,200
When the Japanese actually did break that barrier and create the first humanoid

114
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:13,200
robots in 1999, the Honda Company, what was so strange was they looked like those boxy

115
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,200


116
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:21,440
robots of our childhood with feet like shoeboxes and so forth, but they could move with exquisite

117
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,800
gliding.

118
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,900
They could go up and down a flight of stairs without clank, clank, clank.

119
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,680
Dr. Al, did you see that?

120
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,200
I did.

121
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:34,940
I did.

122
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,580
I did.

123
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,160
I did.

124
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,520
I did.

125
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,620
I did.

126
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:37,840
I did.

127
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,660
I did.

128
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:38,660


129
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,060
I did.

130
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,500
I did.

131
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,440
I did.

132
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,840
I did.

133
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:41,840


134
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:41,840


135
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,180
I did.

136
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,360
I did.

137
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,120
I did.

138
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,820
I did.

139
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,580
I did.

140
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:52,820
I did.

141
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,020
I did.

142
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,240
I did.

143
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,700
I did.

144
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:53,700


145
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:53,700


146
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:53,700


147
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,680
I did it.

148
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:54,800
I did it.

149
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:54,840


150
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,180
I did it.

151
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,240
I did it.

152
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,240


153
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,300
Yeah!

154
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,740
We did it!

155
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:55,840
We managed it!

156
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,020


157
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,160
A friendly ride away with the Japanese

158
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,040
This is my man.

159
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,160
This is my man.

160
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,340
This is my man.

161
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,900
This is my man.

162
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,780
Dr. Hal, did you see that darling thing that just entered the room?

163
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,440
Reverend Trixie Von Mothersbaugh.

164
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,820
She looks so cute.

165
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,160
She looks like a little raggedy.

166
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,680
She's a little raggedy and all.

167
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,860
You just want to hug her and tickle her.

168
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,460
She had little cute ears on.

169
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,680
She did such a great show yesterday.

170
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,540
I know.

171
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,260
I missed it.

172
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm really sorry.

173
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,060
I was holed up.

174
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,200
It was hidden in the rain or something.

175
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,200
I missed your show.

176
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,880
Well, today is the day of heat that replaces the day of wet, and it will take its toll, certainly.

177
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,520
Theoretically, I'll see videos and get all the audio and stuff.

178
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,200
I'd love your outfits, man.

179
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,360
They're just so cute.

180
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,960
Well, they're very elegant, and they raise our spirits.

181
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:22,760
Yeah.

182
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,400
Yeah.

183
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,740
She looks like she just walked out of an MGM musical, lollipop.

184
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,240
Could be.

185
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,620
Song, movie or something.

186
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:33,780
Yeah.

187
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm not so fond of MGM myself.

188
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,960
Everybody loves it.

189
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,360
But really, all it was is that Louis Meyer had more money.

190
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm not so fond of MGM myself.

191
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:41,500


192
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,440
I'm more fond of MGM myself, I think, than anybody else.

193
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,740
MGM made a lot of crap, which was supposed to be top of the line, in my opinion.

194
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,680
Anyway, tomorrow we won't have to worry about any of that.

195
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:01,320
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow will no longer creep in a petty pace from day to day.

196
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,380
We can make any day last as long as we want.

197
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,680
There will be no days.

198
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,000
And all our yesterdays will be retrievable.

199
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,160
Well, actually, tomorrow's—

200
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,480
And not lost in the dust of time.

201
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,700
Tomorrow will be the last tomorrow, correct?

202
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,380
Because after tomorrow, time really isn't going to have definitions like today and tomorrow

203
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:19,820
and whatnot.

204
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,680
It'll be whatever you want.

205
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:20,980
Right.

206
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,360
Exactly.

207
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,900
I'll probably keep the same rhythms on my escape planet.

208
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,360
That's smart.

209
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,600
Because mine—I'm not thinking in terms of a large spacecraft for myself.

210
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,940
I'm thinking in terms of a large planet that I can—and there's no limit, see, to your—anything

211
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,220
you can imagine you can have.

212
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,940
And my main interest is actually in the life forms of Earth.

213
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,520
So you can—

214
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,440
So I'm going to preserve a lot of stuff.

215
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,520
I'm not—as an evangelical, I'm not that into the destruction of all humans.

216
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,660
I really just want to torture a few special people.

217
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,500
That's a side effect.

218
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,060
Pacific people.

219
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,880
Most of them are dead, but I'm going to bring them back into the—

220
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,920
An epiphenomenon.

221
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,640
And then mostly my interest is preservation.

222
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,200
All the comic books that I lost, I'm going to get back.

223
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,200


224
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,260
Not just PDFs of them.

225
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,700
I mean the real comic book.

226
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,000
I've got the damn PDFs.

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,680
All they do is just make me slobber.

228
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,860
If only I had the paper version.

229
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,420
I think the first thing I'm going to do after I do Dr. Howell's suggestion is I'm going

230
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,740
to make the alphabet match the way I spell.

231
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,860
So that then all of my writings and stuff will be correct.

232
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,760
And everybody else will be like—

233
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,060
Oh, there you go.

234
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,600
Reverse proofreading.

235
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:35,900
Yeah.

236
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,980
Just restructure the language.

237
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,520
I've been thinking that out.

238
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,480
All you've got to do is go back in time, step on a butterfly.

239
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,340
Go back to the Cretaceous period, step on a butterfly, and when you come back, everything

240
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,900
will be spelled the way you spelled it.

241
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,900
That's an interesting thought, but Dr. Howell, would a butterfly exist in the Cretaceous

242
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,820
period?

243
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,880
I was wondering about that, but actually the latest indication—and it's always been

244
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,580
changing—is yes, because grasses might have started to exist at the very end of the Cretaceous

245
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,060
while the old Mesozoic was still going strong.

246
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,040
But God had just invented flowers around the top.

247
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,460
Yes, God put flowers around, but these were of a sort of a primitive nature, not the highly

248
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:35,860
evolved magnolia blossoms painted in the famous Rudolf Zellinger mural at Cretaceous.

249
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,540
The Peabody Museum in Yale, you know, life through the ages.

250
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:47,660
They were more like proto-flowers, but it doesn't take long for things that are on a

251
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:58,100
good course of evolving to evolve, and so you have the gymnosperms and the angiosperms.

252
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,500
So anyway, they probably had some crude butterflies, something.

253
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,520
Yeah.

254
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:03,620
Yeah.

255
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,620
They had the things before they had the insects to pollinate them, apparently.

256
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
I mean, there were lots of spiders.

257
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm sorry, I have that wrong.

258
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,980
They had the insects and then they had the things.

259
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,620
Well, you know, think about it.

260
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,820
Maybe it would be—that's why it would destroy time, because it would be like the first butterfly.

261
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,460
And then because you stepped on it, that eliminated that whole food source for the—and it could

262
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,960
be a desolate wasteland if we did that.

263
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,820
Perhaps we should heed and take heed and take caution and maybe—

264
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,400
Slay not the—

265
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:33,600
No, no, no.

266
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:33,600


267
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,680
You know, the big lesson is you go back in time to try to fix things—

268
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,200
For the last judgment draweth nigh.

269
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,400
Any time you go back in time to fix something, you break something else.

270
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,020
It always happens.

271
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,440
So you can't get back to your own timeline.

272
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,880
You have to go with this timeline that you created.

273
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,880
The church used to be much bigger until Stang went back in the timeline to fix it, and here we are.

274
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,080
Here's a screenplay that I never wrote but would be a pretty good movie.

275
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,580
Harold and Kumar meet in a—

276
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:03,580


277
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:03,760
They meet Hitler.

278
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:14,240
They go back in time to kill Hitler, but they—he hadn't joined the Nazis yet, and he's just a frustrated artist.

279
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,460
And they go, wait a minute, let's just get a whole bunch of his art and take that back.

280
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,600
It'll be worth millions, you know, in our times.

281
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,940
An original Hitler.

282
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:33,320
But they make friends with Hitler, the pre-Nazi Hitler, and he's never been laid, and he's never been high, and they get him drunk.

283
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,160
And he's not interested in the Nazis.

284
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,380
The Nazis start, you know, trying to recruit him.

285
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,260
He's like, I'll go away.

286
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,000
Fuck off.

287
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,560
I like these guys.

288
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,180
I like these guys with their pot and their beard.

289
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,700
He was party member number eight.

290
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,980
And so they go back to their own time with all these Hitler paintings, and everybody's going, who's Hitler?

291
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,280
These are mediocre landscape paintings.

292
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,080
Why the hell would we pay for these?

293
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,840
Badly done architectural renderings.

294
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,300
Well, so not only do you humiliate Hitler, but you humiliate Hitler.

295
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,300


296
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:10,160
Who, however, in this scenario is not guilty, but you prevent the suffering and the terrible war.

297
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,900
I know, but poor Hitler.

298
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:18,040
Sure, the World War II never happened, and the world is much better, but they can't sell those stupid paintings.

299
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,080
That Adolf Hitler went on to win the Nobel Priests Prize.

300
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:32,100
From PR News in Washington, I'm decrying the violent political crisis in Nicaragua, saying I'm repressing social protest to launch a nationwide collaboration.

301
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,300
The collaborative will seek data-driven answers on the causes and patterns of PR news.

302
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,360
Scientists will examine characteristics, risk factors, and interventions.

303
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,920
Tonight in Oakland, California, White House economic advisor Larry says don't go to school.

304
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,360
Meanwhile, there are reports of death threats against PR News.

305
00:20:52,340 --> 00:21:02,080
A Houston foundation is giving $2 to launch a study on hot, dry, and windy violence from other philanthropists in Santa Fe, Texas.

306
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,080


307
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,540
The New York Times says it's spreading.

308
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,560
Officials say that may help in the short term, but this is PR News in Washington.

309
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,960
I mentioned this before, but the modern world was created by Annie Oakley.

310
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,200
I told you about this, you know, the famous Little Sure Shot?

311
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,740
Yeah.

312
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,220
She could shoot. She was at Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. She was a great attraction there.

313
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,960
She used to shoot cigarettes out from between her husband's lips backwards with a rifle.

314
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,320
Looking in a mirror. She could always do it.

315
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:47,540
And one time these visiting Germans insisted, especially this one German princeling, insisted on getting down there and being the guy that she shot the cigarette out from.

316
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,540
He screamed, I insist! And he stamped his boots and so Buffalo Bill said, you know, it's his dime.

317
00:21:53,780 --> 00:22:00,160
And he's down there, he's holding the cigarette, and Annie is somewhat nervous, but she shoots and she makes the shot.

318
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,080
But four inches to the left, she's shooting.

319
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,000
And four inches to the left, there would have been no Kaiser Wilhelm.

320
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:17,620
Certainly no assassination at Sarajevo, no World War I, no angry Corporal Hitler, no Dachau, Belsen, Hiroshima, any of that.

321
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,820
All because Annie Oakley was such a good shot. She really was. It was instinctive to her.

322
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,780
But sometimes fucking up can be the greatest gift that you can give to the world.

323
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,780
That's how Bob does everything.

324
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,760
Fucking up is how I live my life.

325
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,280
I wasn't going to say anything.

326
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,540
It's a hard path I've chosen, but it's mine.

327
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,800
Yeah, you're welcome to it, Pease.

328
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,860
Yes, the way you walk is thorny, my son.

329
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,740
Well, look at this. I mean, it's succeeding. He's replaced Bob.

330
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,480
The Dobstown Weekly Whiffreader doesn't have a single picture of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

331
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,360
It has pictures of Pease.

332
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,860
It has all these hideous pictures of Pease, dozens of them.

333
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,760
Everything's about you these days, Bob.

334
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,520
They put in your picture and mine at the end.

335
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,880
All you do is fuck up.

336
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,920
I know.

337
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,920
It's a claim to fame.

338
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,020
Isn't it awesome? You fall upwards.

339
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:28,120
He's a good example of a subgenius. Almost Bob-like in his childlike simplistic idiocy.

340
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,560
You may be comforting.

341
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,500
I'm comforted by that thought.

342
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,640
You're too kind.

343
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,580
Until he purges you from the party.

344
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:42,720
In incompetence and completely shot memory, he's kind of a little bit more Bob-like than most of us.

345
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,540
What were you saying?

346
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:51,520
There is that. You're entering the fringes of overman territory, the way you've been acting, like Philo.

347
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,500
Yeah, Philo is a lot like that.

348
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,820
Internal transformation that takes place upon oneself.

349
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,300
As you near the rupture time, the landing site is here.

350
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:14,840
I'm starting to feel the power of the collective nature of the subgenius and getting excited about my pleasure vessel and the sex goddesses.

351
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,880
As Stang has said, it's very important you understand his distinction.

352
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,960
Sex goddess takes on whatever form you like.

353
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,120
You like hamsters?

354
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,200
Sex goddess is a hamster.

355
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,300
On the other hand, they employ a chemical...

356
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,980
Watch two girls making out. I'd rather be two girls making out.

357
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,500
...strong that what you want is what they are.

358
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:44,460
Even though they may look like a cross between a steel spring mattress and a giant crab or something,

359
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:52,580
with this chemical attractant, you will frenziedly copulate with these so-called sex goddesses.

360
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,640
And enjoy it.

361
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:26,080
Nor I __________________

362
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,280
Glamorous kinda wife.

363
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Flashing the cats again

364
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,360
She's calling them fat

365
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,420
She says I gotta feed them less

366
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,120
I can't do that because my furballs are the best, yes

367
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

368
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,480
Grandma lifts my cat, she says it's unbelievable

369
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,900
That I even let him get this big at all

370
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,660
I said it's not my fault, he loves to eat, he loves his treats

371
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,380
And when he's good, I feed him his favorite good old fancy feets

372
00:26:48,380 --> 00:27:18,320
I'm a cat, I'm a cat, I'm a cat, I'm a cat

373
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:44,480
I'm a cat, I'm a cat, I'm a cat

374
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:18,360
I'm a cat, I'm a cat, I'm a cat

375
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm a cat, I'm a cat, I'm a cat

376
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,860
It's a marvelous invasion of walking catfish yesterday

377
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:58,500
Well, I couldn't believe that we were all so blessed to have seen this miracle of Bob come about

378
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,360
I was told you were tripping at the time

379
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,840
Well, I stumbled here and there from place to place

380
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,700
But, you know, this is what I want to do in a wet environment

381
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,940
Some of them even wriggled into the house across the carpet and so forth

382
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,920
They are crafty devils

383
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,220
Yeah, well, it's not good for them because

384
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,560
The carpet is not wet with the dews of heaven but is dry

385
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,600
And it's scraping off the mucus layer that generally surrounds and protects them

386
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,720
It brings back memories of the failed church venture of marketing those fish as pets

387
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,720
And it did not work out well and staying had to move

388
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:46,320
My memory is vague, but I do remember that these same walking catfish created national attention a few years ago

389
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,020
There was some national story

390
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,300
About walking catfish disturbed Floridans and so forth

391
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:59,960
Yes, it was a walk across America to gather funds for the Lou Gehrig's disease

392
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,200
But they didn't have as many catfish participants as they wanted

393
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,880
So it kind of fizzled out

394
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,220
Philo's daughter was at the X-Day in Wisteria a couple of years ago

395
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,220
And she didn't want to come anywhere near the adults

396
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,500
Because she was afraid she'd see a naked person

397
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,160
She's what a prude

398
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,260
I mean, that was her choice

399
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,040
She also didn't like it when she heard bad language

400
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,360
This is the daughter of a subgenius

401
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,620
This is going to be in the Bulldada auction

402
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,140
A DVD of God's Cartoonist, the movie I was talking about yesterday

403
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,300
Yeah, I did that cover

404
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,900
What? Really?

405
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,720
A documentary by the famous Bruce Banner

406
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,360
It's possible you might even autograph it for someone, isn't it?

407
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,240
I've never met him

408
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,940
And now I'm involved in drawing another one of those

409
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,200
Yeah, I did that cover

410
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,920
And it has, yeah, it's got animated versions of Chick comics brought to life

411
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,320
Of the history of the great man

412
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,780
It's got me making a terrible mistake

413
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,980
I don't know, I hope people think I'm doing it on purpose

414
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,160
Where I mention John 3.16 instead of 3.17

415
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,860
Oh yeah, that really stood out

416
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:16,740
It did, because that's the Jesus Thumper's favorite Bible verse of all time

417
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,200
John 3.16, for him to say that

418
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,020
He so loved the world he gave his only begotten son

419
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,100
Yeah, yeah

420
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,940
There's a store in West Virginia where everything was priced

421
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,900
Three, either $3.16, $31.60

422
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,880
Jesus Christ

423
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,720
That was the only prices

424
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,780
It didn't last long

425
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm not guilty

426
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,360
Ethiopia was set to expire

427
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,160
Ethiopia was beset by a sparking of power

428
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,180
The head of the Roman Catholic Church sent a telegram to the world

429
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,300
Today saying, this is PR News

430
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,900
This don't think button goes very well with this wonderful t-shirt image

431
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,020
Of Bob's pipe smoking Bob's brain

432
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,460
It almost looks like a tree

433
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,600
I saved this one for today, it's my favorite

434
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,220
Emerging from the bowl of Bob's pipe

435
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,760
I think Aspira did this

436
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,220
Beautiful job

437
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,720
Oh yeah, it says subgenius Olympic doping committee

438
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,160
That's my favorite

439
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,280
This is me

440
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,500
See subgenius Olympics, you are not allowed to participate

441
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,900
Unless you're doping of some kind

442
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,780
Okay, we don't want really good athletes

443
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,700
Oh you could just be a dope

444
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,780
Or a dope

445
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,080
Yeah

446
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,200
And by definition, but the dope is such an ugly word

447
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,320
We prefer the term subgenius

448
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,300
There, see I do it every day

449
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,080
Why do you think they call it dope

450
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,800
Every single day

451
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,660
Yeah

452
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,500
Doping committee

453
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,180
We're gonna have our own version

454
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,100
sort of of the

455
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,000
Olympics today, we're going to have the

456
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,540
Olympics. The spectral Olympics.

457
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,940
And there will be a phallic festival

458
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,140
of fun. I saw that

459
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,820
in the schedule.

460
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,760
No, it was the Olympics,

461
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,220
wasn't it? The Olympics.

462
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,600
Well, that's easy.

463
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,520
I should win that one real easily.

464
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,060
I've got so many of them, and pretty much

465
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,240
all of them have gone

466
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,340
limp.

467
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,840
There's one that I can still crank up

468
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,980
if I work at it.

469
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,380
I was thinking, well...

470
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,280
By crank up, I mean pee.

471
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,800
Is it a manual type crank, or is it

472
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
like one of those push buttons for your blinds?

473
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,140
Both.

474
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,860
Either one.

475
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,020
Okay, that's handy.

476
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,300
It's based on a garage door opener.

477
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,100
Well, Dear Abby recommends putting

478
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,800
some sort of device in there

479
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,680
that can be activated from a remote

480
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,500
control box.

481
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,520
Lately, one of her columns

482
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,440
that I read, Dear Abby suggested

483
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,360
put a

484
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,960
thing in there.

485
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,180
That you can control with a remote control.

486
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,720
TV remote control box.

487
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
An automatic

488
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,080
stiffening device.

489
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,040
It was in her column.

490
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,180
Her serious answer to somebody's

491
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,380
question.

492
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,740
Well, I was thinking something between

493
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,960
an auto suck and a garage door opener.

494
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,820
And a garbage disposal.

495
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,180
Why not both?

496
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,520
All three, yeah.

497
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,560
Why not all three sometimes

498
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,720
comes up? I think the auto suck

499
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,440
combined with the garbage disposal

500
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,520
would be really awesome, but it depends

501
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,740
on which end you put the garbage disposal.

502
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,640
Like if it's first.

503
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,880
Oh yeah, you don't want to screw,

504
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,580
you don't want to do it when you're drunk.

505
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:25,880
Yeah.

506
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,300
Just what kind of disposal are you?

507
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,140
Stay sober for that type of pleasure.

508
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,140
Yeah.

509
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,380
As if the garbage ever really went away.

510
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,360
It never actually goes away.

511
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,640
That's the illusion.

512
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,940
That you whisk it away.

513
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,020
It's just food for the sea friends.

514
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:42,980
Uh huh.

515
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,700
That's what the garbage disposal is.

516
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,500
That's what the walking catfish eat.

517
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,740
The algal slime set to cover the earth.

518
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,580
Now is that what makes the coating on them?

519
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,520
Or that's a secretion that they exude?

520
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,340
What's a secretion?

521
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,000
The catfish.

522
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,480
Earlier you were giving a warning that

523
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,740
besides touching them because of the

524
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,180
barbs that there's a mucus.

525
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,600
Yeah, that's an interface

526
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,740
they have between themselves

527
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,140
and the environment.

528
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,080
Dr.

529
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,640
So they, but they can scrape

530
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,460
that mucus off, particularly

531
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,280
when they slither into your house

532
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,080
and are scraping across the carpet

533
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,440
and the floor. You know, you're

534
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,820
gaining no liquid

535
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,440
and you're losing that mucus.

536
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,680
So those fish had to be helped

537
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,100
out by helpful

538
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,100
human xanthia.

539
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,640
I got to be good

540
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,380
friends with several of them before

541
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,640
I cast them back into the pond.

542
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,260
Well that's good. I'm sure

543
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,660
that will count as part of your score.

544
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,480
Like I said, it's my favorite part of X-Day.

545
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,600
I've never encountered a new animal.

546
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,080
I've never encountered before.

547
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,840
Hundreds of them all over the yard.

548
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,440
All I could think of was,

549
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,440
Pee's is tripping. He's going to freak out.

550
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
It took a long time to see them.

551
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,000
But then after seeing the first one

552
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,460
we saw hundreds of them.

553
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,420
He was completely immune to it.

554
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,600
He was a regular Ken Kesey.

555
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,640
Mary Prankster's school

556
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,440
of acid overdosing.

557
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,940
And still functioning.

558
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,880
You have to be able to drive

559
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,200
a school bus while tripping

560
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,760
four hits of acid.

561
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,020
You pass the acid test.

562
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,960
Pee's passed that test yesterday.

563
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,500
I'm so proud. I can't wait to tell my mother.

564
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,720
I've passed that test so many times I don't need to take it anymore.

565
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,140
The school bus? Really?

566
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Well a school bus full of hippies.

567
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,140
Not children.

568
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,560
That would be criminal.

569
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,140
That would be irresponsible.

570
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,860
No one cares what happens to you.

571
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,300
I've ended up tripping and driving

572
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,100
but I don't recommend it.

573
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,240
When I was 18 I read

574
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,320
Tom Wolfe's

575
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,540
memorized story of the Mary Pranksters.

576
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,020
The electric Kool-Aid acid test.

577
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,040
And I distinctly remember thinking

578
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,500
man what a cool scene.

579
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,080
I wish I could do something like that.

580
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,280
Well since then

581
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,980
I've actually seen the bus movie.

582
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,780
Kesey sent it to me himself.

583
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,220
And

584
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,500
we so

585
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,040
totally outdid the Mary Pranksters

586
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,260
and Kesey.

587
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,520
We never went as far as having

588
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,080
the Hell's Angels hanging around.

589
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,640
To scare everybody.

590
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,700
And I never had to escape the police

591
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,560
in a helicopter. And I never went to prison.

592
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,340
Because we didn't have

593
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,660
LSD jars of LSD

594
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,160
around. But

595
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,280
we managed to do the big

596
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,900
national freak out thing

597
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,840
better than those guys ever dreamed of.

598
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,020
Of course they didn't have the internet.

599
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,640
They had to use 16mm cameras.

600
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,440
But then so did I

601
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,220
for a long time. Anyway

602
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,620
Kesey was a

603
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,960
subgenius. He actually

604
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,560
wanted to come.

605
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,380
He would have been at the first

606
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,520
convention if I had money for a plane ticket.

607
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,520
Not only that.

608
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,520
First church of the last laugh

609
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:55,960
also.

610
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,680
I never met Kesey.

611
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,360
But

612
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,700
his buddy Ken is still in touch.

613
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,420
And his son

614
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,220
is selling

615
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,180
Bob Blotter

616
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,140
replicas.

617
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,200
Somebody sent me a link.

618
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,540
Some asshole is selling fake ass

619
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,560
Blotter acid with Bob on it.

620
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,080
I looked at it and was like

621
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,260
Oh that's Ken Kesey's son.

622
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,860
Oh we owe them. That's okay.

623
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,760
He's allowed. I'm not going to bother him.

624
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,660
I should have hit him up for a free copy though.

625
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,100
Yeah.

626
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,300
Yeah boy. Kesey died real suddenly.

627
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,380
Exactly when he was my age.

628
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,140
67 I think.

629
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,080
Everybody thought he was just fine.

630
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,800
It was liver. Some liver thing.

631
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,160
You had a close brush a couple years ago.

632
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,300
The same thing could have happened.

633
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,600
But they rushed you in the helicopter.

634
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:45,800
Yeah.

635
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,920
I wasn't any.

636
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,560
I was just a mere 90% blockage.

637
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,380
Yeah you'd be fine.

638
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,660
I waited three hours to go to the doctor.

639
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,640
Reading about heart attacks.

640
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,000
Guys I love you so much.

641
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,140
Taking aspirin and drinking beer and thinking listen go away.

642
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,580
I'm going to take a break and let Papa Joe Mama come up here.

643
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,880
And get ready for the rest

644
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,900
of our crazy events that we got planned up.

645
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,160
The Ask Dr. Hal show.

646
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,040
Olympics.

647
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,440
Bobtism.

648
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,820
Oh man how could I forget that.

649
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,260
You've got to get.

650
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,020
I'm going to get Bobtismed again.

651
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,520
Just because I don't like it when Stang touches me.

652
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,420
Are we going to do that in the pool?

653
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,560
I think the pool.

654
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,320
There's an alligator in the damn pond.

655
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,280
We're doing it in the pool.

656
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,240
Well I heard the hot tub.

657
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,740
And I thought that's a dumb idea.

658
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,120
Too small.

659
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,180
That's just going to be a subgenius stew.

660
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,660
As somebody pointed out since all of our funk washes off into that pool water.

661
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,900
When we go home we'll be covered with each other's germs.

662
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,020
Did you say funk or stomp?

663
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't know if that's togetherness.

664
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,080
That's gross.

665
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,340
Maybe both.

666
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Keep the PH of that pool balanced.

667
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,160
Stomach turning and endearing at the same time.

668
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,780
There'll be lots of new subgeniuses in nine months.

669
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,380
All from the pool experience.

670
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,680
Well it'll broaden our gene pool.

671
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,480
That too is often a topic.

672
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,500
We've never had the problem that the Amish had.

673
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,220
Dear Abby, could you be impregnated by being in a pool someone had been masturbating in?

674
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,640
They asked Abby that.

675
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:15,680
And Abby went into it and said that there was a very remote possibility that that could happen.

676
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,080
Now hold on Hal.

677
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,700
People describe me as a good debater.

678
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,100
But a master debater that's taken a little far.

679
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,340
No one is more than momentarily mastered.

680
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,160
Then there's the relaxation and ease.

681
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,040
That would just take me too long.

682
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,860
I used to be able to knock one off in about thirty seconds.

683
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,940
Always coming and going.

684
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,560
Hour and a half.

685
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,400
Always too soon.

686
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,100
Always too soon.

687
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,840
Yeah.

688
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,800
Used to be able to hit the ceiling.

689
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,480
Crumb said he felt he'd been released by some force that made him act like an idiot.

690
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,080
Glad it was gone.

691
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:54,960
Yeah.

692
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,800
Old man at old age got me.

693
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,020
What you got in there?

694
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,880
He brought some nuts for the nuts.

695
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,940
Yeah there you go.

696
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,520
Soup to nuts.

697
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,800
Well there's some almonds in there.

698
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,080
Some color appropriated raisins.

699
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,860
All sorts of unusual.

700
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:30,800
The rural rednecks of Texas seem to think that California is just a bunch of silly antifa libtards burning all their cities down.

701
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,680
They don't seem to understand that most of California is actually farmland full of conservative rednecks.

702
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:36,940
Absolutely.

703
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,160
And fruits and nuts.

704
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,240
It is a land of fruits and nuts.

705
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,540
The human ones live in the big cities.

706
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,880
But the countryside is regular edible fruits and nuts.

707
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,820
And they're really good.

708
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,560
And I've never understood why these rural Texans hate California so much.

709
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,420
Well that goes for the rest of the country.

710
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,480
They say California starts a trend and then the country follows it.

711
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,720
So what's in California now will be universal soon.

712
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,740
And much sooner than it used to be.

713
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,780
You being in the religious biz though.

714
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,640
I mean any good religion person should know that

715
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,520
it's not about the money.

716
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,880
It's about loving your own religion.

717
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,720
That brings people together.

718
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,520
It's hating the other religions.

719
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:18,940
Right.

720
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,800
The dream of everyone else going to hell.

721
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,700
The same thing happens with politics.

722
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,960
You gotta hate the other side.

723
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,580
That's what brings all of your side together.

724
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,820
Right.

725
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,360
That's all it is now.

726
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,900
Nobody can say anything good about their own side.

727
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,760
They can only say

728
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,660
infinite bad lies about the other side.

729
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,760
I'm still waiting for the

730
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,420
Biden's the best president ever bumper sticker.

731
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,860
It's out there somewhere I'm sure.

732
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,340
But we're still getting the we hate Trump stickers.

733
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,600
And of course when Trump was president

734
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,120
Obama was his turn in the barrel.

735
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,560
Everybody hates the other guy.

736
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,580
When Trump is reinstated in August you mean?

737
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,900
Lock them all up.

738
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,260
Lock them all up.

739
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,440
Lock them all up.

740
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,820
Lock us up.

741
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,920
Lock us up.

742
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,220
I love all these free thinkers

743
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,200
who all wear the same red hat

744
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,020
calling other people sheeple.

745
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,520
I just love that.

746
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,580
Well you dress as a form of tribal identification.

747
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,260
I had a cave

748
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:19,840
cave

749
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,300
tribalism.

750
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,200
Sickening.

751
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,480
I had a philosophy teacher once fielded that question.

752
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,860
They said, Professor McCown

753
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,040
why is it that everybody else

754
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,400
other than like philosophy majors

755
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,440
they all want to think and act the same way.

756
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,840
And he said, well

757
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,220
I'm looking out at my class here today

758
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,080
and I'm noticing you're all wearing blue jeans.

759
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,400
Do you mean like that?

760
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,460
Yeah well you see

761
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,500
it's a convergence of forces

762
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,400
and one of them is

763
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,820
convenience because

764
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,280
if you just dress like

765
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,380
everybody else then you don't have to spend time

766
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,580
thinking about it or worrying about it.

767
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,780
So you are free

768
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,960
to do other things.

769
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,100
You're not occupied with something

770
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,080
that is trivial.

771
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,760
The Brendelfly school of

772
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,960
clothing fashion

773
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,880
just wear the same suit every day.

774
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,220
We got that idea from Einstein. He said

775
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:14,740
essentially

776
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,580
do pretty much the same thing.

777
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,780
I just don't even think about it.

778
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,480
I'm not fabric oriented and

779
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,040
don't give a shit

780
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,000
what other people think about

781
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,800
how I look.

782
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,700
That would never have worked for me.

783
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,380
There was never any point

784
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,660
if only I looked a little more slick

785
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,780
then wait a minute

786
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,720
what am I talking about?

787
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,560
Well it's a slippery slope. If you start caring about the way you look

788
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,020
the next thing you're going to worry about is

789
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,120
the way that other people perceive your thoughts.

790
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,180
It can be more motivated by

791
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,840
the way you don't want to look.

792
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,220
So that ends up determining

793
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,320
how you look.

794
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,300
Defiance.

795
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,340
The central ingredient to subgeniousness.

796
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,580
Says the guy

797
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,120
wearing the SS uniform

798
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,160
hat but with a

799
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,620
Dobbs head stuck on top.

800
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,120
This isn't SS this is actually a

801
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,620
communist hat. Is it?

802
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,580
Papa Joe was Stalin.

803
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,240
But you know I don't want to

804
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,260
put down, I mean after all

805
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,240
the Nazis did come in second place.

806
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,520
But first place actually goes to

807
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,100
Mao Zedong.

808
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,380
And then I guess it depends on where

809
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,940
you draw the lines but

810
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,460
Papa Joe Stalin did come in

811
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,560
a close second and Hitler third.

812
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,400
Did you ever read the

813
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,760
last Doc Savage

814
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,460
novel ever written but not published

815
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,160
where Doc and his

816
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,200
men go into Stalinist Russia

817
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,820
for an operation? No.

818
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,460
I thought the last Doc

819
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,400
Savage novel he went, he actually

820
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,940
started down to hell.

821
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,740
Up from Earth's center.

822
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,020
It's the last one because he gets killed.

823
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,020
And he ran into something that terrified

824
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,280
even him. Yes. But there was

825
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,300
another one after that?

826
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,080
It's called The Red

827
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,360
Spider. Wow.

828
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,440
Did it get reprinted somehow?

829
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,220
I have it with me.

830
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,980
I'm going to put it in the Bulldog auction.

831
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,580
He keeps it with him

832
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,780
at all times. I got dibs on that one.

833
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,440
Oh really? Why bother

834
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,420
putting it into auction?

835
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,520
Someone recently sent me

836
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,300
a collection of

837
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,260
every Doc Savage

838
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,380
comic book. Oh yes.

839
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,020
They had Street and Smith

840
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,380
published them. I didn't know how many times

841
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,400
it had been attempted. There were like 20 different

842
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,460
versions. It was, there was

843
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,000
a slight difference about it.

844
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,440
He had to wear this hood with a special

845
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,500
jewel in it that gave

846
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,200
him his powers. Do you remember that?

847
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,460
No.

848
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,540
That he got from an old

849
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,160
priestly llama like person.

850
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,160
I don't know.

851
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,260
In the comic. He wore

852
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,360
high boots and pants, no shirt,

853
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,480
and this hood with the jewel

854
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,280
on it. And if you

855
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,180
weren't totally pure

856
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,140
and a super being like Doc Savage

857
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,720
it would kill you to put it on.

858
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,240
But Clark Savage Jr.

859
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,640
put it on. And that's

860
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,400
the way it was in the comic book. Not

861
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,520
in the pulp

862
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,160
magazines.

863
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,220
So he survived. He was worthy.

864
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,520
Worthy of the jewel. He perfected

865
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,620
himself. That was his idea.

866
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,140
Like Batman,

867
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,680
Doc Savage just started

868
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,380
out as an ordinary person who trained

869
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,540
himself with

870
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,660
exercises and mental exercises

871
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,460
and acrobatics

872
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,340
and chemistry and science and

873
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,300
ballistics.

874
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,440
Batman owes Doc Savage an

875
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,640
explanation for sure.

876
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,440
Well my favorite. The utility belt and all

877
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,520
that stuff. Doc Savage had all

878
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,280
that. And he didn't need a mask.

879
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,180
He had a fortress of solitude

880
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,240
before Superman did. That's where

881
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,700
Superman got that idea.

882
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,160
The Arctic retreat where he goes

883
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,220
and meditates in the snow

884
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,880
in his speedos or something.

885
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,820
Well think about it. Clark Kent,

886
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,120
both Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne

887
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,060
would have been the right age to have been reading

888
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,320
Doc Savage pulp novels. That's true.

889
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,380
When they were coming out

890
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,340
in the early 30's.

891
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,480
Yeah well it was the same thing when

892
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,140
They came out in the 1980's.

893
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,340
Sorry to announce but I think

894
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,340


895
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,340


896
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,340


897
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,340


898
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,340
to The Bollywood

899
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,060
Games and video games

900
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,120
recently.

901
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,100
Please don't throw your trash in my yard

902
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,720
Holding on to your empty soul

903
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,320
Can't possibly be that hard again

904
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,420
I'm impatient as well

905
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,880
But I'd rather wait a second

906
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,700
If you'd be here by me in a while

907
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,620
These kids are pretty quick on their feet

908
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,380
So you're looking for some trouble

909
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,640
When you're going nearly 60 down my street

910
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,600
настроemcantstars.com

911
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:00,600


912
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,280
Get out the dirty videos

913
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,500
Fast drink

914
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,180
Nut butter

915
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,780
guitar solo

916
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,740
guitar solo

917
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,680
guitar solo

918
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:35,000
Well, I always keep my cylinder of anti-shark repellent in my pants.

919
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,080
It's actually a real turn-on to the women.

920
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,200
I don't know why, but...

921
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,840
Anti-shark repellent?

922
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,240
Yeah, anti-shark repellent.

923
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,920
It scares the sharks away from being scared away.

924
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,460
Huh.

925
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,180
And it draws women in.

926
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,240
Yeah, they like the circling me all the time.

927
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,760
That stuff usually works,

928
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:02,120
but all the anecdotes say that then there's one shark that doesn't give a damn.

929
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,480
There's always one who doesn't get the memo.

930
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,220
Well, my favorite of those comic book characters would have been the mystery men.

931
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,820
It would have been the Blue Raja.

932
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,780
The guy that throws forks?

933
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,580
Well, why don't you throw knives?

934
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,980
The Blue Raja can't throw knives.

935
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,240
How about Bouncing Boy?

936
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,740
He wasn't in Mystery Man.

937
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,340
No, he wasn't in Mystery Man.

938
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,740
I mean, he was in DC Comics, actually.

939
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,680
He was at Doc Stock 1.

940
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,520
Bouncing Boy was there.

941
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,540
You can hear him on the tapes.

942
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,040
Oh, really?

943
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,420
Yeah, he'd suck on the...

944
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,380
We had a giant tank of church air,

945
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,560
and you'd hear this...

946
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,500
I'm Bouncing Boy!

947
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,200
I'm Bouncing Boy!

948
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,480
It was him.

949
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,560
You could tell by the voice.

950
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,840
It had to be Bouncing Boy.

951
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,020
His power was to be kind of like an inflatable balloon

952
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:51,000
and bounce off the walls and ceiling,

953
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,460
but he was exceptionally vulnerable to bullet wounds, as I remember.

954
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,080
It was Jay Cotton who could turn into Bouncing Boy,

955
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,480
also known as Jay Condom.

956
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,160
How is Jay Condom?

957
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,160
Has anyone ever heard of him?

958
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,240
He's a hateful old right-wing crank in a nursing home.

959
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,780
I heard he'd taken a turn for the worse.

960
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,200
Yeah.

961
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,260
He went the other way.

962
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,460
Well, he created the sex monks, right?

963
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,260
The bunk version of the chipmunks?

964
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,580
The nurses love his nice people.

965
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,260
They like the right-wing crazy guys.

966
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,820
Good for the nurses there.

967
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,220
I had a friend who nursed Johnny Weissmuller

968
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,340
in the Hollywood old folks' home,

969
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,240
and she said he was an ass-grabbing hound dog to the bitter end,

970
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,220
and he would burst out with that Tarzan yell.

971
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,740
He could still do it.

972
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:39,760
Age 80.

973
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,280
Oh!

974
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,760
Only he could do it.

975
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,040
Yeah.

976
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:47,140
And all future Tarzans just used that recorded,

977
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,880
because they couldn't do it either.

978
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,620
That was filmed down in...

979
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,920
But he was still charming the ladies with that,

980
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,460
slapping their butts from his wheelchair.

981
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,260
That was all filmed down in Wakulla Springs,

982
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,720
just outside Tallahassee,

983
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,760
where Creature of the Black Lagoon was filmed.

984
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,400
Uh-huh.

985
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,560
You still hear the echoes of the yodeling.

986
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,520
Are you familiar with Doris Wishman's...

987
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:09,620
I heard.

988
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:09,620


989
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,180
I heard.

990
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,080
I think you were talking about them yesterday.

991
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,480
I thought that maybe one of them,

992
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,040
Nude on the Moon,

993
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,480
was filmed here,

994
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,760
when I came in and saw the wall,

995
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,680
which looks just like the same wall

996
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,800
in that nudist movie she made.

997
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,820
Have you ever seen that one?

998
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,820
No, I haven't.

999
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,900
It's just absurd.

1000
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,140
Two astronauts land on the moon,

1001
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,740
and they come to the wall,

1002
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,000
and they climb up and look inside,

1003
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,740
and it's a nudist camp with women with...

1004
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,900
the bobbly antennas, you know,

1005
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,920
lounging around by the pool and so forth.

1006
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,360
Oh, we should ask Cynthia's dad.

1007
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:48,960
They should know.

1008
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:49,900
They might know,

1009
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,840
because, you know, it's such an absurd movie.

1010
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,600
It's like cultish, goofy movie.

1011
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,880
Unless it was filmed like a clandestine camera.

1012
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,360
I know it was filmed in Florida.

1013
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,840
Also, her movie, her nudist classic,

1014
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,380
Hideout in the Sun,

1015
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,820
where these two gangsters commit a daring robbery,

1016
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,620
and then they decide,

1017
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,140
the perfect place to hide,

1018
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,100
nudist colony.

1019
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,460
They'll never recognize us here.

1020
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,360
Nobody likes to look at those guys.

1021
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,760
We'll just be one of them.

1022
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,660
I'm gonna carry my rod, see?

1023
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,840
So one of them acclimatizes to the nudist colony

1024
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,540
with the comely captive that they bring along.

1025
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,780
The other one is a suspicious criminal

1026
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,420
prowling with his gun out inside the house

1027
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,780
and cursing the nudists.

1028
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,420
I have the two-disc set on DVD.

1029
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,440
You said you also have Dinosaur Valley Girls?

1030
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,480
I think I have that on VHS somewhere.

1031
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,900
Supposedly, part of that was filmed in Glen Rose.

1032
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,260
Well, there's an attempt to do some creditable

1033
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,060
stop-motion dinosaur effects,

1034
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,060
but of course those things are hard to do

1035
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,000
gracefully and symmetrically.

1036
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,120
I've wondered if maybe they used the

1037
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,140
Dinosaur Valley State Park

1038
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,040
for Dinosaur Valley Girls,

1039
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,840
if only for the title sequence.

1040
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:07,720
Well...

1041
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,040
They've got a free sign there.

1042
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,520
It says Dinosaur Valley Park.

1043
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,880
...have the so-called scream queen starlets of the time

1044
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,900
in cave girl drag,

1045
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,160
and then these oafs with beards

1046
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,040
grunting with clubs and so on,

1047
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,660
all very stereotypically,

1048
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,540
in sequences which go on far too long.

1049
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,060
But it's an oddity.

1050
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,440
That's the sort of thing we should be showing

1051
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,400
for Oddball Movie Night.

1052
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,660
And so on.

1053
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,720
Now do you have it on DVD or...

1054
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,140
The same things tend to be shown over and over.

1055
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,080
Is that a VHS copy or a DVD copy?

1056
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,880
I believe it's a VHS copy

1057
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,140
that the late Pedro recorded for me.

1058
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,900
Just for those in the know,

1059
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,860
Hal's room is essential visiting grounds

1060
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,300
if you're a bit of a hoarder like myself.

1061
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,800
I made sure that my wife...

1062
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,640
It's not hoarding, I just don't have enough room

1063
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,300
for the stuff.

1064
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,500
...readjust what her definition of cluttered is.

1065
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:04,820
No.

1066
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:06,980
Um...

1067
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,520
Some sacrifices are worth making.

1068
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,940
And that's why he also gets a little bit

1069
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,300
exacerbated if you send him something he already has.

1070
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,820
Because it's like, I...

1071
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,320
This is just what I need.

1072
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,280
We'll continue this nostalgic nerd out another time.

1073
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,000
Thanks to Reverend Pease, Papa Joe Mama, and Dr. Hal.

1074
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,400
And thanks to Rubik's Pube

1075
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,300
for all of the songs in this show.

1076
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,220
And thanks to Leemur for the titles and PR news.

00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,700
including how to become an actual minister

1079
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,160
in the Church of the Subgenius.

1080
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:52,180
To end the show, let's go to another album by Rubik's Pube,

1081
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,900
the album Bob Comp I, also easily found on bandcamp.com,

1082
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,640
as are, for that matter, a dozen Subgenius official music compilation albums

1083
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,080
spanning decades.

1084
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,900
But now, Rubik's Pube.

1085
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,300
Yetism in a young female

1086
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,280
includes enlargement of the feet and shoulders

1087
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,060
and of course the third nostril.

1088
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,160
Spaghettification and reversion.

1089
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:37,480
Hair!

1090
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,600
Isolating yourself from them.

1091
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,340
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1092
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,720
Shapeshifting, pre-gifting, bestiality, insanity, defying gravity,

1093
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,540
exposing yourself, unfortunately, to the underlying primal hierarchy

1094
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,120
and not giving a Bob damn fuck.

1095
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,380
You can find the full album in the description box.

1098
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,380


1099
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,380


1100
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,380


1101
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,380


1102
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,380


1103
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,380


1104
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,120
Let's hear it.

1105
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,060
Let's hear it.

1106
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,860
Rababababababababababo

1107
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,420
