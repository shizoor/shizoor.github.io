1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:09,160
It's alive. It's moving. It's alive. It's alive. It's alive. It's alive. It's alive.

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,840
The Soul of Jesus.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,700
The Soul of Jesus.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,040
I just sprayed WD-40 on it, and it stopped for about 10 or 15 minutes, and then it'll start back again.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,420
Did you try to wiggle?

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,380
Oh, yes. Yeah.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:25,820
Yeah.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,760
You're right.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,640
And...

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,060
No.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:30,880
No.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:30,880


13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:31,900
No.

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,240
So, if there are actually fetid fetuses falling from the sky...

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,040
And there are.

16
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,760
And they're both spelled F-O-E-T.

17
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,520
The old fetal fetter.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,160
How come we don't call them fetid fetuses or fetid fetuses?

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,780
Because they went off fetus first.

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,800
That would be crazy.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,400
That would be like a world where just chopped off feet washed up randomly on beaches.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:53,860
Right.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,980
That does happen.

24
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,820
It would be the same crazy world.

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,000
A world that didn't make any sense at all.

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
Chopped off feet do wash up on beaches.

27
00:00:59,720 --> 00:00:59,980
Okay.

28
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,500
I've recently been studying this.

29
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,880
They do wash up on beaches, and the reason for this is that sharks bite them off and then cough them up.

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,960
Well, they're actually paddling to shore.

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,120
But it's always right feet.

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,720
And we keep getting left feet in the mail as barter for membership packs.

33
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
You should see the documentary information I have.

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,620
They photograph a lot of these feet when they are washed up, and I've got photos.

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,840
Lots of photos.

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,300
Only $49.95.

37
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,500
I can send you some.

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
I'll see you later for the hot foot pics.

39
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:38,460
Well, they're not that pleasing to the appearance, but they show that a shark can carry things in its gut for many days without digesting it.

40
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,760
Ah, well, that's just the shark kingdom, however.

41
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,280
It could have been a horny seal.

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,780
That explains Philo.

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,900
You mean...

44
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,560
That explains the stuff that comes out of Philo's mouth on a KPFA show.

45
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,680
He's got stuff that's been undigested in his gut.

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,560
You all know who we're talking about.

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,280
Dr. Philo Drummond.

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,960
No, only Dr. Philo Drummond.

49
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,660
Philo Drummond.

50
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:07,880
Only the cub sub-co-founder and cub sub-co-founder of the Church of the Subgenius.

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,040
Back when he was a fledgling cub reporter.

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,900
A cub genius, as Dr. Darby said.

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,980
Hunting for honey and bee trees and so forth.

54
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,240
Now a full-fledged schlub genius.

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,260
He ended up with more than a bucket full of money and a tree full of honey.

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
He ended up with two honeys.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,220
In fact, two families.

58
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,880
And he...

59
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,300
Now...

60
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,540
As the Mormon subgenius supports both of those.

61
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:33,940
Right.

62
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,560
The fundamentalist Mormon subgenius, Philo Drummond, with his several daughters and wives.

63
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,640
And you're all...

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,920
And the latest daughter is...

65
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,900
But they dress better.

66
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,300
Too tiny.

67
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,460
And his payments...

68
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,100
It's rough being a polygamist.

69
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,340
But he's got this whole generation and several generations to take care of him in his old age.

70
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,740
Polygamy is its own...

71
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,340
It's its own punishment.

72
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,560
It's punishment that fits the crime.

73
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,240
But he's only one-quarter subgenius and the rest is Jeffrey Dahmer.

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,120
Or no, who was the one who...

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,420
Yeah, Jeffrey Lundgren, the evil...

76
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,900
He could always drum up a date.

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,680
Pardon?

78
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,860
He could always drum up a date.

79
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,120
Dr. Drummond, yes.

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,000
He could.

81
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,420
Dana Leppard's easy to get a piece of.

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,720
He's just a beat-off.

83
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,600
That's my...

84
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,580
Ah, ah.

85
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,120
We're degenerating.

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,560
It's a pity.

87
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,240
Dr. Drummond couldn't be here this year.

88
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,760
I don't even have standards and this is hurting.

89
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,880
We do hope we'll be able to draw him back one of these times.

90
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,600
Because X-Day is always all the better for his presence.

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,020
It's not always pretty outside.

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,480
Sometimes it's raining like a dog or a cat.

93
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,720
Other times it's just cold as hell.

94
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,920
There's rarely a day as beautiful as this,

95
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,640
which leads me to believe that maybe we have been ruptured and are just...

96
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,040
Can't fit it straight.

97
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,540
It's true that it was pouring rain out here.

98
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,880
Until 2 o'clock on Wednesday when X-Day was scheduled to start.

99
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,080
What, so it just washed it off the counter?

100
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,860
The moment of...

101
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,880
Actually, it was 1 o'clock.

102
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,040
At that moment, the sun ripped through the clouds and the grass instantly dried,

103
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,440
much like at the miracle of Fatima.

104
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,600
Yes, Dr. Drummond.

105
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,860
Which I think I mentioned already.

106
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,120
Well, we have our miracles...

107
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,380
I'm practicing for my Alzheimer's.

108
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,980
...and our signs of wonder.

109
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,160
Believe me, we do.

110
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,120
We manifest them constantly.

111
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,680
Constantly.

112
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,280
Constantly.

113
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,820
Constantly.

114
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,000
Constantly.

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,160
Constantly.

116
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,360
Constantly.

117
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,420
So back to conspiracy theory.

118
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,340
What do you mean when you use the term conspiracy coincidence syndrome?

119
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,640
Actually, I forget where I first encountered that idea,

120
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,080
but I was working for Playboy and somebody submitted an article.

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,400
I think I was the only editor who voted for publishing the article.

122
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,200
And it was about this thing.

123
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,300
This guy set out to investigate conspiracy theorists.

124
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,700
And he investigated a variety of them.

125
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,480
Those who thought the Rockefellers ran.

126
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,020
The government.

127
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,740
Those who thought the Air Force was engaged in a cover-up of the UFOs.

128
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,580
And I forget what others.

129
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,560
About three others.

130
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,140
He found all of them had real incidents that they could demonstrate to his conviction that

131
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,500
they weren't making it up, that they had been persecuted, which helped prove that their

132
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,040
conspiracy theory must be true.

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
Why would they be persecuted?

134
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:28,440
And I began to think, well, I don't exactly believe in psychokinesis, but I do believe

135
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,460
that we program.

136
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,160
What happens to us a lot more than we're consciously aware of.

137
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,540
And it occurred to me that if people who believe widely conflicting conspiracy theories get

138
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,640
equally persecuted, they're bringing the persecution down on themselves in some way

139
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,560
they don't understand.

140
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,560
And that led me into the whole concept of coincidence and synchronicity.

141
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,360
And some of it is pretty damn weird.

142
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,700
You can't explain it in any rational terms.

143
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,200
Well, think May Brussel.

144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,460
Her daughter got killed in a car accident.

145
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,720
She thought the CIA did that.

146
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,460
Now, my attitude is so many kids get killed in car accidents that to immediately jump

147
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,140
to the conclusion the CIA did it is kind of premature.

148
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,880
And if the CIA wanted to shut May Brussel up, the obvious thing to do would be to kill

149
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,780
her, not her daughter.

150
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,460
But then you find things that are really weird, like Kerry Thornley, who believed he was brainwashed

151
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,620
by the CIA and was part of the Kennedy assassination, but he couldn't remember all the details.

152
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,720
He got held up in his own apartment by a cop.

153
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,200
He was a guy who, after pistol-whipping him and taking a stereo and a television and

154
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,140
a few other things he carted away, he took Kerry's ID with him, too.

155
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,180
Now, why did he steal Kerry Thornley's ID?

156
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,640
Maybe that's another coincidence, like May Brussel's daughter being hit by a car.

157
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,660
And the more you look into it, the more mysterious it gets.

158
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,660
John Lilly, Dr. John Lilly, who has a background in more sciences than just about anybody I

159
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,420
can think of.

160
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,280
He has coined the metaphor.

161
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,400
He insists it's a metaphor because he doesn't want to be known as a nut.

162
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,380
I also call it a metaphor because I still have some faint hope that I won't be known

163
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:10,960
as a nut.

164
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,320
Cosmic Coincidence Control Center, CCCC.

165
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,360
It does seem like Cosmic Coincidence Control Center pays special attention to people who

166
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,760
pay special attention to it.

167
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,360
The more coincidences you look for, the more you find.

168
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,760
And the more you look for coincidences, the more you find the really weird ones that seem

169
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:29,980
to be coincidences.

170
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:37,400
As for example, the 23 theme that runs through several of my books.

171
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,240
I was giving a lecture in St. Louis.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,560
Guy came up after the lecture with his wife, chatted with me a bit and said, I know how

173
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,940
your 23 gimmick worked.

174
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,440
I said, okay, tell me.

175
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,780
He said, it's a neurological grid.

176
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,580
You make your readers abnormally conscious of 23s and they ignore all the other numbers.

177
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,420
And I said, congratulations.

178
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,720
You found the great 23.

179
00:07:59,720 --> 00:07:59,720


180
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,580
You're a great magician who makes the grass green.

181
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,020
According to Zen Buddhism, you are now enlightened.

182
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,300
And then after a while, we decided to have a friendly chat.

183
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,440
We decided to go get a pizza.

184
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,520
We went to this pizza place.

185
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,860
They give you a number while you wait for your pizza.

186
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,220
Of course, we got number 23.

187
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,160
He said, how do you do it?

188
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,680
I said, I thought you did it that time.

189
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,060
I mean, when this kind of thing starts wanting you, you find out that any philosophy you

190
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,360
can invent fails to account for it.

191
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,440
Synchronicity isn't a theory at all.

192
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,420
It's a word that Jung made up and pretended he had a theory to go with it.

193
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,360
But in the scientific sense, there is no theory of synchronicity.

194
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:41,900
It's just a label for a phenomenon that tends to occur when you're in depth analysis, Freudian

195
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:48,320
or Jungian, when you do a lot of LSD or if you do a lot of oriental meditation or if

196
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,760
you practice Western Kabbalistic magic.

197
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,640
And it happens to ordinary people too, but it happens much more likely if you belong

198
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,940
to one of those five groups.

199
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,700
If you belong to all five of those groups, it's interesting.

200
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,700


201
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,700


202
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,700


203
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,700


204
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,700


205
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,700


206
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,700


207
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,700


208
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,360
Criticities accumulate so much that you start to think, to quote Aleister Crowley, the whole

209
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,040
universe is an individual dealing of God with your personal soul.

210
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,480
So when one starts investigating conspiracies suddenly by the same principle, facts backing

211
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,280
up the conspiracy seem to pop from the woodwork?

212
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,180
Oh yeah.

213
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,740
It's like the law of fives created by Kerry Thornley before he started remembering or

214
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,680
imagining his connection with the CIA and brainwashing programs and so on.

215
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,200
The law of fives holds that everything in the universe is directly connected to the

216
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,880
number five.

217
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,920
Sometimes I restate it as given enough ingenuity on the part of the interpreter, but usually

218
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,760
I leave that out and leave it in Kerry's form and leave the reader to figure it out for

219
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,080
himself.

220
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,440
But take for instance 666, the number of the beast.

221
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,020
How the hell is that connected to five?

222
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,720
Well, add it up.

223
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,440
666, it adds to 18.

224
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,280
18, 1 plus 8 equals 9.

225
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,320
9 is 3 squared.

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,740
There you got your 3 and your 2.

227
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,060
3 plus 2 equals 5.

228
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,400
You see how easy it is?

229
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,140
I only took three steps.

230
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,260
So because the mind is searching for those kind of connections, it's putting them together

231
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,120
wherever it can?

232
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,360
Yeah, I'd like to do a book sometime on great blunders by intelligent people, because when

233
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,240
you start looking for something, you tend to find that, you know, this wouldn't be like

234
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,660
Simon Newcomb, the great astronomer who wrote a mathematical proof that heavier than air

235
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,660
flight was impossible and published it a day before the Wright brothers took off.

236
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,300
I'm talking about people who found a pattern in nature and wrote several scientific articles

237
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,300
and got it accepted by a large part of the scientific community before it was generally

238
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,240
agreed that there was no such pattern.

239
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
It was all just selective perception.

240
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,220
This happens over and over.

241
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,120
If it happens to scientists, imagine how much more often it happens to artists.

242
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,340
And now imagine how often it happens to subgeniuses.

243
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,400
That was Robert Anton Wilson from the audiobook Robert Anton Wilson Explains Everything, thanks

244
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,300
to the folks at MaybeLogic.com, and praise Pope Bob.

245
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,920
This hour of slack, number 1171, should be pretty crazy since we're stitching together

246
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,060
body parts from various live radio sessions.

247
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,200
I'm Robert Anton Wilson.

248
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,200
We'll see you around the clock.

249
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,640
Thank you, and have fun watching.

250
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,800
Have a great day.

251
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,880
Bye-bye.

252
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,440
See you next time.

253
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,560
Take care.

254
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,120
Bye.

255
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,140
Bye.

256
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


257
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


258
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


259
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


260
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


261
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


262
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


263
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


264
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


265
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


266
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


267
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


268
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


269
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


270
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


271
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


272
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


273
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


274
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


275
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,160


276
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,400
Bye.

277
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:54,720
Bye.

278
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,680
that was of great historical importance.

279
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,520
I believe you're lying, I said,

280
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,100
and in a moment, I'll explain.

281
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,000
In the case of the lady spectator,

282
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,160
he hadn't even heard of the skater's waltz.

283
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,380
Listen again to Ellery Queen's...

284
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,060
That body is not dead.

285
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,940
It has never lived.

286
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,040
I created it.

287
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,520
I made it with my own hands

288
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,480
from the bodies I took from graves,

289
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,980
from the gallows, anywhere.

290
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,680
I'm sure most of you saw the baptism

291
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,940
where the new subgeniuses were washed clean

292
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,400
and made new unto Bob.

293
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
Did you see what the water looked like afterwards?

294
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,200
That's what they have filters and chemicals for.

295
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,240
And aren't you glad the senior citizens

296
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,760
we're going to bring in for the baptism

297
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,300
weren't brought in until later?

298
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,900
I can tell you in all honesty

299
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,280
that after a church of the subgenius ritual,

300
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,960
that pool opened.

301
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,220
It only looks a sort of a light reddish brown.

302
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,040
But after a church of all worlds ritual

303
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,960
at Starwood, which goes on for hours,

304
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,200
it looks like black sludge.

305
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,860
Well, they bring in the earth.

306
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,660
Being honest, horny-handed sons of the soil,

307
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,120
they bring in a lot of soil with them.

308
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,740
A lot of sins to be washed away.

309
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,460
A lot of clogged sewers.

310
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,600
And their ritual isn't funny.

311
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,260
I've spied on the church of all worlds

312
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,340
baptisms in the pool where they share water.

313
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,440
They're water brothers.

314
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,160
The only ones laughing, me and Bob Mosick,

315
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,780
as we peeked over the edge

316
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,900
watching that ridiculous charade.

317
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,320
Basically every other religion's charades

318
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,880
are ridiculous in a way that is not seemly to Bob.

319
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,480
We try to keep ours ridiculous

320
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,760
in a way that Bob finds,

321
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,080
pleasurable.

322
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,860
And because we run down other religions

323
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,260
doesn't mean that we say that we have all the answers,

324
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,940
nor do we claim that we know everything.

325
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,400
That's what separates us from the others.

326
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,800
We don't need to know everything.

327
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,760
We're sub-geniuses.

328
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,500
We need only to know our own genius.

329
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,720
Anything else is gravy.

330
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,560
But when did God ever say we were important enough

331
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,720
to know why the universe is here?

332
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm just trying to remember where I hid my fro.

333
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,660
Right, we're not Bob.

334
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,920
That's for Bob to know and us to guess about.

335
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,840
It leaves some mysteries open.

336
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,980
Think how awful it would be if they had Loch Ness monsters in aquariums.

337
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,540
They wouldn't even be monsters anymore.

338
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Think of all the dirty gangly in the pool.

339
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,660
Someday if the conspiracy takes over, friends,

340
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,060
there'll be stuffed yetis in the Natural History Museum.

341
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,420
I found a yeti in the SkyMall calendar.

342
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,620
I did too. I saw that.

343
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:55,760
It's a garbage.

344
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,900
It's a garden gnome version of Bigfoot,

345
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,100
a la the Roger Patterson movie.

346
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,420
They're trying to get the pinks used to the idea

347
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,140
that yetis may soon be shambling through their gardens.

348
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,200
Have your own garden yeti, it said.

349
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,540
And they're making a bundle on these artificial yeti statues.

350
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,020
Or it could be like those statues of owls,

351
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,100
which they put in gardens to frighten away birds

352
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,760
that might do damage to the plants.

353
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,600
Put a statue of a yeti,

354
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,560
and it'll drive pinks far.

355
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,440
Next they're gonna be doing squids.

356
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,320
And they're gonna make us so sick of squids,

357
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,840
we won't want to fuck them anymore.

358
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,340
And then where will we be?

359
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,140
You were the only one who wanted to fuck squids all the time anyway.

360
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,940
We have photo documentation.

361
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,260
Of course you had your dalliances.

362
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,160
Who wouldn't want to fuck squids?

363
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,740
They're so rubbery.

364
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,020
Dave's a city boy.

365
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,920
He didn't grow up quite the same way we did, Ceezy.

366
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,460
Yeah.

367
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,940
You guys grew up on a farm?

368
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,000
The only peri-squid that Dave ever saw

369
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,440
was a dad wrapped up in cellophane in a supermarket.

370
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,580
Or those misleading Hanna-Barbera squidly-diddly cartoons.

371
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,660
Once you get squid-squack, you never go back.

372
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,200
Ellery Queen's.

373
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,960
This is Ellery Queen with a case I call the illegal entry.

374
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,800
A research firm that dealt in offshore oil exploration

375
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,040
had lost a midget submarine.

376
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,700
I learned that one of the men on board had pulled the necessary vents

377
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,340
after he saw a green light flash indicating the hatches were closed.

378
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,420
I was convinced he was trying to enter the country illegally.

379
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,360
In a moment, I'll tell you why.

380
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,440
In the case of the illegal entry,

381
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,020
the murderer tried to fool me with psychology.

382
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,780
He'd big business.

383
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,780
Listen again to Ellery Queen's.

384
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,460
Speaking of the cat in the hat,

385
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,160
the vulcarding child, one of the uber babies,

386
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,200
says that I am Dr. Seuss.

387
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,820
She doesn't talk a lot,

388
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,340
but she took one look at me and said that's Dr. Seuss.

389
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,400
Well, that is indeed an intellectual and intuitive leap.

390
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,600
Theodore...what was his name?

391
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,100
Geisel.

392
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,160
Theodore Ted Geisel.

393
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,160
He was a subgenius,

394
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,240
and he knew the conspiracy would totally screw his material.

395
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,160
He wrote protos.

396
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:21,740
As long as he lived,

397
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,400
he never let Hollywood touch his crap,

398
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,100
unless Boris Karloff was going to be associated with it.

399
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,400
But as soon as the great Dr. Seuss died,

400
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,180
and his wife was hard up for money,

401
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,380
sure enough, the next thing you know,

402
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,240
Jim Carrey has his Hollywood pecker stuck in the pot.

403
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,460
Not just him.

404
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,500
Wrecking it forever,

405
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,620
for all future generations of kids.

406
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,380
That's why we've got to get off this planet

407
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,440
before any more Dr. Seuss stories are made.

408
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,200
Yeah, they're even corrupting Dr. Seuss,

409
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,760
but it wasn't so much Jim Carrey as that other guy.

410
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,800
You know, Austin Powers.

411
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,240
Mike Myers produced an extremely blasphemous cat in the Hatter movie.

412
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,780
I didn't even want to say that name.

413
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,940
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

414
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,940
I'm simply saying it in the interest of being complete.

415
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,280
But it is not entirely true that Hollywood ignored Dr. Seuss,

416
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,300
because he was able to let one great proto-subgenius

417
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,580
interpret his works.

418
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,140
This isn't much known today,

419
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,320
and that is Bob Clampett,

420
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,900
an angel of light who walked this earth years ago.

421
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,200
Price, another Bob.

422
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
He was utterly great.

423
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,240
It was my privilege to know him for a brief time.

424
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,520
No!

425
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:37,600
Yes, I...

426
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,720
You knew Bob Clampett?

427
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,260
I knew Bob Clampett very well,

428
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,600
and he knew me,

429
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,040
and I can't sing his praises enough.

430
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,420
He was indeed a proto-subgenius, Stang.

431
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,340
You would believe it if you'd ever spoken to him for a short time.

432
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,620
And his cartoon of Horton Hears a Who...

433
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,260
Not Horton Hears a Who, Horton Hatches the Egg

434
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,520
is a great Warner Brothers cartoon which should be checked out sometime.

435
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,360
It was approved entirely by Dr. Seuss, the way Clampett interpreted it.

436
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,340
Ah, but it was banned by the conspiracy.

437
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,580
It is generally censored on TV,

438
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,040
but so are most of the old Warner Brothers cartoons,

439
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,400
which are simply not...

440
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,060
They're too strong for today's namby-pamby intellects to confront,

441
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,500
and so they don't appear to be about anything much.

442
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,340
Something's about to happen, and then it fades out,

443
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,920
or it moves to another thing.

444
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,200
And I'm telling you, some of them are strong stuff.

445
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:38,120
Clampett himself originated the suicide gag, as he called it,

446
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,080
and the murder gag, which ended a number of these cartoons.

447
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,420
In the cartoon Hair Ribbon, if you remember this cartoon,

448
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,760
with Bugs Bunny, a large dog, the large dog chases him underwater,

449
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,260
and then it becomes one of those strange cartoons

450
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,140
that takes place entirely underwater.

451
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,180
Nobody needs to breathe, but it's underwater.

452
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,580
And so at the end, in one version of this cartoon,

453
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,560
the dog says,

454
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,500
This shouldn't happen to a dog!

455
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,860
Picks up a large gun and blasts his brains out.

456
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,600
You can see them coming out the other side.

457
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,800
But in the other version, rare but also extant,

458
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,280
he says, This shouldn't happen to a dog!

459
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,600
And Bugs Bunny leaps into the picture, grabs the gun,

460
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,680
shoves it into his mouth, and fires it through the back of his head.

461
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,400
More brains are seen coming out.

462
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,160
But for some reason, they don't think the kiddies should be watching

463
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,300
this sort of thing today.

464
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,120
As educational as it is, I know it made a profound impression on me.

465
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,360
Anyway, now is not the time to discuss even this wonderful canon

466
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,100
of vanished literature and art.

467
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,020
It's not quite... The Internet still has...

468
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,660
You can still find the banned cartoons on the Internet,

469
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,340
but they're about to ban the Internet!

470
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,220
As we know it.

471
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,580
As we pirates and bootleggers knew it.

472
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,500
If there's anything to be learned from all this,

473
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,260
it's that what one thinks is an eternally available resource

474
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,700
has only its time to be out and then will vanish away,

475
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,600
almost utterly, beyond the extent of even the most strenuous effort

476
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,320
to retrieve.

477
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,020
So take it advisedly.

478
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,540
Enjoy it while you can.

479
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,080
Make your own copies in multiple media.

480
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,720
And most importantly, take that mental snapshot,

481
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,320
which is the hardest to erode.

482
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,120
Think of it, the brain of a dead man,

483
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,500
waiting to live again in a body I made with my own hands.

484
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,660
This is a Dan radio...

485
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,680
This is a Dan radio...

486
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,520
Good morning. Crime and punishment.

487
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,580
True by Trump.

488
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:44,740
Dramatic.

489
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,000
Crime.

490
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,260
Punishments.

491
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,240
Punishment.

492
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,040
Might well...

493
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,580
Were...

494
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,720
The justice system...

495
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,180
Criminals.

496
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,400
Would it help...

497
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,840
Help...

498
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,340
Love...

A life of crime...

00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,180

Love heals...

00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,120
Move...

505
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,720

506
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,780

Traitor...

509
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,680
Traitor...

510
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,560
High visibility...

511
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,600
Brightly colored...

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,160
Slack...

513
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,700

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,600
This is Dan radio...

516
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,660
This is Dan radio...

517
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,200
Good morning.

518
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,740
Good morning.

519
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,420
Good morning.

520
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,980
And that was a snapshot of the inside of the brain of Nor El Kreft.

521
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,560
Speaking of snapshots, friends, what's on the slideshow right now is...

522
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,640
From earlier X days.

523
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,440
X days...

524
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,240
The X days of our grandparents and our...

525
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,300
Well, maybe not our grandparents, but our parents.

526
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,440
They were something, weren't they?

527
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah, that was when we used to hold it in Texas.

528
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,280
Yeah, I remember that.

529
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,740
And that was the Florida...

530
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,020
Kelly Everts won that contest.

531
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,640
...X day of 57.

532
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,120
Yeah.

533
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,520
And that was the...

534
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,440
Friends, oh, there's Phyla.

535
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,140
Remember Phyla's hypno machine?

536
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:46,780
Mm-hmm.

537
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:46,860
Yes.

538
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,880
We had to pay the local police an awful bribe at that time.

539
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,640
And we...

540
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:00,180
Well, it's good to have these photographic records, but they can only hint at the fountains

541
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,620
of slack which used to flow before.

542
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:10,240
Brushwood is a nice tucked away place surrounded by unsuspecting Amish and Hutterite farmers.

543
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,680
Little do they know what actually is going on here at the molten core of subgenius understanding.

544
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,800
By the same token, we're not sure what kind of parties they're having either.

545
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,820
Well, that's true.

546
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,280
I've heard that the Amish do know how to have a lot of fun.

547
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,700
Yeah, those butter churn...

548
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,440
And they finish that barn raisin.

549
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:30,540
...the assembly.

550
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,100
They churn up a lot of clabber.

551
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,600
Yeah.

552
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,460
But that's, you know, they live and let live, I have to say.

553
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,140
Well, you will often, as you...

554
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,220
Yeah.

555
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,480
...wander around Brushwood.

556
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,060
This is early in the week, actually.

557
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:50,660
There'll be more people here on Friday, of course, and Saturday, and also on the days

558
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,880
of Friday and Saturday.

559
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,240
Friday can't handle all of you guys, and neither can...

560
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,320
Saturday can't handle all you girls.

561
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,260
By the way...

562
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,380
He's a brave man.

563
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,540
But on...

564
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Anyway, on those two days, there should be lots of...

565
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,180
Well, plus the pagans start showing up, and they're an interesting group to study.

566
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,320
The virtuous pagans.

567
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,140
There's one thing I'll say about the pagans that...

568
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,640
In which they're very advanced beyond the subgeniuses.

569
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,720
The pagans have mastered fire.

570
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:29,560
And I often, at X days, I lurk and sneak from camp to camp, recording people secretly.

571
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,520
But I've noticed that so often the subgeniuses bring the finest liquor.

572
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,260
They have all bars set up.

573
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,160
They have the purest frocks straight from Arizona.

574
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,160


575
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,620
They have the finest wine in Amsterdam.

576
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,840
They have a big twister game set up.

577
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,800
But the one thing they never seem to have is any heat at all, or shelter.

578
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,120
So friends, I want you to study the pagans, if you can.

579
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,660
Learn how it is that they get that flickering, burning fire under control.

580
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,300
We need to know these things.

581
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,660
Well, it's very simple.

582
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,940
You follow the alchemist's original plan for making fire.

583
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,560
All you do is build your fire in the shape of a pyramid.

584
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,960
That's what fire wants.

585
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,740
Don't throw flat things on glowing coals.

586
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,500
Erect a little teepee out of kindling.

587
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,180
And make sure that whatever else you have piled up forms the pyramid shape.

588
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,760
The triangle with the point at the top, as in all alchemical texts.

589
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,820
And you'll have a fire.

590
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,620
Otherwise, you'll just have a lot of smoke and frustration.

591
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,120
These pagans have been building fires a long time.

592
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,100
And tending them, tending the fire, that vestal duty, is of extraordinary importance.

593
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,040
If your fire gets out of control, cremora is a good chemical to throw on it.

594
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,360
Or aerosol cans, lighters, things like that.

595
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,780
Some sort of chemicals that make it burn green and blue like a witch's oil.

596
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,920
These things all add to the ecstatic enjoyment of the moment.

597
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,020
But not being able to make a fire, that is a disgrace.

598
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,460
It's a disgraceful backsliding from the wisdom and ways of our Neolithic ancestors.

599
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,660
And boy, could they ever nap flints, too.

600
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,560
We should get to work on napping flints.

601
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,960
Because you never know when all our technology is destroyed in a self-induced convulsion.

602
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,860
And we're back on the flint napping ground.

603
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,620
Then the flint nappers will be ahead of everyone else.

604
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,300
That's right.

605
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,080
The loser now shall be later to win.

606
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,980
For the times they are a-changing.

607
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,120
And, uh, uh, friends, so you should be ready to know how to start a fire.

608
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,740
You may not be able to fire up your gas heater because you can't afford the gas.

609
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,320
You need to be able to manufacture air.

610
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,940
Because they're going to start charging you for every breath you take.

611
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,380
They're going to find a way to do it.

612
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,820
Every sip of water will cost what gas costs now.

613
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,640
When the...

614
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,280
If the conspiracy wins.

615
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:16,180
And that's why if by some strange twist of fate the saucers don't lift us away this Saturday morning,

616
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,280
then, friends, it's up to you.

617
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,500
Are you ready to fill Bob's shoes?

618
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,840
Will you be the next Bob?

619
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,440
The neck's broken.

620
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,600
The brain is useless.

621
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,920
We must find another brain.

622
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,620
Just Bob is what it is.

623
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,500
It's just, it's literally Bob.

624
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,560
Bob.

625
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,200
Wayne circumstances online worrying about

626
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,580
darauf aí

627
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:50,620
to hear about my dad.

628
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:26,080
Well, we were hearing a very interesting story from Doc Fropp the other day about the discovery

629
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:32,380
of a hidden book written by a 17th century witch, written entirely in blood, and the

630
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,600
fabulous price that was paid for it.

631
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,080
You never know what's going to be valuable.

632
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,140
So really, you should treat everything as a potential source of value.

633
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,980
That's what Bulldada is all about.

634
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:55,300
The things, oh God, I'll never forget the nightmarish estate sale of the subgenius Steve

635
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,540
Checkey, who suddenly died in a car accident.

636
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,840
And I'm sure his last thought was probably something like, oh no, what's going to happen

637
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,820
to all my cool stuff?

638
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:15,140
And it's a lesson, friends, that you know not the hour when Bob may meet you in subgenius

639
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,240
hell all of a sudden.

640
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,200
And it was interesting because the pinks that came to the estate sale were all out

641
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,100
bidding on his furniture.

642
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,160
They bought up the dinette set and all this crap, and they threw the treasures in the

643
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,620
trash.

644
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,720
Ah, yes.

645
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,520
Princess We looked inside the big chemical dumpster and saw a little cassette labeled

646
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,200
ESO.

647
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,000
And we thought, that's it.

648
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,000
This poor guy's family thought he was a devil worshiper because he had, you know,

649
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,460
no books.

650
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:55,320
And, uh, and, uh, we climbed — I climbed into the, into the dumpster and praised Bob — we

651
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,700
fished out all the, his videos of all the X Days he'd been to.

652
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,920
The Cleveland Performance Arts Festival, all the crash worship shows he'd been to.

653
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,680
It was a treasure trove.

654
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,800
Not that we've had time to look at any of it.

655
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,040
But he labeled them!

656
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,300
That's one important thing about it.

657
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,660
He labeled them all!

658
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,840
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . It was a poignant moment though

659
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,400
because I would fish things out and go, I remember when he bought this from us.

660
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,620
Well, also that beautiful torso, that white statue that's on your mantelpiece at home.

661
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,180
Oh, half my t-shirts came from that guy.

662
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,180
But here's the thing.

663
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:41,420
The pinks completely ignored this guy's collection of books, which was amazing.

664
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:47,600
And his house was full of them, but that was all about to just be thrown out, burned down.

665
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:54,700
Some teenagers and Princess Wee and I managed to take our pick of the books.

666
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,540
The kids got, I think the kids got the drug books and the sex books, and we got everything else.

667
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,920
The history and twisted medical journals and so forth.

668
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,300
But, you know, you never know, friends.

669
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,080
You can't take it with you.

670
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,620
But because you're a subgenius, you can get it all back after you've left.

671
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:23,060
So I want you to now, if tomorrow, if the promise of X-Day holds true tomorrow,

672
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:31,940
don't go to grab the Grand Canyon for your escape vessel, because I've got dibs on it.

673
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,220
I could rattle off quite a few things that I've already got dibs on,

674
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,860
because I don't want people fighting me over it at the last minute.

675
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:46,540
I don't want to go up at the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum and have Doc Frop going, oh, no you don't.

676
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,500
Actually, we worked that out.

677
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,020
He's taking the paintings and I'm taking the furniture.

678
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,620
Furniture of kings.

679
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,000
But think about those things, friends.

680
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,540
What about Brushwood?

681
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,520
Do we want to see this lovely piece of land destroyed when we can just as easily beam it up into one of our saucers?

682
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,540
I don't think that its owners ever actually bought a membership,

683
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,400
although they said, oh, no, we're going to take it.

684
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:11,400


685
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,180
We certainly deserve honorary ones.

686
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,860
So, you know, you've got to think about, are there unsaved friends and family members

687
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,720
or enemies that you want to keep as slaves or sex toys?

688
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,280
You've got to really think about this or you may miss your chance.

689
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:38,000
I mean, imagine if, say, you go, oh, man, I've got to go pick up that one toy store

690
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,400
that had everything I always wanted but couldn't afford.

691
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:48,860
And some subgenius has just blasted it to cinders out of spite just because somebody looked at him funny in that toy store one day.

692
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,540
There's going to be a lot of that going on.

693
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,200
It may be happening less than 24 hours from now.

694
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,040
These are serious things to think about.

695
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,060
Make your list of wanted sex toys now.

696
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:09,120
Say there's some bitchy boss that you always thought, I wish I could lobotomize that bastard, keep him in a cage,

697
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,820
and then just...

698
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,540
fuck their wound every now and then.

699
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,140
You can do this if that's the way you're thinking about it.

700
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,880
There's a certain fifth grade teacher I had.

701
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm sure she's dead, but she won't be for long.

702
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:30,040
She won't be for long, man, because there's a power of muam and those exes, man.

703
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:36,740
If you've got that $30 membership card in your pocket, you can bring those hated teachers back from the dead

704
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,260
and make them eat that pimento cheese sandwich.

705
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,740
Right in front of everybody and see how they like it.

706
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,180
You know, there's...

707
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:51,820
I hate to sound peevish and like a person that hangs, but I know we all do it.

708
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,020
And some of you have a much longer list than me.

709
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,940
And I'm going to avoid you because I may be on your list.

710
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,520
I'm full aware of that.

711
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,760
Yes, there are aspects of ex-day that we tend not to keep in mind.

712
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,300
So let's air out.

713
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,920
Let's air out our brains with some live music from the Record Bar in Kansas City.

714
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,460
A song by Bob Walkenhorst of the Rainmakers.

715
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,640
This song has been stuck in my head for weeks, and I'm hoping to dump it into yours.

716
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:58,460
I heard you telling your friend, ah, he's heartless enough.

717
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,120
There's almost nothing you could have said that would have hurt me so much.

718
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,440
But how to risk all you've got?

719
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,980
Oh, I forget.

720
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,440
You do forget.

721
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,320
Are you to see that harmless is one thing?

722
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,040
I'm most certainly in love.

723
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,180
It's all fools, oh, my dear.

724
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,080
It's all fools, oh, my dear.

725
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,420
It's hardly ever like you think.

726
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,480
It's so most always like you feel.

727
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,780
It's all fools, oh.

728
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,140
It's all fools, oh.

729
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,480
It's all fools, oh.

730
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,120
It's all fools, oh.

731
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,360
When we were young, we were dancing to a band at the ring.

732
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,640
We were so far out of tune in time, and you didn't even click.

733
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,700
We were the best in the world.

734
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,460
As far as we looked, we were.

735
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:07,460


736
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,920
Sir, I learned two years old

737
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,720
It was amazing what they learned

738
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,340
Tries to school, tries to class

739
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,080
Tries to fly, tries to fly

740
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,860
They were at least twice as good

741
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,640
And they're having such fun

742
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,440
It's all those good, my dear

743
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,060
It's all those good, my dear

744
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,360
Yeah, sometimes the facts

745
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,900
Can make us hopeless again

746
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,840
It's all those good, my dear

747
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,920
It's all those good

748
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,120
It's all those good, my dear

749
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,680
It's all those good, my dear

750
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,100
It's all those good, my dear

751
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,180
I was in traffic by the band

752
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,040
Raving up the crowd as he drives

753
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,180
He couldn't stay between the lines

754
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,400
He couldn't read between the lines

755
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,200
And so I ran him off the road

756
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,240
The first chance that I got

757
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,660
See, heartless is one thing

758
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,980
I don't have a chance tonight

759
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,340
It's all those good, my dear

760
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,160
It's all those good, my dear

761
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,260
Yeah, sometimes the facts

762
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,780
Can make the truth disappear

763
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,180
It's all those good, my dear

764
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,680
It's all those good, my dear

765
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,520
It's all those good, my dear

766
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,380
It's all those good, my dear

767
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:14,380


768
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,720
I think I'd honor my old

769
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,300
That he one day struck me blind

770
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,360
But I can't see the forest

771
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,940
Brought to plastic so tight

772
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,720
Oh, if ignorance is bliss

773
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,320
I'm the happiest man alive

774
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,940
I do so want to believe

775
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,300
I've survived

776
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,540
And oh, sometimes I imagine politics and love

777
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,340
When we even resist

778
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,500
Mistakes are handshake of friendship

779
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,080
Call the hate shaking fists

780
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,940
It's like the lost touch of the mind

781
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,620
It's a rational blame

782
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,400
Why leave no other choice

783
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,040
That's who gave the mind to that blame

784
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,980
It's all fools, you're over-minded

785
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:08,120
And it's our fools go my dear

786
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,280
An ethereality

787
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,100
Not stone

788
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,700
It's all fools go

789
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,420
And it's our fools go

790
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,060
But you know, religion is complex.

791
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,520
Morality is complex.

792
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,400
Luckily, we don't have to worry about morality or good and evil.

793
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,700
Only what feels good.

794
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,540
We're like the new age.

795
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,080
There's no...

796
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,540
Science means nothing.

797
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,920
It's all in what you feel.

798
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,540
Our id is our id.

799
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,420
If you feel like you can heal somebody and they shouldn't go to the doctor,

800
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,580
then they're terrible to go to the doctor.

801
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,100
That's against the new age.

802
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,260
Don't get me started.

803
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,500
I have a question since Dr. Hill may know the answer.

804
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,940
I'll save that for Starwood.

805
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,160
As Stang was talking about this,

806
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,720
this list and what we should claim,

807
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,180
should we just think of it very deeply right at 7 a.m.?

808
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,340
Because it would be very difficult to communicate.

809
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,840
Will the exes sort of wire up a hive mind

810
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,200
for us to be able to communicate what we got dibs on?

811
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,020
No, they instantly know.

812
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,060
Everything is instantly known.

813
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,540
All fails fall away.

814
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,580
Our intellect...

815
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,400
They know what you really, really want

816
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,100
and what's really inside your head.

817
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,480
Crude blundering is our mental acuity compared to theirs.

818
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,400
It's easy for them to read

819
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,000
as it's...

820
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,740
It's easy for us to read the four-inch high scrawls of a kindergartner

821
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,600
on a piece of art on the refrigerator.

822
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,280
Some of y'all may be surprised.

823
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,640
You may suddenly find yourself...

824
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,660
Some of you tough guys out there may wake up on the saucer

825
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,180
and you're a beautiful woman.

826
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,820
And it turned out that was really all you really wanted to be.

827
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,200
Oh look, see the eggplant there.

828
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,160
He knows what it's like.

829
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,760
You know?

830
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,760
It's too late for most of us to follow the path of Pope S. Lilith.

831
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,840
The brave subgenius who decided to change bodies before they...

832
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,100
I couldn't wait for the exes.

833
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,760
Two girls making it.

834
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,520
Right.

835
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,740
Pope S. Lilith said,

836
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,380
Watch two girls making it.

837
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,560
Hell, I'd rather be two girls making it.

838
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,060
And actually took Bob up on that.

839
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:39,840
Where doth thy hairs go, lady?

840
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:39,960
Follow the assămahamma.

841
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,180
Sorry mighty god, you'll die now.

842
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,880
You'll die?

843
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,280
Well I'll giderado kill you.

844
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,280


845
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,380
approving her...

846
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,340
Then go and purge ourselves of this world,

847
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,300
And leader of the Underworld.

848
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,800
After your beauty claims done?

849
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,920
The mutants must fear

850
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,560
The mutants must thrive

851
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,620
The saucers will burn

852
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,780
And the darlings will die

853
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,760
The mutants will leave

854
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,300
And be loud and scary

855
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,100
The doors will carry

856
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,140
The saucers will burn

857
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:58,140


858
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,880
The mutants must fear

859
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,820
The mutants must die

860
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,280
Now get this

861
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,180
One of the students

862
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,580
Who joined up

863
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,860
Learned in the course of it

864
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:50,040
That her real biological father

865
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,340
Was a well-known subgenius

866
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,380
A terrible

867
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,760
Dr. Katahdin Lagoon

868
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,840
And I don't see

869
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,140
The heck with him

870
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,460
happy new family here.

871
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,120
No, I don't. I'm looking for Mr. Legume.

872
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,500
She was one of the...

873
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,980
And this is something I wanted to tell you all about that course.

874
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,000
She was one of the four people

875
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,700
who passed.

876
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,860
There were 40 people who joined that damn course.

877
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,020
They spent $135 and most of them

878
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,860
flunked. But you know how

879
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,860
Reverend Anna Dynamite passed?

880
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:18,820
She

881
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,580
crudely drew her own

882
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,340
diploma.

883
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,720
Not even using a pen, using her

884
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,340
mouse.

885
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,480
And

886
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,560
that, I thought, that showed enough nerve

887
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,140
to prove that she really understood.

888
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,740
Another guy

889
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,220
passed also by forging a diploma,

890
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,580
but his was really fancy. And he gave me

891
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,340
one. Another one

892
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,240
passed by a bribe.

893
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,540
Sent me a book he'd written

894
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,020
about Robert Anton Wilson.

895
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,700
But the

896
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,820
one who really...

897
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,500
I'm telling you this because I know you'll

898
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,560
forget by the time you take the course.

899
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,300
Because you're subgeniuses.

900
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,920
But the one guy

901
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,600
who really passed with flying colors

902
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,080
was the guy who said,

903
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,980
this is all a lie.

904
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,900
You're talking about a...

905
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,720
this Doug Smith

906
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,840
guy having to work.

907
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,060
And there was never an Ivan Stanger

908
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,460
just flew, breezed through life.

909
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,220
And that Bob is just this

910
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,340
piece of clip art as far as you

911
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,200
guys really know. You don't have

912
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,900
any more solid evidence of him

913
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,080
than that skull of the person that was shot

914
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,460
in San Francisco in 84

915
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,000
and a few other things, pipes and teeth

916
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,540
and stuff.

917
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,000
This is a lie.

918
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,480
This whole thing, all of these documents,

919
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,560
you hired actors, handsome

920
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,160
young actors to play

921
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,340
these old subgenius

922
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,380
ne'er-do-wells as young people.

923
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,800
And faked all these graphics

924
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,900
and things just to test our

925
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,800
faith the same way that God

926
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,680
put dinosaur bones

927
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,220
into the Grand Canyon

928
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,520
to test the faith of

929
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,180
the human race.

930
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,640
And that guy

931
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,660
was like, he doesn't need

932
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,820
subgenius 102.

933
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,620
He passed subgenius 101

934
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,900
and the truth of the matter is

935
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,740
he realized that the only way to really

936
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,380
pass is when you realize

937
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,840
subgenius 102

938
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,880
is when you teach the next

939
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,640
sucker subgenius 101.

940
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,200
That also works

941
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,660
for mysticism 101.

942
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,640
For ye of little faith.

943
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,880
Which actor was

944
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,060
the best?

945
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,820
Which actor was playing you

946
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,960
and which actor was playing how?

947
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,800
Well, I don't know.

948
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,700
They hired unknowns, but they were

949
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,920
really good looking.

950
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,800
I was there in the

951
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,220
early 80s and I

952
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,060
don't remember any of us

953
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,800
looking that good.

954
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,420
I, for one, was never

955
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,420
that young.

956
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,000
They cleaned it up in post.

957
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,420
It's digital redo that they can do now.

958
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,880
I was wondering because the prop

959
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,800
production was great. I mean, the glasses

960
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,900
that the young Stang,

961
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,860
the young actor wore were just impressive.

962
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,080
Well, you have to remember they were trying

963
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,680
to make it look 80s style.

964
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,500
You know, that Elvis Costello look was big.

965
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:03,960
Right.

966
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,400
Now you're a...

967
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,620
To many people here,

968
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,580
Priestess Pisces is old hierarch.

969
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,780
She's been around forever,

970
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,000
as long as they can remember.

971
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,100
I'm a spring chicken.

972
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,800
But yeah, to me,

973
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,780
to me, even Nenslow is a newcomer.

974
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,120
To me, actually, Dr.

975
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,340
Howell is second stage subgenius.

976
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,920
Because I didn't meet you until like 19,

977
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,680
late 1980s.

978
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,980
That makes Dr.

979
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,460
Howell an infant instead of genius.

980
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,260
A mere embryo, barely out of the shell.

981
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,700
Still covered with the amniotic fluid.

982
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,800
You can tell the very first ones who were touched

983
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,940
by Bob because they all have false teeth and wear

984
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,980
wigs and trusses and can barely walk.

985
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,260
The Elohim.

986
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,980
They've been exposed.

987
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:55,060
They've been exposed.

988
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,860
They've been exposed to the radiation of Bob directly.

989
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,600
That's why Philo has to wear a mask all the time.

990
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,860
Philo is pretty frightening if you see him up close.

991
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:05,320
Yeah.

992
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:05,920
Yeah.

993
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,660
It shows.

994
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,180
It really shows his years spent in Dobstown.

995
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,540
Man, there's...

996
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,860
You can see every ass rape on those on his face.

997
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,920
Philo has to toil in the bowels of the conspiracy

998
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,200
to support his multiple families being the Mormon

999
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,200
subgenius.

1000
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:25,520
Yeah.

1001
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,340
He's the polygamous subgenius.

1002
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,700
He actually does have more than one wife.

1003
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:38,800
This is the sun, the moon, the stars, carved images, pictures, icons, dead people, human

1004
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,960
science, money.

1005
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,260
Make yourself useless.

1006
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,480
There is no God.

1007
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,880
You should worship science or the creation, mother nature.

1008
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:51,900
Astrology rules.

1009
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,880
We need Buddhists.

1010
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:54,800
We need Buddhists.

1011
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:02,040
When you come, like me, follow after sorcerers, witches, mediums, you need to seek homosexuals.

1012
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,620
That is good advice for you now.

1013
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,920
Please write to me.

1014
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,160
I would like to know about you.

1015
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:08,860
Okay.

1016
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,860
This program is presented by the Centers for Disease People.

1017
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,240
Is your heart trying to die from a heart attack?

1018
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,060
New treatments are available today that can kill.

1019
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,580
So listen to your doctor.

1020
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,160
And feel short-headed or have chest pains in the arms or shoulders.

1021
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,120
Down in Abilene, Texas is Brian.

1022
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,000
Hey, Brian, you're on with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

1023
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:35,480
Good morning.

1024
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,820
Good morning.

1025
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,280
Hail Bob and hail Connie.

1026
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,380
Hail.

1027
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,940
Yeah, Connie is Bob's beautiful wife.

1028
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,420
Cool.

1029
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,520
Yes.

1030
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:49,400
I remember the good Reverend mentioning that not enough people remembered Connie and they

1031
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,620
just focused on Bob.

1032
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,500
Not enough people remember which?

1033
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:53,560
Not enough people remember which?

1034
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,480
Not enough people remember Connie.

1035
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,440
Oh.

1036
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:05,360
Well, you got to have some sex in your religion, and Connie's pretty cute.

1037
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,840
Bob's good looking too.

1038
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,920
You have to wonder what the kids will look like.

1039
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,040
They look like Ken and Barbie.

1040
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,220
Oh, yeah.

1041
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,680
And neither one of them have sexual appropriate identifying.

1042
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:20,440
Yeah, right.

1043
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,540
So you don't have to worry about them reproducing.

1044
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1045
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1046
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1047
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1048
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1049
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1050
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1051
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1052
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1053
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1054
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,540


1055
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,200
They don't have to be reproducing too much.

1056
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,860
Good thing, yeah.

1057
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,700
Bob's head, just his head alone, reproduces fabulously.

1058
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:36,440
The main portrait of Bob actually came from a piece of Yellow Pages clip art that wasn't

1059
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,580
anybody's copyright or trademark.

1060
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,380
It had been used to death at some point in the ancient past, and we trademarked it.

1061
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:50,740
And I've seen that thing projected at concerts over Michael Jackson's head.

1062
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,600
I've seen him.

1063
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,520
I've seen like a lot of people.

1064
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:53,520


1065
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:59,140
You know, one story high, fire breathing, three dimensional Bob face sculptures.

1066
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,240
We have some real fanatics in this religion.

1067
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,480
Luckily, some of them are pretty good artists.

1068
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,560
That's a good thing.

1069
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,020
And very few of them have been serial killers that we know of.

1070
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,000
As far as you know.

1071
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,280
Brian?

1072
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:21,200
Yeah, I joined the church myself a couple months ago, and it's an honor to meet Mr.

1073
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,040
Stang, Reverend Stang.

1074
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,520
Excuse me.

1075
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,600
Right, that's Reverend Stang.

1076
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,120
That's Reverend Stang.

1077
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:25,600
Yeah.

1078
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,080
I didn't spend six weeks at Dobstown University.

1079
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,100
Of course not.

1080
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:29,860
Divinity College for nothing.

1081
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,640
How is Princess Wee, by the way?

1082
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,600
Oh, Princess Wee is my wife.

1083
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:35,620
Oh.

1084
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,860
She is sound asleep.

1085
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,560
She's much better.

1086
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,820
You see, I'm speaking from Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and it's 3.30 in the morning here.

1087
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,260
Oh my.

1088
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,520
So she's, I'm married to a princess from outer space.

1089
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,080
Cool.

1090
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:50,460
Right?

1091
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,520
And I actually have a really happy, happy life.

1092
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:53,520


1093
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:53,520


1094
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:53,520


1095
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:53,520


1096
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:53,520


1097
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:53,520


1098
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:53,960
And it's just a happy marriage.

1099
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,020
There are such things as happy subjects.

1100
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:56,920
Well, I've heard of it.

1101
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,200
Yeah, that's her official title, Queen of all the UFOs, if I remember correctly.

1102
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,140
That's right.

1103
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,700
Yeah, she is the Queen of all the UFOs.

1104
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:11,320
Unfortunately, being unidentified, we don't know which UFOs they are.

1105
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,000
So we can't figure out which is her home planet.

1106
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,980
And although she should be waited on hand and foot by handmen and footmen, instead,

1107
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,100
she has to go to work like everybody else.

1108
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:23,500
Well, I don't think that's true.

1109
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:23,500


1110
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:23,500


1111
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:23,500


1112
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:23,500


1113
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:23,500


1114
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,340
I'd worship her.

1115
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,600
I'm still waiting to get an autographed picture of Princess Lee

1116
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,520
and stick it up on my altar and bow to her three times a day.

1117
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:33,980
Wow.

1118
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,100
Oh, it's great to know that we've got stalkers out there.

1119
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,620
That's great.

1120
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,820
No, no, no.

1121
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,160
All the way in Cleveland, eh?

1122
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,500
I'm not going to stalk her.

1123
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,600
He's just a worshiper.

1124
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,880
He's a faithful, loyal worshiper.

1125
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,420
Well, like I said, there was a time when the Church of the Subgenius

1126
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,140
was all a bunch of lonely, nerdy guys with glasses.

1127
00:53:53,500 --> 00:54:00,100
And we gradually changed that by lying and saying there were lots and lots of girls.

1128
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,700
And by golly, it finally happened.

1129
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,660
And now some of our, like for instance out in Atlanta,

1130
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:13,020
Reverend Susie the Flusie has a weekly radio show on a college station.

1131
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,020
And there's the Connieites, we call them.

1132
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,140
These are the women's auxiliary, you might say, women's sewing auxiliary.

1133
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,640
As it were, yeah.

1134
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,120
We borrowed a lot from the Masons.

1135
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,920
Really?

1136
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,740
Well, you know, they secretly control the universe.

1137
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,700
I've heard that, yeah.

1138
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:37,620
And so we figured, you know, they had, they must be doing something right.

1139
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,200
Yeah.

1140
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,300
And.

1141
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,580
All those cool uniforms they wear.

1142
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,400
Yeah.

1143
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,500
Yeah, they all, yeah.

1144
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,880
And they have some great initiation stunts and so forth.

1145
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,200
Yeah.

1146
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,060
We've tried to borrow from them.

1147
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,280
And, of course,

1148
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,200
the secret names business, the whole secret society thing.

1149
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:56,760
Right.

1150
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:56,940
Yeah.

1151
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,220
Right.

1152
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:57,440
Yeah.

1153
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,000
I like that too.

1154
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,760
Except you're not a secret.

1155
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,180
I mean.

1156
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,660
And the good Reverend will be getting an order from me in a couple of weeks after I get my tax return.

1157
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,280
I'm getting you three Bob books.

1158
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:07,860
Cool.

1159
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,200
That's right.

1160
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:09,900
There are three.

1161
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:14,760
We have the Old Testament, the New Testament, and yet the Third Testament.

1162
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,920
And the Third Testament.

1163
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:17,460
All right.

1164
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:22,600
Well, the Bobly, the new one is the Cyclopedia of Slack, the Boblyographer.

1165
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,940
And that's the latest one.

1166
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,760
But the basic one is called the Book of the Subgenius.

1167
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:37,820
If you Google subgenius and spell it correctly without an O, you'll suddenly know everything.

1168
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,240
You'll know all you need to know.

1169
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,060
And then you'll wish you didn't.

1170
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:41,720
See.

1171
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,100
It really sucks you in.

1172
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,620
I haven't had a real job since the 90s.

1173
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,080
Praise Bob.

1174
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,420
It's been play for pay for over a decade now.

1175
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,580
By the way, the book is called The Book of the Subgenius.

1176
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:52,580


1177
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,680
The collages before that were by Norrell Preff.

1178
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,420
And the background music here is by Speed Cave.

1179
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:03,680
For more information about the show, the Hour of Slack, including archived MP3s and podcasts

1180
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:09,360
and so forth, and about our guru, JR Bob Dobbs, see subgenius.com.

1181
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,460
Okay, good.

1182
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,780
Now give me a little smile.

1183
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,400
Come on now.

1184
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,540
Okay.

1185
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,620
I'm not used to this.

1186
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,580
I'm not used to this.

1187
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:22,980
I'm not used to smiling.

1188
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,680
Can I say something about this reflective surface?

1189
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,720
Yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn't it?

1190
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,940
I reflect too much.

1191
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,800
Except mercury's liquid at this stage.

1192
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,700
I reflect too much.

1193
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,680
I have too much insight.

1194
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,360
Oh, no.

1195
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,560
That's not what I'm talking about.

1196
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,120
What worries me is that it's reflecting everything but us.

1197
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,600
I need more outside.

1198
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,560
That makes you think about what you're doing.

1199
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1200
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1201
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1202
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1203
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1204
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1205
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1206
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1207
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1208
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1209
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:52,560


1210
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,200
I reflect too much.

1211
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,580
I hate to be the one non-scientist that picks this up, guys.

1212
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,720
I reflect too much.

1213
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,380
One could self-reflect on itself into a grave.

1214
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,220
Dig your own grave and save!

1215
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,800
One could self-reflect on itself into a grave.

1216
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,440
Snap into a daydreamer.

1217
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,480
Snap into a daydreamer.

1218
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,880
Snap out of it!

1219
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,160
Never get out.

1220
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,060
Never get out.

1221
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,020
Stop eating.

1222
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,380
Stop drinking water.

1223
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,180
Snap out of it!

1224
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,380
Stop moving.

1225
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,040
Stop living.

1226
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,320
Stop living.

1227
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,240
Never get out.

1228
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,100
Now to pull this predator in close.

1229
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,180
Bring in the truck.

1230
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,900
Never get out.

1231
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,800
Never get out.

1232
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:29,840
Never get out.

1233
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,580
Okay, whatever.

1234
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,600
Go! Go! Get out of here!

1235
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,820
We're out of here, friends.

1236
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,180
That was Phineas Narco of NationalSynical.com,

1237
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:46,000
where you can get a lot more Phineas if you want.

1238
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,460
Praise Bob.

1239
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,320
He's a real hero.

1240
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:57,620
He's a real hero.

1241
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,400
He's a real hero.

1242
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,980
Welcome to eternal good news of Hell.

1243
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,600
We need punishment.

1244
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,780
The righteous receive eternal, everlasting punishment.

1245
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,180
Instantaneous non-existence.

1246
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,920
It is not punishment.

1247
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,140
Go to Hell.

1248
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,540
Cease to exist.

1249
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,060
Day and night forever and ever.

1250
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:16,980
There. There.

1251
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,640
What will happen sexually?

1252
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,960
My friend, please do not cut it off.

1253
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:22,540
Go to Hell.

1254
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:22,540


1255
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:22,540


1256
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:26,480
D-E-M-O-N-O-K.

1257
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,780
Have a good eternity.
