00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,540
oh yer yer yey Oh Oh oh yer O praticamente

2
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,980
vowel

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,620
music

4
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,760
You ask me why I love her?

5
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,380
Give me time.

6
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,860
I'll explain.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,380
Have you drifted on a cold fog drifting over Kansas, sir?

8
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,900
Bayoued over San Francisco Bay?

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,340
Have you heard the bellow of a Bob White calling in the diesel in the Appalachian Mines?

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:03,700
You look with awe and wonder drifting way up high where men who braved a hard new world first stepped on the diesel in the city dock?

11
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,320
Do you think of them when you stroll along a rock way high?

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,860
Have you seen the mighty Peet?

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,180
Have you seen an eagle roll along Missouri's shore?

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,520
Have you felt it rage along the shore?

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,360
Is the word why a mayor read?

16
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,320
From a...

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,720
Alaska's Everglades.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,340
The mayor.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,520
My heart runs out.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,420
My pulse rises fast.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,020
The might of her domain.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,780
You ask me why I love her?

23
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,260
I have a million Appalachian Mines.

24
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,440
My beautiful Appalachian Mines.

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,660
Beneath God's wide old fog sky.

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,040
And found my hood from shining...

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,580
Sea to Sea.

28
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:01,980
Ah!

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,120
Like this movie is for kids!

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,640
John Wayne and Lemur.

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,200
Oh my gosh I kind of love vendo i can afford 50 kids

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,200


33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,100
MEMPLE SA Сейчас настроğu

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,500
Things However mismos

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,840
What is this here...

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,160
HUH?

37
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,560
It's his mind!

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,260
I'LL STAY AC不錯

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,300
STILL

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,300


41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,060
Hour of Slack number 929.

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,020
The Yeti of El Queso.

43
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:23,900
The Yeti of El Queso.

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,680
Hour of Slack.

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,840
Uh, yes.

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,500
It is 5000 BC.

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,560
Look around.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,820
See how there is nothing here to listen to.

49
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,300
No radio.

50
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,900
No television.

51
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,540
No phonograph.

52
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,900
Nothing but the wind and the rain.

53
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,520
The rhythm of the wind.

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,400
The beat of the raindrops.

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,680
See how man listens to that.

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,020
And now see how he starts to create strange rhythmic sounds of his own.

57
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,980
Sounds that excite his emotions.

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,920
Is that not some cowboy dance over there?

59
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,100
Goomagawoom.

60
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,760
Goomagawoom.

61
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,480
Goomagawoom.

62
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,060
Goomagawoom.

63
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,920
Goomagawoom.

64
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,420
Goomagawoom.

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,300
Goomagawoom.

66
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,300
Goomagawoom.

67
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,460
Goomagawoom.

68
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,940
The storm has driven the Yeti out of the high mountains into the old palace.

69
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,520
That is not good.

70
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,460
If the Yeti cut our contact with the outside world,

71
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,540
it could mean a slow death to the village and to us.

72
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,080
What were you saying about the high mountains?

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,100
I gotta get a new memory.

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:06,500
I gotta get a new memory system.

75
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,900
I gotta get a new memory system.

76
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,440
Oh, yes, friends, and I got one.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,260
And now I can quit doing reruns

78
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,440
because this is a special show

79
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,200
about our cousins

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,340
in the primate world.

81
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,960
The apes.

82
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,580
The big feet.

83
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,160
The yeti.

84
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,460
What?

85
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,820
So far, no complaints.

86
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,220
Well, this is about our ancestors,

87
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,900
the yeti from outer space.

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,020
And, friends, it's an educational show.

89
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm trying to tell you.

90
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,140
I'll be your monkey's uncle.

91
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,840
Get your sticking paws off me,

92
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,500
you damn dirty ape.

93
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,920
Do you want to touch my monkey?

94
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,040
I don't make monkeys.

95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,300
I just train them.

96
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,260
No more monkey business.

97
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:26,960
No!

98
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,120
No more monkey business.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The Monkey Babies

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,240
Birds and the bees and the monkey babies.

101
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,360
The Monkey Babies

102
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,420
The Monkey Babies

103
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,540
I thought Sir Edmund Hillary proved that yeti

104
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,780
or the abominable snowmen don't exist.

105
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,280
That's true, but sometimes native superstitions are just as powerful as the ones that are in the wild.

106
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,280


107
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,280


108
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,280


109
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,280


110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
There's also a scientific proof.

111
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,540
Thank God we can enjoy this pain.

112
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,500
Speaking of bears, now, recently,

113
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:06,660
two weeks ago, this bear photographer naturalist and his wife were eaten by bears.

114
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,220
And this week, squirrels invaded our house.

115
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,340
Our house has been...

116
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,460
I came downstairs this morning and found a large ratty squirrel.

117
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,480
Now, wait a minute.

118
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
With a Swiss Army knife.

119
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,080
I opened the door.

120
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,540
And he waddled slowly out.

121
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,940
Cleveland-aged squirrels.

122
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,040
Okay, man, I'm leaving.

123
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,020
A very well-fed squirrel waddled out.

124
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,500
Get that broom away from me. I'm leaving.

125
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,180
Actually, he was.

126
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:42,340
We later discovered that he had taken a bag of candy out of a purse or something.

127
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,020
And we still don't know where the rest of the bag is.

128
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,820
Dark chocolate and crystallized ginger.

129
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,320
You have to make sure you don't...

130
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,280
We found little black objects here and there around the house.

131
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,220
That's called squirrel poo-poo.

132
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,060
Is that what you call it?

133
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,240
Oh.

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,780
And if you infuse enough of that into your herbal teas, you will get the...

135
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,400
I thought those were smart pills.

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,800
Yeah, I thought those were smart pills.

137
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,000
You will get the well-flavored Navajo Plague Whey.

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,660
You know, a couple months back, I was on the air and I even said that the wild kingdom is in rebellion.

139
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,220
Yes.

140
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,620
Well, this has been said by...

141
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,360
The animals are smart and smarting up.

142
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
The animals are telling...

143
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Hey, this is what they're going to say one day.

144
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,900
They're going to walk up to us and say,

145
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,420
You know how to build rockets?

146
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,620
Get the fuck out of here.

147
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,120
The squirrels are going to say that to us?

148
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,040
All of them.

149
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,380
Squirrels don't need rockets.

150
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,620
Look at how they propel themselves from branch to branch.

151
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,020
Humans, go back to Yeti laboratory.

152
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Yeah, you humans, back out to the space.

153
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,260
Go back to the alien lab.

154
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,140
Back to the silver mines of ancient Atlantis where you belong.

155
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Earth, back to Mars!

156
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,980
Earth, back to Mars!

157
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,540
It must be true because, you know, there's no monkeys that can kind of talk.

158
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,140
Yes, there are.

159
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,960
There are baboons have a vocabulary of about 250 words and they sound weird as hell.

160
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,600
Their word for lion, for instance, is java and it sounds like...

161
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,060
But you can't teach a monkey to speak a language.

162
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,720
Well, now, that's arguable.

163
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
Coco the gorilla is a famous example.

164
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,940
That's all sign language.

165
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,440
Yeah, but that's still language.

166
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,860
But they are reflective of our human verbal language.

167
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,240
Understand my point.

168
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,980
There's no link between a human who can just blabber on and on forever and ever, take Dave,

169
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,080
and a monkey who can sort of blabber a little bit.

170
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,860
Well, monkeys can hand sign.

171
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,220
There's no links between the two.

172
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,040
We have to be implanted from outer space.

173
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,960
Well, we've all been implanted, but it has nothing to do with monkeys.

174
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,780
It has to do with superior sexual experience.

175
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,460
Or, no, it's not sexual experience.

176
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,420
It's kind of like the hell world, actually.

177
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,200
You'd think there'd be a few monkeys that could pick up a few English words and go,

178
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,340
Hey, man, throw me that fucking banana.

179
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,900
Oh, I think they would probably use that word, too.

180
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,720
You're thinking of apes and they can.

181
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,060
They'd probably say...

182
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,700
Throw me a fuck, you bananas.

183
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,360
They saw that movie Planet of the Apes, and they know what awaits them if we know that they can be trained to do it.

184
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,640
Yeah.

185
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,760
Let's take out the garbage of white tables.

186
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,420
...watching their TV screens.

187
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:06,080
The maintenance men thought it would be amusing to let them watch hours and hours of Planet of the Apes on DVD.

188
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,460
But something went wrong in that laboratory, didn't it, on the...

189
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,400
Well, the thing that disturbed me is that...

190
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,060
...Sar Cornelius...

191
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,460
...is Saturday afternoon.

192
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,800
Yes, my leader, Cornelius.

193
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,180
Great Caesar.

194
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,380
King of the apes.

195
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,220
Chaz.

196
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,880
Huh?

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,420
Chaz, you better watch you don't talk like Cornelius.

198
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,600
Huh?

199
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,500
If you know what I'm saying.

200
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,080
Hey, man.

201
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,280
Ten minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

202
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,180
Well, I mean, you know...

203
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,460
Hey, amigo.

204
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,540
It's bad enough what happened to the indigent peoples of this continent and so many others, actually.

205
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,620
We should make fun of short people.

206
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,360
And other planets.

207
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,420
But think what we do to the apes, dude.

208
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,600
What?

209
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,280
Well, that's what you do to the apes, Steve.

210
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:54,820
I mean, they still serve chimpanzee meat in Belgium and they're cutting their brains open and hooking their little rhesus monkey robot arms up to robot arms.

211
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,640
Ape...

212
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,260
Macaque brains operating robot arms.

213
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,620
Yes, they do.

214
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,860
They pluck them from the wilds.

215
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,700
I want one on my living room table.

216
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:11,600
Eating their jaundiced dingleberries and their happy fruits and their strange philosophies and put them in a science laboratory where they are cold-cutted and masturbated to oblivion.

217
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,920
I want my monkey brains well done.

218
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,740
And they'll be done for you.

219
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:24,120
To quote J.R. Bob Dobbs, actually he was ordering monkey brains in a Malaysian restaurant, but I want a monkey brain on my living room table that operates...

220
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,740
You didn't have monkey brains for Thanksgiving?

221
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,180
...a robot arm.

222
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,100
You didn't get the monkey brain dish at the Thanksgiving dinner?

223
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,580
No.

224
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:31,940
Oh.

225
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,940
Those are illegal now, man.

226
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,780
But that's still a delicious snack.

227
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,520
If I did have it, I sure wouldn't say it on the radio.

228
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,340
Your cat ought to do that point.

229
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,360
Looks like a Yeti convention.

230
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,400
You lie with the Yeti.

231
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,220
Seeing as how you know everything, what's the scoop on this Yeti stuff?

232
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,780
They're also called abominable snowmen.

233
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,040
They have feet that point backward, scream like a banshee, and are invisible.

234
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,940
Well, if they're invisible, how can anybody see a Yeti?

235
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,300
No one has Yeti.

236
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,860
Oh, come on.

237
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,740
Good evening.

238
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
Good evening.

239
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,260
Oh, look, Maggie.

240
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,560
What is that?

241
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,700
Do-de-ki-tron.

242
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,320
Do-de-ka-hee-tron.

243
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,040
He does.

244
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,160
I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father's trying to worry.

245
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,680
Ahhhhh!

246
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,900
Ahhhhh!

247
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,360
Ahhhhh!

248
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,320
Ahhhhh!

249
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,080


250
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,660
Ahhhhh!

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,560
Ahhhhh!

252
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,900
Ahhhhh!

253
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,380
Ahhhhh!

254
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,180
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

255
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,440
Ohhhhhh!

256
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,340
Aaaaah!

257
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,180
I work hard at my job, and I hope that by my efforts rendered faithfully over a period

258
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,040
of years, I'll move up through the corporate hierarchy to a position of security, power,

259
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,820
and prestige.

260
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,620
In order to improve my chances for advancement, I dress conservatively, keep myself well informed

261
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,340
in the arts and current events, hold popular opinions, and socialize in the best circles

262
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,340


263
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,340


264
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,260
with those who have influence.

265
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,040
But these efforts have been so far in vain.

266
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,420
I remain the Night Watchman.

267
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,120
The Grey Plannel 8.

268
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,720
What is death?

269
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,360
If I put the barrel of a gun against my forehead and pull the trigger,

270
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,320
what will happen?

271
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,260
Where will I go?

272
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,480
I wonder if expressions we have come casually to use when referring to death

273
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,780
actually reflect reality.

274
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,900
For example, the term,

275
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,860
bought the farm.

276
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,520
Could it be that when I die,

277
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,960
I will actually come into possession of a farm I've purchased with my own money?

278
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,140
Is it possible?

279
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,380
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

280
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,500
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

281
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,100
Raise the...

282
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

283
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,140
And Norelpref.

284
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,760
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

285
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,560
Who did this mix in the background?

286
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,280
We don't know what Mitchie says.

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,260
Even the strongest have their moments of...

288
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,740
Lie with the Yeti.

289
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,560
I'm just... I'm fucking fatigued.

290
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,680
Yes, we lie with the Yeti, friends.

291
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,060
You've been hearing clips from all manner of places.

292
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,920
From ESO radio on WCSB Cleveland, of course,

293
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,100
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Professor Chaz,

294
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,700
the new Monet,

295
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,680
a mix called Monkey Man preceded that,

296
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,840
and lots of Norelpref mixes,

297
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,260
which will be throughout the show.

298
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,840
We had a little Evolution Control Committee clip

299
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,920
that's rather in keeping.

300
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,400
Yeah, baby, because we lie with the Yeti.

301
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,700
The titles of this show were by the El Queso All-Stars.

302
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,320
And, friends, this is going to be an El Queso All-Star and Yeti show,

303
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,520
number 929.

304
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,080
Yes, the Yeti.

305
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Because, friends, we were brought, we, the so-called humans,

306
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,980
were brought from space by the Yeti.

307
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,460
Actually, the humans were invented as lab rats by the Yeti.

308
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,060
But 80 million years ago, they got out,

309
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,260
there was interbreeding, and the result was we, the subgenius.

310
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,140
And, yes, we lie with the Yeti.

311
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,760
So there will be tons of El Queso All-Stars.

312
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,220
In fact, they are working on a Yeti,

313
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,680
a Yeti opera about a Yeti named Rufus

314
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,080
and his journey to a final triumph over the conspiracy.

315
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,700
Friends, you are not going to believe the tales of Rufus the Yeti,

316
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,580
which follow.

317
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,200
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

318
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,380
I see it, but I hardly dare believe it.

319
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,860
You can believe it.

320
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,200
The Yeti have taken vengeance into their own hands.

321
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,680
We, the subjects, will take our revenge.

322
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:31,680


323
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:31,720
Good night, dear and interdependent friends.

324
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,580
I long not to see you again, sisters of El Queso All-Stars,

325
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,520
for you am a bread to my magic.

326
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,020
Under all circumstances,

327
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,160
theFreeCast has been temporarily stopped

328
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,740
To disappear in a flash of light

329
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,920
You can't imagine that it happened

330
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,480
But it happened to a yeti one night

331
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Abducted, transported

332
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,620
But unanticipated

333
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,960
His vibration calculated a break

334
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,600
In the beam that held him against his will

335
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,480
But he remained still

336
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,700
We've read the situation

337
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,740
Then he showed his agitation

338
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,880
By jumping to his feet

339
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,100
And confronting his abductors

340
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,080
You guys aren't the exes

341
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,140
You bug-eyed motherfuckers

342
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,800
It was the greys

343
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,520
The alien slaves

344
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,920
The ones working for the pentagon

345
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,600
For six decades

346
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,080
This must have been a mothership

347
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,340
As he was hip deep in the creaks

348
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,200
He knew a little slip

349
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,500
Would cause him to sleep a long sleep

350
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,460
So he fixed his gaze

351
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,880
On the horde that confronted him

352
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,680
He cleared his throat

353
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,900
And then he spoke in their native tongue

354
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,800
I slayed greys for days

355
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,540
And ways to pay

356
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,520
When I played the game

357
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,060
That you didn't know I came here to play

358
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,040
You'll regret the delays

359
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,880
That you caused me

360
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,040
Cause greys are way too weak

361
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,840
To fight a yeti

362
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,300
Rufus took a stance

363
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,200
And began to breathe

364
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,260
His eyes turned red

365
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,280
And he began to weave

366
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,960
He made a noise

367
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,360
And sounded like a tiger's sneeze

368
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,440
And then the lights blew out

369
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,560
And the aliens screamed

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,540
Crimson eyes flashed in the dark

371
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,380
As he ripped apart his first victim

372
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,320
It didn't matter

373
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,380
If the splatter from the alien

374
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,880
Did ever whittle up into his presence

375
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,000
Cause he ripped them all to tatters

376
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,560
In a heartbeat

377
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,900
It was all over with

378
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,020
Rufus on the bridge

379
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,580
And turned to Troy

380
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,940
On the ship

381
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,000
Black space above

382
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,780
Green earth below

383
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,640
Which way should he go?

384
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,160
He didn't know about the aliens' control

385
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,880
So he put on his magic blindfold

386
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,840
His magic blindfold

387
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,880
Put it on and started spinning

388
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,120
Faster and faster

389
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,720
Reverting disaster

390
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,860
With a casual press

391
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,140
Against a panel or a button

392
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,160
He was just touching

393
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,320
What he needed to on accident

394
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,260
He didn't understand

395
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,600
The symbols or the consequences

396
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,780
The earth grew larger

397
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,960
As the ship came down

398
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,840
Rufus crashed land

399
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,000
And at the outskirts of town

400
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,740
Hey, any lender

401
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,700
You can walk away from

402
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,100
Rufus stepped out of the bushes

403
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,980
And he got out of sight

404
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,580
His cruelty grew

405
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,300
He knew the plan

406
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,400
He had well known

407
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,940
That inside wsbridge

408
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:54,940


409
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,180
It was true

410
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,280
That Kelly

411
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,280


412
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,400
This was Rufus

413
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,400


414
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,080
At my very best

415
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,300
In this world

416
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,780
Which he said

417
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,520
He was not

418
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,680
By equipment

419
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,500
Rufus

420
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,340
ológica

421
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,160
Who he was

422
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,160


423
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,600
R америку

424
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,480
Come on

425
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,440
AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH!

426
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,800
It is the cry of the Yeti! The Yeti!

427
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,380
Knob? Knob? Knob?

428
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,900
It's the dance of the Sacred Pumpkin, calling the demise due to all things pink.

429
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,340
It's the dance of the Sacred Pumpkin, Rufus doubled over and released his stink.

430
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,320
It's the dance of the Sacred Pumpkin, calling the demise due to all things pink.

431
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,520
It's the dance of the sacred pumpkin

432
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,560
Rufus doubled over and released his sting

433
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,100
On the side of sand

434
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,080
Lost in a bad world

435
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,780
Like the fart of a time man

436
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,820
Rufus got the shovel and she dug the grave

437
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,000
He didn't give a crap for the shit that he gave to the people

438
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,020
The slave or the dwarf or the creep or the dumb on the street

439
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,720
They're all slackless and weak

440
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,720
But the dance in his feet and the beat from the pulsing pumpkin

441
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,800
Caught something alive from the pumpkins that died

442
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
In a circular trap until Rufus arrived

443
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,120
With his wits and his slack and the will and the balls

444
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,340
Nailing every last beat to the walls of the stall

445
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,520
In the shithouse they built that was fashioned of lies

446
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,840
And they couldn't wipe their asses, Rufus cut them down to size

447
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,260
No, no, they couldn't wipe their asses, Rufus cut them down to size

448
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,700
The wall is tidy, let's fight

449
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,160
The wall is tidy, let's fight

450
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,600
And they were swirly, orly, thick and not just any trick

451
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,800
With a pork so Rufus had to exercise, he had to dance

452
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,260
And dance

453
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,300
It's the dance of a sacred pumpkin

454
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,260
Calling the demise just to all things good

455
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,620
It's the dance of a sacred pumpkin

456
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,680
Calling the demise just to all things good

457
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:42,200
It's the dance of a sacred pumpkin

458
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,220
Only a yeti could bring on such terror

459
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:57,360
When Rufus arrived at the tit of all trees

460
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,040
He was very alive

461
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,060
He was crawling with fleas

462
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,400
He was swarming with flies

463
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,100
There were scabs on his knees

464
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,100
But the look in his eyes said his life would not soon cease

465
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:18,120
He kept a bucket of disease that he would use to mark his trail

466
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,020
He walked it slower than a snail to buy his time half up on sand

467
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,840
And so when finally he reached that ancient tavernry of green

468
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,560
He held his sacred pumpkin high

469
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,920
And the Rufus screamed

470
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,640
And then a disco ball

471
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,520
Descended from the sky

472
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,840
His lapels grew long

473
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,380
And the fleas burst into song

474
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,040
Peach decked in glitter

475
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,920
And feathers the senders

476
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,680
That snooped and swirled

477
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,040
That rendered their ane to blenders

478
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,480
That rendered their rectums

479
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,560
And reduced the slack

480
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,420
That this brave yeti Rufus

481
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,300
Will fight to get back

482
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,340
And with the introduction of the fleas

483
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,580
The tit of all trees granted Rufus a nipple

484
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,920
And with a near instinctive ease

485
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,780
Rufus dropped to his knees and proceeded to suckle

486
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,260
And a vision then appeared in his mind

487
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,560
Of a world unconfined

488
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,580
Of the con and decline

489
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,960
Of the pink left behind

490
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,140
Of the slack that's combined

491
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,780
In a plan that's designed to make the gods knees buckle

492
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,960
There's a question that's taken

493
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,560
To make this vision come true

494
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,080
Twenty morning trials

495
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,940
My eyes have seen

496
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,620
Can't defeat

497
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,360
The choice to slow your hand

498
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,260
But for now

499
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,620
Take the last train out of town

500
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,100
Ple colleague help the prowler

501
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,100


502
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,100


503
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,100


504
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,100


505
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,100


506
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,880
Rufus took the last train out of town

507
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,680
He moved the Потом out of town

508
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,140
Rufus took the last train out of town

509
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,040
Rufus took the last train out of town

510
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,160
Let's get the last train out of town

511
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,060
Let's get the last train out of town

512
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,500
Step forward on the right, step forward on the left

513
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,680
Step out on the right, lifting the bent left knee

514
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,040
By the right foot

515
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,940
Step back on the right, step forward on the left

516
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,260
Step back on the right

517
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,680
Rufus took the last train out of town

518
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,180
Rufus took the last train out of town

519
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,380
Rufus took the last train out of town

520
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,000
Rufus took the last train out of town

521
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,680
Yee-haw!

522
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,580
This song is magical

523
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,200
As magic as Doug Heating's act was gay

524
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Rufus had watered for

525
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,900
He waded through a field of fresh toupees

526
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,920
He kept his mini nostrils closed

527
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,060
He would not smell the mayonnaise

528
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,120
He would not eat a single piece of cheese

529
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,700
Though he was hunted by his foes

530
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,320
He ordered pizza every day

531
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,580
His magic unicycle helped recombine his DNA

532
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,820
But Coldwood gave him chicken skin

533
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,580
So he would rarely bite that way

534
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:29,940
Rufus was a good boy, he was a good boy

535
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:29,940


536
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,580
He was a good boy, he was a good boy

537
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,620
And when he woke up in the morning

538
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,520
He was usually still high

539
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,160
He was usually still high

540
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
He was usually still high

541
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,440
And with his pumpkin brained and polished

542
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,840
Kissed the chicken's lips goodbye

543
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,560
Kissed the chicken's lips goodbye

544
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,880
Kissed the chicken's lips goodbye

545
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,180
Kissed the chicken's lips goodbye

546
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,200
To pay an AIDS

547
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,680
And artificial covering disgusting glaze

548
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,420
That's hiding us and smothering all the ways

549
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,260
That we could be discovering a way out of the maze

550
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,580
And end to all the buggery

551
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,800
The con's driving its pink caddy up your dirt road

552
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,380
You'll just watch TV and do what you're told

553
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,120
You don't even care that your soul's been sold

554
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,700
You're just not aware of the blue space mold

555
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,480
Or the powers that it has on the rulers of your land

556
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,200
And how they have both your balls in the palm of their hand

557
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,700
And how they have both your balls in the palm of their hand

558
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,280
And how they have both your balls in the palm of their hand

559
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,340
Way too...

560
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,200
Too to pay an AIDS

561
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,060
The whole damn world was too to pay an AIDS

562
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,760
So Rufus spent his idle days concocting all the many ways

563
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,500
That he would make the pink boys pay out

564
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,120
Come the day he got his way out

565
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,460
Of the senseless mental trap

566
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,660
That feeds its mindless zombies

567
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,840
And someday Rufus will come back

568
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,860
And give to pay an AIDS

569
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,480
A slap

570
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,680
And a kiss

571
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,100
And a bust

572
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,540
In the face

573
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,840
With a bridge

574
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:05,820
Ooh...

575
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,820
Way too...

576
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,820
To pay an AIDS

577
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,180
With a...

578
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,180
Too to pay an AIDS

579
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,400
Too to pay an AIDS

580
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,280
Way too to pay an AIDS

581
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,920
Wow!

582
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,720
Too to pay an AIDS

583
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,260
Ooh...

584
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,900
Too to pay an AIDS

585
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:44,980
Too to pay an AIDS

586
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,980
Ruff

587
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:53,840
Ooh

588
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,360
Ruff

589
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,720
Ruff

590
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,320
Ruff

591
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,340
Ruff

592
00:29:59,520 --> 00:29:59,860
to Chris

593
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,060
I love you so much.

594
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,580
I love you so much.

595
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,920
The El Queso All-Stars,

596
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,060
dear friends of preview of Rufus the Yeti.

597
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,760
And you can learn more about the El Queso All-Stars

598
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,120
and download material from this website.

599
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,780
You lie with the Yeti, don't you?

600
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,940
Okay, here it is.

crotchlessleatherwheelchair.htm

607
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,320
crotchlessleatherwheelchair is the name that El Queso All-Stars also goes by.

608
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,680
So you can go to soundclick.com

609
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,120
and look for crotchlessleatherwheelchair.

610
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,080
I love you so much.

611
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,400
There must be something we can do about those monsters.

612
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,520
You know, I'm for going on a Yeti hunt.

613
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,600
No, it would only further arouse the Yeti.

614
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,660
Every.

615
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,140
Human.

616
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,520
Culture.

617
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,940
Has its creation myth,

618
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,060
its Garden of Eden,

619
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,020
Fall from Grace,

620
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,500
and Great Deluge.

621
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,360
All are tissues of lies,

622
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,200
but all are based on real events,

623
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,920
of which only Dob's revealed word

624
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,680
and scrupulous research in the forbidden sciences

625
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,200
can give an accurate picture.

626
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,680
Around 65 million years ago,

627
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,100
near the close of the Cretaceous era,

628
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,420
the Exist came from space

629
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,680
and planted on Earth

630
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,900
those mighty men of the Biotic,

631
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,020
the true covenant men of antiquity

632
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,920
who lived 999 years,

633
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,840
the Yeti.

634
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,600
Yeti, of course, is only a convenient term.

635
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,960
The proper scientific nomenclature

636
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,620
is Gigantopithecus correctus.

637
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,560
Yeti is what the Nepalese of the Himalayas call them,

638
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,080
and we find it more dignified

639
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,760
than the epithet Abominable Snowman

640
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,960
or the Native American Sasquatch,

641
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,120
which literally means raping demon.

642
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,740
We especially resent

643
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,860
the popular racist term Bigfoot,

644
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,300
which is not even particularly accurate

645
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
if a minority must be characterized

646
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,980
by the size of a physical feature.

647
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,920
Most people who have actually seen a Yeti

648
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,800
probably remember it less for its feet

649
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,780
than for other organs.

650
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,220
The scientific community,

651
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,300
in its infinite wisdom,

652
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,860
upon encountering ancient Yeti bone fragments,

653
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,640
announced the discovery,

654
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,880
quote-unquote,

655
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,960
of a giant prehistoric ape

656
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,900
called...

657
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,720
Gigantopithecus.

658
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,980
My friends, the Yeti,

659
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,320
were the Nephilim of the Old Testament,

660
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,980
the patriarchs and matriarchs of yore,

661
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,500
the giants of great stature

662
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,280
encountered by Cain east of Eden.

663
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,580
Those who came from on high,

664
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,460
who found the daughters of men

665
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,000
to be comely and mated with them,

666
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,820
bringing forth the Sarim,

667
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
the hairy ones,

668
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,240
or...

669
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,900
early...

670
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,620
the sons of Esau.

671
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,480
The biblical Nimrod and Goliath

672
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,520
were among these.

673
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,140
Giborim, the half-breed,

674
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,380
divine people.

675
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,360
But long before they invented man,

676
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,100
the Yeti were breeding dinosaurs

677
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,060
the way we breed dogs and turkeys.

678
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,880
Oh, our public schools still teach

679
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,040
evolution or creationism.

680
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,420
What we aren't told in conspiracy school

681
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:54,980
is that...

682
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,180
some of those so-called

683
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,760
Neanderthal skeletons are recent.

684
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,580
They date from last year,

685
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,680
and that Piltdown Man was no hoax,

686
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,280
but a recent genetic failure

687
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,060
that had to be hidden from the press

688
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,680
and mainstream scientists.

689
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,600
These facts, were the truth known,

690
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,100
would be sure proof

691
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,200
not only of ongoing interbreeding

692
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,720
between humans and Yeti,

693
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,880
but also of the existence

694
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,800
of an entire race

695
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,940
of Yeti.

696
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,480
Yetinsin half-breeds.

697
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,540
Us!

698
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,780
The subgenius race!

699
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,740
As well as the institutionalized genocide

700
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,060
of our kind

701
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,420
by the conspiracy.

702
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,140
Friends, the Yeti are all around you.

703
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,160
If you know what to look for,

704
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,740
you should be able to spot your fellow Yetinsini

705
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,640
among the purebred pink humans.

706
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,100
Whereas the pinks display bland,

707
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,220
barely mobile, smooth-veneered,

708
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,780
difficult-to-read features,

709
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,920
our mugs are overstatements,

710
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,160
with every emotion vividly portrayed as we talk.

711
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,260
We're self-parodies, granted,

712
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,140
but at least there's a self there to parody.

713
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,740
Compared to pinks,

714
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,300
who are all average,

715
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:15,060
many subgeniuses are brutish Neanderthals,

716
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,380
geeky goons, etc.

717
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,480
But better that than these emotionless,

718
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,780
contented, pampered, bovine, zombie,

719
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,500
pod people.

720
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,400
Yet they think we're funny.

721
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,960
Oh, they humor us.

722
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,480
Their smugness denies us

723
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,100
even the pleasure of seeing them jealous.

724
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,060
Only subconsciously do the pinks

725
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,280
bitterly envy our vitality.

726
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,520
Some of us buckle under from this iniquity

727
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,880
and turn hate-negative.

728
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,620
The heartier of us tend to be more magnanimous.

729
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,420
We can afford to be patient,

730
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,160
charitable, and generous

731
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,180
in our bestowals of condescension.

732
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,920
Why try to insult them?

733
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,240
They wouldn't get it anyway.

734
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,880
It is in the very bowels of the brain,

735
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,040
where an altogether different alchemical mix occurs,

736
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,020
that the yeti's descendant,

737
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,700
the subgenius,

738
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,440
still differs most from the human.

739
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,140
The humans would begrudge us this,

740
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,800
were they capable of knowing it.

741
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,640
But since most of us grow adept at mimicking them,

742
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,620
we have thus far been able to slip between the cracks of their knowledge.

743
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:37,600
Those humans who happen to stumble upon subgenius materials like this show

744
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,140
think it's all a joke.

745
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,980
Were they aware of us,

746
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,100
truly aware of what we represent,

747
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,600
they would hunt us down one and all and slay us,

748
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,460
and bury us in pits of quicklime.

749
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,420
That future generations might never again be tainted

750
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,320
by the subgenius gene.

751
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,740
The music in the background was by

752
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,940
Reverend Angry Larry,

753
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,080
automatic robot fish.

754
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,580
Praise Bob.

755
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,960
The readings from Revelation X,

756
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,120
the Bobapakraphon.

757
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,340
Thank you.

758
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,220
There are enough yeti outfits and supplies here to equip a small army.

759
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,180
We're all monkeys.

760
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,600
We're all monkeys.

761
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,940
Think of us as brains with massive brains.

762
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,500
You're talking about unscanning subgenius.

763
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,160
Astronauts say it was,

764
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,420
the first unbaked unoctured гigos

765
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:41,860
created a cy chama

766
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,820
called the

767
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,600
Spencer Gary.

768
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:49,560
Hey look, Merry.

769
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,180
Oh, we'll never get a better deal, Harry.

770
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:07,180
He says, all we have to do is smoke this thing called prop, and Bob will justify our sins.

771
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,980
But what about forgiveness, Harry? Aren't we supposed to be forgiven for our sins?

772
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,660
I cannot do that. This island is not for me anymore.

773
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:23,100
Mary, he says, probably not. Where we'll be going? What do you think he means?

774
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,560
Probably to do the groceries, Harry. That's what they all mean.

775
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:39,380
Mary, he says we need to take action before the pleasure vessels come with the sex goddesses and destroy the universe.

776
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,760
Action? What action, Harry?

777
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,780
Oh, I can't talk anymore. I can't speak. I don't know.

778
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,400
Mary, got your pencil ready? We just have to write to...

779
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,820
Bob.

780
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,080
Bob?

781
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:12,220
Yeah, yeah, I know. P.O. Box 204206, Austin, Texas 78720.

782
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:12,980
Oh.

783
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,140
Mary, you speak Yeti, too?

784
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:23,100
Well, ha ha ha ha! But of course, dear. I've been sleeping with them.

785
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,040
Bob, my hero.

786
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,300
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space. Space monkey.

787
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,120
Oh, yes, friends. Mary the Hairy Yeti.

788
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,740
An edit by Self-Subs.

789
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,320
Players.

790
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,600
Get on it. What?

791
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,900
Oh, look, Maggie. What is that?

792
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,640
Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron.

793
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,460
Jesus. I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father's trying to worry.

794
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,080
The terrible snow creatures have come out of the high snows.

795
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,740
It's like, look, a picture of, um, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

796
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,000
He's like one of those weird Hindu saints.

797
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,600
It's live.

798
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,720
And he's got Monopoly money coming out of his nose. Just like we do.

799
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,320
I'm a general. You have to come back today.

800
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,520
Ay, campesinos, no puede ni español.

801
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,940
Um, um, um, um, um, um.

802
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,240
Que suele ser un bien.

803
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,480
Why is that vibrate? Are they ready to take everybody back now or just refund them or what?

804
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,660
I wish they would. That's what we've been waiting for, for them to take us back.

805
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:38,300
Sour sweat. You know what I mean? The sour smell of sweat. The urgent smell of too much to go. And, uh, being left behind.

806
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,660
Well, the smell of humans in general, I understand.

807
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,960
It's unpleasant to most non-human animals and creatures.

808
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,180
Well, I heard that Julia Robertson taught a orangutan how to wash her clothes or something.

809
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,340
I don't know if I got the right thing.

810
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,300
That's how it started in the Planet of the Apes series.

811
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,800
That was, that was how we got started.

812
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,580
They taught us how to wash clothes.

813
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,560
What if Jane Goodall went back in time and had, she would find out how she was taught how to wash clothes.

814
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:11,640
She would find out how she was taught how to wash clothes.

815
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,520
Like an orangutan.

816
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,820
The orangutan would teach her how to have secuval sex, too.

817
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:26,940
Giant, intelligent, super intelligent orangutan taught the early anthropologists and humans how to wash fruit.

818
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:33,400
And when they taught the first one, hundreds of monkeys on the other side of the island instantly learned at the same time.

819
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,100
Yeah, they, you know, any time you imitate washing your fruit, everybody will imitate you washing fruit.

820
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,020
What would you do with a brain if you had one?

821
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,040
That's what the new age is all about.

822
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:51,640
You know, I might have been, if I could conceive myself in time, I might be one of the first people who ever washed a meatball in a river.

823
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,300
And was, you know, watched and instantly eulogized by thousands of other parasites.

824
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:05,780
Well, thousands of years down the line, you'd be, yeah, the parasites in the publishing and music world, the scientific world, you'd be eulogized.

825
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,540
But at the time, you'd be just another monkey.

826
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:32,580
But like with most people, they way out of a book-

827
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,660
Fisherman, yeah.

828
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:33,660


829
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,420
There was no shitin'.

830
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:37,580
Trying to get out of this world.

831
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:37,640
Yeah.

832
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,740
Think about time…

833
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,140
For a while, I thought.

834
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,080
I have confidence.

835
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,320
I have confidence.

836
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,580
Confidence by Norrell Preff.

837
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:24,140
Friends, and you can download lots of Norrell Preff from heavyconfetti.com.

838
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,540
Coming up, Dr. Mr. Sister and Le Mer.

839
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,780
Here's Bob One for A1 Slacks.

840
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,580
Double your trousers, double your legs with A1 Racers, tapers, and...

841
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,840
Hi, kids.

842
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,920
And remember, you can take A1 Slacks out of the country, but you can never wear them out.

843
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,660
Thank you, Bob.

844
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,120
What?

845
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,620
And now, back to our movie.

846
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,940
A1 Slacks.

847
00:44:39,940 --> 00:45:09,900
A1 Slacks.

848
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,320
A1 Slacks.

849
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:14,480
A1 Slacks.

850
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,000
A1 Slacks.

851
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:15,620
A1 Slacks.

852
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,220
A1 Slacks.

853
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


854
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


855
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


856
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


857
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


858
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


859
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


860
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


861
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


862
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


863
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


864
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


865
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,280
A1 Slacks.

866
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,780
I had to admit it.

867
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,400
Uh-huh.

868
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,220
And I live near San Francisco.

869
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,720
That's not true.

870
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,620
Well, I guess that about does it.

871
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,500
Goodbye.

872
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,260
Good evening.

873
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,220
I'm Adele Arakawa.

874
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,180
I'm Jim bitumen.

875
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,600
Nine News reporter Ginger Delgado has meth labs like that fellow.

876
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,340
Yes, Jim.

877
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:41,800
It's a job that is so dangerous, it could eventually explode, cause fires, or worse, cause life.

878
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,260
And because of that, he has decided to share his cancer.

879
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,400
He will not reveal Bob since he was 12, since 17.

880
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,300
I don't think there's any person who's interested in me.

881
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,860
Not really, but...

882
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,760
Why?

883
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,320
Because I'm brown no more.

884
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,540
Today, Bob is dying of his teeth.

885
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,600
In short, an explosion has ruined his life.

886
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,600
He now says the quick high he got was worth it.

887
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,260
You know, it's fun for a minute.

888
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,080
No one should see.

889
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,340
He wants to keep making the same fatal mistake.

890
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,160
And his meth lab's growing at an alarming rate.

891
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,980
Authorities in 31 drug labs.

892
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,420
The next year, this year.

893
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,880
Authorities say this year.

894
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,280
Then last year, here in Colorado.

895
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,080
The indiscipline .

896
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,980
All the doctors go the bomb.

897
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,820
Plan as little as possible.

898
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:42,820


899
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:42,820


900
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:52,460
Know youradenamnetie. huhuhuhuh huhuhuh

901
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,960
Finally, radiation percent.

902
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,240
It's gonna Сhsey lan-

903
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:03,040
C-shsey lan-

904
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,580
From the favorite movie Baldi hacer.

905
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:09,000
Slack, and now, a final El Queso All-Stars closer.

906
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,460
I'm gonna do it right.

907
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,600
He's suspended at a birthday party.

908
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,620
He's a flesh piñata.

909
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,380
Give me a mirror and a line of Lucille Ball's ashes.

910
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,280
The fashes have dashed my hopes of necrophilia.

911
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,080
By burning the butt, I've been yearning to fuck.

912
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,260
I've been down on my luck, jerking off to Buck Rogers.

913
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,860
And woman-fearing spandex camel toe.

914
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,400
The dirty hoe on that show turned little Gillard to a homo.

915
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,320
If my mustache could throw a sausage,

916
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,240
I would name it Jim J. Cole.

917
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:04,560
And I would name it Jim J. Cole.

918
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,120
It would be a movie star.

919
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,180
So far beyond the gayest me.

920
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,480
Far, far, and all, but no perversions.

921
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,700
But it takes its acting back to six.

922
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,200
The person you could meet

923
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,100
at a mighty admosy.

924
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,320
If my mustache could throw a mustache,

925
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,180
a kiddie who is watching match.

926
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,220
I'd name it Jim J. Cole at two.

927
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,060
It'd offer you and the stars

928
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,220
and make a god of Jamie Farr.

929
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
Oh my god. I'm gonna die.

930
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,360
Poor damn music.

931
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:33,920
True me.

932
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,480
It's a book.

933
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,420
Blackout, mindshot, looking at your face, pal.

934
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,300
Pass mile, park on, watch without a doubt.

935
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,080
Excess bleed, off course, adapter.

936
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,240
Over chest, roll the lock, bus transfer.

937
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,400
Roll it down the door, cause you can't find the answer.

938
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,380
Vigency beyond the limits of the frequency.

939
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,600
Living for the quest to contribute to delinquency.

940
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,760
Suck grinds, good times.

941
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,160
Dodging middle landmines.

942
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,580
Black eyes, moonshine.

943
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,900
Actresses, nature's lies.

944
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,640
We're to cross the ties of automation.

945
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,420
Lost creation, repressed apathy, total manipulation.

946
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,580
We're to cross the ties of automation.

947
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,800
Tend of forger, disco, discord, poly, yester, clad.

948
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,060
Tend of forger, disco, discord, poly, yester, clad.

949
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,300
Of rising, sat, leap, propaganda, Danny.

950
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,820
Break two into anti-glyphed and shifting into obsolete.

951
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,320
Break two into anti-glyphed and shifting into obsolete.

952
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,160
The sheezy now's their blood and species.

953
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,760
The sheezy's torn and reborn above the scorn of sin.

954
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:21,940
The sheezy's torn and reborn above the scorn of sin.

955
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,240
We're pandimensional, invisible.

956
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,000
We're psychic pimps.

957
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,380
Pushers of buttons that open and shut open.

958
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,580
Slap of a lion, my third, in his crimes of the night.

959
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,560
For solutions polluting the visions of minions of purvey and kings that would nay say the truth.

960
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,680
Blast my Several as you are.

961
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:45,100
The sweetest I will say that a task to this better king can be acquired only by 옮 and Drac4l3rf7n F personality more than his other conta Filter.

00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:55,440

966
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:02,000
What varesexito

968
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:03,580
novel

969
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:03,580


970
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,780
With a drunken husband, she's a flesh piñata.

971
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:15,760
Like Alan Alda, if we ever hurt him, he's a flesh piñata.

972
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,840
Flesh piñata.

973
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,760
Flesh piñata.

974
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,640
Like a cripple at recess, when he eats the meat, he's a flesh piñata.

975
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:39,520
Like a mouthy woman with a drunken husband, she's a flesh piñata.

976
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:47,620
Like Alan Alda, if we ever hurt him, he's a flesh piñata.

977
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,900
Flesh piñata.

978
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:33,500
Like Alan Alda, if we ever hurt him, he's a flesh piñata.

979
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:37,480
You can beat off. You don't need to have another woman.

980
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:41,480
You can beat off. You don't need to have another woman.

981
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,540
I don't want to be vulgar, but...

982
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,580
I don't want to be vulgar, but...

983
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,160
I don't want to be vulgar.

984
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,720
Take it easy, sister. One peep out of you and I'll drill you.

985
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,320
Please.

986
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,920
Get down on the floor behind that counter.

987
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,120
And don't move if you want to live.

988
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:57,820
Yes, sir.

989
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:20,920
I don't want to be vulgar.

990
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,200
The hairless monkey thing?

991
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,620
The hairless monkey?

992
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:23,800
Yes.

993
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,280
Hairless monkeys who came here from a distant land,

994
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,260
a distant world far beyond the fringes of the cosmos.

995
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,380
To an alien from outer space.

996
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,120
Looking for sharp items with long-sleeved logos.

997
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,440
Which titty ain't no different from anybody else's.

998
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,360
And big hooded sweaters.

999
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,220
No, no, no.

1000
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,160
They're not looking for that.

1001
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,380
They're looking for the gold of the alchemists.

1002
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,800
What's the name of that thing again?

1003
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,020
Gold? What do you say?

1004
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,680
The alchemy.

1005
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,000
The stone?

1006
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,520
The stone?

1007
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:50,900
The stone?

1008
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:50,900


1009
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:50,900


1010
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:50,900


1011
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:50,900


1012
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:50,900


1013
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:50,900


1014
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:50,900


1015
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,140
The stone?

1016
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,360
The philosopher.

1017
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,720
They're looking for the philosopher's stone.

1018
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:59,220
I want the gold, Ben, and the diamonds, and the map, and the girl.

1019
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,580
The philosopher's stone.

1020
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,000
And the treasure.

1021
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,300
The holy grail, along with the blood of Christ.

1022
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,820
Would you like to take a look?

1023
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,060
Verified by the Institute of Irrational Science.

1024
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,420
Oh, it's the creed.

1025
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,320
I want the creed.

1026
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,940
I want all of the creed.

1027
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,680
Every bit of it.

1028
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,480
No, it's all yours, my son.

1029
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,700
Sit at my feet.

1030
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,020
Ten minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

1031
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,220
Kiss my goatee foot.

1032
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,040
Yes, boy.

1033
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:21,620
Yes.

1034
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,520
Kiss it.

1035
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,780
Now raise your head up.

1036
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,040
In ten minutes, you'll be fropping in hell.

1037
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,560
We'll all be fropping in hell in ten minutes.

1038
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,280
In Cleveland, Ohio, DNA level C.

1039
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,100
I have pretty good fropping hell, Bob.

1040
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,420
Hell, yeah.

1041
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,420
Lower levels.

1042
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,920
Hey, look, there's Bob Dylan.

1043
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,120
He's not even dead yet.

1044
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:40,380
Bye, Bob.

1045
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,280
Nope.

1046
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,520
But he's still walking around Cleveland begging for spare changes.

1047
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,000
Spare, like, werewolf changes or blank-eyed stare changes.

1048
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,200
All those philosophical insights.

1049
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:56,720
Psychological changes you can go through when you've fallen to Earth from such a lofty place.

1050
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,240
Get real, man.

1051
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah.

1052
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,960
Come on.

1053
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,320
Listen to the music, man.

1054
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,480
Get grounded, dude.

1055
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,260
Let flow down the river, man.

1056
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,040
Get on the stream, baby.

1057
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,360
Get your head in the clouds and your feet on the pavement.

1058
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,960
Flow down the stream.

1059
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,260
Turn off your mind.

1060
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:15,720
Relax.

1061
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,120
None is the color and none is the number, dude.

1062
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,620
Flow downstream.

1063
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,760
The light builds on within you and, like, without you.

1064
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,120
It is not dying.

1065
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,880
Place the bowling ball on your lap.

1066
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,220
Who are the brain police?

1067
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,400
Cross it gently.

1068
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:38,040
Yes, you shall make some yamma on this bowling game with you.

1069
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,400
Some yamma?

1070
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,000
Yes.

1071
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,680
What will you do if the people you know...

1072
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,320
A sacred and holy meditation on this bowling ball.

1073
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,960
Inscribe with the words Brunswick and Cleveland's.

1074
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,860
And the plastic that melted and the chromium, too.

1075
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,020
Your tiny little finger shall fit in this bowling ball.

1076
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:05,740
And you shall run down criminals, evildoers, falsifiers, and all of those.

1077
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,260
Blasphemous!

1078
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,520
With this bowling ball, you shall become a superhero.

1079
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,960
The pins are your mind.

1080
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,600
The bowling ball is Bob.

1081
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,460
You are the pin, man.

1082
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,020
Become one with the pins.

1083
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,860
Now, roll.

1084
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,440
Bob into your mind.

1085
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,800
And knock down all the pins.

1086
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,520
Strike!

1087
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,380
Praise Bob.

1088
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,380

00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,980
See the website.

1095
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:53,580
Praise Bob.

1096
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,020
Hail Connie.

1097
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,620
This background music is automatic robot fish.

1098
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,100
Reverend Angry Larry.

1099
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,720
Worried about covering the lower half of your body?

1100
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,180
Here's Bob One for A1 Slack.

1101
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,880
Things go better with slacks and trousers.

1102
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,500
Things go better with slacks.

1103
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:19,640
Hi!

1104
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,200
This is Bob One for A1 Slack.

1105
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,740
This is Bob One.

1106
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,780
And I wonder how many of our go-go-now-generation-action-man-on-compass realizes

1107
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,140
how important it is to keep the lower half of your body covered

1108
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,940
without disguising the fact that it is indeed the lower half of your body.

1109
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,580
Well, there's nothing like a pair of trim-fitting A1 slacks.

1110
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,460
They're better than skirts and a lot warmer, too.

1111
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,860
Thank you, Bob.

1112
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,300
You're welcome.

1113
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,420
And now, back to our movie.

1114
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,720
Looks like we're going to find more than we expected.

1115
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,000
And, friends, yes.

1116
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,840
That was the fire.

1117
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,340
Fire sign theater.

1118
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:55,600
Ancient fire sign theater recordings.

1119
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:04,240
Some of you may be too young and little to know of the fire sign theater.

1120
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:11,820
But it is they to whom we owe so very much in our blabbermouthitude.

1121
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,440
And, in fact, when I say,

1122
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,740
dear,

1123
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,620
dear friends,

1124
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,820
that's a little tip of the hat to our dear,

1125
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,640
dear friends at the fire sign theater.

1126
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,660
And I think I disagree with Chairman Bob.

1127
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,040
I do agree with Chairman Bob.

1128
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,480
That Chairman Bob can't be working.

1129
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,820
I don't know.

1130
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:49,820


1131
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:49,820


1132
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:49,820


1133
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:49,820


1134
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,620
I recall that Chairman Bob went that route.

1135
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:55,620
Right?

1136
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:56,720
Right.

1137
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,520
I think the thing,

1138
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:57,960
things,

1139
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,600
the thing,

1140
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,500
and I think some,

1141
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,380
and I think, in essence,

1142
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,820
that Chairman Bob can't be working while they're type alive to investors.

1143
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,660
We've viewed and so forth.

1144
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:18,360
But how to,

1145
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,060
uh,

1146
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:20,580
close,

1147
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,080
uh,

1148
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,660
down the law.

1149
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,440
But now,

1150
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,240
uh,

1151
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,180
uh,

1152
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:25,780
uh,

1153
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,040
uh,

1154
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,520
one final question,

1155
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,100
if I could.

1156
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:29,560
Uh,

1157
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,560
anybody on the panel who'd want to address Chairman Bob?

1158
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,340
Uh,

1159
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:33,880
no,

1160
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:34,980
no.

1161
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,300
Okay.

1162
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:38,980
Attention.

1163
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,980
All biotech personnel.

1164
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,460
This is a biohazard alert.

1165
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,140
Until further notice,

1166
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,720
containment protocols are in effect.

1167
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:48,980
Bob!

1168
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:50,680
Bob!

1169
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:52,800
Bobby!

1170
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,720
Dana, what's going on?

1171
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,160
Sheriff Morse, they locked the doors.

1172
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:58,920
Bob's inside.

1173
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,900
Why lock the doors?

1174
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,160
I don't know.

1175
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,760
Who else is in there?

1176
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,860
Just about everybody, I guess.

1177
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,500
I'm sorry.

1178
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,380
Bob! Bob!

1179
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,480
I found the problem and there is no biohazard.

1180
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,520
It was a false alarm.

1181
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,020
You can unlock the doors and let everyone go home.

1182
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,700
This is a non-event event.

1183
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,600
The moron.

1184
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,400
Back to the end.

1185
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,520
Motherfuck you, Big and Flynn.

1186
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,160
We are the university majors in Los Angeles, California,

1187
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,420
who had our Harvard University deans come to teach us.

1188
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,820
We'll not have you goddamn bitch kidnapping us, sticking us with needles.

1189
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,180
The reason I did not, none of your goddamn business.

1190
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,440
None of your goddamn business.

1191
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,720
You didn't even hear a thing.

1192
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,740
You have no sense using your goddamn needles.

1193
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,800
And those goddamn old men who used to suck.

1194
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,120
You baboon ass pussy motherfucker.

1195
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,300
Had no business giving you nothing.

1196
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,660
There's been no people or no buzz knowing that you are an animal.

1197
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,220
None of your goddamn business.

1198
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,660
And they've been listening for a long time.

1199
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,580
You motherfucking baboon.

1200
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,920
And here's the line, goddammit.

1201
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:14,060
Licking on Doc's wick and we know he is a baboon.

1202
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,620
We have studied him for years.

1203
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,080
But listen bitch.

1204
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,660
Stand your goddamn face.

1205
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,600
The deal is hard goddamn.

1206
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,380
Have me higher over you motherfucker.

1207
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,140
Shut up.

1208
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,900
I don't want you goddamn bastards to get rid of this whore.

1209
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,400
She licked me between my sacred legs and I am Mrs.

1210
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,420
The only reason I demand her death.

1211
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,020
I need her death goddamn.

1212
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,260
And they have her here at the crazy house.

1213
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,860
Now you goddamn bitch.

1214
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,480
I don't care who you think you know.

1215
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,800
Just go along.

1216
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,620
Just go along bitch.

1217
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,400
Sit your ass down bitch.

1218
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,380
Sit your ass down.

1219
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,900
And you do not call people.

1220
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,740
You said people.

1221
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,720
You are an animal.

1222
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:05,380
It is wrong for you goddamn bastards to have missed a goddamn bullet when you cut their tails off.

1223
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,360
Because you and me.

1224
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,840
And because you and me.

1225
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,500
And left on these goddamn bastards of asses like you and me.

1226
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,400
When they were born with monkey asses.

1227
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,180
And when they take an x-ray of this bitch ass they'll know that it's a animal.

1228
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,960
Now that's nothing to tell you bitch.

1229
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,040
You didn't even understand.

1230
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,120
You did not represent yourself with names.

1231
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,540
That is how ignorant you are.

1232
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,500
If you don't.

1233
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,620
I am not a spy.

1234
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,520
I have nothing to tell you bitch.

1235
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,220
You went to the crazy house.

1236
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,480
Said you were going as a student to the crazy house.

1237
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:45,600
You went to the school.

1238
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,980
You are abnormal because we have schools here.

1239
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,840
In all the cities.

1240
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,220
In all the suburban areas.

1241
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,760
And other suburban areas.

1242
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,500
But usually the same children are sent.

1243
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,180
To a boarding care home.

1244
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,880
To get away from you abnormal motherfuckers.

1245
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,460
And you shouldn't have been in these suburban places.

1246
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,220
Can you start talking about going to Harvard.

1247
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,500
No I'm telling you.

1248
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,700
No it's nothing.

1249
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,660
We are graduates.

1250
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:14,800
We have our choice.

1251
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:20,900
And you should have had some goddamn Salvation Army things on.

1252
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,480
You know your goddamn doctors.

1253
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,260
Who are supposed to buy you motherfuckers things.

1254
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,500
And send your goddamn life's ass clothes to the laundry.

1255
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,660
You are not good on stable people who live at home.

1256
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,760
Grabbing the clothes.

1257
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,020
With a small ball of fluid and everything.

1258
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,220
Did you hear what I said?

1259
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,680
And this stands for all of these black people.

1260
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,640
My name is on the social media.

1261
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,000
I'm a social medicine.

1262
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,580
I said our name.

1263
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,220
You.

1264
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:48,340
You slut.

1265
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,480
You slut.

1266
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,820
What's up.

1267
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,800
You haven't even been back yet.

1268
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:55,940
You went to the crazy hospital.

1269
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:56,880
Plunged there.

1270
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,940
They sent you to the administration building.

1271
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,000
With your baby animals.

1272
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,040
To take a test.

1273
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,400
You were plunged there.

1274
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,220
No I'm talking about you.

1275
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,820
You're not psychoanalyzed.

1276
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,460
And nobody ever baptized you.

1277
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,800
You are a kid younger.

1278
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,860
A child molester.

1279
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,620
You're so young.

1280
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1281
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1282
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1283
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1284
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1285
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1286
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1287
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1288
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1289
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:13,620


1290
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,460
And I saw you on the street.

1291
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,280
I hate the black-headed bastards.

1292
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,440
And to put my name up there.

1293
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,840
You don't gotta look at me like that.

1294
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,120
Cause you bastards are gonna die.

1295
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,980
You motherfuckers are all right.

1296
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,200
But the chin of this man is on the go.

1297
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,260
And for the life of you kids of mine.

1298
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,200
Getting in the poison.

1299
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,560
You gonna do like a bitch.

1300
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,280
And motherfuckers guys.

1301
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,100
Is it here.

1302
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:35,880
It's up back there.

1303
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,540
Did you hear what I said?

1304
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:39,460
You.

1305
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:39,980
You.

1306
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:40,400
You.

1307
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,600
Goddamn false teeth ass motherfucker.

1308
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:43,620
With your real ass.

1309
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1310
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1311
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1312
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1313
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1314
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1315
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1316
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1317
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1318
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:43,620


1319
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,160
You got a wig wearing.

1320
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,600
You got a wig on your goddamn head.

1321
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:52,960
You are a ugly motherfucker without somebody making a wig for your fucking head.

1322
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,700
They calling you beautiful.

1323
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,080
Shit.

1324
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,000
Look at your god damn crooked teeth.

1325
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,860
Tell me about something that you.

1326
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,840
It's nothing to tell.

1327
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,880
You mother fucker.

1328
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:04,920
If you could.

1329
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:10,360
If you think sucking dick and being fucked in your baboon pussy ass was making you graduate.

1330
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,620
You are goddamn lying.

1331
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,280
You are goddamn lying.

1332
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:13,600
You are goddamn lying.

1333
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:18,020
No, motherfucker, that's how I'm expected, you goddamn cocksucker.

1334
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,080
And I'm asking God to damn you and any motherfucker like you

1335
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,820
licking between women's legs and their blessed wounds, motherfucker.

1336
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,680
Not an animal's cock.

1337
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,780
Well, the goddamn doctors made an oath

1338
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,580
not to take no motherfuckers in those hospitals

1339
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,240
and fuck no goddamn baboons and things

1340
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,240
and sit around in no goddamn circle

1341
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,780
like you motherfuckers was in the jungle.

1342
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,300
You weren't to have been brought here to a civilized nation.

1343
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,340
And them motherfuckers who fucked your ass

1344
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,220
and them motherfuckers looking like them were cursed.

1345
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,600
That's why God let them look like them

1346
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,140
when they come out of the goddamn fur.

1347
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,840
Because baboons have their own female species.

1348
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,340
By MC 900-foot Jesus.

1349
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,620
Praise Bob.
