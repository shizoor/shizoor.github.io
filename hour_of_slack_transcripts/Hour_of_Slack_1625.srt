1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
I see no reason for violence.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,220
Sex.

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,820
If however you are confronted you may result in

4
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,160
SELF-GENIUS!

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,320
Bugs.

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,220
Bug sex.

7
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,060
So now we can hug our fleas and ticks too.

8
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,740
WEDD.

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,560
WEDD.

10
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,100
WEDD.

11
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,480
WEDD.

12
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,180
American Ticks.

13
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,460
Sex.

14
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,760
Don't kill flies with our nostrils.

15
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,080
Sex.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,700
Eeeeeeeeeee...

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,200
What will you do if we let you go?

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,860
And the plastic's all melted and so is the comb.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,060
Who are the brain police?

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,440
What will you do when the label comes off?

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,400
And the plastic's all melted and the chrome is too soft

22
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,380
You feel like you're done You feel like you're done

23
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,180
You feel like you're done I feel like i'm done

24
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,780
I feel like I'm done I feel like i'm done

25
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,700
I feel like i'm done

26
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,920
I feel like i'm done

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,480
Who are the brain police?

28
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:49,100
What will you do with the people you knew?

29
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:57,820
Who were the plastic that melted at the chromium tube?

30
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,860
Who are the brain police?

31
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,080
Who were the real prisoners?

32
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,080


33
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,080


34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,160
When they stick it to you

35
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,500
There's something you can do

36
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,420
They're at your back door

37
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,420
Don't take it anymore

38
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,300
When there's an attack

39
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,540
We got your back

40
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,400
When things get odd

41
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,540
We're the urgency squad

42
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,000
There's an attack

43
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,560
Urgency squad

44
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,100
Got your back

45
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,560
Urgency squad

46
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,560
Urgency squad

47
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:49,560


48
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,640
We are the urgency squad

49
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,920
We know there's no free lunch

50
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,540
Gonna get a knockout punch

51
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,800
Thought you're better off dead

52
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,620
You get a boot to the head

53
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,660
When there's an attack

54
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,880
We got your back

55
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,540
When things get odd

56
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,960
We're the urgency squad

57
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,360
There's an attack

58
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,920
Urgency squad

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,480
Got your back

60
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,040
Urgency squad

61
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,620
When things get odd

62
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,920
Urgency squad

63
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,040
We are the urgency squad

64
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,780
They're always looking out

65
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:52,780


66
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,100
We only run what we seek

67
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,900
We'll grow the strength

68
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,320
We'll grow our strength

69
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,200
They will see that we can

70
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,520
We're nowhere near

71
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:00,920
You'll be mamofist

72
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,100
We'll blow you down

73
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,740
It's too early

74
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,700
How are you gonna live

75
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,780
in a world of hate?

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,980
Let your pegs green

77
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:05,980


78
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:05,980


79
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,080
Come up and up

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,080


81
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,100
Let your pegs loose

82
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,920
Let your pegs out

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,040
Gasping

84
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,020
Let your pegs loose

85
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,420
Let your pegs open

86
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,540
Say I can make him

87
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:15,540


88
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:15,540


89
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,540
When there's an attack, we got your back

90
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,620
When things get odd, we're the urgency squad

91
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,020
There's an attack!

92
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,560
Urgency squad

93
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,040
Got your back!

94
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,640
Urgency squad

95
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,280
Things get odd

96
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,560
Urgency squad

97
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,620
We are the urgency squad

98
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
Urgency squad

99
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,100
Urgency squad

100
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,000
Urgency squad

101
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,960
Urgency squad

102
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,080
We are the urgency squad

103
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:56,080
We are the urgency squad

104
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,140
We are the urgency squad

105
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,760
We are the urgency squad

106
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:38,500
The Vespa gives you confidence because it was born from the most modern design, from the most advanced technology.

107
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,980
And then, go with me.

108
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,200
Thank you.

109
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,420
Thank you.

110
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:08,740
Thank you.

111
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,440
Thank you.

112
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,580
Thank you.

113
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,580
Thank you.

114
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,460
Thank you.

115
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,140
Thank you.

116
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:08,580
Ooh.

117
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,640
Ah.

118
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,980
Ah.

119
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,580
Ah.

120
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,040
Ah.

121
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:18,620
Ah.

122
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:18,900


123
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,080
Oh.

124
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,320
Oh.

125
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,640
Ah.

126
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,700
Ah.

127
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,900
Ah.

128
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,760
I always wondered why it was just me when I grew up.

129
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,140
I always wondered whether or not I could make it.

130
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,380
I was excited because it was such a drag to reject it.

131
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,280
So I tore the cover off a bunch of matches.

132
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,300
And I got this letter back that said,

133
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,740
I'm not going to be a fan of the band.

134
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:03,740


135
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:18,600
I than knew the band had results like that.

136
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,000
I lined up with this guy on my Facebook account.

137
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,000


138
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,100


139
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,100


140
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,160
I called him.

141
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,740
My father at that time called me fishy or something.

142
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,080


143
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,080


144
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,320
I said,◝

145
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,020
Uh oh,ando.

146
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,860
◝

147
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,600
Oh, souvent mis труба я вижу.

148
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:32,680
Yeah, и прarded.

149
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,740
You will, probably.

150
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:33,740


151
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,760
Sis.

152
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm a little dumb

153
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,240
Yeah, I'm a little paranoid

154
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,260
But to me, it's what I tell you

155
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,860
Yeah, we're just a bit of a squirmer

156
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,860
Yeah, we're just a bit of a squirmer

157
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,560
Yeah, we're just a bit of a squirmer

158
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,160
You wanna fight?

159
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,320
Then you're full of yourself

160
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,380
You wanna fight?

161
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,460
Then you're full of yourself

162
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,700
You wanna fight?

163
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,140
Then you're full of yourself

164
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:50,340
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man

165
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:29,740
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man

166
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:59,840
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man

167
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,900
An unusual piece by the Psychoskeletons, a piece called Shower Scene.

168
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:25,360
Before that, we heard a little, well, second part of the classic tune, Help, I'm a Rock, from the Mothers of Invention ancient album from the late 1960s.

169
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:45,200
The all guitar, all big guitar, religious sounding, graceful thing was called Grace by our brother, Reverend Jimmy Ryan, who just does that kind of big guitar greatness.

170
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:55,340
Before that, the almost four minute long participation in the Bunga Bunga was by the Rudy Show.

171
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:03,960
The Shorts Project, it would be hard for our Slack listeners to mistake Rudy Shorts Project for anything else.

172
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:25,100
The one, what one might call a Devo retro or Devo-esque song, Urgency Squad, was from the album Urgency Squad by the band Exposed Forehead.

173
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:34,200
The song was spelled with a giant X and a giant four and a huge posed and a huge forehead.

174
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:47,080
Exposed foreheads, and you'll be seeing them at the Beachland Ballroom, the devotional, the last weekend in July, I believe, this time.

175
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,360
Amazing.

176
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,520
I sure will be.

177
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,340
Before that, who are the Bridesmaids?

178
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:05,600
The Bride Police, another real classic from Frank Zappa's first album, maybe, or second album, Freak Out.

179
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:25,260
It was the third LP record I ever bought, honestly, after, I think the first LP record I ever bought, besides movie soundtracks, first rock and roll album, was The Monkees, Last Train to Clarksville.

180
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:34,680
great album. Then the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour, then Frank Zappa's Freak Out, and then

181
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:44,400
Jimi Hendrix' Are You Experienced? So that's my rock and roll history of album buying in the

182
00:20:44,400 --> 00:21:00,500
very late 1960s. Oh man, that got me. So yeah, yeah, yeah. The background music is Cyber Chump,

183
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:08,480
which is related to Exposed Foreheads. Cyber Chump goes just instrumental music.

184
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,580
It's a great, great rug for the hour of slack.

185
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:25,860
The best rug on the planet. Princess Wee is here, and I am here. Although, you know,

186
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:35,240
we went to a memorial for a beloved family member, not part of my family, actually not even somebody

187
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:44,120
I even knew, but a big part of Princess Wee's family. It was like a memorial service,

188
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:58,680
and it was rather sobering, but there was wine. And we don't usually do shows when we're in a state

189
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:14,180
of emotional uproar or grief, but hey, why not? And guess what? I've got Lonesome Cowboy

190
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:22,120
Dave's book in front of me. It's almost ready to put on sale. In fact, all we really are waiting

191
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:30,040
for is Lonesome Cowboy Dave to finish proofreading. I've proofread the whole thing.

192
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,440
Oh, it's so good. Princess Wee is working on it. I'm not finished proofreading.

193
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:42,980
A Dave's book, Neighbor World, a novel, I guess one could call it a science fiction novel,

194
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,520
but really, if I was a librarian, I'd put it in the literature section because, you know,

195
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,820
sci-fi, that's just pulp. That's just silly kid stuff, you know, crazy stuff, kid stuff,

196
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:07,600
science fiction. On the other hand, Kurt Vonnegut fits into the literature section somehow, right?

197
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,680
Right. And Neal Stephenson fits into that literature

198
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:13,560
section.

199
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,700
although also into the science fiction section.

200
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,100
Terry Pratchett goes in the fantasy section.

201
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,640
I would put him in the uppity literature section

202
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,000
alongside Mark Twain and Jonathan Swift.

203
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,860
But I'm not running the libraries,

204
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,540
and I understand how the publishing business works.

205
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,860
Anyway, we have become publishers.

206
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:49,500
Thanks to the modern technique of Insta-publishing,

207
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,180
print-on-demand,

208
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,340
I don't have to keep a closet full of book of the whatever

209
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,280
in my closet to be a self-publisher.

210
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,320
I can just let them whip one out whenever you order a book.

211
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,460
Not that I'm urging you to do so,

212
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,280
but,

213
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,620
for the first time,

214
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,800
we're in the position of being able to publish books.

215
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,880
And the first thing we started with was not our own, but our friends.

216
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,800
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave's novel Neighbor World is astounding.

217
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,980
I was about to read from it,

218
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,760
except I'm afraid that poor old cowboy just probably just called in.

219
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,320
I just probably called in.

220
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,800
I was afraid of that.

221
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,200
I was trying to read Schopenhauer's Essence and Reason.

222
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,760
I was trying.

223
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,520
I thought it sounded real smart,

224
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,260
but since I had my crotch fumigated and my eyebrows all plucked,

225
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,860
I'm ready to go.

226
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,060
Alright.

227
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,840
Well, all those words you said sounded pretty smart Dave.

228
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,940
Well, I could also quote Emanuel Kent,

229
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,780
I could say,

230
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,960
maybe perhaps he could,

231
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,920
but he didn't want to.

232
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,120
I was about to quote Lonesome Cowboy Dave

233
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,360
from Chapter 6,

234
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,840
point A of Neighbor World,

235
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,260
world but I'm not gonna cuz you called him cuz I could oh I can't I could do

236
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:24,300
that quote in any time but I can't talk to you just any old time this is a

237
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,340
special time yes firstly for the people who out there somewhere in space have

238
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,300
the Humphrey in the route of Vegas and all the different problems you know

239
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:39,380
sociopathic problems that they do that's right they need modern immediate updates

240
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:49,280
modern science they need you Dave no they need you so get on it it's up to

241
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:56,600
you it's all on your shoulders fix them fix them now are you sure it's not you

242
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:05,480
because the articles to be fixed yeah that's what they told me what happened

243
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,200
tell you his voice they were telling me

244
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,360
something is wrong with the computer I don't know what happened I don't know what happened

245
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,260
so I decided to tell you go ahead and fix everybody's problems Dave it's a

246
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,680
religious culture it's famous it's like Church of the subgenius we can do

247
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,740
anything Bob said so so go ahead and fix everybody's problems okay I'll just wait

248
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,040
hmm but I'm not like Bob I'm hardly a shooter foot in his whole steps I can

249
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,840
hardly you know place my articles of deception well me a great genius like

250
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:39,140
Bob Dobbs well me neither I but but we thought that you was you were

251
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,160
like a smart guy you had a book a novel that's about to be out if you'll ever

252
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:51,500
finish proofreading that he will I'm pretty close to done from the back you

253
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:59,320
were going from the front right I was done from the front yeah we're probably

254
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,640
we're probably halfway okay well friends I could do I could do

255
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,100
it perhaps you know right away I could have done it tonight if I

256
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,760
I didn't have to be on a real stupid hour of slack radio show.

257
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,340
Oh, no.

258
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,500
God, do I know what you mean.

259
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,720
I could have been doing so many other things tonight.

260
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,180
But, you know, the reason I was able to finish proofreading your novel Neighbor World,

261
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:35,060
coming from Subgenius Press, was I had to sit on a plane for five hours.

262
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,300
Right.

263
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,760
That will do it.

264
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,840
That's like being in a dentist's office.

265
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,240
Where's the reading material?

266
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,200
Where's the reading material?

267
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,860
I can't take it here.

268
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,560
I'm going to go crazy.

269
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,680
I'm going crazy, man.

270
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, God, I jumped out of a window.

271
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
No, I can't jump out of a window.

272
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,660
We're at 1,200 feet in the air.

273
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,160
No.

274
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,360
This show would have been a lot better if you had not called in

275
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,520
and I had just read all of your words from your novel over the air.

276
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,840
No, you just said the opposite.

277
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,740
But you know what?

278
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,420
It's best that you called in because now,

279
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,740
they're just going to...

280
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,380
They're going to have to read your novel

281
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,580
to get those hot, hot words zoomed in their loom.

282
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,120
Well, what was salient about the virtual world of Point A

283
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,640
that you were going to espouse on?

284
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,740
It's back like you see.

285
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,440
You've heard of it.

286
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:21,720
Yeah.

287
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,720
Well, let's see.

288
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:29,160
It was when No-Go and Standard are driving into...

289
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,660
They're driving towards Industria's Tragic Coast near Car Town.

290
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,580
And they're going to...

291
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,480
They're going to meet Bob Sideways.

292
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,800
And El Chimpy, their favorite band, has faded from the radio.

293
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,500
And the mag is silent.

294
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,300
And, uh...

295
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,040
Oh, wait.

296
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,660
There's a...

297
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,520
There's a question here.

298
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
You actually made that sound interesting.

299
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,800
Yeah.

300
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,180
Oh, God.

301
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,400
You know, I can't get the same alacrity out of there.

302
00:28:59,520 --> 00:28:59,960
I can't...

303
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,820
You know, I was like...

304
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,640
Well, Dave, you're too close to it.

305
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,280
You wrote the damn thing.

306
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,020
I know exactly how it is.

307
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,260
Uh, I wrote the most brilliant things in the world,

308
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,760
and I can't get any joy from them.

309
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,320
They just seem stupid to me.

310
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,940
But all these people seem to love it.

311
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,080
And, Dave, I love reading your stuff.

312
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,620
I mean, even though I know you,

313
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,940
even though I know what a complete Dave kind of person,

314
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,300
it's just such a complete cowboy.

315
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,880
What a lonesome, lonesome cowboy you are.

316
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,060
Yet, when I read your writings,

317
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,180
it's like as if I was reading the writings of an elevated genius,

318
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,520
some kind of literary achiever.

319
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,320
Not you.

320
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,900
Or me.

321
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,980
You know, it's like...

322
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,780
It truly transcends our real world.

323
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,780
I understand that in one way.

324
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,560
I read some of your stuff to a person once,

325
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,040
and I very rectally point out...

326
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,900
I know this guy.

327
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,380
Well, it's amazing how...

328
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,620
You know, the unfortunate part of all that was

329
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,700
that some of these people were so demented,

330
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,440
they actually not only found it entertaining,

331
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,440
what you had written,

332
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,920
but they believed it.

333
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,500
They believed X-Day was truly coming,

334
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,760
which it's coming in its pants, perhaps,

335
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,680
but that's the only place we can...

336
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,460
Hey, what else matters?

337
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,080
Who cares about any other place?

338
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,020
But here's the thing.

339
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,220
Uh,

340
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,540
they're right.

341
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,420
It is elevating and inspiring,

342
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,760
and they should pay attention to it.

343
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,460
Uh, the...

344
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,580
Anything published by Subgenius...

345
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,260
Foundation or dot-com or whatever,

346
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,340
I'm not sure...

347
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:54,500
I have noticed that.

348
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,580
I can't remember the company name exactly that I run, but...

349
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,880
I've actually felt jealousy back in the days

350
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,460
when my computer was up and running.

351
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:01,960
I would...

352
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,940
I felt rather jealous many times.

353
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,640
Like, who's this?

354
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,000
That's a pretty cool way of saying that.

355
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,520
Well, yeah, because our computer...

356
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,600
We kept our computers running all the time.

357
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,920
Huh.

358
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,620
Yeah.

359
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,940
Well, we sometimes had to get new computers.

360
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,540
And it's...

361
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,340
What can I say?

362
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
We've been lucky.

363
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,460
We were able to afford new computers

364
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,120
just in the nick of time.

365
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,740
Not everybody can.

366
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,060
I had somebody going,

367
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,000
Hey, Reverend Stang,

368
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,620
it seems like this X-Day...

369
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,580
Festival you hold every July.

370
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,500
It seems like you're always begging for extra help

371
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,180
to pay for a plane ticket or this or that.

372
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,180
But shouldn't you...

373
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,840
Well, this may seem like a dumb question,

374
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,460
but shouldn't you raise the admission price?

375
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,020
I can't give that admission price on community radio,

376
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,880
but it's not very high.

377
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,480
And I had to honestly answer the guy,

378
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,400
Yeah, for half of these people,

379
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,640
that's actually a lot of money.

380
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,260
Yeah.

381
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,660
That's a deal killer.

382
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,920
You know, 40 bucks, 30 bucks,

383
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,920
something like that,

384
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,260
somewhere within that ballpark.

385
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,160
That's a deal...

386
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,800
That's hard.

387
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,300
I haven't gone out to concerts or movies myself

388
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,880
for a long time.

389
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,100
You went into your alter ego, though.

390
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,700
Well, I...

391
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,240
And you didn't bring Leo up with her.

392
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,740
No, no.

393
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,560
He, him...

394
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,280
My alter...

395
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,460
My alter ego learned how...

396
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,460
How to get things from the internet without...

397
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,680
Which is a form of doppelganger.

398
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,780
Not a doppelganger.

399
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,380
It's more like when you have a little...

400
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,260
A little tiny four-inch tall version of yourself,

401
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,340
like a mini-me type of character that...

402
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,980
I know as well as anybody, it's stealing.

403
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,000
Sure, it's stealing from the mom-and-pop

404
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,640
international conglomerate next door.

405
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,620
Sony Pictures or Disney or whatever.

406
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,840
Well, same thing.

407
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,600
But...

408
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,120
Really?

409
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:07,920
You know...

410
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,000
And yet I do it anyway.

411
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,860
It's because I...

412
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,180
What other choice do I have?

413
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,260
My other choice is to...

414
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,320
Because you're an underground fellow

415
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,260
and you fight for the right to be free.

416
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,200
No, that's just stealing.

417
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,160
No, no, no.

418
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,920
That's...

419
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,320
Come on, get real.

420
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:24,980
You have...

421
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,960
You have a license to steal?

422
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm not a rebel.

423
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm just an idiot.

424
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,900
To quote the great Reverend Fox,

425
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,640
Argus Fox,

426
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,300
I'm not a rebel.

427
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,140
I'm just an idiot.

428
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,060
And it's true.

429
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,560
Think about it, Dave.

430
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,280
Isn't that the realest thing you ever heard?

431
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,400
I'm not really a rebel.

432
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,420
I'm just an idiot.

433
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,280
It rings true.

434
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,460
And yet...

435
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:53,740
It's sad.

436
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,440
That doesn't mean we can't still be rebels.

437
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,140
We can still be rebels.

438
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,880
We're idiots.

439
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,500
Just so long as we're not Confederates.

440
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:00,800
Right.

441
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
We will be rebels.

442
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,700
Oh, we're not Confederates for sure.

443
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,960
Well...

444
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:05,780
Not...

445
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,040
No somos Confederatos.

446
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,560
Not us.

447
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,120
Not us.

448
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,040
But by definition...

449
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,600
Especially not I.

450
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,340
Confederates means us.

451
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,200
You know, doesn't it?

452
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,300
In the town where I live,

453
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,280
there are a group of people,

454
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,720
there's two pickup trucks

455
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,100
who put Confederate flags

456
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,960
in their cars and fly them

457
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,020
and drive around like

458
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,480
Confederate flag wavers.

459
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,740
Well...

460
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,080
Boy, and I'm gonna get in trouble

461
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,580
because just the other day,

462
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,440
I got...

463
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,440


464
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,700
I gave one of them the finger

465
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,640
as I drove by.

466
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,140
Now, if that guy would have slammed

467
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,520
on the barracks and chased me,

468
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,560
I probably would have died.

469
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,540
In the old days,

470
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,640
I probably would have grabbed

471
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,380
a heavy object

472
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,960
and tried to fight my way

473
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,860
to the death and lost.

474
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,060
This way, I just will die

475
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,140
because...

476
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,160
Because they're...

477
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,380
They have guns

478
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,100
and they're scary.

479
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,000
And it's your fault, too.

480
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,200
I don't know why, but...

481
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,960
I thought I was.

482
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,120
I know what you're talking about.

483
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,920
I don't know why, but...

484
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,400
I've actually been chased around

485
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,700
by rebels, quote, unquote.

486
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,920
The same kind of people

487
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,200
that would drive around

488
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,280
waving the Confederate flag

489
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,520
to prove to the world

490
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,580
that they're really, really mad.

491
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,640
They're angry at this world

492
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,140
where white people

493
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,940
don't get special consideration.

494
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,240
Right?

495
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,380
They don't get special attention anymore.

496
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,240
Oh, deary me.

497
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,140
We're so picked on,

498
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,900
especially white males.

499
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,160
Oh.

500
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,500
Yeah.

501
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,520
It's like we're not cool anymore.

502
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,220
The transgender people get attention.

503
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,740
Even the women

504
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,240
get to be superheroes now.

505
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,400
Oh, deary me.

506
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,740
We manly white men

507
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,080
are so picked on.

508
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,660
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

509
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,700
I feel so sad.

510
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,400
I'm so...

511
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

512
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,280
Well,

513
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,400
that's the way.

514
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,400
It seems to me

515
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,960
as a southern white man

516
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,600
in America today

517
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,200
who finished his high school education

518
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,300
and got a little tiny bit of college

519
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,740
and continued my education

520
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
vastly far beyond anything

521
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,760
any college could have taught me.

522
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,500
And that's why I know

523
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,080
I am right in all of this.

524
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,600
I agree with you.

525
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,380
The rest of these people

526
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,980
are a bunch of jerks

527
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,420
and they don't know

528
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,000
Jack Hooey.

529
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,880
And if I was them

530
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,260
or were them,

531
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,540
I would read that novel

532
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,020
Neighbor World

533
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,060
by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

534
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,440
And I can say that

535
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,320
because it's not on sale yet.

536
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

537
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,840
it's what you want to do.

538
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,440
You want to straighten out

539
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,540
all your mental equities

540
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,620
and your other cis components

541
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,160
of your existing existence.

542
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,600
The 21st century

543
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,800
just goes straight ahead

544
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,400
and pick up a copy of...

545
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,600
It says right here

546
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,540
on the cover.

547
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,400
And you're going to get

548
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,860
a copy of...

549
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,220
Here's a good little section

550
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,760
that I outlined.

551
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,080
Okay.

552
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,780
Sex.

553
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,520
That's all you think about

554
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:16,920
is sex.

555
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,040
Okay, here it goes.

556
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,760
This is a quote.

557
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,580
No, this is better than sex.

558
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,900
From Neighbor World,

559
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,900
I chanted along,

560
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,320
the bioflux regulators,

561
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,900
the instruments of genocide,

562
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,340
the whispers in the ear

563
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,760
and squares in the skull

564
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,140
were being rejected.

565
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,460
Washed away.

566
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,280
The weirds were reshaping

567
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,900
my brain.

568
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,600
Laia was full of juicy,

569
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,260
eye-peeling eratoslam.

570
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,900
The school uniform

571
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,320
made her look earthy

572
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,240
but spiritual.

573
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,360
Boners and buying

574
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,820
go hand in hand

575
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,080
and I was buying.

576
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,380
Then the whole place

577
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,740
filled with light

578
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,800
as a giant old-era disco ball

579
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,400
lowered from the ceiling.

580
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,260
The ball began shooting up

581
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,160
blue citrine

582
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,220
and red-colored streams.

583
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,260
And then it gets really weird

584
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,860
after that, my friends.

585
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,660
You'll just have to read

586
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,160
Neighbor World

587
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,700
by Dave, quote,

588
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,920
DeLuca, unquote.

589
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,820
This must mean...

590
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,260
If they want to know, that is.

591
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,500
They'll have to read it

592
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,140
if they want to know.

593
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,020
If you really want to know, man,

594
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,200
there's some...

595
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,960
As long as you're not

596
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,260
in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu,

597
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,700
we're playing with their own

598
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,200
Barthesia organs.

599
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,100
Because that's way, way too...

600
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,380
Actually, Dave,

601
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,860
I think you just described

602
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,800
about one-third of our audience.

603
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,220
I hope so.

604
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,480
Yeah, but let's keep off

605
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,660
the negative advertising.

606
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,600
Friends, you'll love

607
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,900
this book that you can't buy yet,

608
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,300
Neighbor World.

609
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,140
This is, you know,

610
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,180
citizen radio,

611
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,000
so we can't do commercial stuff.

612
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,200
But there will come a time

613
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,260
when it will be

614
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,780
obvious how to buy

615
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,080
your copy of this.

616
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,280
And it actually is an amazing...

617
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,660
I wouldn't call it

618
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,160
science fiction exactly

619
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,020
because it's more like literature.

620
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,140
I wouldn't put it

621
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,620
in the sci-fi section

622
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,220
were I the librarian

623
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,580
of the world.

624
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,280
I'd put it in the literature section.

625
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,540
I'm sorry.

626
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,940
That's just the way it is.

627
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,140
There's no monsters.

628
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,980
There's no explosives.

629
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:35,420
There's no emotions.

630
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,180
Soft and moist

631
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,520
like a chocolate chip cookie.

632
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,260
It takes place in the future.

633
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:47,280
But it's the chocolate chip cookie future

634
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,840
you're going to get, friends.

635
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,240
You might as well dig in.

636
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,300
Get used to it.

637
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,540
It ain't going to change.

638
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,740
It's going to be.

639
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,780
Imagine the world of vast selfie

640
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,480
and how that's going to be so stupid

641
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,960
in like 20, 30 years

642
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,440
of selfie.

643
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,140
The mania of people

644
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,580
looking down at their hands

645
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,320
or looking, well,

646
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,000
you don't even have to do that anymore.

647
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,740
Looking down at their feet

648
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,820
or their encrusted, dirty, rotten toenails

649
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,660
like in my case.

650
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,200
I just need to...

651
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,280
You know, Dave,

652
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,080
in the movie

653
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,860
Mad Max Road Warrior,

654
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,440
the newer

655
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,780
Road Warrior Mad Max movie,

656
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,840
there's a scene

657
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,300
where these future apocalypse people

658
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,140
are sitting in the desert

659
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,340
looking at the sky.

660
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,920
There's no technology

661
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,040
to speak of left.

662
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,920
And they see a satellite going.

663
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,080
There's still a few satellites up there.

664
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,480
And one of them goes,

665
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,440
yeah, my mom told me

666
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,560
those used to have all the shows.

667
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,600
Back in the old world,

668
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,780
everyone had their own show.

669
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,340
Hmm.

670
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,520
And, you know,

671
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,660
it's...

672
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,440
That's the way it is.

673
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,320
We happen to be on broadcast radio,

674
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,620
which is a really old way

675
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,940
of doing your own show.

676
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,840
But we're also on a podcast.

677
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,960
And anybody can do a podcast.

678
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,140
And we're not into

679
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,780
random bestiality

680
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,300
slash sexuality

681
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,960
with, you know, with foreigners.

682
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,740
What?

683
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,700
We're Americans.

684
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,500
I don't know what that is.

685
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,040
Well, no.

686
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,820
Let's not draw any...

687
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,940
You know, we don't need to make any...

688
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,340
close any doors here.

689
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,520
We still have possibilities.

690
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,700
We'll wrap them shut.

691
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:46,160
But we have had to really consider

692
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,520
that it's broadcast radio, right?

693
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,620
That's different from podcast.

694
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,480
It's broadcast because

695
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,720
anybody could turn on their radio

696
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,340
in their car and suddenly hear it.

697
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,160
Oh, wait.

698
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,060
Anyone with a computer in their car

699
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,320
could do the same thing.

700
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,260
Mm-hmm.

701
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,840
They'd have choices

702
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,260
of about a thousand

703
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,020
and ten more stations.

704
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,860
But, of course,

705
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,280
they would land on this one.

706
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,680
Or the moon.

707
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,960
And so, what's the difference?

708
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,160
So, praise Bob!

709
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,080
Praise Bob!

710
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,220
That's right.

711
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,540
More people can hear

712
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,360
the hour of slack.

713
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,240
Oh, Lord, praise him.

714
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,920
Praise, praise...

715
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,580
But think about it, Dave.

716
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,020
Well, maybe you weren't there.

717
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,400
But when...

718
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,480
When...

719
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,480
When there were only

720
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,680
ten radio stations

721
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,060
and ten television stations,

722
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:40,980
they were...

723
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,680
They worked harder.

724
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,040
They were...

725
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,220
They tried really hard

726
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,200
to be real

727
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,320
and tell the truth.

728
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,840
They really actually did.

729
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,140
There were only ten of them.

730
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,680
No, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits.

731
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,900
Think of those early programs.

732
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:56,940
Exactly.

733
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,540
They actually had writing staffs

734
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,720
where they all met

735
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,500
and had coffee

736
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,340
and looked out the window.

737
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,480
And screamed,

738
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,320
I got it.

739
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,600
Ran back and started typing

740
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,620
curiously and stuff.

741
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,960
Just like us.

742
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,160
That's what we did.

743
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,760
But times have changed.

744
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,320
Now, all you have to do

745
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,220
to have a show

746
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,820
is turn your phone around

747
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,920
pointing at you

748
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,240
and push the big red button

749
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,060
and you're on the air.

750
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,040
Yeah.

751
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:23,820
Yeah.

752
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,620
Nobody cares whether you cuss.

753
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,420
Nobody cares whether you're lying.

754
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,760
And all that matters is...

755
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,880
Do you want to hear this or not?

756
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,860
Do you want to tune in or not?

757
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,880
And a lot of people

758
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,460
most want to hear

759
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,180
what they most wanted to hear.

760
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,980
And that's...

761
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,080
I'm sorry.

762
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,120
...explains the difference

763
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,620
between when we were struggling

764
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,680
and when they're struggling now.

765
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,940
You can hear

766
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,820
what you most wanted to hear

767
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,740
instantly

768
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,100
and...

769
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,500
in duplication.

770
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,820
Many different versions.

771
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,160
No matter how stupid and wrong

772
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,020
what you want to hear may be,

773
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,460
you can hear it

774
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,580
echoed in your chamber.

775
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,720
Think of the jelly dogs,

776
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,700
the blow mows,

777
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,060
and all the retardations

778
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,120
that make things go slower.

779
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,480
We could be too.

780
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,520
We could be,

781
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,240
but better off

782
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,500
we would be on Uranus

783
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,640
or some distant planet

784
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,900
where we could...

785
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,140
we could wield...

786
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,980
I mean,

787
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,280
what's the word?

788
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,260
Not wield, weld.

789
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,120
Wend.

790
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:37,960
Wend.

791
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,360
Where we could wend

792
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,640
our visions of the stars

793
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,620
throughout the rest of the universe.

794
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,400
We could wend our visions.

795
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,460
Wend.

796
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,120
Wend.

797
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,640
Wend.

798
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,900
No, I don't think that's right.

799
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,360
Weave.

800
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,760
Weave.

801
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,340
That's it.

802
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,680
Wend and weave.

803
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,720
Why not both?

804
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,880
We'll do both.

805
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,380
We'll wend them and weave them.

806
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,180
Our visions.

807
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,560
Our fantasies.

808
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,300
Our...

809
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,100
Our prophecies of the future.

810
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,820
Our concoctions,

811
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,980
which are not for sale.

812
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,620
Thanks to college radio

813
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,900
and podcast...

814
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,040
No, wait.

815
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:12,880
That's pathetic.

816
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,520
I'm going to blow them

817
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,320
and I'll be on the mountain.

818
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,340
All I need...

819
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,980
If you're not on Fox News,

820
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,320
then it's not real.

821
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
That's all they know and see.

822
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,100
Well, reality is fake.

823
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,520
Phone news.

824
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,100
Fake news.

825
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,400
Fake news.

826
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,260
Fake news.

827
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:27,320


828
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,700
Reality is fake.

829
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,160
If you ask me,

830
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:30,720
who is?

831
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,200
Nobody.

832
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,600
Nobody.

833
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:31,760
Nobody.

834
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,500
None of soul

835
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,160
asked me a question ever.

836
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,320
But what about...

837
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,000
No, nobody polled you, right?

838
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:37,800
You didn't...

839
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,520
You weren't polled.

840
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,260
I was left on the tag.

841
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,960
They called me up and said,

842
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,860
would you mind taking

843
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,340
a 12-minute long survey

844
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,160
on your impression...

845
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,780
Then they ran down the list

846
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,540
of my opinions

847
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,640
and impressions and stuff

848
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,040
and I said,

849
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,160
well, it takes 12 minutes

850
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,160
and it's starting now.

851
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,280
And they said,

852
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,660
well, if you want to start it now,

853
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,980
it's another 12 minutes

854
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,600
of signing you up.

855
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,240
Right.

856
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,520
So I refused.

857
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,460
I once again

858
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,860
flipped in the mighty bird

859
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,500
and made my way out the window.

860
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,300
Oh, they polled me.

861
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,400
They took the giant pole

862
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,580
and I had to sit

863
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,900
upon the huge pole

864
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,100
of the polling.

865
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,540
It was...

866
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,640
I was paid,

867
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,060
I think,

868
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,280
$2.50 an hour.

869
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,520
To ride the stag?

870
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,080
I was being polled, yeah.

871
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,880
I was actually paid to be polled.

872
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,580
I spent the first half of my life

873
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,040
being polled for money.

874
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,020
Well, can I ask you your...

875
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

876
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,460
And then I started working for myself

877
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,100
and I didn't get nearly as much polling

878
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,140
or money, but it was better.

879
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,500
What would you do...

880
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,540
Because there was no polling.

881
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,160
Right, yeah.

882
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,520
So what...

883
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,980
If you were to poll the nation,

884
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,320
what do you think the actual tri-axis

885
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,220
and the actual...

886
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,240
And the quagglaferon

887
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,420
of the hexagonal parts, too,

888
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,240
because they're interconnected

889
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,380
just like, you know,

890
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,180
carbon monog...

891
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,320
I think...

892
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,700
I think it's like...

893
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,460
Anyway, Miss Griffith's portrayal

894
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,920
of an insane woman

895
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,980
with a decapitated head of Diffurer,

896
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,380
of Oingo...

897
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,760
of Bongo Longo,

898
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,820
Mr. Mango Bikini...

899
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,980
You know what I'm saying.

900
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,960
How many people do you think

901
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,340
actually want to end her career

902
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,540
or does it only?

903
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,620
In 1980, we did all that stuff

904
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,700
and nobody cared

905
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,060
and who cares now?

906
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,120
But somehow they've made

907
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,220
a big deal of it

908
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,440
because, hey, it's okay

909
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,040
if a redneck says

910
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,460
Lynch Obama,

911
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,320
that Negro president,

912
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,160
but it's terrible

913
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,340
if a comedian holds up

914
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,720
a cutout of a head

915
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,000
of a chopped off,

916
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,460
decapitated,

917
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,000
New York real estate builder.

918
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,980
You know, we've been doing

919
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,340
head launchings

920
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,320
in the Church of the Subgenius

921
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,800
since 1980.

922
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,500
We launched the bleeding head

923
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,480
of Arnold Palmer.

924
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,260
We, well, other schismatic groups

925
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,240
attempted to launch

926
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,580
the bleeding head of Lee Trevino,

927
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,340
Jack Nicklaus,

928
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,440
various different old school...

929
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:27,440


930
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,520
And flip the scrotum

931
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,860
of Lee Harvey Oswald.

932
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,940
Remember those days?

933
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,120
Of Lee Harvey Oswald.

934
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:34,980
Oh, please.

935
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,300
Well, first scrotum,

936
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,580
first scrotum,

937
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,460
flipper wasn't too...

938
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,820
Man, we've been flipping scrotums

939
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,880
for so long

940
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,300
and launching heads

941
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,000
and making Photoshop

942
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,240
bloody head cutouts.

943
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,060
This, all of this

944
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:56,400
seems so fantastically contrived

945
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,260
by a...

946
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:57,860
A contestant.

947
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,420
A contestant.

948
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,420


949
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,420


950
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,420


951
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,420


952
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,420


953
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,420


954
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,420


955
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,420


956
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,440
A contestant.

957
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,240
A committee of idiots

958
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,980
who, of 12-year-olds

959
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,360
who went,

960
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,340
well, now look,

961
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,900
we can pick on them for this.

962
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,440
They said Negro

963
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,580
in the wrong way.

964
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,740
We can pick on them

965
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,580
and we can prove

966
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,680
they're the racists,

967
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,400
not us.

968
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,360
Even though we've been

969
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,900
gerrymandering everything

970
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,500
to make sure black people

971
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,680
don't get any kind

972
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,800
of equal representation

973
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,480
or any other minorities,

974
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,380
including the Mexicans.

975
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,120
Why, we can always just say

976
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,960
that it's unfair

977
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,640
because they made

978
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,440
a funny comment.

979
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:28,780
They made a funny comment

980
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,220
about a comedy show

981
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,180
that had a Republican's head

982
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,160
on a stick.

983
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,040
How horrible and awful.

984
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,500
So that means we can do

985
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,960
anything we want to forever

986
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,920
because that one liberal

987
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,000
did something stupid

988
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,900
and tasteless that one time.

989
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,720
I got news for you, friends.

990
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,440
Yeah, us libtards

991
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,660
may occasionally

992
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,000
do something tasteless.

993
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,840
Oh, deary me,

994
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,300
you better cry.

995
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,900
And weep and melt

996
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,600
like a little snowflake

997
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,360
about that

998
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,760
because that never,

999
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,020
ever happened to you

1000
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,460
before and that did it.

1001
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,980
God.

1002
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,020
Well, well, well said.

1003
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:10,660
Oh.

1004
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,920
Perfectly well put.

1005
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,840
It encapsulates

1006
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,900
the entire truth

1007
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,600
of the reality.

1008
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,140
Oh, Jesus.

1009
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,740
Oh, don't.

1010
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,720
Oh, man, I know

1011
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,740
exactly how you feel.

1012
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,180
The short memories

1013
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,900
of our,

1014
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,700
oh, my people are destroyed

1015
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,860
for lack of knowledge,

1016
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,140
said Hosea

1017
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,380
two and a half thousand

1018
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,220
years ago.

1019
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,480
And he's still right,

1020
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,180
but nobody remembers it

1021
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,200
because their minds

1022
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,880
are destroyed

1023
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,460
for lack of knowledge.

1024
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,440
Hence my dedication,

1025
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,100
my personal dedication

1026
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,820
to what we might call

1027
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,780
soulless, hard,

1028
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,140
hard, hard, cold science.

1029
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:52,680
Yes.

1030
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,220
The coldest and the hardest.

1031
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:54,840
Now, Dave,

1032
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,460
I know that you're

1033
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,180
hard science.

1034
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:57,700
You're not.

1035
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,240
Hard, cold,

1036
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,300
soulless science.

1037
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,160
You're not down

1038
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,460
in that vault with me

1039
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,900
with those frozen seeds.

1040
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,060
I know.

1041
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:04,680
No, but I know

1042
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,020
where the,

1043
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,420
I know where the

1044
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,880
digestible animals are

1045
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,740
and where the convenience

1046
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,040
stores is.

1047
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,620
And also the,

1048
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,540
you know,

1049
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,160
placard conveniences

1050
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:15,780
that are applied

1051
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,720
when you have to

1052
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,340
relieve or misinterpret

1053
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,380
your bowel movements.

1054
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,060
Because Canadians

1055
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,340
talk differently

1056
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:22,980
than we do.

1057
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,500
And that's why

1058
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,460
they need to have

1059
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:24,940
their eyes

1060
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,120
touted out.

1061
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,420
Canadians talk differently.

1062
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,180
Canadians?

1063
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,160
Canadians?

1064
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,400
Canadians?

1065
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,640
Mm-hmm.

1066
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,060
I love Canadians.

1067
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,340
I'm sorry I said that.

1068
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,420
I didn't mean to hate

1069
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,980
Canadians for a brief moment.

1070
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,000
Dave, is it,

1071
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,660
is it because

1072
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,200
we're, you know,

1073
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,340
in northern Ohio

1074
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,440
we're neighbors

1075
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,540
of this other country

1076
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,980
called Canada?

1077
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,600
So we have to...

1078
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,000
Yes, why do you think

1079
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,580
we who live on the lake

1080
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,300
call mayflies

1081
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,980
Canadian soldiers?

1082
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,160
You thought

1083
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,260
we were making that up

1084
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:07,980
when Chaz and I

1085
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,500
told you that

1086
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,560
many, many years ago.

1087
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,060
You thought

1088
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,460
it's mayflies

1089
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,920
and he's just making that up.

1090
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,160
Right, yeah.

1091
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,440
Until Jeff Rosenbaum

1092
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,180
That's right.

1093
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:15,640
said,

1094
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,600
no, it's Canadian soldiers.

1095
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:18,960
That's the way people

1096
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,860
on the lake

1097
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,820
view Canada.

1098
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,780
That's racist!

1099
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,520
No, it's not

1100
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,080
because they're all

1101
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,460
mollycoddle whites

1102
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,700
and occasional Sikhs

1103
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,200
here and there.

1104
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,060
Hey,

1105
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,480
I come from Texas

1106
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,500
where we have

1107
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,400
shiggers.

1108
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,820
Now, you think

1109
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,120
that's not an awkward

1110
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,380
insect disease

1111
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,460
to be afflicted with.

1112
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:38,960
They are painful.

1113
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,000
Yeah.

1114
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,260
They're horrible.

1115
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,340
Luckily,

1116
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,540
they only last

1117
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,300
a couple of months

1118
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,100
and everything

1119
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,720
will be fine

1120
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,480
when we go back.

1121
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,960
But here's the thing, Dave.

1122
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,320
You can't slander

1123
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,680
Canadians just because

1124
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,760
of their insects

1125
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,000
any more than

1126
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,220
I can slander

1127
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,840
my own insects.

1128
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:57,900
My own insects.

1129
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,260
What else is there

1130
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,080
to live for?

1131
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,260
Blood thirstiness.

1132
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,340
It's just nature.

1133
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:03,700
Oh, okay.

1134
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,240
Well, the movie Blood...

1135
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,000
Okay.

1136
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,000
That's the way

1137
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,480
the people in Canada are.

1138
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,060
You have to be tolerant

1139
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,640
of the Canadian people.

1140
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,220
They are bloodthirsty.

1141
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,020
Yeah, I've noticed

1142
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,840
that if you go to,

1143
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,740
like, you were to go

1144
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,100
live in a suburb of Ottawa,

1145
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,880
then they, you know,

1146
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,400
and someone in my mother's

1147
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:20,980
place, you know,

1148
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,200
then they, you know,

1149
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,680
they're not that

1150
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,060
different from us.

1151
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:27,540
Sure.

1152
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,100
Sure, they have

1153
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,400
some customs.

1154
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,140
They may

1155
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,280
behead people

1156
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,360
when no other

1157
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,740
culture does.

1158
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,440
Oh, no, wait.

1159
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,160
I'm talking about

1160
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,600
Muslims.

1161
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,940
It's legal throughout

1162
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,980
the entire country

1163
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,120
by the year 2018,

1164
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,520
by September of 2018,

1165
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,880
which is the promise

1166
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,640
of Trudeau,

1167
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,080
whose ears are

1168
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,920
a delight to the senses

1169
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,620
and a childish rumor

1170
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,720
to the romantic friends

1171
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,200
of Hitler.

1172
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,680
Okay.

1173
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,900
I made myself cry.

1174
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,700
No, Dave, no.

1175
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,260
I had trouble

1176
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,300
following that.

1177
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:01,860
I hate Hitler.

1178
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,900
In the first place,

1179
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,060
Hitler is a...

1180
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,440
He resembles a guy

1181
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,500
in Birds of a Nation

1182
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,900
at the very last scene,

1183
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,260
you know,

1184
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,360
all dressed up in white

1185
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,340
with a monocle

1186
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,340
and a beard's wax.

1187
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,800
I'm sorry.

1188
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,900
Gary Trudeau

1189
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,860
was in there somewhere.

1190
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,620
I left Gary Trudeau

1191
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,460
and all of a sudden

1192
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,300
I saw that picture

1193
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:24,740
of Hitler

1194
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,660
as a Teutonic knight

1195
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,520
and then I saw

1196
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,220
the Birth of a Nation guy

1197
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,220
at the very end of it,

1198
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,720
the hero,

1199
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,500
who looks like

1200
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,320
an insane person

1201
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,680
and that's what

1202
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,480
they wanted us all

1203
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,380
to be like

1204
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,200
a hundred years ago.

1205
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,920
They wanted us

1206
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,960
to all be mad

1207
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,940
and they pulled it off again.

1208
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,560
This country

1209
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,400
will never change.

1210
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,500
They're trying to take

1211
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,380
Howard Zinn's books

1212
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,220
off the shelves

1213
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,260
and I don't know

1214
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,960
why they want to

1215
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,680
pull it off the shelves

1216
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,040
anyway.

1217
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:48,400
That's, uh,

1218
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,240
that, uh, yeah.

1219
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,440
Every now and then

1220
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,780
I think to myself,

1221
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:56,380
I think to myself,

1222
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:57,920
wow,

1223
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,560
they really are

1224
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,040
censoring books

1225
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,800
and burning books

1226
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,780
and putting people

1227
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,040
in jail for 20 years

1228
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,220
for holding a protest sign.

1229
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,220
And punishing comedians.

1230
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:13,340
Well, they actually did that

1231
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:13,520
in Cleveland

1232
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,820
about 20 years ago.

1233
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,520
A woman who was

1234
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,620
an avowed communist

1235
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,200
got beat up

1236
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,780
by a patriotic lady.

1237
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:21,940
In fact,

1238
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,960
the patriotic lady

1239
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,480
whooped her up

1240
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:23,880
pretty good

1241
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,620
upside the head

1242
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,040
and said,

1243
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,300
don't you burn my flag

1244
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:26,860
and all this stuff.

1245
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,100
And then they charged her

1246
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,320
and put her away forever

1247
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,480
in wherever it is,

1248
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:31,980
Lansing,

1249
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,060
or, I mean,

1250
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:33,580
Lansfield.

1251
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,100
Which her,

1252
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,680
which her was put away?

1253
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,620
The,

1254
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,280
the protester her,

1255
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,100
not the angry

1256
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,300
patriotic woman

1257
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,000
phony,

1258
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,500
phony,

1259
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,420
phony patriotism.

1260
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,640
because it's illegal

1261
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,740
to have, uh,

1262
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,380
opinions in America.

1263
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,200
Oh, wait,

1264
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,520
no, I thought it was legal

1265
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,540
to be a communist.

1266
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,240
Even if being a communist

1267
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,240
is stupid,

1268
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,840
I thought it was legal

1269
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,320
to be stupid in America.

1270
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,160
That was the opinion

1271
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,400
I got growing up.

1272
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,400
Me too.

1273
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,620
In the deep south

1274
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,520
in 1950s.

1275
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:09,900
Uh,

1276
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,840
well, oh, wait.

1277
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,500
Oh, now I remember.

1278
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,840
It was okay

1279
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,600
to be a communist

1280
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,540
if you were white.

1281
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,040
Yes.

1282
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:21,940
And, and, and,

1283
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,180
and you were a janitor

1284
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,120
at a small school

1285
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,360
in your old killer.

1286
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,200
I,

1287
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,360
I,

1288
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:26,580
I,

1289
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,020
I,

1290
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:27,420
honestly, Dave,

1291
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,860
I swear to God,

1292
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,000
I thought things

1293
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,600
had started to change.

1294
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,160
I was such a sap.

1295
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,580
I thought

1296
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,240
that racism

1297
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,400
was diminishing

1298
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,280
in America.

1299
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,920
Me too, I did too.

1300
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,040
God, what an idiot I was.

1301
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,140
Uh,

1302
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,400
the last six months,

1303
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,740
well, actually,

1304
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,500
you know,

1305
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,240
to tell the truth,

1306
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:49,600
the,

1307
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,360
the administration

1308
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,680
of Barack Obama,

1309
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,040
I,

1310
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,720
man,

1311
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,060
wised me up.

1312
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,780
I guess I was

1313
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,100
overestimating

1314
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,360
the intelligence

1315
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,180
of my

1316
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,220
fellow

1317
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,540
redneck

1318
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:03,800
Caucasians.

1319
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,320
But I,

1320
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,020
yeah,

1321
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:06,440
hmm.

1322
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,780
Bummer.

1323
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,100
Well,

1324
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,480
that's all I can say.

1325
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,580
Bob was right.

1326
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,500
J.R. Bob Dobbs

1327
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,640
was right the whole time.

1328
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,180
He was right.

1329
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,780
It's gonna be a bummer.

1330
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,760
He said it was gonna be a bummer

1331
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,700
and he was right.

1332
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,240
He predicted

1333
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:20,860
the entire

1334
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,060
Trump administration

1335
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,200
and this entire

1336
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,720
slide back

1337
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,180
to the

1338
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,220
damn

1339
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:27,920
1950s.

1340
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,860
The idiotic

1341
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:29,960
uh,

1342
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,820
Neanderthal

1343
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,260
approaches

1344
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,160
to race,

1345
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,160
science,

1346
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,080
religion,

1347
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
and everything else.

1348
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,560
Makes me sick.

1349
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,520
And,

1350
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,460
that said,

1351
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,320
this has been

1352
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,120
the Hour of Slack

1353
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,180
from the Church

1354
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,320
of the Subgenius.

1355
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,180
Uh,

1356
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:45,820
number,

1357
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:46,860
Hour of Slack

1358
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,120
number

1359
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,500
1,625.

1360
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,560
Yeah,

1361
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:50,880
yeah,

1362
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,220
yeah,

1363
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:51,440
yeah,

1364
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:51,660
yeah.

1365
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:51,960
Yeah,

1366
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:52,160
yeah,

1367
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:52,280


1368
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:52,280


1369
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:52,680
And,

1370
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:52,960
uh,

1371
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,740
we have to

1372
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,900
sign off now

1373
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,620
and let the

1374
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,200
number,

1375
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,200


1376
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:56,820
next poor

1377
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,320
son of a bitch

1378
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,220
get on the air

1379
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,280
and do what he can

1380
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,120
to fight against

1381
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,740
You're allowed to say

1382
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,200
that now,

1383
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,260
even if you're,

1384
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:03,620
um,

1385
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,540
I'm talking about

1386
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,120
a dog,

1387
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:05,660
okay?

1388
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,720
I'm a dog owner.

1389
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,420
And,

1390
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,760
you know,

1391
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,180
as Ken Casey said,

1392
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,400
uh,

1393
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:13,940
put your good

1394
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,220
How come you're

1395
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,260
mentioning Ken Casey?

1396
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,080
I was just thinking

1397
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,540
about him before I called in.

1398
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,060
That's weird,

1399
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:18,700
don't you think?

1400
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,180
It's telekinetic.

1401
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:20,500
No.

1402
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,080
Put your good

1403
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,220
where it'll do the most.

1404
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,700
That's what Ken Casey said.

1405
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:25,500
Now,

1406
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,100
I'm not sure,

1407
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,500
what I have next.

1408
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:27,900
Oh.

1409
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,440
Oh,

1410
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,980
it's an ad for Ed's Day.

1411
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:30,800
Of course,

1412
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,360
I forgot.

1413
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,480
We're about to have

1414
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,640
the biggest subgenius

1415
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,360
festival in the whole universe

1416
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,500
in less than a month.

1417
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:36,520
And right after that,

1418
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,400
there's gonna be Starwood.

1419
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,360
It's not like,

1420
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,660
and then Starwood.

1421
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,620
If there's anything

1422
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,040
left in the world.

1423
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,160
All at the same place

1424
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:41,840
in southern,

1425
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,240
uh,

1426
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,360
Ohio.

1427
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,580
Not that we can legally

1428
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,680
give you all the information

1429
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,400
about it,

1430
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,660
but here goes anyway.

1431
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,580
Praise Bob.

1432
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,940
This is it.

1433
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,440
Your last big chance

1434
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,040
to win

1435
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,120
back your soul.

1436
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,920
X Day

1437
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,360
is coming.

1438
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,140
Kiss all your calendars

1439
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:03,480
goodbye

1440
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,080
and prepare yourself

1441
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,140
to greet

1442
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,900
the men from Planet X

1443
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,620
in power

1444
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,540
and glory

1445
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,400
at the coolest campground

1446
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,560
in the United States.

1447
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,140
With sideshow marvels,

1448
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,000
spontaneous doctor band combustion,

1449
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,560
trained prairie squid,

1450
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,400
frop enhancement workshops,

1451
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,100
acu-beating, psychic surgery,

1452
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,060
human fights, live freaks of nature,

1453
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,340
and acid casualties,

1454
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,460
face-fucking, bat sperm,

1455
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,540
antidote pudding, cook-offs,

1456
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,100
private adult sex-hurt seminars,

1457
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,800
self-mutilating preachers,

1458
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,360
and oddly normal-seeming people,

1459
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,720
sex goddesses, elder gods,

1460
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,320
and exes.

1461
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,940
X Day is coming.

1462
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,780
Are you ready for the finals?

1463
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,080
Which will it be?

1464
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,420
Spaz Outlaw Holiday Forever

1465
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,780
or The Last Roundup?

1466
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,520
Can you handle Judgment Day?

1467
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,520
Will you simper while the world ends?

1468
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,900
Or will you get slack?

1469
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,680
Brought to you by JR Bob Dobbs

1470
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,400
and the Church of the Subgenius.

1471
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,300
See www.subgenius.com

1472
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,340
for more information.

1473
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,320
Experience the anxiousness,

1474
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:22,300


1475
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,400
the anxiously awaited moment,

1476
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,540
the nail-biting suspense

1477
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,000
of July 5th, 7 a.m.

1478
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,640
Only $30!

1479
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,920
None may stop us,

1480
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,420
and none may escape

1481
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,300
once the gate closes.

1482
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,920
Praise Bob!
