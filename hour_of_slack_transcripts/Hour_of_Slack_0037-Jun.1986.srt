1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,360
You're being aware of it.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,840
We are controlling transmission.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,000
We will control the horizontal.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,620
We will control the vertical.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,480
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,860
and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,480
Then we dip them in the sacred waters of the slot.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,720
And what exactly does this do for them?

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,100
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,060
and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,040
the imprinting of the true subgenius.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,060
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,040
You have to turn on the machine.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,880
This is Radio Yerevan.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,600
Wake up, puppet boy!

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,900
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,100
which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,680
There is absolutely no other possibility.

20
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,860
All participants.

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,860
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,700
We subjected it to careful editing

23
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,560
to eliminate elements which we might consider in questionable taste

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,720
for late night viewing.

25
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,660
As it will be shown, it is well within the restrictions of the television code

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,880
which is even more restrictive and stringent in many areas

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,840
than the industry code.

28
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,040
We are sensitive to the concerns which prompted your letter

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,380
and assure you that this network will continue to adhere

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,300
to the high standards we have maintained throughout the years.

31
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:14,900
Thank you.

32
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,500
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

33
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,840
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,840
which reaches from the inner mind to the inner soul.

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,200
What?

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,280
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Bible prophecy is a very, very important subject for every Christian

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to study to help you better understand current events.

39
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,500
Yes.

40
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,700
Yes.

41
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:58,820

00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:58,820


48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,120
in perspective and most importantly to help you have that inner peace of

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,340
knowing that God is on his throne and in control

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,780
okay your code number once more

problems both sides will be destroyed regardless of who starts it the minute you have another war

102
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,660
there's not going to be any war left i don't think if you're going to blow one another pieces

106
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,160
government prepared cancer maps there's not gonna be anything left for the kids i mean there's not

107
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,140
gonna be a world left and we're all gonna end up digging our own holes as soon as we dig them

108
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,280
there's not gonna be anything left for the kids i mean there's not gonna be a world left and we're

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,520
gonna fall in on it i don't think anybody would know what to do even possibly the president

110
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:47,260
is it possible that the end of the world will come in july 1999 perhaps in the form of an atomic

111
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,280
holocaust such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand the

112
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,460
white house will confirm an order to use the atom bomb and our first target will be the initial

113
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,260
landing place for the atomic bomb

114
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,500
capital

115
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:13,740
they're gonna get out of ЛАЙбАРВАР

DW mcdonough

119
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,720
thank you for watching

120
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,380
There was no actual loss of life in the sense we know it.

121
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,520
Still, the vicious destruction of Western Luddys by this sneak attack by Asian robots...

122
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,200
What you see is what you get.

123
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,560
What you get, what you get.

124
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
What the hell do you expect?

125
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,460
What you expect, what you expect.

126
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,760
Pretty red roses.

127
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,860
White puppy noses.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,840
Man of proper hoses is what I get.

129
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,620
Oh, what you see, oh, oh, oh, oh.

130
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,020
Oh, it's not always what you get.

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

132
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,920
The strange worshippers pull at their faces.

133
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,980
Despite himself, a strangled cry escapes Brent.

134
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,420
Ah!

135
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,060
As he sees the ghastly heritage of atomic radiation.

136
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,080
The bomb is indeed their maker.

137
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,240
Hey, Tony, let's have some.

138
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,080
Get me out of here.

139
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,400
Get me out of here.

140
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,660
Going to be hiding this stuff underground.

141
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,000
I personally feel that the President of the United States

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,180
is evading the issue of hazardous waste in America today.

143
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,320
He's with Wonder Woman and her incredible powers of strength and agility.

144
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,180
At six, it's Kirk Spock and the crew of the Starship Enterprise.

145
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,600
The only cult they want to talk about is the subgenius foundation,

146
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,720
the church of the subgenius,

147
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,080
and the only reason they talk about it is for the money.

148
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,200
We're going to go to the phones right now.

149
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,460
Good evening.

150
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,220
You're on KFJZ with Mr. Opinion and Dr. Philo Drummond

151
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,820
and the Reverend Arnold Stang, Ivan Stang.

152
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,140
I have a question for Mr. Drummond.

153
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,820
Yes, go ahead.

154
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,520
Are you Mr. Drummond?

155
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,120
That's right.

156
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm calling from Dallas.

157
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,680
What's your question?

158
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,840
Well, do you work on spiritual problems or do you just work on wallets?

159
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,840
We will help you out spiritually.

160
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,080
Of course, it helps if we can.

161
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,780
We have some financial assistance.

162
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,440
We sell $10 members.

163
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,820
And this is KNO and 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

164
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,240
That's K-N-O-N, 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

165
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,280
The voice of the Yetis.

166
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,220
But there's absolutely no truth to the rumor that members of the church

167
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,140
need passes from Dobbs Committee in order to,

168
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,660
you know, urinate.

169
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,260
We do have permission to urinate at any time.

170
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,040
Not like asked in those other groups where you have to ask permission to go to the restroom.

171
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,080
Subgeniuses can go to the restroom whenever they want.

172
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,580
It's always that mighty time.

173
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,760
They don't even, you know, they don't even have to go to the restroom.

174
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,580
That's not a message from Bob, is it?

175
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:23,660
Well, in 1987, Orson Welles will come on the radio and tell people that the aliens are landing.

176
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,440
But this time, no one will believe him.

177
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,440
But it will be true.

178
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,420
Laser beams shaped like vampires with glow-in-the-dark brains.

179
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,560
I seen a vision, ma'am.

180
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,460
So play your cards right.

181
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:50,980
Yes.

182
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,320
Are you confused?

183
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,280
I'm not.

184
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,100
Heads up.

185
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,260
Look out below.

186
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,380
There will be plenty of distractions to take your minds off the real problem as the time

187
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,260
of P draws to its final close.

188
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,940
For instance, beware.

189
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,500
The fake God Junior, the anti-Bob, will come before long.

190
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,100
Bullets cannot stop him.

191
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,960
He's one of the deceptively human-looking advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from

192
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
beneath the hollow earth.

193
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,040
Parasites of the Elder Gods.

194
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,280
But most people will think he's the second coming.

195
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,080
And his alien hynie will be killed.

196
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,380
Just all the way to world dictatorship and beyond.

197
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:35,020
Perhaps you've been deceived by evangelists masquerading as angels of light.

198
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,920
He's gone.

199
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,300
And the world is waiting for who?

200
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Well, the world's not in believers entirely.

201
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,040
They're waiting for the anti-Christ.

202
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,940
They don't know they are.

203
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,280
But who's going to come in ten days but the one who says to Israel, you need protection.

204
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,920
As we said, have made the club.

205
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,020
And...

206
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,080


207
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:54,920
Hi.

208
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
May I speak to Reverend Stang?

209
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,260
Oh, yeah.

210
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,260
You got me?

211
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,720
Reverend Stang?

212
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,700
Right.

213
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,080
Yeah.

214
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,960
I called to ask, as far as your belief is concerned, are you a Christian and do you

215
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,400
believe in God and the Bible?

216
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,300
We believe in everything.

217
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,300
You do?

218
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,000
Mm-hmm.

219
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,180
The reason I asked is I was intrigued by what you brought out about using the word conspiracy.

220
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,060
And I was wondering if you believed in the Bible.

221
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,060


222
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,060


223
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,060


224
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,060


225
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,840
And the fact that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

226
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:35,320
And do you believe that he still has a true pop in these last days as he did in the Moses

227
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,840
and Elijah?

228
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,700
Well, I'll tell you what.

229
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:45,200
We've been, in the course of our research, we've been getting a whole lot of stuff in

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
the mail about the second coming.

231
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,860
A lot of other cults are talking about the second coming and how Jesus is going to come

232
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,940
back, or sometimes it goes by other names, that Christ is going to come back.

233
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,140
And our main, the main thing that the Subgenius Foundation has to say about that is beware

234
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,700
of cheap imitations.

235
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,760
There are a lot of false prophets running around right now.

236
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,240
And a lot of people that are, in the next 20 or 30 years, there are going to be a lot

237
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,000
of people trying to convince you that they are Jesus back on earth.

238
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,680
Oh, yes.

239
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,840
I've, as a born-again Christian, I've seen that coming.

240
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:22,840


241
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,440
The Spirit, too.

242
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,920
I know exactly what you're talking about.

243
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,540
I'll make a peace agreement.

244
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,980
I'm convinced the only reason America still stands is there's a remnant of Christians

245
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,580
who are still praying for a spiritual awakening in this country.

246
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:45,700
The church of the living God is preaching and believing and looking for the coming of

247
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
Jesus Christ.

248
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,820
There is a way out.

249
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,540
Kill Bob.

250
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,220
Yes, sirree, Bob.

251
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,580
Yes.

252
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
Get down.

253
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,180
We're going to beat down the tongues.

254
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,680
You're going to beat down the tongues of those if their tongue offendeth thee.

255
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,000
Rip it out.

256
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,920
Rip it out.

257
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,400
That is what I say.

258
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,860
Hi, it's Pastor Naked here.

259
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,040
And we've got Dr. Chaos with us.

260
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,080
Doc has got a prepared statement he's going to read to you in just a moment.

261
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,840
Also, we'd like to, everybody out there in radio land, we'd like to thank you for coming

262
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,180
tonight.

263
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,380
We've got a special guest tonight.

264
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:31,200
We're going to be doing our Men In Black special next weekend.

265
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,080
We've got a special guest tonight.

266
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,080


267
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,060
The Hour of Slack Radio Ministry is on the air, only the truth, only on KNON, only in

268
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,420
Dallas.

269
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,240
You get the truth about the Men In Black on the radio.

270
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,580
By the way, you can call us to share your personal problems with us and maybe get a

271
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:48,840
healing.

272
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,820
828-9500 is the number.

273
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:52,820


274
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:52,820


275
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,820
You can call or you can call the classic number, 823-7490.

276
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,040
The rest of them are back in the toilet where they belong.

277
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,500
The rest of the numbers are all gone.

278
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,780
And we'd like to hear from you if you've got personal problems.

279
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,200
You'll get to talk to a minister and maybe we'll even put you on the air with us.

280
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
So you just hold onto those phones.

281
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,300
We'll get to you.

282
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,200
We'll get to you.

283
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,500
I see them all lighting up now.

284
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,240
A lot of folks want to talk to a minister off the air.

285
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,660
Well, we'll just talk to you folks and see what you all got to say and we'll be back

286
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,700
with Dr. Chaos and hear a little more tape right now.

287
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:38,220
Some take the Bible for all it's worth When it says that the meek shall in heaven

288
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,300
be heard Well, I heard that some sheik has bought

289
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:51,480
New Jersey last week And you suckers ain't getting nothing

290
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,640
You suckers ain't getting nothing You suckers ain't getting nothing

291
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
through a

292
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,360


293
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,360


294
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,920
Is HariRama really wrong If you wander around

295
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:10,140
With a napkin all You look Mellow to stiff

296
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,820
And your hair is all gone

297
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:22,340
The king shall inherit Milton Então voce é Strada sobre isso

298
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,640
Seu K Ledford Não tem período Ninguém vai seguir

299
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:31,320
a fun deal and you're up against the wall, well, people, you ain't even got no kind of

300
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,420
deal at all.

301
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:50,780
Because what they do in Washington, it just takes care of the number one, the number one.

302
00:15:50,780 --> 00:16:01,120
And you, you ain't even number two.

303
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:17,020
Well, Jesus freaks, well, they're friendly, but the shit they believe has got their minds

304
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,960
for sure.

305
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,400
And they don't.

306
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,180
Even care when the church takes a cut.

307
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,760
Ain't it bleak when you got so much nothing?

308
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,740
So what do you do?

309
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:40,840
Hey, eat that pork, eat that ham, laugh till you choke on Billy Graham, Moses, Aaron, and

310
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,380
Abraham.

311
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,360
They're all a waste of time, and it's your ass that's on the line.

312
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,920
It's your ass that's on the line.

313
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,820
Do what you want, do what you will.

314
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,480
Just don't mess up your neighbor's bill.

315
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:20,160
And when you pay the bill, kindly leave a little tip and help the next person.

316
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,840
They got theirところ.

317
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,780
It's one day change.

318
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,260
Some take organize!

319
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
Luo Lu

320
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,020
When the chart paper read.

321
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,140
Oh, give me half a dozen for the hotel room.

322
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,640
Wei!

323
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,200
Do what you got to do with your life!

324
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,380
Like me or leave me here.

325
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,180
Right!

326
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,180


327
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,760
Steal everything else!

328
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,340
We are where we're from.

329
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,400
We should have noticed by now our behavior is dumb.

330
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,700
And if our chances expect to improve, it's going to take a lot more than trying to remove

331
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,520
the other race or the other whatever from the face of the planet altogether.

332
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,740
And it's all the earth, which is a dumb thing.

333
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,540
But the thing that really does mean the same, we are dumb all over.

334
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,540
Dumb all over.

335
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,820
Yes, we are.

336
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,180
Dumb all over.

337
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,340
Here and far.

338
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,940
Dumb all over.

339
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,080
Black and white.

340
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,720
People's leaders not real tight.

341
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,740
Oh!

342
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,540
And don't tell them, don't tell the white villages fanatics of the air.

343
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,040
And the night's saying the Bible tells the story.

344
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,820
And makes the details sound real boring about what to do.

345
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,980
If the geeks over there don't believe in the book of income over here,

346
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,420
you can't run a race without no feet.

347
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,380
And for this.

348
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,120
There won't be no street for dummies to jog on or doggies to dog on.

349
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,720
Religious fapics can make it be all the one.

350
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,760
I mean, it won't blow up and disappear.

351
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,900
It'll just look ugly for a thousand years.

352
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,040
You can't run a country by a book of religion.

353
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,440
Not by a heat or a love or a smidgen of foolish rules of ancient date.

354
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,280
Designed to make you all feel great while your bones tend to mutilate.

355
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,540
Those unbelievers from a neighboring state.

356
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,160
Two arms, two arms.

357
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,940
Hooray, that's great.

358
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,740
Two legs ain't bad unless there's a great bishop of hearts to mama in.

359
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,300
For souvenirs, two years.

360
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,120
Get down.

361
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,900
Not his, not hers, but one day.

362
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,240
The good book says it's gonna be that way.

363
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,900
But their book says, not revenge.

364
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,480
The book says,

365
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,100
With whips and chains and hand grenades.

366
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,100
Two arms, two arms.

367
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,860
And with another and another.

368
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,600
Our God says there ain't no other.

369
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,740
Our God says it's all okay.

370
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,840
Our God says this is the way.

371
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,940
It says in the book, burn and destroy.

372
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,080
And revenge and redeem and revenge and deploy.

373
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,480
And rumble the earth to the land of the unbelief.

374
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,460
Scum on the other side.

375
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,180
Cause they don't go for what's in the book and that makes them mad.

376
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,020
So verily we must chop them up.

377
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,720
And stomp on them down.

378
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,420
We'll rent a nice French farm.

379
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,360
To pull them out of existence.

380
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,060
While we leave their real estate just where we need it.

381
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,460
To use again for temples in which to praise.

382
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,000
Our God.

383
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,380
Cause he can really take care of business.

384
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,300
And wear his humble TV suit.

385
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,460
With humble white hair and humble glasses.

386
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,580
And a nice brown suit.

387
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,860
And maybe a blonde wife who takes phone calls.

388
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,200
Tells us our God says it's okay to do this stuff.

389
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,460
And we gotta do it.

390
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,200
Cause if we don't do it, we ain't one of many men.

391
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,300
Depending on which book you're using at the time.

392
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,180
Can use theirs.

393
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:15,980
It don't work.

394
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,760
It's all lies.

395
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,720
Gonna use mine.

396
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,440
Leave that right.

397
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,620
That's what they say.

398
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,420
Every night.

399
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,220
Every day.

400
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,620
And we can't really be dumb.

401
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,540
If we're just following God's orders.

402
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,180
Let's get serious.

403
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,080
God knows what he's doing.

404
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,640
He wrote this book here.

405
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,920
And the book says.

406
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,660
He made us all to be just like him.

407
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,440
So if we're dumb.

408
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,760
Then God is dumb.

409
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,160
And maybe even a little ugly on the side.

410
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,280
We're just like him.

411
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


412
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


413
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


414
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


415
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


416
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


417
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


418
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


419
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,280


420
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,300
They're dumb.

421
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,540
We're dumb.

422
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,500
They're just dumb.

423
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:55,500


424
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:55,500


425
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:55,960
Not the only dumb.

426
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,960
But many different dumb.

427
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,940
They're dumb.

428
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,740
No doubt.

429
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,720
Plus a little old man.

430
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,680
It's then a little ugly of a side.

431
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,540
They're dumb.

432
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,160
But we're special.

433
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,720
We'll tell us very soon.

434
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:10,720


435
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:10,720


436
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,440
Just a little too old.

437
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:11,700
I mean two or three years.

438
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:11,700


439
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,020
We're young to say I rudiment each other.

440
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,020


441
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,020


442
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,020


443
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,020


444
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,260
And I know how to raise my kids.

445
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,460
I guess most of it had been uttered time and time again

446
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,340
to the faithful remnant of the Church of the Cross in slackness.

447
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,980
He'd gotten the children of Cain and the cavemen and the mammoths and the megatheria

448
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,140
and the dinosaurs all jumbled up in the wildest confusion.

449
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,840
It was a storm of nonsense, but yet, you know?

450
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:10,600
Dobbs regarded the Bay of Loch Ness in silence for a few moments, and out of it all came

451
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,340
a suggestion.

452
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,320
The Bay of Loch Ness.

453
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,680
And dear friend, we want to know what your suggestion is.

454
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,820
Dumb all over and a little ugly on the side.

455
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,120
Ah, yes.

456
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,240
There's so many callers out there demanding a healing or demanding answers or demanding

457
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,160
something, but friends, what about what you owe Bob?

458
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,520
Listen to those screaming.

459
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,060
Those are their electronic screams.

460
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,320
Those little beeps you heard.

461
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,880
Those little sounds you heard in the background.

462
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,660
Those are their sad pleadings.

463
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,600
Yeah, the lost souls.

464
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,960
The subgenius out there.

465
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,440
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack, friends.

466
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:02,940
The hour of prophecy for those of you lost wandering souls out there trying to get them

467
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,000
just a bite of slack, just a taste, if only just a taste for a few seconds.

468
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Friends, we're going to try to deliver.

469
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,300
We're going to get them to the church.

470
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,300


471
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,600
We're going to get one of these obnoxious things going here.

472
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,180
Yeah, please do.

473
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,740
Okay, we're going to hail from Dilbert from Fort Worth.

474
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,140
Oh, please don't do that yet.

475
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,080
Hello, Dilbert.

476
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,080
What's happening, Reverend Buck?

477
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,480
Oh, nothing special.

478
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,400
Just a little soul saving in the late, late evening when all my friends are asleep.

479
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,380
Ah, they should be awake, Reverend Buck.

480
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,900
We all need slack tonight.

481
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,620
I know it.

482
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,200
I know it.

483
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,760
We listen to your radio program religiously in Fort Worth.

484
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,960
We have slack on Sunday nights over here because of you.

485
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,160
You get it all the way over there in Fort Worth?

486
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,220
Well, we have to hold on to the FM antenna.

487
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,220
So we need to raise more money for KNON so we can get a stronger signal over here.

488
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,580
Well, you know.

489
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,860
If you hold your hand in your lap, friends, you'll get a much better signal, too.

490
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,340
If it wasn't for gangs like Dilbert's, we wouldn't have much for the KNON radio ministry.

491
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,060
In fact, you know, I'm not going to be doing that.

492
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,080


493
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,080


494
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,080


495
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,180
I'm going to be doing it for the KNON radio ministry.

496
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,180
The world's one true religion might be dead on the air, except for people like Dilbert.

497
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,000
Dilbert, I'm sorry.

498
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,240
Dilbert, you pledged.

499
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,480
Yes, and my brother, Lug, who is also of the Church of the Subgenius and on the phone with

500
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,080
me, he pledged last week.

501
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,240
Yes, praise Bob.

502
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,220
Praise Bob.

503
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,540
Praise Bob Dobbs.

504
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,520
Praise Bob.

505
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,680
Hallelujah, Bob.

506
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,200
Oh, the smiling face.

507
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,480
Bob's smiling now.

508
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:38,020
All you people in Fort Worth, all you weasels in Fort Worth who will not pledge to KNON,

509
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,160
you need to pledge to KNON.

510
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,160


511
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,160


512
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,160


513
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,160


514
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,160


515
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,060
I'm telling you, this is the brother Dilbert, and I'm a member of the Subgenius.

516
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,280
I am a subgenius.

517
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,760
Oh, praise Bob.

518
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,300
I hear him.

519
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,920
Oh, yes.

520
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,840
Help me.

521
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,700
I am a subgenius.

522
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,380
He is a subgenius.

523
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,380
He is, friends.

524
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,620
Can you hear the power coming out across the airwaves here on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas?

525
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,560
Oh, yes.

526
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,120
I can feel the power.

527
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,460
Praise Bob Dobbs.

528
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,340
Praise Bob Dobbs.

529
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,280
All you people get over the phone.

530
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,780
KNON 90.9, Voice of the Yetis in Dallas.

531
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,200
We've got to have pledges from Fort Worth.

532
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,140
Now, Fort Worth, you have to stand up for the KNON.

533
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,140


534
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,140


535
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,580
You have to stand up and be counted for if you're subgenius.

536
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,380
We should have put him on the pledge drive.

537
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,760
Friends, are you abnormal?

538
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,740
If so, then you're probably better than most people.

539
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,880
We have got to help KNON and Reverend Buck Mechut.

540
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,140
He's got to stay on the air.

541
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,040
Hey, what about Reverend Ivan Stang, man?

542
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,840
All of you, every one.

543
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,480
And how about Dr. Chaos?

544
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,340
Yeah, what about KNON?

545
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,380
What about Philodromus?

546
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,800
They don't know who those people are.

547
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,080
Brother, brother, brother, brother, brother.

548
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,120
Brother, brother, brother, brother.

549
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,120


550
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,120


551
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,120


552
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,120


553
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,760
They can't talk to them on the air.

554
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,040
We have to have a say in the whole planet, friends.

555
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,160
World Slack is our goal.

556
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,880
And nothing short.

557
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,200
We need a concert for Slack.

558
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:55,200
Well, Dilbert, thanks for sharing your pledge of love with all of the Dallas-Fort Worth

559
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,500
area.

560
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,400
Reverend Buck.

561
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,520
Reverend Buck.

562
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:57,520


563
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
We need one true world religion.

564
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,360
Love ain't enough, dear friends.

565
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,040
Reverend Buck.

566
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,620
Reverend Buck.

567
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,660
It might be enough.

568
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,340
Yes, Dilbert.

569
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,360
Praise Dilbert.

570
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,740
What is it?

571
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,820
We need Reverend Buck.

572
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,120
I am willing to help sponsor the KNON.

573
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,120


574
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,440
I want to give you a number for a concert, and when I get off the air, I want to give

575
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,140
you a number where you can reach me.

576
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,160
Sounds dangerous.

577
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,180
We need to have a concert for Slack.

578
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,760
Slack 8.

579
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,760
For you.

580
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,580
For the radio program.

581
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:18,660
For you.

582
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:18,860
For the radio program.

583
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,460
For the radio program.

584
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,220
All right, well.

585
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,260
It keeps us all safe.

586
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,940
The rainwater had formed puddles around me.

587
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,960
I'll put you back on hold then if I can.

588
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,980
Put me back on hold and let me give you my number.

589
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,040
But Fort Worth, stand up and be counted for.

590
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,240
I know there's subgenius in Fort Worth.

591
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,560
I know Fort Worth needs work.

592
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,660
I know Fort Worth needs work.

593
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,440
Please, Buck.

594
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,100
The thing is, there are subgenius in Fort Worth.

595
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,100


596
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,040
There are subgeniuses everywhere.

597
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,760
There are subgeniuses in your pocket, my friend.

598
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,080
There are subgeniuses hiding in your headphones.

599
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,520
Okay.

600
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,740
They're between the two headphones, friends.

601
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,820
Thousands of subgeniuses live in the space between your headphones.

602
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:59,740
The lifetimes of a million born and killed again subgeni live inside your head.

603
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,500
You can bring these forces out one at a time and make money off of these through the sacred

604
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,080
super science of Bob Dobbs Telecom.

605
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,740
Telecosmic astrochemistry.

606
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,400
That's right, friends.

607
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,060
Hello?

608
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,880
By listening to this station for hours and hours and hours and by praying to Bob and

609
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,820
saying his name and the word slack over and over again.

610
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,780
Mr. Peepy, come in.

611
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,420
Mr. Peepy.

612
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,340
You, you, you out there, yes?

613
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,540
You poor simpleton listening.

614
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,000
You and you geniuses.

615
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,720
You poor wretched devils.

616
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,560
Those of you who thought you were smart.

617
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,860
What are you going to do?

618
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,060
Mr. Peepy.

619
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,480
When the whip comes down.

620
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,600
What are you going to do when the whip comes down, buddy?

621
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,840
What are you going to do, baby, when that white hot flash of radiation gives you a

622
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,420
spanking?

623
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:50,860
Huh?

624
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,640
Are you going to jump out of your skin?

625
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,060
Are you going to kiss the ground praising Bob that finally the end has come and you

626
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:04,660
at least have that subgenius membership card in your pocket to protect you from the alien

627
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,920
gamma rays?

628
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,040
Oh, you're going to get a little bit of a shock.

629
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,900
Oh, yes, dear friends.

630
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:22,320
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

631
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,460
I wonder what happened to Mr. Peepy.

632
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,200
His line is mysteriously totally jammed.

633
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,440
It's karma, baby.

634
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,960
I mean, I'm sorry, but that's...

635
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,580
When you see a solid light, you know it's just no good.

636
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,620
Kill him.

637
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,460
Kill him all.

638
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,600
That's the way I look at it.

639
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:37,920
You hear that?

640
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,720
Huh?

641
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,220
I ain't going to hear nothing.

642
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,400
Okay.

643
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,720
Well, Fishbowl...

644
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,140
Oh, I'd like to say something to the callers.

645
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,340
I don't know.

646
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,460
I guess that's fine.

647
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,700
Fishbowl and Peepy, you need to call back.

648
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,940
I don't know what's wrong with you guys.

649
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,620
You might as well hang on.

650
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:50,920
Thanks for calling.

651
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,360
Good luck.

652
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,800
Thank you.

653
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,240
Yep.

654
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,600
So long.

655
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:07,580
The program is brought to you in living color by the American Heart Association.

656
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:07,580


657
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:07,580


658
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:07,580


659
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:07,580


660
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:07,580


661
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:07,580


662
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,080
I'm going to get my course.

663
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,780
Ask your friendly cork dealer for a file cork today.

664
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,180
If you itch, you need soft and soothe.

665
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,720
Swimming, you know.

666
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,900
High temperature today, 100 degrees even.

667
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,960
That makes it the 63rd day this summer that we've been there.

668
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,240
Well, actually this year, because almost the entire...

669
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,400
And if weather conditions had been different, the toxic cloud release might have blown over

670
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,740
Manhattan.

671
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,120
It's scary.

672
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,800
It's damn scary, especially with the fact that I've got two kids.

673
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,100
You die normally.

674
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,300
You die with these chemicals.

675
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,080
What's it going to do?

676
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,880
XX helps keep you extra, extra dry.

677
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,040
Let your fears well up.

678
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,020
You have them.

679
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,380
Now don't deny them their chance to clean your soul.

680
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,680
Send a dollar to Bob Dobbs or die.

681
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,380
Know that within every man lies a little bit of a chance to clean your soul.

682
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


683
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


684
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


685
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


686
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


687
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


688
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


689
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


690
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


691
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


692
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


693
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


694
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


695
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,380


696
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
The world is a monster.

697
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,780
And the dogs.

698
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,320
And this monster may create a monster.

699
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,820
A Frankenstein monster to bring your realistic world crashing down around you.

700
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:32,660
Or a hideous religion made of the parts of dead religions dug up from their foul, shankered

701
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,380
graves and pieced together under these walls.

702
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:35,380


703
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,780
The unholy science.

704
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:45,040
The forbidden sciences of Bull Dada and of Bob Dobbs.

705
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,800
He who has lived among us and shall live again, my friends.

706
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,960
Bob shall come back.

707
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:59,600
And soon we will be hearing from the Pope of all New York, Reverend Dr. Dr. Mr. M.D.

708
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,980
David N. Meyer II in San Francisco.

709
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,740
But first...

710
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,700
You say it can't be true.

711
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,700
There are some 50,000 nuclear weapons in the world today.

712
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,960
I think we really need nuclear weapons because Russia and everybody else has got them.

713
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:27,820
Jesus began to give to them the signs of his coming and the end of the age.

714
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,900
And one of the signs he referred to was the abomination of desolation that was spoken

715
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,280
of by Daniel the prophet.

716
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,360
This happened in the early 20th century.

717
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,840
And it hasn't taken place yet.

718
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,180
Just don't buy your doomsday theories.

719
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,240
Well, you better buy them.

720
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:45,540
We are in worse shape from the point of view of our military preparedness than we were

721
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,680
on the 8th of December, 1941, the day after the Pearl Harbor attack.

722
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,640
The Russians got the definite advantage on us right now.

723
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,100
We need to show more strength.

724
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,160
We got to catch up or get ahead of them or we're dead meat.

725
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,480
Exactly as Noah getting into the ark triggered the deluge that destroyed the earth in his day.

726
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,760
And that it's very highly possible that when this all takes place that a great cataclysmic

727
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,380
judgment will do that very thing.

728
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,540
And we do not know that it wouldn't happen in 1982.

729
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,740
Boys and girls, we're going to shock the house with your brain and the world.

730
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,780
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

731
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,340
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

732
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,720
Bob is coming here to ease your strife.

733
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,960
Come on, suckers, let Bob into your life.

734
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,340
Well, I'm MC Cleave.

735
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,260
I'm a master rapper.

736
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:34,460
I'm a master rapper.

737
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


738
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


739
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


740
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


741
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


742
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


743
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


744
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,460


745
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,980
I'm a dog like my mother's lips.

746
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,540
Got the clack.

747
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,660
Y'all sitting out saying, oh, woe is me.

748
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,040
Well, I'm here to tell you it ain't worth being.

749
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,300
The end times is here.

750
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,280
You're a pretty mad lad.

751
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,260
Time to make a pay for the past.

752
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,920
The world is going to have to go through a rebirth.

753
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
And that means paying the spaceship earth.

754
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,700
This will come from Planet X to remove from us the pay for sex.

755
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,880
In the meantime, we will have our say.

756
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,200
Get slack and fornicate every day.

757
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,540
Not the conspiracy on his ass.

758
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,580
Make your life a ass.

759
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,460
Take the money and get out of here.

760
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,460


761
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,460


762
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,460


763
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,460


764
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,460


765
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,460


766
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,460


767
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,980
Take your toes back to the hips.

768
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,260
Make the normal suckers fit.

769
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,620
Take the time to rape their minds.

770
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,900
Tell them to blow it out their behinds.

771
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:17,220
Take all their money, get what don't work, and continue to switch to the rebirth.

772
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,600
Who's gone?

773
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,900
He's gone.

774
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,180
Who's gone?

775
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,500
He's gone.

776
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,700
Who's gone?

777
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,040
He's gone.

778
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,160
Who's gone?

779
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,580
He's a

780
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,860
He's a dickhead

781
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,320
Slack master makes it damn faster

782
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,780
Than any other

783
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,060
Smoke through the bone

784
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,020
He's a one-of-a-kind

785
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,260
Stick it up your behind

786
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,040
If you wanna know the truth

787
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,020
Then that's a fact

788
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,180
Somebody scream

789
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,220
Give me more slack

790
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,400
Give me more slack

791
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,660
Do you like slack?

792
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,720
I like it

793
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,020
I say I love slack

794
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,000
I love it

795
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,360
Do you want slack?

796
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,320
I want it

797
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,560
Do you need slack?

798
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,400
I need it

799
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,580
Do you like Niki?

800
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,240
No

801
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,360
How about Anani?

802
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,180
No

803
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,000
What about Nunu?

804
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,820
No

805
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,300
Look out for Shaggy Dismal

806
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,980
Get down to program

807
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,760
Go

808
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,820
Ride, ride, Jehovah One

809
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,980
Do you like Trinaturalist?

810
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,380
No

811
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,800
Castle for a big nation

812
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,940
Illuminati

813
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,980
Get out my face

814
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,840
Shocker's a removal

815
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,580
Head of the world

816
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,380
I'm a golfer

817
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,380
Do you like Bob?

818
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,320
Yeah

819
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,220
Do you like Ivan Stack?

820
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:41,600
Yeah

821
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,300
Like Milo Drummond?

822
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,540
How about Buzzing Evidence?

823
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,040
Yeah

824
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,340
What about Doctors?

825
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,740
I like Bob

826
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,100
How about Passaport Niggas?

827
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,840
Do you money?

828
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,120
How about David and Maya?

829
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:52,760
Yeah

830
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,600
How about Paul Fabrici?

831
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,020
Yeah

832
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,800
St. Jane or Huxley?

833
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,220
Yeah

834
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,460
Got a big convenience

835
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,260
Yeah

836
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,080
How about Randy Gage?

837
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,480
Yeah

838
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,280
How about David and Filiber?

839
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,100
Yeah

840
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,740
How about Zach, Madison, Cleve, and the Spirited Sky?

841
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,600
Yeah

842
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:07,920
Yeah

843
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,100
Yeah

844
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,080
Well I'm Reverend Cleve

845
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,180
The bastard son of Blowfly

846
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,220
Dr. Rudy Graymore

847
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,240
And while my Steve Dolomite ain't the next

848
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,800
I know what's what

849
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,160
Babe, I like the shape and size of contour of your butt

850
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,380
So come on over here and give up the gas

851
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,580
Whip some skin on me, bitch

852
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,920
Oh, give me all of your cash

853
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,000
Return you wanted to worry about your soul

854
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,200
Cause when the exits come

855
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,340
You'll be right on my pole

856
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,860
To God's holy home

857
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,500
Hello

858
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,960
Good evening, my friends

859
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,400
This is the Reverend Dr. Sardonicus J. Chaos

860
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,080
I just wanted to talk to you a little bit

861
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,360
I want to talk about people being used

862
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,260
You've got to see the conspiracy as a user of people

863
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,980
Watch an angry man

864
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,320
An angry man

865
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,480
Notice how an invisible force

866
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,060
Uses and agitates his physical parts

867
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:13,080
His vocal cords send out snarling threats

868
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,760
His mouth twists weirdly

869
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,040
His eyes flash fire

870
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,900
His arms and body jerk violently

871
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,700
You are seeing conspiracy possession in action

872
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,620
The angry man has been taken over

873
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:33,020
He is used, controlled, tyrannized

874
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,740
Still believe that people are self-controlled?

875
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,340
Don't

876
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,480
Now I'll tell you what

877
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,340
You've got to think about how you use your mind

878
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,520
How would you describe your mental activities?

879
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,420
One man described his mind as a zoo

880
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,160
Gone mad with shrieking and clawing beasts

881
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,720
He was describing his sudden explosions of worry and frustration

882
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,560
A bored and unhappy person is always looking for an excuse for his own self-interest

883
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:03,560


884
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:03,560


885
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,140
When he has the Contentment,

886
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,520
That's when one wants to act tough

887
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,780
And he looks to this Belle

888
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,820
To exasperate himself

889
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,980
The human- ré kontrollant

890
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,740
It's aways easy to fail

891
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:13,740


892
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:13,740


893
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:13,740


894
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:13,740


895
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:29,400
He then،

896
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:33,540


897
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:33,540


898
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,800
Oh yes friends and what we heard a little while ago was a slack master

899
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,980
cleave and the spurious jive doing that great subgenius rap song welcome to the

900
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:52,820
end times. Reverend Cleave is also the madman that did the bozo nose rap that

901
00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:00,400
we heard last last week with the Egyptian reggae. I know that you all are

902
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,300
big fans of the bozo nose out there in subgenius land at least those of you

903
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:11,280
who know what I'm talking about. But in 1961 Jones had a vision that

904
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,940
Indianapolis was going to be consumed in a holocaust. Fortunately he'd also found

905
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:22,060
an article in Esquire magazine about the nine safest places in the world to hide.

906
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,200
That was when he bought the property in Guyana.

907
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,160
Yes friends and this let's let's go in

908
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,380
to the end times.

909
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,760
We're deep into an actual recording of a real subgenius revival now.

910
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,360
This is a devival that is friends a devival. This is to devangelize you.

911
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,880
It depends on how you come out of it. It depends on whether you come out with your

912
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:51,100
legs or not. This is Pope David N. Meyer the slickest of all the subgenius

913
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:56,340
preachers with his choir the zombies for Bob choir in San Francisco.

914
00:39:59,340 --> 00:39:59,880
Devangelism.

915
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,380
A bit more serious.

916
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,380
I want to talk about this supposed death of Bob.

917
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,100
So you'll notice that the seance a little earlier the Pope of all New York was not in

918
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,800
attendance. Ask me why that was.

919
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,940
Ask me why that was.

920
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,460
Ask me why that was.

921
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,380
Children the answer is simple because children are not the only ones who are not the only

922
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,300
ones who are not the only ones who are not the only ones who are not entirely unlike Paul

923
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,080
McCartney is alive.

924
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:47,900
Children they would have you believe they would have you believe children that last

925
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:55,380
year in this wonderful city of San Francisco that J.R. Bob Dobbs actually came here for

926
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:55,880
a revival.

927
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,360
Children that's very flattering to you the audience and of course it is.

928
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:00,380


929
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,880
It makes all of us feel good.

930
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,140
But let's face facts about corporate America.

931
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,800
Children how is corporate America composed?

932
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,380
Why you all know it's composed in a pyramid.

933
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,400
Yes it's composed in a pyramid children.

934
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:19,440
And Lee Iacocca sits at the top and the man busting rivets on the assembly line sits at

935
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,820
the bottom.

936
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:26,100
We are not unlike that man busting rivets in the great pyramid of the church of the

937
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,680
subgenius.

938
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,620
Now I ask you children.

939
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,000
Let's try to find an apt.

940
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,360
I'm not going to be a genius.

941
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,980
I'm going to be a subgenius.

942
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,240
Let's find an apt analogy.

943
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,840
The subgenius analogy test tonight.

944
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,140
Let's find an apt analogy for the revival last year.

945
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,000
Couldn't we liken it to really.

946
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,980
When you consider that Bob has to go all around the universe.

947
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,280
He has many things to do.

948
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,640
Many planets to look after.

949
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,740
Many deals to settle.

950
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,900
Really that revival was more or less like a meeting of junior salesmen in Dubuque Iowa.

951
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,420
Now children do you believe for one minute Lee Iacocca would come to that meeting of

952
00:41:59,420 --> 00:41:59,900
salesmen.

953
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,340
What?

954
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:00,840
Say no.

955
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,580
No.

956
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,520
Say no.

957
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,220
No.

958
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,100
Say no.

959
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:04,780
No.

960
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,340
God damn it.

961
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,500
That's right children.

962
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,700
He wouldn't come and I believe that neither would the real Bob Dobbs come here.

963
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,700
No offense men to you.

964
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,560
You're a fine audience and we are indeed fine preachers but we're Bob's foot soldiers and

965
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,940
Bob has better things to do.

966
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,840
Now then children.

967
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,060
If Bob sent one of his many android doubles here.

968
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:38,440
if Bob was elsewhere, if the android double was shot, then Bob must be alive, children.

969
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,980
He must be alive.

970
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:49,280
And that's why I say to you, children, to close the first part of my sermon,

971
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,120
if your Bob is dead, try mine.

972
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,840
And now, children, the lovely left coast jaded heart and crow all zombie choir for Bob

973
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,400
is going to treat you with a wonderful song, and I'll be back for part two of my sermon.

974
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,840
Oh, yes, dear friends.

975
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,040
Listen to that all-star song.

976
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,040


977
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,420
All-star zombies for Bob choir.

978
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Now, friends, we have a devival coming up here in Dallas, Texas.

979
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,940
That's right, dear friends.

980
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:45,300
Yes, a real devival, and we can talk about it on the air because it's no charge by that time of night.

981
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,180
We're talking about it at the Fantasy Fair, friends, twice a year.

982
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:58,480
The science fiction and comics and crazy, weird movie fans.

983
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,420
Have these enormous conventions.

984
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,800
If you've never been to one, you might want to check it out just for the convention itself.

985
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,000
But that's right, friends.

986
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,540
We're doing a small-scale devival.

987
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:20,080
We're going to try to save some souls, destroy some pink ones, destroy a few unbelievers, perhaps.

988
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,780
But, friends, let me tell you when and where that devival is.

989
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,260
Now, Bob, don't laugh at us.

990
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:28,520
Please.

991
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,580
This is him.

992
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,060
Listen to Bob cackling away.

993
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,780
Friends, it's at the Marriott Park Central.

994
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:44,300
Yes, the Marriott Park Central at Coit and LBJ this Saturday night at 11.30.

995
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,500
No, 11 o'clock.

996
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:45,900
I'm sorry.

997
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,080
That's 11 o'clock p.m. this Saturday, July 5th.

998
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:56,120
The Marriott Hotel at the corner of Coit and LBJ, dear friends.

999
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,260
The subgenius.

1000
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:20,540
The subgenius devival where Pastor Naked, myself, and I'm sure Dr. Chaos and Bob only knows what other creatures will come crawling out of the woodwork to preach to those unsaved and perhaps unsavable nerdly science fiction fans and poor comics fans who barely, you know, they've heard of Bob.

1001
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,440
They may even wear Bob t-shirts, but it ain't the same.

1002
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,160
That's right.

1003
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,520
Yeah.

1004
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,280
You know, well, we've got a caller who's going to ask us a few of those things.

1005
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,360
I'd like to say to our listening audience, though, that I won't be there.

1006
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,820
Yes, my dad's going to be in town.

1007
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:49,240
My genetically identical dad is going to be in town that very night, and we're going to be partying at the Hyatt all night.

1008
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,520
So a little false slack for us.

1009
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,740
But anyway, we're going to now go to a phone call.

1010
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,300
Here we go.

1011
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,760
And we'll just say this guy.

1012
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,080
Oops.

1013
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,260
I thought we were, but he just hung up.

1014
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,140
I guess he his tongue froze.

1015
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,280
I guess this is a good time, however, to tell you all to call us at 828-9500.

1016
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,820
You could get on the air fairly quick.

1017
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:19,760
Also, to tell you that the address of the subgenius foundation, we're going to send you a free information pack on the Church of the Subgenius.

1018
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,220
I just had a I just had a Bob had a fan.

1019
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,180
At least a couple.

1020
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,280
I just had a real Yeti game.

1021
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,740
I'll give me a call right just now and say, Pastor naked.

1022
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,620
How can I find out about Bob and who is Bob?

1023
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:41,440
Well, the way to explain all this without boring all these died in the wool subgenie who are so sob's they're sick of Bob.

1024
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,580
We're just going to send you the information that you want for free.

1025
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,880
Right to this address.

1026
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,280
Post Office Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1027
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,520
And let me repeat it once again, because I know you want it.

1028
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,260
Post Office Box 140306.

1029
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,780
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1030
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,380
This is a great chance for all you.

1031
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,620
Give me Bob's out there to get something for Bob for nothing.

1032
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:13,420
Now, I mean, I don't I don't know if you know what a gimme Bob is, but believe me, I gave Bob is the biggest curse on the subgenius church.

1033
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,380
But never mind all that.

1034
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,920
We're going to give you the first hit is free.

1035
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,520
Let's see who's on the phone here.

1036
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,200
Who is this?

1037
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,520
I am on the air.

1038
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,680
Oh, yes, sort of.

1039
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,680
I'm afraid this is this phone calling again.

1040
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,360
Oh, fish.

1041
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,180
I didn't cosmic radio.

1042
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:27,240
I'm sorry.

1043
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,240


1044
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,240


1045
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,240


1046
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,240


1047
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,240


1048
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,240


1049
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,240


1050
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,240


1051
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,240


1052
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,400
That's right.

1053
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:27,400


1054
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,300
I don't have any ways to keep cutting me off.

1055
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,200
Well, listen, I'd like to ask a few questions on the air for the benefit.

1056
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,060
OK, well, let's let's speed it up and go for it.

1057
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,260
Right.

1058
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,440
First of all, what exactly is flack?

1059
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,180
And how can I get more?

1060
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,600
OK, how you can get more?

1061
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,520
That's a great way to ask.

1062
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,840
Because slack is a quant.

1063
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,860
It is a how much slack isn't?

1064
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,100
What?

1065
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,140
It's a how much slack is?

1066
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:57,120
The sort of a distance or two actual physical property of how long it takes before the conspiracy jerks in your your chain and you stand up straight with your back.

1067
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,220
I'm sorry.

1068
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,800
and add attention and all that.

1069
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,940
So slack is sort of a lack of tension in your life,

1070
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,380
and it's the ability of you to not serve the conspiracy.

1071
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,380
Whatever little tiny bit of ability you've got not to serve the conspiracy, that's slack.

1072
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,820
You know, there just ain't enough slack.

1073
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:14,920
One other thing.

1074
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,480
I have a picture of Uncle Sam that says,

1075
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,600
I want you to examine your Series E bonds, and that made me wonder,

1076
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,240
what can I do to help do my part for Bob?

1077
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:29,220
Well, you can, I'll tell you what, you can tithe the church.

1078
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,500
I don't think that that's too strong of a statement.

1079
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,720
You can tithe the church.

1080
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,020
Yeah, and we don't ask for all worldly goods, friends.

1081
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,740
I mean, some of these other religions might ask for all worldly goods.

1082
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,420
We only want about 50%, about 20%, 10% of your income,

1083
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:47,800
a little link off the bottom of your spinal cord, one or two vertebrae.

1084
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,060
And, friend, the way to serve Bob is to feel Bob.

1085
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,620
Stop working through you and just do whatever you think Bob wants you to do.

1086
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,640
Don't do what we tell you to do.

1087
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,080
Don't suck on the finger.

1088
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,580
Go where the finger's pointing, my friend.

1089
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:10,120
Right, and another thing, Fishbowl, is don't make the mistake that some of these Bobbies have made,

1090
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,900
because if you want to bow down to Bob, the best thing to do is just to bend over.

1091
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,860
So, now, anything else?

1092
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,840
There's one other thing.

1093
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,840
Okay, one more.

1094
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,040
I'm listening to your show on a hi-fi stereo system.

1095
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,740
And I was wondering just how that could be hazardous to my health.

1096
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,480
How can it be hazardous to your health?

1097
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:34,940
The conspiracy allows radioactivity to emit from that stereo at astonishing quantities, Fishbowl.

1098
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:44,380
And, you know, what you need to do is not to wear those lead-lined pants that they sell in Sears now.

1099
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,600
Don't mess with those, friend.

1100
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,820
What you should do is sit right by your stereo with your legs wide open and mutate as fast as you can.

1101
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,220
Let's contaminate that gene pool.

1102
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,260
All the further.

1103
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,380
We need to mutate faster and faster.

1104
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,720
More subgeni.

1105
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,820
Because the only way the subgeni are going to get out of our human breeding, the tainted seed.

1106
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,100
The bondage.

1107
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,100
The terrible bondage of this evil seed.

1108
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,120
The tainted seed, because the subgeni mix their genes.

1109
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,540
Remember, the Yetis.

1110
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,260
We are the Yetis.

1111
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:09,960
We're not the humans.

1112
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,540
We're the Yetis.

1113
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,840
We're the other kind of person.

1114
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,100
You need to...

1115
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:13,240
The others.

1116
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:19,140
You need to burn out the human side of your genetic structure.

1117
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,940
Oh, yeah.

1118
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,680
And kill it.

1119
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,320
Kill it.

1120
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:21,680
Burn it.

1121
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,220
Burn it with fire.

1122
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,020
Thanks a lot.

1123
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,020
Thanks a lot.

1124
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,380
And that opened up a line, and we're going to go right to another line.

1125
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,140
What the heck?

1126
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,000
Hello, hello, hello.

1127
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:30,640
What?

1128
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:31,880
What?

1129
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,540
You're on the air, son.

1130
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,320
I thought...

1131
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,720
Oh, they're shaking me out there.

1132
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,140
Who cares?

1133
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:37,580
Afraid.

1134
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,420
Hello, you on the air?

1135
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:39,700
Pitiful things.

1136
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,420
Have I got anybody?

1137
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,140
All right.

1138
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,160
Let's see what I got left.

1139
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,080
Hello, you want to be on the air?

1140
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:46,520
Yeah.

1141
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,960
Well, give it to me.

1142
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,440
You detected W.A. this particle.

1143
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:49,760
Hello?

1144
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:50,500
Hello?

1145
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,520
Yeah, talk.

1146
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,360
You know?

1147
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:52,480
Talk?

1148
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,640
You remember how to talk?

1149
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,240
No.

1150
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,000
Okay.

1151
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,560
That opened up a line.

1152
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,100
Hello?

1153
00:50:59,100 --> 00:50:59,820
You want to talk?

1154
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,980
It's been a long time.

1155
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,820
You've got squish all over you.

1156
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,320
What?

1157
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,040
I can't hear you, man.

1158
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,100
You can't hear me.

1159
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,380
Why not?

1160
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,220
I don't know.

1161
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:05,840
I wasn't listening.

1162
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,160
Go ahead.

1163
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:06,800
Okay.

1164
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,120
Well, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions.

1165
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:09,880
Okay.

1166
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,340
Well, go ahead.

1167
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,020
Fire away, dude.

1168
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,940
First of all, where and when is the revival again for...

1169
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,200
Okay.

1170
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,480
We'll repeat that at the end of the show.

1171
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,220
Anything else?

1172
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,040
Yeah.

1173
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,760
I'm with Tom Franco with Bohemians against Bocconzi.

1174
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:21,860
Oh, yeah.

1175
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,100
Yeah.

1176
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:22,160
Yeah.

1177
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,240
Yeah.

1178
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,920
I was listening to your tape.

1179
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,200
You know, I sent that one to Malaysia.

1180
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,440
We're going to play it whenever we find the exact right spot.

1181
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,820
It's tough to find, but we're going to get it.

1182
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,020
Okay?

1183
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:30,560
Okay.

1184
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:30,840
Thanks.

1185
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,420
Okay.

1186
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,320
And that opened up a line.

1187
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,500
Let me go ahead and talk about where that revival is.

1188
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:36,760
Okay.

1189
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,680
Well, let's go ahead and tell them.

1190
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,020
Hello?

1191
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,360
Yes, dear friend.

1192
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,640
As you asked, that revival...

1193
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,260
You want to go to this revival?

1194
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:41,720
Hello?

1195
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,200
Yes.

1196
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,120
You want to go to the revival guy?

1197
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,720
Yes.

1198
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,420
Okay.

1199
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,880
Tell them where to go, Stan.

1200
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:46,600
Yeah.

1201
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,300
My name is Bob.

1202
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,040
My name is Bob.

1203
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,540
I need to know where Bob is for one thing.

1204
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,320
What about this?

1205
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:52,940
You want to know what a...

1206
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,700
Friend, you've got to look deep inside.

1207
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,540
Just unbutton your pants.

1208
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,200
Oh, all right.

1209
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,620
And let yourself free and start to think the pure thoughts.

1210
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,920
The pure thoughts.

1211
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,200
I want to be Bob's girlfriend.

1212
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:03,740
Wait, wait.

1213
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,900
Okay, well, the Bob in your...

1214
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,940
You're talking about Barbara.

1215
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:06,500
Right.

1216
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,460
The female essence of Bob.

1217
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,280
The Bob in your pants should find the Yeti in hers.

1218
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:11,720
Hell, yes.

1219
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,060
And we're going to give the number again.

1220
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,280
Listen, listen, guys.

1221
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:14,720
Hey, listen.

1222
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,080
Wait.

1223
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,400
How about my Jimmy Hendrix?

1224
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:17,540
Okay.

1225
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,360
Hey, guys.

1226
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:18,620
Praise Jimmy.

1227
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,480
You want some free information on the church?

1228
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,420
We're going to give...

1229
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,520
God.

1230
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:21,880
Yeah.

1231
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,900
Listen to your radio.

1232
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,560
We're going to give the address again for free information.

1233
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,940
I don't want that church, man.

1234
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,040
Oh, okay.

1235
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:28,580
Well, great.

1236
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,300
Well, you...

1237
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,420
Obviously, this guy got the wrong...

1238
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,300
The wrong...

1239
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,440
Think of the eternity.

1240
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,360
Tell him where to go to that thing again.

1241
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:35,960
Okay, friends.

1242
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,900
There's a subgenius devival.

1243
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:38,580
Yes.

1244
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:42,400
This Saturday night at 11 o'clock p.m.

1245
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,420
And go until God only knows when.

1246
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,060
At the Marriott Park Central.

1247
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,460
Excuse me.

1248
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,880
The Marriott Park Central at...

1249
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,640
Coit and LBJ.

1250
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,340
That's the Fantasy Fair.

1251
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,280
And friends, if you bring that picture of Bob

1252
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,440
or your subgenius membership card or your Bob button

1253
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,660
while you can get in for free.

1254
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,340
In fact, that's the only way you can get in.

1255
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,580
So, that's the only way we can talk about it

1256
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:09,780
on these shows supported by your donations.

1257
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:10,720
Oh.

1258
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,120
Yes, friends.

1259
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,620
You know, these devivals are important to your Bob gland.

1260
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,680
Your Bob gland's a rectangular gland in your foot.

1261
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,940
You don't know about it, and yet it's more real

1262
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,520
than anything else you've got.

1263
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,140
It's more real than that job you've got

1264
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,940
that you've got to get up in the morning

1265
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,780
and go to tomorrow morning.

1266
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,240
Hello?

1267
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,900
Oh, we got to screw up.

1268
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,240
Hello?

1269
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,660
You want to talk?

1270
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,100
Praise Bob.

1271
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:36,980
Oh, yes.

1272
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,340
It's a real subgenius name.

1273
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:38,820
You guys.

1274
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,960
I was wandering.

1275
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,020
I was straying from the church.

1276
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:43,780
Uh-oh.

1277
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,080
That's okay.

1278
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,100
I admit it.

1279
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,020
I thought I had a mattress back.

1280
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,420
But I was...

1281
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:49,660
But I was...

1282
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,960
I was wafted in the way.

1283
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,540
But...

1284
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,940
But tonight, I heard the radio ministry,

1285
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,380
and it all came back to me in a big flash,

1286
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,220
a big burst, a big explosion.

1287
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,860
Praise be to both of you.

1288
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh, praise be to both of us.

1289
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:06,500
Praise be.

1290
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:07,960
That's right.

1291
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,760
Yes, they...

1292
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,940
And that opens up a line.

1293
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:11,940
...worship our...

1294
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:12,980
...pathetic...

1295
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,300
Oh.

1296
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,260
Oh, man.

1297
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,900
We're going to have to sign off for the question.

1298
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:16,700
Hello?

1299
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,180
Is power of flagellation a sin?

1300
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,040
No.

1301
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,020
No, it's the best thing you can do, guy.

1302
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,880
...is the only answer to your problems.

1303
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,000
The only thing you can do to save your soul for sure is pyroflagellation,

1304
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,800
and yet it's too hard for most of these.

1305
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,280
Many hardly even believe that pyroflagellation even exists.

1306
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,260
I think it's a wives' tale.

1307
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,400
What do you got to say?

1308
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,880
Hey, my bob won't get up, man.

1309
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:40,780
What did I do?

1310
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,440
What?

1311
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,840
My bob won't get up.

1312
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,560
What did I do?

1313
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,820
Your bob won't get up?

1314
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,140
Yeah.

1315
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,600
Well, I don't care.

1316
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,620
You got a bob in my pocket.

1317
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:47,960
Yeah.

1318
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,520
Oh, well, that opened up a...

1319
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,200
Bob in my pocket.

1320
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,680
Hello.

1321
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,600
What about you?

1322
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,040
I got a great big monster bob in my pocket.

1323
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,820
Hey, Reverend Buck.

1324
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:56,800
Yeah, hello.

1325
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,500
Hey, what's going on?

1326
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,500
This is a rapper in Fort Worth, and I heard the Reverend Dilbert,

1327
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,480
and we really do need some slack here in Fort Worth.

1328
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,360
You're going to get your share because we're planning a Fort Worth devolvel, son,

1329
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,620
and we're just going to let you know as we go,

1330
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,720
but I'm ready to work with Dilbert on that,

1331
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,660
and Dilbert is fixing to become a saint in the church,

1332
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,280
and I wouldn't kid about a thing like that.

1333
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,940
That can be found in this mushy brown pie that's all over Fort Worth.

1334
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,540
I think the people in Fort Worth need to know about this.

1335
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,980
I think the people in Fort Worth are going to have their chance.

1336
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,120
All right.

1337
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,700
Thanks very much, Whopper and me.

1338
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,700
Don't forget to call us back,

1339
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,800
but right now we're running out of time, as you may have noticed.

1340
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,080
That's right.

1341
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:34,480
Okay.

1342
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,200
Okay, slack.

1343
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,660
A truly enlightened person can find slack

1344
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:43,580
in the brown, squishy, smelly pies that cover the ground of Fort Worth.

1345
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,640
Go to the stockyards and dive right in, friends,

1346
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,600
and there ye shall find slack.

1347
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,560
If butt you have...

1348
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,640
All right.

1349
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:49,640


1350
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,000
...eyes to see, none are so blind, said Dr. Drummond,

1351
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,780
as those who have no eyes.

1352
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,080
Hello?

1353
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,380
Hello?

1354
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,440
Hey, that's it for the calls, man.

1355
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,260
That's it for the calls.

1356
00:55:59,280 --> 00:55:59,860
We're moving out.

1357
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,160
Right.

1358
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:08,140
The world is equal proportions of bull's eyes and bull's shit.

1359
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,560
They were bullish and they were foolish.

1360
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,220
Now there's no one to listen when they talk.

1361
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,160
Adam's been the same on the eve of destruction.

1362
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,340
Not unlike the way we split our genes.

1363
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:43,520
But like the way we split our genes, we split our world at the same.

1364
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:45,200
Adam's been the same on the eve of destruction.

1365
00:56:52,840 --> 00:57:07,660
But like the way we split our genes, we't be there until the

1366
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:07,660


1367
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:07,820
But like the way we split our genes, we're seen again.

1368
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:07,820


1369
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,300
We're three times as old as fiction.

1370
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,300


1371
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,500
We're shot from 보고у

1372
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:08,500


1373
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:08,580
like our land, our air non-woven land.

1374
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,180
American Rail is falling red,ガми Fr eagerly heights of flight,

1375
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,780
wind blowing depths of my pathsं

1376
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,880
Sonic que sweetheart is flying так high and at that moment,

1377
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,660
doesn't seem like G.R. Williams live here.

1378
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:22,040
While he dreamed his dream dreams, the memes to his dreams hit the scene.

1379
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,740
Someone called his name, let me say.

1380
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,900
Basic training in the ghetto, basic training in the ghetto.

1381
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,300
Talk about your mama, you took it.

1382
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,220
Yeah, there's the logic library.

1383
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,420
Some of my best jokes are free.

1384
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,560
Basic training in the ghetto, basic training in the ghetto.

1385
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,940
Talk about your mama, you took it.

1386
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,920
Yeah, there's the logic library.

1387
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,140
Some of my best jokes are free.

1388
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,180
Uh, yes, dear friend, sorry to leave George Clinton there.

1389
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,360
We're gonna have to move out.

1390
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,320
Oh, I don't know, maybe I will come to the Steve Ival.

1391
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,600
It sounds so good.

1392
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,640
Sounds so good. Isn't that Friday night you said?

1393
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,200
That's Friday night, no, that's Saturday night at 11 o'clock.

1394
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,180
Saturday night? Oh, I can't make you do that.

1395
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:30,300
Saturday night, 11 o'clock at the Marriott Park Central Fantasy Fair.

1396
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,140
The incredible weirdness bazaar, so to speak.

1397
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,740
Hey, I'm gonna be at Wyandale's that night playing my own harp.

1398
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,560
At Coit and LBJ, the Marriott at Coit and LBJ.

1399
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,280
That's the same thing.

1400
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,740
The church of the subgenius D. Vival, number 5006.

1401
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:49,220
Or if you're a cheapskate, just come to Wyandale's and just listen to me play my own harp with all my weird friends.

1402
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:59,640
Alright, and friends, that calls for a hideous death rattle of an end for the hour of slack.

1403
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,180
Did you give them the address?

1404
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:09,360
And if you want to write to the church of the subgenius for more information, friends, that sacred P.O. box number is Bob at P.O. Box 140.

1405
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,860
1-4-0-3-0-6.

1406
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,100
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1407
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,360
Give it to them again.

1408
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:24,020
Yes, that's P.O. Box 140, 306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1409
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,300
That's all you get.

1410
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,740
That's all you get P.O. Slacks over with.

1411
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,260
We're history.

1412
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:28,980
We're out of here.

1413
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,720
I think I'll give you a call.

1414
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,880
I'll call you back.

1415
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,960
Okay, thanks.

1416
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:00,960


1417
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:00,960


1418
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,520
Bye-bye.

1419
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:02,520


1420
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,280
Bye-bye.

1421
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,840
Bye-bye.

1422
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:05,980
Bye.

1423
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:06,380
Bye-bye.

1424
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,060
Bye-bye.

1425
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:07,580
Bye.

1426
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:07,660
Bye.

1427
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,480
Bye.

1428
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:08,480


1429
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:08,480


1430
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:08,520
Bye.

1431
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1432
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1433
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1434
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1435
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1436
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1437
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1438
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1439
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1440
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,520


1441
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,680
Bye.

1442
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,280
Bye.
