00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,740
Oh, yes, dear friends, this hour of Slack, alleged number 1655, is by necessity and choice a rerun of number 411 from September 1993, which was requested by a longtime listener.

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,700
And when I checked it out, I could hear why.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,620
It's really unusual and features some excellent rants by a then high schooler named Reverend Gobi.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,860
Who had a subgenius show at her high school radio station somewhere up north.

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:45,940
We recently saw Reverend Gobi at Starwood Festival, and I wish I'd remembered how great her rants were, because I would have reminded her, too.

6
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,400
Hello, and welcome to the hour of Slack.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,020
This is 89.7 WITN.

8
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,480
What?

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,740
And my name is Gobi.

10
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,760
Yeah, it is Gobi.

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,980
And I will be with you forever.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,920
For the next hour and a half, hour and 45 minutes or so, bringing you Slack, as always.

13
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,020
Why?

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,960
Because we love you.

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,420
Yeah, speak for yourself, Gobi.

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,440
Because we're in the mood.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,880
For Slack.

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,360
For fun.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,180
For good times.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,780
For good music.

21
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,020
For friends.

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,700
And drinks.

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,900
For cocktails.

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,140
And parties.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,440
For cheese dip.

26
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,580
Cheese whiz.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,900
Little pretzel things.

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,320
Yes, folks.

29
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,700
We're in the mood for J.R. Bob Dog.

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,760
We're in the mood for Wanda.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
We're in the mood for Heifer, Savinoon, and Narnini.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,200
Niggie.

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,920
We're in the mood for Niggie.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,360
Niggie.

35
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,460
Niggie.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,520
Niggie.

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:01,720
Niggie.

38
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,540
Niggie.

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:02,540


40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,220
We're in the mood for the

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
We're in the mood for the

42
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,680
And we're not hearing it.

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:29,960
We're in the mood for technical difficulties.

44
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,380
For albums.

45
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,580
For cassette players.

46
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,400
We're in the mood for puzzling evidence.

47
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,440
We're in the mood for the end of the song.

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,000
Here it comes.

49
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,240
Here it comes.

50
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,080
Oh yeah.

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,000
It's coming.

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,860
It's almost there.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,780
We've almost made it, friends.

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,320
Together.

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,400
As one.

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,580
We've almost made it to the end of the song.

57
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,660
Woo!

58
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,420
Not yet.

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,240
Okay.

60
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,600
All right.

61
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:54,960
All right.

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,780
We're out of our way.

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,760
Here we go.

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,680
Here we go.

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,560
Here we go.

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:02:59,940
We're going to the end of the song.

67
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


68
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


69
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


70
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


71
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


72
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


73
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,180
We're going.

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,580
We're going.

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
Here we go.

76
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,160
Here we go.

77
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,220
Okay.

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,840
Okay.

79
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:19,700
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the end of the song.

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,440
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

81
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,920
Our subgenius.

82
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:29,920


83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:29,920


84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,600
Oh, slack.

85
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,180
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

86
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,660
If you're watching this video, I...

87
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:20,660


88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,660
Welcome trapped 16 years ago.

89
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,580
The film was rabid, and made by journalists.

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,040
In the 1960s, the government saved sizes of $10,000.

91
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,780
A�� Jones wrote about the

92
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:24,780


93
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:24,780


94
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,900
we were coming home from the gas industry, getting ideas on how stuff.

95
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:29,900


96
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,440
the will of every bullet to the body.

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,500
Reason enough to take away care.

98
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,980
And reason enough to remember again.

99
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,600
I'd like to always know

100
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,180
what's like to have a constant

101
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,640
pride. That's the time to relax

102
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,100
and to breathe.

103
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,660
This is the wild side of life,

104
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,300
ain't it, Wilgus?

105
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,580
Wilgus just grinned and opened

106
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,420
in another beer.

107
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,140
And are you married, divorced,

108
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,960
separated, single, uninterested, or dead?

109
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,160
Yes. And do you or anyone in your household

110
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,200
work in publishing, television, radio, or

111
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,840
have a conviction of violent crimes with a gun?

112
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,320
With a gun? Yes. No. Good.

113
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,000
Now, we're conducting research into the impact of

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,580
visual versus oral stimuli.

115
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,600
What you see as opposed to what you hear.

116
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,980
For the next three minutes, we're going to either show you

117
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,820
a slide or let you hear a sound.

118
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,940
You tell us which of the two stimuli has a greater

119
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,160
impact on you. And you're going to give me a watch for this?

120
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
When it's all over, yes. A cheap one.

121
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,380
Okay, shoot.

122
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,600
Here's your first image.

123
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,800
Okay, a second's all you get. Here's your sound.

124
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,120
I would...

125
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,380
have to say the sound.

126
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,960
Fine. Indicate your choice by pressing either one

127
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,500
of the two blue buttons in front of you.

128
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,180
What about this big red button? Don't touch that.

129
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,800
Now, indicate your choice.

130
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,920
Fine. Sound over image for the first example.

131
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,520
Alright, here's another slide.

132
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,140
Wow! Put that back on!

133
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,360
Sorry, a peek is all you get. Who is she?

134
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,620
Come on, we have to continue. Now, here's your sound.

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,900
I, uh, can't decide.

136
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,960
Maybe you'd better let me see the picture again.

137
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,660
No, your choice is obviously

138
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,620
image over sound.

139
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,520
Ow! That was your next sound.

140
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,040
You hurt me!

141
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,100
And here's another slide.

142
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,220
Look at this! I'm bleeding!

143
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,040
Ah, sound wins again. Please press the appropriate button.

144
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,640
And we're ready to move on to part two of the survey.

145
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,780
An image or sound will be presented, then several reactions will appear on the screen with a number above each one.

146
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,380
Press the yellow button that corresponds to your reaction.

147
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,580
What about this big red button?

148
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,580
Don't touch that.

149
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,840
Now, first we have a sound.

150
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,740
Sponsors are on the screen. Indicate yours now.

151
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,820
Indecisive, aren't you?

152
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,340
Sorry. Is that alright?

153
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,360
It's fine.

154
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,840
Fine. Thank you very much.

155
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,260
And how about that one?

156
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,340
That one makes me want to leave. Can I push the big red button now?

157
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,400
I said don't touch that.

158
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,420
We have achieved liftoff. The show is lifting off. Fasten your seat belts, please.

159
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,040
There will be a toll.

160
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,740
Please slow down. The toll booth is approaching.

161
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,100
Pick up your ticket. Cars only. Nothing in tow.

162
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:13,900
Please press the button on your right. Insert coin. Deposit 25 cents.

163
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,880
We have achieved orbit. We're now orbiting this country.

164
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,580
Doo doo doo doo doo.

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:34,380
Yes, orbiting the United States. In a small, slow circle.

166
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,220
And that's right.

167
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,160
We are taking requests. If you'd like to hear something on the space episode of the subgenius, just ask.

168
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,540
Oh, what's that? You want to hear, there's no beer in heaven?

169
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,060
Well, I think we can find that.

170
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,200
Rock music. It is the number one tool being used in this world.

171
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,200


172
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,200


173
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,200


174
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,200


175
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,980
Rock music sets itself above God.

176
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,440
Now listen, we are programmable. The devil knows how to program you.

177
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,340
The devil has programmed two generations of young people for absolute total destruction through his music.

178
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,220
Now, the devil wouldn't be the devil if he didn't have music.

179
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,860
Stop it. Stop.

180
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,820
You know what they said in Syracuse, New York, when they were going to have a concert up there recently?

181
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,180
The police chief said, it's not the violence I worry about. It's the people.

182
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,180


183
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,420
As much as the nudity.

184
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,140
Dancing. Dancing.

185
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,200
Nudity. Violence.

186
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,400
Dancing. Dancing.

187
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,480
Nudity. Violence.

188
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Young people are killing themselves at a rapid rate.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,800
I believe much of it as a result of rock music.

190
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,060
Our homes have been torn down.

191
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,760
The walls of purity have been torn down.

192
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,080
The walls of purity have been torn down.

193
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,140
The walls of purity have been torn down.

194
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,140
Morality in general has been put in the sewer because of rock music.

195
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,220
These gods.

196
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,260
That's supposed to get you all nervous and jerky.

197
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,660
Because it can make us feel relaxed.

198
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,120
It can make us feel scared.

199
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,080
Isn't it interesting?

200
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,440
You'll notice they don't play the Tennessee Waltz in a Halloween flick.

201
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,680
Now, would you agree with me that there's patriotic music? Yes.

202
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,220
Would you agree with me that there's funeral music? Yes.

203
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,220
Would you agree with me that there's scary type music? Yes.

204
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,720
Would you agree with me that there's relaxing type music? Yes.

205
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,180
Matter of fact, there is also boogie type music.

206
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,720
Boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity.

207
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,000
And now, here's Johnny.

208
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,080
Ask not what your country can do for you.

209
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,820
Here, our friends will be drinking all of their holy.

210
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,180
In him, Mel Gibson will.

211
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,220
We'll drink and we'll receive.

212
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,560
And since we're nicked in here.

213
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,340
Don't think we can be under an unconfirmed.

214
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,500
What did he say?

215
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,380
In heaven, there is no beer.

216
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,300
No beer?

217
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,200
That's why we drink it here.

218
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,500
I won't go.

219
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,020
And when we're gone from here.

220
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,340
Our friends will be drinking all of their holy.

221
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

222
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,500
We can't be out of here.

223
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

224
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,620
Un- Acceptable.

225
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,580
In heaven there is no beer.

226
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,520
No beer?

227
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,400
That's why we drink it here.

228
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,200
And when we're gone from here.

229
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,220
Our friends will be drinking all of their holier.

230
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,380
I-I-I-I-E, we'll drink all of resulting fear.

231
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:17,940
Hooray!

232
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,780
A product will be introduced whose only function is to be recycled.

233
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,200
As a backlash against animal rights fanatics,

234
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,040
cruelty plus products will be introduced.

235
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,980
We have one of your old favorites from the 70s,

236
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,720
from the rocking years, the golden years of rock and roll,

237
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,860
the golden years of disco, the golden years of ugly clothing,

238
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,680
and bad music.

239
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,220
I'm sure you'll remember this one.

240
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,080
This goes out to Bleepo Abernathy.

241
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,260
I'm a can.

242
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,900
I've come to see you smile.

243
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,280
I know you understand.

244
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,920
The greenhouse effect,

245
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,080
will be used to prove that the earth is a zoo.

246
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,120
The last drive-in theater will close.

247
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:35,240
Low definition television will be taken over by subgenius sympathizers,

248
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,740
as high tech TV hypnotizes normals.

249
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:48,140
Conspiracy scientists will reveal that cancer and cigarettes have a single cause.

250
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,560
Learning disorders will be discovered to be teaching disorders.

251
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,260
And counseling centers will be opened for would-be conspiracy teachers.

252
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,960
Shopping malls will become large enough that they begin to connect,

253
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,000
forming walled cities of consumption.

254
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,360
The world's largest consumer of drugs.

255
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,700
The world's largest consumer of drugs.

256
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:18,700


257
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,200


258
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,140
Because they're bad for the environment.

259
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,200
Yes.

260
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,300
They must change their ways.

261
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,140
So, let's volunteer to rip off their clothing until their hair is pure and clean.

262
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,400
Come on now.

263
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,440
Come on back on The Comeback.

264
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,360
We're asking you to speak your piece about perhaps the Lithuanian problem.

265
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,200
Denying peyote to the Native American church.

266
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,680
And Earth Day, the commercialization of Earth Day.

267
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,160
One of the greatest holidays for money.

268
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,020
making and money saving in American history.

269
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,100
So shop now on those beautiful

270
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,460
Evolution Echo

271
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,380
Perfect Lawn Chairs.

272
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,320
We got them real cheap, $49.95.

273
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,840
Ecologically perfect

274
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,780
lawn chairs.

275
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,180
Only a little bit of Zirconium 90 in them.

276
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,980
Now that's a

277
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,640
fan for the family.

278
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,100
I am, I, I, I,

279
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm here.

280
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,840
Let's, let's hear this guy.

281
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,660
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,360
Oh, West Coast

284
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,500
Cone from the West Coast.

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,600
I expected you to give

286
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,240
a full report.

287
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,520
Are you still

288
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:33,980
keeping it?

289
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,860
Hell, it's a good idea.

290
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,000
I was thinking, I want to see if, I want to see if I can count you guys

291
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,120
in on this. What I'm going to do is buy up a bunch

292
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,700
of surplus magic fingers from those

293
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,260
vibrating hotel sofa things.

294
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,580
And sew them into sneakers,

295
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,100
loafers, and baggy trousers.

296
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,320
And sell them as like kind of a West Coast experience kind of thing to the malls in the Midwest.

297
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,520
As a full market device?

298
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,340
As a full market device, I think we could clean up.

299
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,280
Oh my God.

300
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,780
You are on.

301
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,000
He wants to sell those little like chocolate dog fingers.

302
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,560
Is that correct?

303
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,680
Well, not, not the Vienna sausage ones.

304
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,960
No, those little magic Vienna sausages.

305
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,240
Magic Vienna sausages.

306
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,800
The ones that you kind of, that you find in the hotel sofas and things like that.

307
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,420
Hey, Wes.

308
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,640
The little vibrating ones.

309
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,160
Can I ask you a question?

310
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,920
Oh, vibrating Wiener sausages.

311
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,200
Viennas.

312
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,220
Vibrating Wieners.

313
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,800
Sew them into the loafers and sneakers.

314
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,360
And then, yeah, and then they suck up.

315
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,440
So like when you're walking around in the rubble, you can feel a vibrating Vienna sausage in

316
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,080
your like, your Rockford so to speak.

317
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,280
There you go.

318
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,220
Oh my God.

319
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,320
This guy's a, he's a genius, Taz.

320
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,640
I think it would be less traumatizing then, you know, the way they're, the way they're

321
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,180
setting it up now because I understand why they're doing it.

322
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,560
Red Cross everywhere, I suppose.

323
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,580
Is it like before or is it more like now?

324
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,060
It's a, it's a, it's a lot closer to now.

325
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,600
Ah.

326
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,200
It's a lot closer.

327
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,080
Can I interject here?

328
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,680
Hey, Taz wants to interject something.

329
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,100
Wes.

330
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,420
Yes, sir.

331
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,920
Are you having Earth Day out there on the West Coast too?

332
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,660
On Earth?

333
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,920
Yes, we are.

334
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,140
Taz is such a brilliant man.

335
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,080
He still didn't know California was in the United Snakes.

336
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,460
It's still part of it.

337
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,940
As a matter of fact, this is the state that leads to these idiotic trams.

338
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,760
It's not quite sure how long we will be.

339
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,800
It's going to be like Atlantis.

340
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,680
Yes, yes.

341
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,580
Or Atlanta.

342
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,620
Or Atlanta would be a lot better.

343
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,560
It'd be steamy and there would be like tennis courts on your forehead and people walking

344
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:17,620
around.

345
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:24,700
Or like, you know, New Elbia and Pennsylvania maybe.

346
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,080
That's what I go for is them Rockport Vienna sausages.

347
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,220
But have you ever tried low sodium iguana?

348
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,040
Now you have to put an awful lot of water and steep it in water for like maybe three

349
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,880
or four hours before you bring it to a rapid boil with a handful of chickpeas.

350
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,020
Now once you've got your iguana meat all bubbling and frothy, it'll exude kind of a brown foam.

351
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,460
That's just the bad juices coming out.

352
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,320
And you scrape those off top, put in a little bit of butter and drop that handful of chickpeas

353
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,700
in there.

354
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,120
Now did you already drop the handful of chickpeas into the bubbling iguana?

355
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,400
Let's repeat those steps.

356
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,760
The Kentucky Headhunters at the Cleveland Agora Sunday, May 13th.

357
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,860
The Kentucky Headhunters.

358
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,480
Oh, you're talking to Lonesome Cowboy.

359
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,380
You interrupted their show.

360
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
I met the island man and he said, uh, uh, uh.

361
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,000


362
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,520
Wing-bang.

363
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,040
Bing-bang.

364
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,520
Wing-bang.

365
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,140
Oo-ee.

366
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:20,960
Oo-ah, uh.

367
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,300
Bing-bang.

368
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,820
Ọ-a-ba-di-wing-bang.

369
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,900
Wing-bang.

370
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,200
Wing-bang.

371
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,880
Hiç-ting-rock, one-a- larg.

372
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,140
Academic My name is Mark McMillan, I've been in this business for 18 years, and it's

373
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,780
a small town town, but I got an idea.

374
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,140
It can beetto, it can beetto.

375
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,120
I've been to California and I never had a والa would-be суáto.

376
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,920
That's now anạtlough, then yo'll get a folding rooibos like me, that is a would-be.

377
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
By the way we use that something that goes into the needle that I made into a boat, I

378
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,000


379
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,900
Hello, you're talking to Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

380
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,060
I have a great marketing strategy for...

381
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,820
For Earth Day?

382
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,500
Serving burgers without a powerful container.

383
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,600
Without a plastic container?

384
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,120
Okay, lay it on us. What is this idea?

385
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,920
You just serve the burgers on your body parts there.

386
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,700
Oh, now, see, this is a form of imagination.

387
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,260
A very small part or a very small and limited example of imagination.

388
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,120
As a matter of fact, it's kind of an example of an examination,

389
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
but it is an example of an imagination.

390
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,200
In that the burger is just piping fresh and frizzy.

391
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,820
And piping fresh and frizzy.

392
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,880
Because they've grown up, learned what life is.

393
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,340
They know what to do with themselves in society.

394
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,720
They can now go out in the world and sit in a classroom

395
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,220
and not spit and fling their boogers on the people next to them or anything.

396
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,920
And not be...

397
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,860
They can go downtown and people won't throw them in jail.

398
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,520
Listen, you guys are making some great strides here.

399
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,860
First it just starts by being able to not swear on the air.

400
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,980
And then the next thing you know, you'll be eating regular food.

401
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,300
You'll eat the same food that people eat and stuff.

402
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,740
And quibbling and fawning and obsequious and fawning and tidwiddling and...

403
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:11,980
Tidwiddling?

404
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,160
Tidwiddling?

405
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,880
Tidwiddling.

406
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
That's not an actual word.

407
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,040
Isn't that?

408
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,480
Yeah, I think that is tidwiddling.

409
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,760
I tried it and believe me, it's not a real one.

410
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,520
Well, what other words do you got?

411
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,500
Romboid?

412
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,060
Romboid?

413
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,560
Romboid is a secret password for the prophylactic.

414
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,700
It is?

415
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,840
Yeah.

416
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,260
Well, that's rather fitting for this problem.

417
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,040
How about this one?

418
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,520
You think I've got a big vocabulary.

419
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,140
Get a load of this one.

420
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,540
Yeah?

421
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,760
What do you think of it?

422
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,000
Lay it on me, big guy.

423
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,540
Isn't that disgusting?

424
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,560
Come on, come on, admit it.

425
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,840
Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen in your life?

426
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,480
Come on, I'm not going to ask you to describe it.

427
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,560
Hello, you're talking to one of these guys over there.

428
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,340
Doesn't that fill you with revulsion?

429
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,840
Are you going to swear?

430
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,480
No, you wouldn't want to swear on the air, would you?

431
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,480
Well, as you may be able to tell, dear friends, this is one of those hour of slack shows.

432
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,640
It's just a battle of the shows.

433
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,740
It's so many different subgenius and subgenius sympathizer.

434
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,700
Oh, there.

435
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,020
All over the place, they're scrambling the airwaves.

436
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,260
But yet, but yet.

437
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,300
Hello?

438
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,120
I mean, a booth.

439
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,280
I mean, a beep.

440
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:25,980
Hello?

441
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,580
Other show?

442
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,400
Can you hear me?

443
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,160
Come in, please.

444
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,180
Yes, we're here.

445
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,360
Yeah, plug into other show.

446
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,620
We're here with very few sound effects.

447
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,300
Find a multimeter.

448
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,220
What is your trajectory?

449
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,520
Over.

450
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,660
It's 4 and 4.

451
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,420
Oh, my gosh.

452
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,820
See if you can angle in a little bit behind our ship.

453
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,540
Punch in 4 and 4 and drive this show right up.

454
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:44,740
Yeah, I'm about to start.

455
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,680
4.

456
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,540
Radio traverse.

457
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,580
There we go.

458
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,380
We are attempting your maneuver here.

459
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,620
Hey, wait.

460
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,780
They're coming towards us.

461
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,520
That's right.

462
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
Get that guy out of here.

463
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,940
Oh, I'm sorry.

464
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,540
It's time for penetration of the subspace around your craft.

465
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,880
We're attempting to rotate shows.

466
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,580
Wait, get the front deals up.

467
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,720
The front deals up.

468
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,860
If you can meet our meeting phase,

469
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,480
you too can join the Bridgman family.

470
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,620
We have achieved penetration.

471
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,720
I think we have transmission.

472
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,180
I think we have show.

473
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,840
Yeah, there's just minor damage to the sub hull.

474
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,480
Minor difficulties.

475
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,920
We can patch that up en route.

476
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,960
Okay, that's great.

477
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,320
My genitals feel all fluffy.

478
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,500
We're happy to be speaking with you tonight.

479
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,280
How are you, Dr. Howell and Berkeley Show?

480
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,420
I'm glad you're speaking to me,

481
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,380
but how about canning the personal comments?

482
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,840
You know, we're being audited by the Federal Bureau of Demonology,

483
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,780
and they sometimes object to the...

484
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,980
Those kinds of lower trajectories are only usable inside and outside.

485
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,780
Well, speaking of...

486
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,020
Speaking of lower trajectories,

487
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,120
speaking of the gravitational pull...

488
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,920
Yes, but what does all this have to do with Frank Bent?

489
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,500
Oh, not much.

490
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,860
You know, we try not to let these evil perverts

491
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,420
who kill student nurses and so on

492
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,620
call us up on the show because it only encourages them.

493
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,320
That's right.

494
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,120
And there was Bob Spent, the murderer who killed all...

495
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,900
And what do you mean he likes me there?

496
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,640
Listen, you make lots of money off of it afterwards

497
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,300
when you sign that big record contract.

498
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,360
Well, you know, tomorrow's heroes are today's serial killers.

499
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,340
Children will buy action figures of them in department stores,

500
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,480
and tomorrow's serial killers...

501
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,200
We'll laugh at their antics on...

502
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,420
You know, it's...

503
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,260
Hard murderers, he says here, but that doesn't make any sense.

504
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,740
If we all talk at once, it sounds like we're having a party.

505
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,740
I think I'll pass out hors d'oeuvres and martinis.

506
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,000
Wouldn't anybody like a froth stick?

507
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,040
Yes, I would very much like a hot buttered rum martini.

508
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,500
Yum, yum.

509
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,460
For public service.

510
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,340
And three froth sticks.

511
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,960
Hot buttered rum martini coming up.

512
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,860
Could I have another froth stick while we're at it?

513
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,040
Pass one this way.

514
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,320
I'd like another grub for that puff, Moe.

515
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,940
Now, come on, gentlemen.

516
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,260
Ew.

517
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,800
Okay.

518
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,440
As I said, the...

519
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,820
Firing one.

520
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,420
Solons in Washington...

521
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,720
No.

522
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,120
No.

523
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,320
No.

524
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:43,880
No.

525
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:43,900
No.

526
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,180
No.

527
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,560
Look at the slag tights in this place.

528
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,340
Look at this.

529
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,540
It's a secret ice cave.

530
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,940
We have our proton shirts up.

531
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,460
Yeah, there's...

532
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,220
Besides, we're friends.

533
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:52,580
I mean...

534
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,960
You want to load up that proton?

535
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,820
The show assumes the position of familiarity.

536
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,620
Yep.

537
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,280
We will now have to...

538
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,960
...fire the...

539
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,360
...proton pill.

540
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,460
They can't escape the...

541
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:04,960
I think we better...

542
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,580
...put them on the...

543
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,960
Nothing to be alarmed of.

544
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,160
We're just experiencing minor technical difficulties with the space...

545
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,420
...ship.

546
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,260
Please remain calm.

547
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,420
Remain seated.

548
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,120
If you need help...

549
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,840
...waitress...

550
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,620
...someone will come and...

551
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,100
...hit you very hard.

552
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,440
Don't worry.

553
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,540
Everything's under...

554
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,620
...under control.

555
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,460
I think she's right.

556
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,120
Gobi?

557
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,240
Is that your hum?

558
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,000
Or is that my buzz?

559
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,020
That you love me?

560
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,800
Oh, okay.

561
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,620
That's right.

562
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,380
You got it.

563
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,560
Ooh.

564
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,260
Ooh.

565
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,680
And, uh...

566
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,040
In other news...

567
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,300
There will be a completely unjustifiable but brief war between the United States and the Middle East.

568
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,580
The anti-war resistance will be firmly orchestrated by the conspiracy.

569
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:23,520
Communism will collapse, even in Korea, when the Red Leaders finally understand Bob's deal.

570
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,360
And do you know what Bob's deal is, friends?

571
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,360
Well, good luck trying to figure it out from this particular show.

572
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,140
I just...

573
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,440
I don't know what it is myself.

574
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,000
It's...

575
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,000
But it's a beautiful thing.

576
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,780
Whatever it is, I don't know that we'll ever figure it out.

577
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,200
Not as well as the Baptists have figured it out.

578
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,160
According to...

579
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,940
According to this newspaper report here...

580
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,880
From the Dallas Morning News...

581
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,800
News...

582
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,820
Paper...

583
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,960
Uh...

584
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,820
Southern Baptist estimate of those headed to hell sparks fire...

585
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,160
Brimstone...

586
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,380
In Alabama.

587
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,340
Yes, Birmingham, Alabama.

588
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,660
God only knows how to get to heaven.

589
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:12,880
But the Southern Baptists estimate that 46.1% of people in Alabama risk going to hell.

590
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,160
Since the figure from church...

591
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,640
Research on potentially doomed souls was made public.

592
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,880
It is Baptists who are feeling the fire, however.

593
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,040
The Southern Baptist Convention's county-by-county breakdown of who's bound for heaven and who isn't...

594
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,540
Unless they're born again and accept Jesus Christ as their savior...

595
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,180
Hit the Birmingham News on September 5th.

596
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,400
It's been the buzz in some Alabama pews...

597
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,120
And some radio stations ever since.

598
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,320
Under the headline, Baptists Count the Lost...

599
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,900
The front page story included...

600
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:53,000
A detailed map and box listing the 1.8 million unsaved by county in precise percentages.

601
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,220
The Baptists said the numbers were only a guide on where to establish new churches and find more followers...

602
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,860
But some of the faithful...

603
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,220
Baptists as well as others are incensed.

604
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,840
The Southern Baptists have done such demographic research for years...

605
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,880
Said Martin King, a spokesman for the denomination...

606
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,100
Of the Atlanta-based Home Mission Board...

607
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,540
Which compiled the study and has national figures he would not disclose.

608
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,380
Mr. King added that the Baptists don't claim to be passing judgment.

609
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,480
We don't know who's lost and who's saved, he said.

610
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,380
All we know is that as we understand the doctrine of salvation...

611
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,960
A lot of people are lost.

612
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,220
Of course, they don't like hearing that they're not going to heaven.

613
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,880
The study...

614
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,860
The study took each county's population and subtracted from it membership of all churches.

615
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,340
After that, Baptist researchers used a secret formula to...

616
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,000
A secret formula, friends...

617
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,680
To estimate how many people from different denominations and faiths...

618
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,240
Were probably going to heaven.

619
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,080
Mr. King said estimates of the unsaved from other creeds...

620
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,140
Were based on how closely those groups' beliefs matched Southern Baptist doctrine.

621
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,880
The index, of course, applied the traditional Baptist view...

622
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,120
That Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and members of other non-Christian religions are not saved.

623
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:26,180
The paper said virtually everyone not belonging to a church congregation was counted among the lost.

624
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:32,160
The Reverend Thomas Raynor, pastor of the Green Valley Baptist Church in Hoover...

625
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,940
And the Mission Board's Alabama representative said he was amazed by the fun.

626
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,300
But it has a good motive behind it.

627
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,460
And that is not one of judging...

628
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,280
But of reaching.

629
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,480
Well, that's a great way to do it, Rev.

630
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,920
But, you know, I've got some sad news for those Baptists.

631
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:58,420
I'm afraid 46.1% is rather an optimistic number for who's going to be lost on Judgment Day.

632
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,880
I'm afraid that it's going to be a bit closer to the 99.999 mark...

633
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,260
Which is most...

634
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,320
Well, it's all humans.

635
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,380
And unfortunately, 90% of the subgeniuses...

636
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,760
Those who did not...

637
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,700
Indeed...

638
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,300
Uh...

639
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,180
Join the Church of the Subgenius properly.

640
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,640
With full dues.

641
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,780
Which we cannot tell you exactly on the air.

642
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,960
But we can tell you how to write for free information on how to be saved in Bob.

643
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,220
It should have to be saved not in Reverend Raynor or Dr. King, but in J.R. Bob Dobbs.

644
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,260
And that it would be...

645
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,060
Got that pencil ready?

646
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,880
Because, you know, if you send us a self-addressed stamped envelope...

647
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,740
And the accent is on stamp.

648
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,780
And the stamp is stamped, friends...

649
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,440
Why, be surprised what you can get.

650
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,280
And I'm going to give you that lovely number right now.

651
00:28:49,320 --> 00:29:00,520
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

652
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,940
Now you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour on Slack.

653
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,880
And we've been tonight because...

654
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,480
Well, I've been working on that book.

655
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,760
I finished the last chapters last week.

656
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,340
I did.

657
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,660
Of course, now I've got to start on the middle chapters.

658
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,140
We're working on...

659
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,240
We're working on Connie this week.

660
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,100
Heh heh heh heh.

661
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,320
Uh...

662
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,160
But, um...

663
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:31,740
And in such times as that, we like to throw together show attacks from barely screened tapes from other subgeniuses.

664
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,780
Yes, and those have included tonight...

665
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,240
Uh...

666
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,200
Oh...

667
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,380
Who has it...

668
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Who has it included tonight?

669
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:40,460


670
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,120
Um...

671
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:48,400
Well, we're playing lots and lots from the good Reverend Gobi's show up in Rochester, New York.

672
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,120
This is from a tape compiled by Bleepo Abernathy.

673
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,760
And it's been...

674
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,640
You know, we would have been running Gobi a long time ago, but we lost the first tape and we never got the other tapes.

675
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,420
But we...

676
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,400
Anyway, we got this one.

677
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,940
Also, early in the show, a little bit of Hub City spoke repair.

678
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,300
Uh...

679
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,420
We're playing a semi-newly discovered radio comedy group.

680
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,780
Um...

681
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,840
I don't know how to describe what it was that they were doing, but you did hear it.

682
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,920
Uh...

683
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,440
And the song about rock music, I believe, was Steve Stein.

684
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,880
A lot of our tapes aren't even labeled, friends.

685
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,940
You know, they get used once and the sweat rubs the labels off.

686
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,380
Um...

687
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:39,280
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave show percolating along in there with the...

688
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,700
With their evil callers.

689
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,240
And, as always, KPFA, uh...

690
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,860
Uh, show.

691
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,580
Show.

692
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,440
Uh, the...

693
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,240
Less than an...

694
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,880
Show.

695
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,340
More than an hour show with Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence in that case, I believe.

696
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,360
And, uh...

697
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,440
I, uh...

698
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:58,980
Uh...

699
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,560
Actually, I need to flip a tape over coming up here pretty soon.

700
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,780
And then we'll hear the most amazing rant by Little Gobi.

701
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,160
It, it...

702
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,000
Really, I was...

703
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,720
I was floored when I heard this, uh...

704
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,680
Seamless, uncut, and probably completely unscripted spew, um...

705
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,960
From the, the little but very powerful Gobi.

706
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,740
Thank you all.

707
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,220
Stand by, please.

708
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,340
In Dallas, Texas...

709
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,320
It appears as though something has happened.

710
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,580
Repent.

711
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,400
Else I will come against thee with my clenched fist.

712
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:46,200
And it is the fist which beareth many eyes and breatheth many breaths.

713
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,300
And this goes on...

714
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,040
For...

715
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,540
One, two, three, four...

716
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,940
For five more pages.

717
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,500
That was section one through...

718
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,520
Thirty-five.

719
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,120
And it goes up to...

720
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,020
One, twenty-six.

721
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,760
That was not...

722
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,600
I did not write that.

723
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,200
Those are not my words.

724
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,780
I, in no way, feel that way.

725
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,100
I, I certainly would never say that I myself am Jehovah One.

726
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,640
I'm not.

727
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,500
Okay?

728
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,820
And, like, I don't agree with anything.

729
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,180
Well, like, some things.

730
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,360
Like, you know, like the pink worms are the kind of base creatures, you know.

731
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,320
Um...

732
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,720
But, like, you know, like, I don't go along with, like, this whole, like, power trip that Jehovah One's on.

733
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,080
You know, he's, like, kinda totally, like, Mr. Swellhead.

734
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,340
I'm like, so cool!

735
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,560
You know, if you find out where the center of the universe is, hey, man, if you even ask where it is, I'll smash you.

736
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:36,900
I'll smash your ass.

737
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,980
You know, he's such a big dick.

738
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,940
He thinks he's so cool just because he, like, rules the universe or something.

739
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,600
You know, I bet he doesn't even rule the universe.

740
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,360
What do you want to bet he only rules the galaxy?

741
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,020
Yeah.

742
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,040
Yeah, Mr. Cool, Mr. Jehovah One only rules one galaxy.

743
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,220
God, out of, like, how many million?

744
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,900
And he thinks he can get off on, like, writing all these pre-scriptures and everything.

745
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,580
And saying all these these and thous and threatening to do everything.

746
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,260
And saying that he knows everything we do.

747
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,820
I mean, who is he?

748
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,760
God, he knows when you're sleeping.

749
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,980
He knows when you're awake.

750
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,620
He knows if you've been good or bad.

751
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,320
It should be good for good.

752
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,720
No, Jehovah One is not Santa Claus.

753
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,680
He's not nearly as cool as Santa Claus.

754
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,700
Maybe he's as cool as the Easter Bunny.

755
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,840
Because all the Easter Bunny does is, like, lay eggs and paint them.

756
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,620
That's probably all Jehovah One can do is lay eggs and paint them to be fancy colors.

757
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,080
Because he thinks he's so great.

758
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,620
But he's not.

759
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,660
He's just some puny little god.

760
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,280
That's all he is.

761
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,660
And we're so much better, aren't we, children?

762
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,560
Because we're real subgeniuses.

763
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,800
He's just some upper deity.

764
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,320
But we are subgeniuses.

765
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,580
We don't know anything at all.

766
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,460
Which makes us...

767
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,160
I mean, you can't even use the word superior.

768
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,320
I mean, that's like, that's got like too many syllables in it for our vocabulary.

769
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,900
That's how superior we are.

770
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,620
We are so superior we can't even use the word superior because it's below us.

771
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,900
Because it has too many syllables.

772
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,520
We are so stupid we go all the way around to genius.

773
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,440
You know how, like, everything's a circle, you know, like, stupid on the top and genius on the bottom?

774
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,200
We're so stupid we go past stupid all the way around back to genius.

775
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,780
That's how stupid we are.

776
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,360
We are so dumb.

777
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,680
The Oxford English Dictionary is like reading Dr. Seuss to us.

778
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,380
And the reason why we're so bored,

779
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,600
why you find so many bored subgeniuses and so many, you know, slackers,

780
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,020
and like, you know, beer drinking t-shirt wearing subgeniuses,

781
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,840
is because we can't find anything to stimulate our interests at all, except, you know, something.

782
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,300
But, where was I?

783
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:55,240
Oh, I got so sidetracked thinking about stimulation of interests.

784
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,520
Well, yes, anyways.

785
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,020
So, like, the Oxford English Dictionary, which for those of you who don't know,

786
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,580
it's like the, you know, for the word and, it's got like three letters.

787
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:04,580


788
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:04,580


789
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,120
It's got like 300 listings telling the first time anyone ever said the word and

790
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,440
and how it's been used, you know, every single time since then.

791
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,560
And if that is like Dr. Seuss to us, well, can you figure out how bored we are?

792
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,420
We have to read like, we have to raid scientific libraries just to have a little, you know,

793
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,420
reading on the bus to work, you know.

794
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,200
We don't even go to work, you know.

795
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,320
We can't even find jobs that are good enough.

796
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,640
It's terrible.

797
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,540
We're so stupid and we're so lazy.

798
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,080
God.

799
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,300
That's why we get so many checks in the mail.

800
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,740
Because we're so lazy.

801
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,900
We can't even work.

802
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,600
I mean, it's, some of us are so lazy that we actually do have jobs

803
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,020
because we can't make the effort to not have a job.

804
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,560
It almost takes too much effort to not work.

805
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,120
To like stay at home.

806
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,680
That's really actually quite hard.

807
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,000
You have to be really disciplined in order to stay at home and not work.

808
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,900
It's terrible.

809
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,180
Usually when we watch television or something, especially when it's an educational channel,

810
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,380
we have to call one of our, you know, big off-duty policeman friends over and strap us down,

811
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,420
you know, handcuff us to the chair so we'll watch TV.

812
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,740
It's like forced relaxation.

813
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,840
Because we're so lazy, it's almost impossible for us to relax.

814
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,220
I mean, we're dealing with all those checks that we're getting in the mail.

815
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,360
I mean, we, it's just, it's even hard enough to just like lift up the flap on the mailbox

816
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,020
that like strains our brains.

817
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,060
We can't understand the mechanical design of a mailbox.

818
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,460
Man, we can't even understand how stairs work.

819
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,940
I'm not talking about escalators.

820
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,880
I'm talking about stairs.

821
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,420
I haven't been able to walk up the front steps to my house since I was born.

822
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:50,120
I have to have somebody drag me up by my ponytail because I don't understand like, you know, gravity.

823
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,000
What is, it's just so weird, man.

824
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,340
Gravity? I don't understand it.

825
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,160
I don't believe in it.

826
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,940
That's another thing.

827
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,300
Subgenius, we don't believe in anything.

828
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,220
Gravity? Eh, no, I don't think so.

829
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,900
There's no such thing as gravity.

830
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Reality? Ah, no, wrong, eh.

831
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,880
No such thing as reality.

832
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,420
Let's see, what else don't we believe in?

833
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,920
We don't even believe in not believing in anything.

834
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,820
That's how stupid we are.

835
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,000
We actually think we can get away with not believing in not believing.

836
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,020
We, so therefore, we don't even exist.

837
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,060
So why are you listening to this show?

838
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,660
Because we don't really exist.

839
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,660
We're just a figment of your imagination.

840
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,940
Yeah, we're not really here.

841
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,000
You're not really listening.

842
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,580
You're not listening to us.

843
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,480
You just are, you have an active imagination and you think you're listening to us.

844
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,100
But you're not.

845
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,980
Stop it.

846
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,080
Stop hallucinating us.

847
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,800
This is terrible.

848
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:47,560
You're going to frighten all the people around you when you're laughing at these jokes that aren't really happening.

849
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,000
Except inside your own head.

850
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,840
I mean, where do you think you're hearing us from anyways?

851
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,220
A radio?

852
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah.

853
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,560
Those haven't even been invented yet.

854
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,540
Radios.

855
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,040
Who knows what a radio is?

856
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,900
It sounds like some kind of new shoe.

857
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,120
Some kind of like a sneaker or something.

858
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,960
The radio sneakers.

859
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,800
Maybe like radial tires or something.

860
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,560
Sorry.

861
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,720
I told you to stop.

862
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,760
What's wrong?

863
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,100
No, that's not a radio.

864
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:19,620
No.

865
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,880
There's nothing there.

866
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,320
You're pointing to thin air.

867
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,200
Stop it.

868
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,320
Geez.

869
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,640
You know, being hallucinations, being figments of other people's imagination is really difficult.

870
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,020
And it's hard.

871
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,920
And it takes a lot of time and a lot of practice.

872
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,440
Us subgeniuses have a really hard life being figments of other people's imagination.

873
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:45,180
You know, I had a lot of trouble getting this radio show, getting people to not be on the air at this time so that I could not be on the air either.

874
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,480
Do you know how hard it is to get things not done?

875
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,820
It's pretty easy to not get things done or to get things done, but to not, to, to get things not done, that's really hard.

876
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,820
You're not hearing anything right now.

877
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,740
I think something's wrong with you.

878
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,780
I don't think you're a subgenius.

879
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,220
If you're listening to something, you're, you're not a subgenius.

880
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:10,700
I don't know.

881
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,140
I don't know.

882
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,980
Maybe you've had a little bit too much of them peels of Bob.

883
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,560
Yes, the peels of Bob.

884
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,660
Which you can get if you join the Church of the Subgenius.

885
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,240
You put on a waiting list for the peels of Bob.

886
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,800
But then if you take too many of the peels of Bob, you'll end up thinking that you're actually listening to a radio show.

887
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,740
And even that, you know, listening to a show on a radio.

888
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,200
Ah, better watch out for them peels of Bob.

889
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,560
Man, they're really bad.

890
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,920
But how can you get on this waiting list for the peels of Bob?

891
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,980
You have to join the Church of the Subgenius.

892
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,860
And how do you do that?

893
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,940
To get the peels of Bob, to get the peels of Bob, you have to write.

894
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,820
Post office box.

895
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,300
807 Glen Rose, Texas.

896
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,840
76043.

897
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,380
Yes, that is the right address.

898
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,780
Ah, fooled you, haha.

899
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,500
No such thing as Texas.

900
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,400
Haha, haha.

901
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,800
No such thing as Texas.

902
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,700
There's no such thing as zip codes either.

903
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,900
How'd you invent such a crazy thing like that?

904
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,100
Zip codes.

905
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,520
How about those killer trucks?

906
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,420
Don't worry.

907
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,160
Without you to press play, there'd be no audio comics.

908
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,540
And now for Gypsy Psychic.

909
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,200
Gypsy Psychic's in hyperspace.

910
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,740
It's where he went once Wendy died.

911
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,320
Turns the hyperspace rig on on himself.

912
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,800
Pulled the trigger.

913
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,360
All around him, gray paste pulled through a blender.

914
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,480
Silent and forgetful.

915
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,640
He had no place to go when she died.

916
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,900
So what better way to find out?

917
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,240
Is hyperspace the same as death?

918
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,460
There's something happening here.

919
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,480
A separation into shapes.

920
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,620
Dark twisted girders growing skin and bone.

921
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,620
Plaster and paint like life run backwards from the grave.

922
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,100
Squaring out now, a rumble like trucks.

923
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,280
I'm not sure.

924
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,280


925
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,280


926
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,280


927
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,560
The lights come on.

928
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,160
And then an open space.

929
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,640
A room with a hideous smell like the smell of death.

930
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,220
Gypsy Psychic in hyperspace.

931
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,460
Forget the funeral.

932
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,460
I got to hear the tape.

933
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,860
Gypsy Psychic in hyperspace.

934
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,320
Offend your parents for just ten bucks.

935
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,160
It's a truck stop diner.

936
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,280
Name of the greasy time cafe.

937
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,420
There's an old woman there in a wheelchair.

938
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,760
Gyp starts to push the chair outside.

939
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,920
Down the street.

940
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,040
Like he's supposed to do.

941
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,160
But Gyp's tired.

942
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,040
He's getting weak.

943
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,280
He's getting older.

944
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,200
She's getting younger.

945
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,300
With a shock, Gyp is in shock.

946
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,360
Gyp realizes that it's Wendy in the chair.

947
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,780
But as he reaches his aching skeletal hand down to touch her hair,

948
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,260
everything starts to blur.

949
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,980
Heat and light.

950
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,440
Cold and emotionless air.

951
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,500
In hyperspace.

952
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,240
During hyperspace Fitnext is complying with mud.

953
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:15,240


954
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:15,240


955
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:15,300
Imprisonment.

956
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:15,900
She's torn to pieces.

957
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,620
She grinds her earn or brush her hair.

958
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,660
Hypie lectures.

959
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:19,880
Gypsy Psychic in hyperspace.

960
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:19,880


961
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:19,880


962
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:26,300
a day you must have theantech tasks.

963
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,300


964
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,300


965
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,300


966
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:27,720
Again, with a T wheel.

967
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,380
I don't care who I get along.

968
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,440
Metallic echoes travel down, down, down.

969
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,920
It was none of it real.

970
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,040
Like a dream.

971
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,480
Wendy is gone.

972
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:55,560
At the Belle de Canleview Memorial Hospital, an aged gypsy psychic begins in his hospital bed to die.

973
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,620
But is he really there?

974
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,720
Or just lost somewhere in hyperspace?

975
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:58,360
To be continued...

976
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,000
Dan Rhetoric.

977
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,780
And I forgot to bring the box with me, so I don't have his post office box.

978
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,100
But he has apparently been creating these audio comics.

979
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,220
And, uh, oh, what a show.

980
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,620
What an odd show this has turned out to be tonight.

981
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:26,900
With the long rant there by Little Goby, the she-chainer, as she was tonight.

982
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,220
All the stridest...

983
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,500
And, and what next?

984
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,660
Why...

985
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,840
Are you, are you a moron?

986
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,140
Is this a contemporaneous activity that's going on here, or is this something that happened three years ago?

987
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,140
I think he's a fluff chick.

988
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,820
He's not a fluff chick.

989
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,240
He's a full-blooded...

990
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,360
Did you see? Do you know why he's off the pajama girl?

991
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,700
You're not the wife of the pajama girl, but you have a...

992
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

993
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,600
I don't think I'm carrying chicks.

994
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

995
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,040
And you want to show us...

996
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,760
Don't, don't...

997
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,720
Don't, don't, don't, don't...

998
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,360
Come on!

999
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,140


1000
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,660
Jess!

1001
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,480
Jess!

1002
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,380
If you have any questions,

1003
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,860
you may call.

1004
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,540
Feel free

1005
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,540
at any time

1006
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,260
to make any calls at all.

1007
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,940
You can request whatever you want,

1008
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,240
but we probably won't play this

1009
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,260
because this is a religious show.

1010
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,300
You understand.

1011
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,280
I hope you understand

1012
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,260
this isn't just another music show.

1013
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,000
This isn't just another

1014
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,640
modern music and more show.

1015
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:13,940
No.

1016
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,380
This is a special show.

1017
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,780
A show

1018
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,180
who inspires

1019
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,140
young men

1020
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,420
and women everywhere

1021
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,440
to reach and stretch

1022
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,240
their minds

1023
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,280
to push

1024
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,780
forth those boundaries

1025
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,960
that the pinks and the conspiracy

1026
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,620
have set for us.

1027
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,840
To break through

1028
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,340
the plastic bag

1029
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,280
they try to put us in.

1030
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,420
And it's not just a plastic

1031
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,160
bag. It's a plastic

1032
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,340
bag with a twist tie

1033
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,580
around it.

1034
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,020
So we have to

1035
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,140
push and squeeze

1036
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,140
just like

1037
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,840
the twist tie

1038
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,680
strangles that plastic bag

1039
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,160
that the conspiracy has put us in.

1040
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,480
So does

1041
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,600
bad radio

1042
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,020
strangle us

1043
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,320
just like the twist tie

1044
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,580
that strangles us

1045
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,820
and the bag that the conspiracy has put us in.

1046
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,240
And you can

1047
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,000
be the big fingers of Bob.

1048
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:22,540
That.

1049
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,140
It takes off the twist tie.

1050
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:24,920
That detwist

1051
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,540
the twist tie.

1052
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,460
Yes, you can operate

1053
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,980
the big fingers of Bob.

1054
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,340
Or maybe the big fingers

1055
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,060
of Jehovah One.

1056
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,020
Maybe the big fingers

1057
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,600
of Wotan.

1058
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,220
Or Odin.

1059
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,220
Or you know

1060
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:34,380
Pan.

1061
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,100
Whoever you choose.

1062
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,840
You know those games

1063
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,820
at video arcades,

1064
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,460
the ones where

1065
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,460
you put a quarter in

1066
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,260
and you press the

1067
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:45,920
buttons and maneuver

1068
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,620
the little crane

1069
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,400
to pick up the

1070
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,480
stuffed animals?

1071
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,480
It's like that!

1072
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,420
But instead of

1073
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,480
putting a quarter in

1074
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,560
and maneuvering the buttons in the crane

1075
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,340
to pick up a stupid little stuffed animal.

1076
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,100
Of course, they always have, like, the gold watches.

1077
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,120
You know, that's what you really want.

1078
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,480
But you always end up getting, like, some stupid, like,

1079
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,060
little three-inch stuffed animal made out of, you know,

1080
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:10,320
strange leftover, I don't know, like, popcorn or something.

1081
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,140
But, see, instead of putting a quarter in,

1082
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,800
you just give us a little bit of your time,

1083
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,840
just a little bit of your brain cells,

1084
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:24,400
and just slide your brain cells in through that slot marked brain cells

1085
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,280
and maneuver those fingers of Bob

1086
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,600
so that you can detwist that twist tie

1087
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,140
and remove yourself from the plastic bag

1088
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,180
that the conspiracy has put you in.

1089
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,900
And if you're lucky, if you are true in your heart,

1090
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,520
then you will be able to maneuver the crane

1091
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:48,820
over the top of the crane.

1092
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:48,820


1093
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,680
And you will be able to maneuver the crane over to where the gold watch is,

1094
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,840
but instead of a gold watch, it will be slack.

1095
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,240
Yes, slack for you.

1096
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,000
You will get it, finally,

1097
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,640
just by giving us a little bit of your brain cells.

1098
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,960
That's all we ask for, just a little bit of your brain cells.

1099
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,380
That's not a lot.

1100
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,560
So this is the hour of slack.

1101
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,320
The hour of slack.

1102
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,800
That you're listening to, and you will be listening to

1103
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,760
until about one o'clock.

1104
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:18,780
So enjoy.

1105
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:18,980
Enjoy it.

1106
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:27,160
In a cafe windy Chicago

1107
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,340
Oh, oh

1108
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,860
What's up, boisterous New Year's party

1109
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,000
You should be able to do what makes you happy

1110
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,060
and get paid for it.

1111
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,760
Why else are we alive?

1112
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,580
Why do people have to work to make money

1113
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,240
so that they can do the things that they like?

1114
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,060
You should be able to work at things that you like

1115
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,460
so that you can constantly be doing things that you like,

1116
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,120
which is what I guess I'd do

1117
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,160
if I had money.

1118
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,320
Which I don't, but okay, alright.

1119
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,500
I suppose we come when any of you needs

1120
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,780
And ask as I do

1121
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:14,280
If the door exceeds that all those

1122
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,960
And I don't know what you need

1123
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:20,960


1124
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,820
And I'll be the one to knock on your door

1125
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,180
And I'll be the one to knock on your door

1126
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:34,980
And I'll be the one to knock on your door

1127
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,080
You can never leave

1128
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,380
Isn't it wonderful?

1129
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,700
O-Tare.

1130
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,800
But what do you think of all the Navajo people dying

1131
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,100
without, nobody can tell what they're dying of,

1132
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,000
and then like some of them just get well,

1133
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,280
and everybody else just dies?

1134
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,760
Have they taken their drums away?

1135
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,000
I don't know.

1136
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,040
I'm trying to set up this skinwalker stick

1137
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,120
that some sorcerer, and it could be the government

1138
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,600
for all we know, poisoning sheep and so forth.

1139
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,580
Maybe I could like donate them to them or something.

1140
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,380
What?

1141
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:05,640
Drums.

1142
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,960
You have drums?

1143
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,380
Yeah.

1144
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,000
Oh, they know them to chasm me.

1145
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,340
I want drums.

1146
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,600
Do you denote them as, uh,

1147
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:13,780
partial pot?

1148
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,000
Post.

1149
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,620
Cash on delivery to you.

1150
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,740
The denotation zone.

1151
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:17,320
Yeah.

1152
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,280
Denotation?

1153
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:18,820
Yeah.

1154
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,340
He was like...

1155
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:20,920
A denotation zone.

1156
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,300
It was the worst band of the 60.

1157
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,120
Denotation and the denotation zones.

1158
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:25,620
Yeah.

1159
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,000
Dino was, uh, real fat, remember?

1160
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,740
I try not to use too many denotation zones.

1161
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:31,980
Yeah.

1162
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,320
I think it would be wiser if you didn't.

1163
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,340
Because sometimes you get so vacuous and deep

1164
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,440
that you can't even clamber up a number

1165
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,760
or a denotation for anything.

1166
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,040
You can't get out of it sometimes.

1167
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,780
It's kind of like the doldrums.

1168
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,440
It's the...

1169
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,220
It is.

1170
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,100
It's like the doldrums.

1171
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,080
The box doldrums.

1172
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,940
And you better watch out

1173
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,420
if one of them cyclophaglottic pirates

1174
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,120
from the Barbados zones

1175
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,020
doesn't come out there

1176
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,300
and wheeze off with one ear on it

1177
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:54,980
rowing up.

1178
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,840
Come rowing up.

1179
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,340
Yeah.

1180
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,360
With a hearty har har.

1181
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,060
Your impotent men

1182
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,500
with their foolish wells

1183
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,460
cannot protect you

1184
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,100
from my power.

1185
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:07,380


1186
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,660
Second one.

1187
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:08,920
I don't know.

1188
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,360
I don't know.

1189
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,460
I don't know.

1190
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,060


1191
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:11,280
I don't know.

1192
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:11,780
I don't know.

1193
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,120
I don't know.

1194
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:12,380
I don't know.

1195
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:12,980
I don't know.

1196
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,420
I don't know.

1197
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:13,560
I don't know.

1198
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:13,580
I don't know.

1199
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,260
I don't know.

1200
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,160
And what next?

1201
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,960
Why?

1202
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,220
Well, it's sort of an anniversary,

1203
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,560
so I'm going to go ahead and do this.

1204
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,680
Now, ladies,

1205
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,100
I want you to listen

1206
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,380
to what his fingers are doing.

1207
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,000
Okay?

1208
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,160
Listen to...

1209
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,700
Just hold in your mind

1210
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,200
what his fingers are doing.

1211
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,340
I think you can just take it from there.

1212
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,940
Brother.

1213
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,520
Mm hmm.

1214
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:56,860
Mm hmm.

1215
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,120
Mm hmm.

1216
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,140
The-the-the...

1217
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:04,920
What?

1218
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,440
They sold out.

1219
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,000
Hmm?

1220
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,540
Mm hmm?

1221
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:11,660


1222
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,320
Mm hmm.

1223
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,360
Yes.

1224
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:13,360

1238
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,100
things he normally would never obey.

1239
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,600
Take this brick, Timothy, and throw it through that window.

1240
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,540
Ladies and gentlemen, messieurs

1241
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,240
and mesdames, mes

1242
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,640
dames et messieurs,

1243
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,180
little Timothy will now leap

1244
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,460
from the back of the syphilitic elephant

1245
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,460
in towards the puddle of

1246
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,380
poodle-piddle under a

1247
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,740
flaming arch.

1248
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,380
Now have a victory parade down

1249
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,720
the Champs-Élysées. Yeah, that's a great idea.

1250
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,380
And thus it was that a little nobody from Newark,

1251
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,300
New Jersey, attained the ultimate

1252
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,340
crown of fame, wealth, and

1253
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,300
riches. Soon Timothy

1254
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,960
is leading a small legion,

1255
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,120
a crowd of expected

1256
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,800
jugglers and

1257
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,120
do-evilers. Across the

1258
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,260
astonished face of Europe they marched,

1259
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,780
the iron dream

1260
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,420
given hideous reality.

1261
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,120
The octopus of evil reaches out

1262
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,180
across the world. Its tentacles

1263
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,780
ensnared every nation.

1264
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,340
Reaching beyond the Pacific,

1265
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,200
the Atlantic, even

1266
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,320
the North Pole, where it digs

1267
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,280
deep beneath the earthen crush

1268
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,100
to build its UFO base.

1269
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,080
While its huge cephalopod

1270
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,180
eyes strain through Earth's

1271
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,980
pitiful atmosphere into the endless

1272
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,540
reaches of outer space.

1273
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,140
Even the aliens begin to take notice

1274
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,160
of this strange phenomenon occurring on a

1275
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,200
neighboring planet. And wouldn't you?

1276
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,200
I think we must soon

1277
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,880
interfere with this

1278
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,240
earthen phenomenon.

1279
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,060
Well, uh, what would a robot

1280
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,680
know about the life

1281
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,180
below?

1282
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,660
Hal, who are you talking to?

1283
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,900
Oh, I see, you've got a face on Earth.

1284
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,700
Yeah, that's right, and as long as I don't move from this chair,

1285
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,860
I can keep talking indefinitely to this

1286
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,220
little voice from far away.

1287
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,020
I think you are right, Zabar.

1288
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,420
These strange, malevolent

1289
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,640
evil may soon

1290
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,360
span out across the universe

1291
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,000
unless we stop it soon.

1292
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,660
I'm fading fast. I've got scoppy fever

1293
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,300
and I've come down with a horrible

1294
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,920
case of the sniffles.

1295
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,160
But, you know...

1296
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:12,840
Well, you mean you...

1297
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,120
He's right, Zabar.

1298
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,060
Those strange bacterias in his nostrils

1299
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,020
may prove harmful to our alien

1300
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:20,640
scopers.

1301
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,380
But it is sweet unto the nostrils of the Lord.
