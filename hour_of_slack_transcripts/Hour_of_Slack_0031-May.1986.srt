the message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,440

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,460

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,480
hear

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,980
or think

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,400
what about slack

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,620
that's your key phrase

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,940
it will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,140
and now

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,620

38
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,540
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

39
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,780
Look, I know you people don't believe that.

41
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,600
Well, hi, it's Pastor Buck Naked over here again.

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,640
And that was...

43
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,220
Mr. Science?

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,140
On the radio there?

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,540
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

46
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,580
All right, well, we got one more hellacious subgenius radio ministry show for y'all tonight.

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,660
And tonight's topic...

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,340
Tonight's topic is going to be

49
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,500
your personal anti-conspiracy freak-outs you've done

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,480
or your close friends.

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,260
I'd like to stick with personal experience tonight.

52
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,200
For instance, I had some friends when I was a teenager

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,880
and they hauled this suitcase up to the second level of a mall with them

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,860
and they were overlooking a balcony that goes around this fountain.

55
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,100
And they put this dummy together and they throw it off the balcony and go,

56
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,340
Ah!

57
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,300
And so they got banned from the mall, but they didn't mind.

58
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,580
And Dr. Chaos is here with us.

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,720
Yeah.

60
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah.

61
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,660
He's got plenty of records queued up.

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
What do we got first?

63
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,920
We have a song by the Holy Model Rounders.

64
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,120
It's called Boobs A Lot.

65
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,780
Okay, well, we have...

66
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,780
Do you like boobs a lot?

67
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,020
Yes, I like boobs a lot.

68
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Boobs a lot, boobs a lot.

69
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,240
You gotta like boobs a lot.

70
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,340
Really like boobs a lot.

71
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,580
You gotta like boobs a lot.

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,800
Boobs a lot, boobs a lot.

73
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,900
You gotta like boobs a lot.

74
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,940
Down in the locker room, just three boys.

75
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,000
Beating down the line.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,220
Locker room with all that noise.

77
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,660
And you think, do you like boobs a lot?

78
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,900
You gotta like boobs a lot.

79
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,000
Boobs a lot, boobs a lot.

80
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,180
You gotta like boobs a lot.

81
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Do you wear your jock a lot?

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,340
Yes, I wear my jock a lot.

83
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,580
Got to wear your jock a lot.

84
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,680
Got to wear your jock a lot.

85
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,740
Jock-a-lot, jock-a-lot.

86
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,960
You gotta wear your jock a lot.

87
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,120
Got to wear your jock a lot.

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,220
You gotta wear your jock a lot.

89
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Down on the football, football field.

90
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,560
You never can tell where your heel can't wheel.

91
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,000
So you gotta wear your jock a lot.

92
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,700
I'm going to give you the phone numbers here.

93
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,840
Gotta wear your jock a lot, Joe.

94
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,020
If I had a long flag along.

95
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,660
823-7490, 823-8801, 823-8883.

96
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,540
That wasn't too bad.

97
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,760
I'm going to the phones.

98
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,600
Hello.

99
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,820
Yeah.

100
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,880
Fire away, dude.

101
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,380
Hey.

102
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,380
You know what?

103
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,360
You know, the person that stands for anti-conspiracy more than anybody else in my life, Mr. Rogers.

104
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,660
Well, come on.

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
Now, what has he done against the conspiracy?

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,480
A real freak-out thing.

107
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,760
Well, I mean, you know, he...

108
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,500
No, I'm talking about activism.

109
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,620
This isn't for humans.

110
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,740
Like, I think Mr. Rogers is a human person.

111
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,640
Like, I'm talking about weirdos.

112
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,340
I mean, this is a call-in for weirdos tonight.

113
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,080
You know who I'm challenging to call tonight?

114
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,700
Who?

115
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,580
That guy.

116
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:25,800
Who?

117
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,080
Who always calls us.

118
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
And always talks about his pee-pee.

119
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,800
Now...

120
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,560
Oh, not him.

121
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,100
Yeah.

122
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,160
No, I know he...

123
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,480
I know.

124
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,500
It's kind of a...

125
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,420
It's kind of...

126
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,060
It's kind of a...

127
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,780
A weirdo thing.

128
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,600
But I want him to...

129
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,920
Look, I don't want to hear about his pee-pee tonight because, I mean, hey, this is the radio, right?

130
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,460
Yeah.

131
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,920
I mean, you know around the house all I ever talk about is pee-pees and all that other stuff.

132
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,240
There's a lot and everything, right?

133
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,660
Yeah.

134
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,600
We got to, you know...

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,980
Anyway, so I want him to call, but, I mean, have you ever done anything to really freak him out?

136
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,220
To freak out the guy with the pee-pee?

137
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,240
Well...

138
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,020
Yeah, or anybody else?

139
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Anybody in the conspiracy?

140
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
Have you ever done anything like...

141
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,580
Doc, didn't you get a dog collar put on you and get walked around a mall?

142
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,740
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,840
Back when I was about 18.

144
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Back when I was about 18 years old.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
Hold on a second.

146
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,320
Let me catch this record.

147
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:37,080
Back when I was about 18 years old, I put on a spiked dog collar and had this chick walk me around a Valley View mall on a leash.

148
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,940
And we were having a lot of fun until the security guard comes along and says,

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,740
All right, what do y'all think you're doing?

150
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,160
Yeah, but people do that every day now.

151
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,840
This was back in 1978, my friend.

152
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,040
That was a big deal back then.

153
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,460
I don't think that you're right about this.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,060
And I don't mind a little controversy on my show.

155
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,240
I say that, you know, you've got to keep that thing going.

156
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,860
Well, I still think Mr. Rogers is anti-conspiracy.

157
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,500
Okay, well, thanks for your opinion.

158
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,340
By the way, did you like the Neagie stuff we were playing last week?

159
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:13,880
Yes.

160
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,680
Well, we're going to keep that in heavy rotation.

161
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,600
And I'd like to also hear from any of the callers, you know, if they're getting the stuff that I'm throwing at them right now about Neagie.

162
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:22,920
Okay.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,540
Well, if the guy with the pee-pee doesn't call, I'll call up later.

164
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,180
I'll call up later and pretend I'm the guy with the pee-pee.

165
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,240
Yeah, but don't say any real explicit words about your pee-pee.

166
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,840
Well, I know better than that.

167
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,700
Yeah, I know the law.

168
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,320
Okay.

169
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:35,880
Okay.

170
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,420
Yeah, we're not trying to get kicked off the air, but, you know, we don't mind talking about pee-pees as long as we don't get too graphic about it.

171
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,680
Okay, well, you know, Dr. Ruth is over, so we've got to have somebody to talk to about it, right?

172
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,020
Okay.

173
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,380
See you around, dude.

174
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,140
Bye.

175
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,380
Well, that opens up a line somewhere or other.

176
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,900
I think that was 8883.

177
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,780
And, uh...

178
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:00,700
Hello.

179
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,700
Hello, my friend. How are you?

180
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,700
Oh, you're back. Okay.

181
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,460
You're the one I wanted to hear from.

182
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,000
Am I the guy about the pee-pee?

183
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,040
Yeah, yeah, that's you.

184
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,560
I did not know if you were talking about me or not.

185
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,420
Oh, that's you, definitely.

186
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,320
Oh, really?

187
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:13,840
Yeah.

188
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,720
How are you tonight?

189
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,520
Excellent, man. Glad you called.

190
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,140
Why are you glad that I called? You want me to talk about my pee-pee?

191
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,200
No, not particularly.

192
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:21,900
Because I didn't think...

193
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,760
I wanted to hear something...

194
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,560
Hey, man.

195
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:24,880
What?

196
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,520
There is no doubt.

197
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,820
There is no doubt that you've got one of the...

198
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,840
Probably one of the biggest pee-pees in Radioland.

199
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,900
But I wanted to ask you a question.

200
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,520
I mean...

201
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,220
What is it, my friend?

202
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,880
Okay.

203
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,500
Yes.

204
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,940
Would you tell us something?

205
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,600
You don't have to make it too exact, like exactly where this was.

206
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,340
We don't want you to reveal the neighborhood that you're carrying this thing around in this stupid pee-pee.

207
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:50,340
But what I want to do is I want you to tell us some kind of thing, anti-conspiracy type freak-out.

208
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,400
I mean, just when you've given it to him, given him something so weird that nobody around you could handle it.

209
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,600
Well, the Russians wanted to use my pee-pee for something, but I did not let them.

210
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,300
For a nuclear bomb or something.

211
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,140
What do you think of Negi?

212
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,700
Negi?

213
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,400
Yeah, I know you were listening last week.

214
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,660
Is he related to Pat?

215
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:09,940
All right.

216
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,160
Well, I'm going to play a little bit about Negi right now.

217
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,400
Wait, wait, wait.

218
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

219
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,000
Wait a second.

220
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
I want to talk to you a couple of minutes, please.

221
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:17,800
Oh.

222
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,160
Please.

223
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,740
All right.

224
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,300
Okay.

225
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,340
Well, I tell you what.

226
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,780
Why don't you call back, listen to this, and give me a comment on it, okay?

227
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,200
Okay.

228
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,460
You ready?

229
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,340
So just...

230
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,000
We're going to...

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,520
Hang on.

232
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,060
I know you know the number, so you'll call back, okay?

233
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,800
I can trust you.

234
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,220
Wait, wait, wait a second, please.

235
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,020
You got a radio, don't you?

236
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
Wait, where is Doug?

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,240
Oh, Doug.

238
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,440
Where did he go?

239
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:36,820
Hmm.

240
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,100
Well, we're going to give you a hint about that tonight.

241
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,120
Oh.

242
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,800
Okay, dude?

243
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,380
Yeah.

244
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,800
But that is a mystery, isn't it?

245
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,200
It's starting to bother you, isn't it?

246
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,180
He's not with me tonight.

247
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,380
He was last night, not this night.

248
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,900
Okay.

249
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,580
Okay.

250
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,800
So we'll see you in a little while.

251
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,200
Call back.

252
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,700
Okay.

253
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:50,960
Okay.

254
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,080
And that opens up a line.

255
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,980
But right now, we're going to hear a little...

256
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,660
A little bit of...

257
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,380
A little bit more about Neegie.

258
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:03,080
And I wanted to make sure that you all really get your Neegie while I'm here behind the board.

259
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,240
And since that time...

260
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,180
Neegie has driven many away from the church.

261
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,220
Where is he, Neegie?

262
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,340
Neegie has sired many unpleasant deities.

263
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,540
Where is he?

264
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,060
Neegie has sired...

265
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,980
Neegie...

266
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,720
I had an ape in the palm of my hand and I blew it.

267
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,460
I blew it.

268
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,780
Oh, Neegie has sired thousands of what we call the Neegie.

269
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,540
Neegie.

270
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:37,540


271
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,360
He likes the warm weather.

272
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,640
Who then is this Neegie?

273
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,360
As Bob once said, if you have to ask, you'll never know.

274
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,820
This, the most hideously named of all demons,

275
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,560
he who named himself,

276
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,800
represents to many the unspeakable dark side of Bob.

277
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:09,360
Some theologians question whether Bob actually has a dark side.

278
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,380
Or whether Neegie is some malevolent manifestation of Oboe, the anti-Bob.

279
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,680
Most, however, agree that it doesn't matter.

280
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,480
To even speak of Neegie,

281
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,880
whose name can be spelled or pronounced,

282
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,080
18 different ways,

283
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,140
to even mention his name,

284
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,420
is to invite him into your life.

285
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,040
Now, we know that Neegie is not the Christian devil.

286
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,500
Neegie does not kill you or ruin your life.

287
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,640
He ruins your day, or your month, at most.

288
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,140
He does not try to steal your soul, only your sanity.

289
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,920
He does tempt you.

290
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,580
And he always wins.

291
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,840
He is the mischievous spirit, or Imp,

292
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,300
whose various names crop up in the legends of every uncivilized race dating back to antiquity.

293
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,740
Before subgenius, he was not known to any Western culture.

294
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,580
But his cruel capers can be read on the scrolls and hieroglyphs of the ancient Africans,

295
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,240
the ancient Native Americans,

296
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,320
the ancient Caucasians,

297
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,880
the ancient Aboriginals,

298
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,580
the modern Yetis.

299
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,560
Though Neegie is as old as man himself,

300
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,260
he is yet not of this earth,

301
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,820
but was vomited out of the nothingness of the inverted black hole of Gabri-gay-z-d-d.

302
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:46,160
He is a product of the negative backwards time stream spoken of in the prescriptions,

303
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,760
and he has in turn produced a veritable universe of lesser mal-aligned deities.

304
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,560
Though the universe is not of the same nature,

305
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,620
there is but one Bob,

306
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,680
one light streaming forth from earth.

307
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,320
There are countless demons and binding spirits.

308
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,540
The sinister forces of the Yakatizma,

309
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,960
the deathful sweetness of the fertility goddess Nunu, mother of Neegie,

310
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,640
and her twin sister, Marnini, sister and daughter of Neegie,

311
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,860
and the martyred Nini, son of Marnini and Neegie,

312
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,600
and the pink tennis shoe-shaped heliopters,

313
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,840
living beings with motors inside.

314
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,680
And the horrors of Mornonglyaks and the Diros from the Hollow Earth

315
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,360
and the tobacco demons and the green energy demons and the liquor demons,

316
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,740
and yes, even Gibrod-thran.

317
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,600
All these and more most stupidly named archetypes

318
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,780
from the danker recesses of man's mind

319
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,740
came spewing forth from the ark of Neegie once it was opened by a few doctors.

320
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,580
Doctors who dared to tamper with the dark,

321
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,620
with that which man was not meant to know.

322
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,600
Let us journey back in time then

323
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,740
to seek out the origins of Neegie,

324
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,400
as discovered by Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond,

325
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,500
as pursued relentlessly by Pope Sternokekever and St. Janer Hypercletes,

326
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,100
as sung about by Doctors for Bob and Doctors for Wotang

327
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,560
and Pastor Buck Nakey.

328
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,920
As truly known by lies and puzzling evidence,

329
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,680
as feared by reverence, hand bone and danger,

330
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,980
and as inflicted on every member of the human and subgenius races.

331
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,920
Neegie, where is he?

332
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,100
Neegie, where is you?

333
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,860
Neegie is not here yet.

334
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,420
Come with me.

335
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,420
Here is Neegie.

336
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,560
Oh, no, he is not here.

337
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,340
It is a little man.

338
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,100
You must now go down to Neegie.

339
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,420
Speak up.

340
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,620
I think my best friend, Alcaneth Neegie,

341
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,660
I think his soul has been sucked away by me.

342
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,880
I went over to his house last night.

343
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,240
He converted his bedroom into an opium den.

344
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,240
In the middle of it, he was sitting there,

345
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,900
cutting out two thousand aluminum foil paper dolls,

346
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:26,560
and on every paper doll, it had the word Bob written on it.

347
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,020
And he was eating the paper doll.

348
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,740
Sounds to me like you're...

349
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,900
Okay, friend, hold it.

350
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:34,980
Wait.

351
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,340
Listen to this.

352
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,460
If you see Bob, kill him.

353
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,920
Pills for Bob. Pills for Bob.

354
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,840
Okay.

355
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,400
Give me some of them pills, Bob.

356
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,140
Oh, God.

357
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,840
Well, what I think that is wrong with your friend is not Neegie.

358
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,060
He sounds like he's got a worse problem.

359
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,220
Oh, what's that?

360
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,420
The anti-Bob.

361
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,600
The anti-Bob.

362
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,160
What can I do about the anti-Bob?

363
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:10,560
Well, the only thing to do is to look at one of those negative images of Bob.

364
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,920
That's a negative of Bob.

365
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,960
But the neatest thing is when you look at the anti-Bob

366
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,380
and stare at him for a minute,

367
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,660
a while,

368
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,320
and then look at the clouds,

369
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,620
you can see Bob in the clouds.

370
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,780
Oh, okay.

371
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,280
And that would be the best thing for me to do,

372
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,520
is to take the light back in and burn out the anti-Bob.

373
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,180
I see.

374
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,060
Okay, but we're going to go back to the other callers now,

375
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,540
and we've got a little pee-pee controversy going on,

376
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,420
so we're going to go to line three next,

377
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,400
and then we're going to go to line two where Mr. Pee-pee is, okay?

378
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,140
Okay, thanks a lot.

379
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,760
All right, bye-bye.

380
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:42,900
Bye.

381
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,840
And that opens up 7490.

382
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,380
That's 8490.

383
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,360
8237490.

384
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,080
But we're going to go now to a man who doesn't like all this talk about pee-pees,

385
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,360
and he's got some good things to say to the radio ministry and our prayer family tonight.

386
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,860
Fire away, dude.

387
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,700
I can't stand it no more hearing about pee-pees.

388
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,700
All good men got good pee-pees.

389
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,460
All right.

390
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,400
Praise Bob.

391
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:10,940
Praise Bob.

392
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,260
What y'all been talking about that girl?

393
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,620
I used to date that girl.

394
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

395
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,180
I mean, she had a tongue on her like a lizard now.

396
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

397
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,140
And pee-pees.

398
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,020
I'm from Tennessee, and I'm going to tell you about pee-pee.

399
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,180
I pee-peed on the Jackson-Madison County, Tennessee Court Square back in 1970.

400
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:26,920
Yeah.

401
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,820
That's where Big Ed Jones is from.

402
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,320
Too tall.

403
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,140
Y'all know him?

404
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,800
Yeah.

405
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,500
Y'all know him?

406
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:32,900
Heck yeah.

407
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,040
He's mad now.

408
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,580
But now, I tell you, pee-pees, everybody's got a good pee-pee.

409
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,900
You ask any good little girl, she'll tell you.

410
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,300
All right, well, we're going to get to Mr. Pee-pee, and we'll get his reply to you.

411
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,480
He ain't got no pee-pee.

412
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,320
Oh, I see.

413
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,000
Hey, ask him how does he know that.

414
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,560
Well, you heard that, didn't you?

415
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,280
He asked the BAM squad to pee, I bet you.

416
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,740
Okay, well, thank you very much.

417
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,240
And I think, Mr. Pee-pee, you've angered someone, and we're going to get your reaction.

418
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,220
Well, what do you have to say about that?

419
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,160
He says you don't got one, and he also says all good men's got one.

420
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,280
So I think that you could read into that something.

421
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,760
What do you think?

422
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,760
That's because he bit it off, the jerk.

423
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
I could have killed him.

424
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,720
Oh, seriously?

425
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,860
Pee-pee-pee-pee.

426
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,860
He just said pee-pee-pee-pee.

427
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,440
Well, there you hear it, friends.

428
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,420
This is real controversy on the hour of slack tonight, and we're going to now go back to

429
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,300
the tape for just a moment.

430
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,620
Over my wife.

431
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,900
Got the blues, because Bob let that pickup run over my wife.

432
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,040
Over my wife.

433
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,380
Over my wife.

434
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,860
Hey, you got three points for hitting that hippie, girl.

435
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,740
Hey, there's a black cat that lives in the store now, and his name's Neegie, believe it or not.

436
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,260
Oh, no.

437
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,380
A black cat?

438
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,240
Yeah, and Neegie has swept Little Rock almost as hard as Bob has.

439
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,060
I'm not surprised.

440
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,920
Neegie is very nihilistic, you know?

441
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,440
Yeah.

442
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:15,160
It's a kind of a counterproductive thing to keep it from getting together totally, I think.

443
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,560
But when, yeah, Neegie does a lot of stuff.

444
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,640
Neegie is his own worst enemy.

445
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,980
Neegie does stuff like break three guitar strings at once when you're playing Doctors for Bob.

446
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,400
Yeah.

447
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,700
Or Neegie does things like...

448
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,840
What do y'all think of that kind of stuff?

449
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,800
We're going to go to the phone lines over here, and Doc Chaos has a little background music for us while we...

450
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,780
Before you're listening?

451
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:45,900
Whatever.

452
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:47,980
Hi.

453
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,140
Hello.

454
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,480
Got a good anti-conspiracy trick for you.

455
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,180
Thank goodness.

456
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,300
Hey, you know those very lifelike dolls you can get now?

457
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,860
They look just like little bitty babies?

458
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,140
Yeah.

459
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,920
Okay.

460
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,900
You get one of those.

461
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,680
You get a card seat.

462
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,000
A what?

463
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,980
A card seat.

464
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,400
What's a card seat?

465
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,760
You know, a card seat for little babies that you have to have required by law now.

466
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,380
Oh, a card seat.

467
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:14,700
Sure.

468
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:14,940
Yeah.

469
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,600
Oh, okay.

470
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:15,900
Good.

471
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,220
Okay.

472
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,060
I'm with you now.

473
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,500
Okay.

474
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,640
Like baby in car.

475
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,220
One of those signs, baby in car?

476
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:20,760
Yeah.

477
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,280
Right.

478
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,760
Okay.

479
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,780
You put the baby, the lifelike doll, in the car seat.

480
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,100
Get out on the loop and drive up next to a bus, right?

481
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,200
Uh-huh.

482
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,980
Then you start arguing with the baby.

483
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,100
Then you grab the baby by the foot and hang it out the car window and wave it as steeple

484
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,540
in the bus.

485
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:39,780
Cool.

486
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,100
Isn't it?

487
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,580
Yeah.

488
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:41,740
That's a good idea.

489
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:41,740


490
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:41,740


491
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:41,740


492
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:41,740


493
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:41,740


494
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:41,740


495
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:41,900
That's right.

496
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,620
You know, there's some variants, not Cabbage Patch dolls, but they're kind of like a version

497
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,500
of Cabbage Patch or something, and they look a lot like babies.

498
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,160
Oh, yeah.

499
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,800
And you could really probably pull some stuff.

500
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,480
You know, now, Steve Martin did something that I thought was real interesting.

501
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,200
On his movie, The Jerk, he had these, you know, he's a juggler, right?

502
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,620
Yeah.

503
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:02,980
Okay.

504
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,200
Well, he did this thing called cat juggling.

505
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,540
He took these little kittens and he shows you these kittens on this cheap little .

506
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,620
Long known as the cause of Theodore's disease.

507
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,260
Running sores in athletes' feet.

508
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,840
Recently, this microscopic troublemaker has also been blamed in the nasty disease labeled

509
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:27,940
Hartman's Palsy, formerly Strassman's Syndrome, the only cure for which is death.

510
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,300
I'll answer any questions, dear friends.

511
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,380
Just write me if you still have the strength.

512
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,860
Until next week, this is Dr. Whiplash.

513
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,700
I'm out for lunch.

514
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,280
See you then, my son.

515
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,360
I thought they were.

516
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,760
Oh, no.

517
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,680
I know one who is as brave as any human being.

518
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,600
I'd like to meet this man and smoke with him.

519
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,760
Bob started the church about, oh, 20 or 30 years ago.

520
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,020
And we've got a picture of him here.

521
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
We'll hold it up so everybody on the radio can see him.

522
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,540
Hold it up to the left part of the radio.

600
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,260
tokyo japan yes i've finally made it here to the island of slack or at least

601
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,080
seems like an island of slack i'm not sure if it's a good idea to do that but i'm going to do it

602
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,260
here in the middle of the island of slack here compared to new york city which was my last come

603
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:50,460
on ivan it new york friends is the anti-slack pit of hell compared to this incredible what about

604
00:29:50,460 --> 00:30:00,040
dallas oh it's it's a humbling to be in a country more advanced than america except in their toilets

605
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:07,820
i'm uh sad to say but it's true the japanese have succeeded in becoming i think more american

606
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,840
than uh

607
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:16,200
we americans uh their pursuit of slack as evidenced by everything around me especially the uh porno

608
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:23,300
theater across the street featuring what they call soft women you mean extra fat right soft is

609
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:31,160
getting big yeah japan one might say in more ways than one uh if anything here pursuit of slack

610
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:38,080
if far out distance is anything we have had to offer for a while boy it's windy they got more

611
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,080
slack here they got more slack they got more slack they got more slack they got more slack

612
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:46,120
more slack um i think the trouble is these people seem to have to work even harder than we americans

613
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:52,740
do that's a good point i guess in a way it's it may be false slack just as as bad as anything we

614
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,280
have that's true if you do if you work for it friends there's still hope i think because i'm

00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,440
you know where it is

639
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,540
deep as you know

640
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,280
we know our

641
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,960
so much we didn't have

642
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,080
trying to stay so dropped up in the air

643
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,140
we don't think about it

644
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,940
so much

645
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,160
I wouldn't go so far as to say so.

646
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,600
I frankly think you may be in it too deep to do otherwise yourself.

647
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,580
Woah, woah, woah, you catch me in your web of...

648
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,680

650
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,300
Woo, woo, woo, oh, oh oh, you can't take a pill from me.

651
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,940
For once, I'll comma ar мож,

652
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,400
more can take to make me whine

653
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:02,400


654
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,040
but as the dark nightب

655
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,680
and hate replace the one you're going to.

656
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,420
Woah, woah , oh oh,

658
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,280
This little thing called hate breeders are the misfits.

659
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:34,320
A little earlier in our program, we heard Fireside Theater doing a thing called Dr. Whiplash.

660
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:50,720
Dr. Whiplash.

661
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:50,720


662
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,380
Yeah. Hey, I did something anti-conspiracy one time.

663
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,120
This was before anybody else did this.

664
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,100
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to use the word pee-pee again.

665
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,240
Oh, use it. That's okay. Fire away, dude.

666
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,760
Okay. I pee-peed on the Alamo before Ozzy Osbourne did it.

667
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,320
Wow. Now, that's heavy.

668
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,120
Yeah. And I didn't get caught, unfortunately.

669
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,640
Well, that's not a freak out then, really. I mean, it's like sort of a private act of defiance.

670
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,160
Well, I mean, people saw me. I just didn't get caught by the, you know, conspiracy cops.

671
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,740
I get you. Okay. Well, that's smart, really.

672
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,440
Yeah. So...

673
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,180
You don't want to martyr yourself for the cause you want to win, right?

674
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,980
That's right. You know, love to fight another day.

675
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,600
I respect that. I really do.

676
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,320
Niggy has a joke for you. Niggy wants me to tell you this joke.

677
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,180
Okay.

678
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,740
Oh, you know what you call two queers named Bob?

679
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:43,620
What?

680
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,580
Oral Roberts.

681
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,340
I think you better suck my soul for that one.

682
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,400
Well, that opened up a line.

683
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,640
We're gonna burn out the banks of the devil.

684
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,280
We're gonna root him out. Burn out the hate.

685
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,820
Burn out the radiation. Burn out the fire.

686
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,380
These words may be harsh.

687
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:21,800
They may not go down well on the polished ears of the rationalists, the modernists,

688
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,260
those who wish to see proof of Bob.

689
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,380
But I don't care what they say. I'll keep preaching.

690
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,600
If ye go down, pull them with you.

691
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,100
Yeah. Boy, these so-called...

692
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,980
This. This.

693
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,360
So-called civilization.

694
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,800
On the day that we finally realize that things are all backwards

695
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,500
and we have slack without work and the promised kingdom of Bob Dobbs,

696
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,180
then perhaps we'll find the true civilization,

697
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,700
which needs not Xerox machines nor fancy coats and ties.

698
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,000
It doesn't have to have them. It can have them.

699
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,120
You can be civilized and you don't have to live in a cave.

700
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,800
But you're probably gonna be more civilized being one of these characters

701
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,740
than you are running around on this treadmill of false slack.

702
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,760
Oh, yes.

703
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,500
And look at the humans lining up for the slaughterhouse.

704
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,580
Oh, yes.

705
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,620
The harvest.

706
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,000
It's a squirting universe, friends.

707
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,560
And that's why we have to call for your help on the great new tabernacle.

708
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,320
We've only been in there a month, but it's going back into the hands of the conspiracy.

709
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,020
They're gonna turn it into a war game.

710
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,700
It's a new way of doing things.

711
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,360
It's a new way of doing things.

712
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,420
And I want you to know that you're gonna have to learn to do it.

713
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:39,420


714
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,480
Because the law says, the law says,

715
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,600
a subgenius can't achieve Scytor spasm with whatever it wants.

716
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,760
That's what the law says.

717
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,420
No subgenius can do anything it wants.

718
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,380
And they call this free land.

719
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,100
Well, my friend,

720
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,300
I've heard people say,

721
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,960
people call the subgenius church a joke.

722
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,500
But I have to wonder,

723
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,660
is the subgenius church a joke?

724
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,120
Or is this world a joke?

725
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,680
Bob Dobbs owns deed and title to the church.

726
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,360
But who owns deed and title to the world?

727
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,280
Not Bob yet.

728
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,040
Uh, no, I'm afraid not.

729
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,540
No, sir.

730
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,100
The conspiracy owns this world.

731
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,740
Those policemen on motorcycles,

732
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,640
they won't let me preach on car hoods downtown,

733
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,480
because they think I'm a crazy man or a drunk man.

734
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,620
And they got no reason to arrest me,

735
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,240
yet they would.

736
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,040
Because I'm free, free, free enough to rant to myself in public.

737
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,440
Because I come for Bob Dobbs,

738
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,320
against taxes, work, death, and premature immaculation.

739
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,480
Your mind has to be certified okay by them.

740
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:57,960
By them.

741
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,800
Thame.

742
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,120
Thame.

743
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,820
And oh, we hate thame.

744
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,560
They and their tools.

745
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,560
The tools of iniquity.

746
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,020
Not the tools of the preacher, nay,

747
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,880
not the tongue nor the other parts.

748
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,960
But tools of false slack,

749
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,440
dangled forever in front of you like that raise right around the corner,

750
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,100
or like that rat swimming in poison cheese.

751
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:27,200
And so, we find that as my time is running out,

752
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,240
and it's sad that we only have 15 minutes on each broadcast,

753
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,040
but it all balances out in one great religious,

754
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,840
er, urge,

755
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,820
uh,

756
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,580
great religious.

757
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,240
Okay, that's enough.

758
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:37,920
That's enough.

759
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,240
That's enough.

760
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,400
Holy heck.

761
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,980
You're on the air.

762
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,800
Hello.

763
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,860
Yeah, go ahead and tell us your story.

764
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,480
We have another PP call.

765
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,100
Oh, squirting universe.

766
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,340
Squirting universe.

767
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,200
Okay, let's hear it.

768
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,420
That is correct.

769
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,060
Okay, here in my hometown of Mesquite,

770
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,920
back when I was a young and naive teenager, I was 17.

771
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,520
All right.

772
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,620
The mayor of Mesquite.

773
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,280
Mesquite used to live down the street from us.

774
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,920
And I just, out of a sudden urge,

775
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,620
decided that I needed to pee on this guy's front doorstep.

776
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,320
And I was arrested for this,

777
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:27,540
and I was thrown out into a world without slack for the last 12 years.

778
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,580
And so now I'm 29,

779
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,540
and now I'm finally being brought back.

780
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,420
And you have no idea how much the subgenius church is helping me.

781
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,080
Helping me regain.

782
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,540
Praise Bob.

783
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,820
Praise Bob.

784
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,200
Bob, I want to reach out to you in the name of our prayer family.

785
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,380
I want to reach out to you in the name of our prayer family tonight.

786
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,120
Yes.

787
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,500
And I want to touch this man's,

788
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,360
touch this man's PP with the love of Bob.

789
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,980
Would you please touch my PP?

790
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,420
No, only Bob will touch your PP.

791
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,280
I can't do it.

792
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,100
I'm only a minister.

793
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,080
Oh.

794
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,620
But Bob, touch this man's PP.

795
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:03,620


796
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:08,060
And make his life a real experience.

797
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,580
And give him the courage to pee freely.

798
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,200
Let the pee dribble down his leg.

799
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,940
Be a natural man like you, Bob.

800
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,760
Who needs a toilet?

801
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,980
Who needs it, right?

802
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:19,780
Right.

803
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,120
Right, friends?

804
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:20,900
You're free!

805
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,420
You're free, brother!

806
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,880
Praise Bob.

807
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,160
Praise Bob.

808
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

809
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,560
Well, that opens up a line.

810
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,600
And we're ready to go.

811
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:33,600


812
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:33,680
We're...

813
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,640
That's what...

814
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,040
You know, friends, that's what the Hour of Slack's all about.

815
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,720
And I want you to keep pouring your money in.

816
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,360
I want you to take a funnel, put all your money in it,

817
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,380
and pour every cent into Hour of Slack Radio Ministry.

818
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,280
And you know why?

819
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,560
It's because of the power!

820
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,700
It ain't the money, friends.

821
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,500
It's the power!

822
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,060
Yeah!

823
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,720
Hey, I mean, we can...

824
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,240
We can literally listen to whatever we want to listen to.

825
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,380
Now, here's a tape sent to me by the First Church of Mr. Science.

826
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,440
They made our introduction that we keep playing at the beginning of every show.

827
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,180
And I kind of like this little thing they do here.

828
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,760
We're going to go back to the callers in just a moment, give you the feeling of this piece.

829
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:09,540
Yeah!

830
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:18,960
Yeah!

Really enjoyed playing with your minds tonight.

844
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,660
We'll do it again next week.

845
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:56,880
We'll do it again next week.
