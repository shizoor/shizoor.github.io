1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,880
Oh, my Lord!

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, I want to make absolutely clear that I'm in no way interested in the contents of your tights.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,700
You might be, my Lord, if you knew what I kept in them.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,720
Uh, I've learned it myself, Bob, that I know what a gentleman keeps in his tights. Thank you very much.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,540
But, my Lord, I have a great secret.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,560
What?

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,260
Prepare to be amazed.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,060
Oh, no, you haven't got one of those birthmarks shaped like a banana, have you?

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,500
No.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,060
Or a tattoo saying, get it here?

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,260
No.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,200
Oh, God, you've got one of those belly buttons that sticks outwards, haven't you?

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,480
No, my Lord.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,080
Well, what can it possibly be?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,680
The Self Genius Hour of Swag.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,040
Ah, good Lord.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,900
I find you curiously pleasant.

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,560
I'm in company, Bob.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:11,100
Yes, friends, like last time, as X Day gets closer, I have less and less time to put into the kind of dense hours of slack we're known for, if you're knowing about it at all.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:20,760
And our options in such cramped times are reruns or uncut live shows at WCSB, which means actually going to the station.

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,120
Or, well, like we're doing this time, uncut other subgenius shows recorded elsewhere.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:40,280
In this case, it's Dr. Philodrummond and I appearing with other guests on Dr. Hal's two-hour show, the Ask Dr. Hal Show on Radio Valencia in San Francisco.

23
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,100
Best of all, with only a few edits, it was hour of slack ready, and that saves us a lot of time.

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,620
You will not believe the creature known as Zero Boy, who is another guest.

25
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,080
The music in the background right now is Boron Nozzle recorded live.

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,780
And now, back to the Ask Dr. Hal Show.

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,120
Don't toss and turn all night with spiders in your hair.

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,100
Thank you very much, Dr. Hal, for coming all the way to our country to be interviewed for this radio show.

29
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,360
Gosh, it's so wonderful to be here.

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm determined to represent my country.

31
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,680
My religion and my radio station.

32
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,740
All right.

33
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:46,020
First thing, I want to say that as an American, do you think that you'll ever be able to understand the plight of most of the people of the planet, which number America almost 13 to 1?

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,100
Probably not.

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,680
Okay, thank you.

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,880
That's all we need for that question.

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,040
Their problems are not mine.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,040
I really can't cure the problems of some foreigners on the planet.

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,640
I'm just going to try to get them to understand the plight of some of the people on the other side of the world.

40
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,300
Next question, please.

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,060
The next question I have has to deal with the fact that America is the largest polluter of the free world.

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,740
And we would like to know what you think about that.

43
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:18,860
Well, you know, in order to keep the financial intestines producing energy, we have to generate waste products.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,480
And that's why we're advancing to higher grade plutonium this year.

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,820
My next question is about the sexuality of dinosaurs.

46
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,600
What do you think dinosaurs were thinking when they were reproducing?

47
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,500
Was there a pleasure aspect to this?

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,860
They were thinking most amorous thoughts, of course.

49
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:53,640
Yes, they were enjoying themselves as one can hardly imagine if one only weighs several stone.

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,460
But if you weigh 82 pounds, you can imagine how much you weigh.

51
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,460


52
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,340
If you weigh 80 tons, your orgasm will be proportionately increased.

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,800
Now, I have another question.

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,620
It's about the thorough recesses of the mind.

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:17,400
Let's go back deeply for a moment and think about that perhaps people who are reproducing at this point in the planet,

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:25,440
are they being selfish or do you think it is part of the natural progress of what is happening?

57
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,440


58
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,400
Do you know whatmoi mean?

59
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,300
craftsmanship ofgiois mind are the foundational 00.

60
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,580
And aviation mechanics can beocaphoria,

61
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:44,580


62
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:44,580


63
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:44,580


64
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:44,880
are children's luck.

65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:44,880


66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,380
and humans with people with bsad ibis requirements their happy lives in the firm.

67
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,020
The mission that I progress is to build the standing wreck to whiskey.

68
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,420
And Sweden is giving me the real signs that there's good

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,760
This is great.

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,780
Yes, of course. It's wonderful to be here.

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
Don't blow it, you know.

72
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,640
The courtiers are all watching us,

73
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,180
and we've got to make a good impression at court here.

74
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,140
No problem. I'm the king. No problem.

75
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,200
Lord Squanderfield.

76
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,900
I am founding you.

77
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,480
And Bishop Westchester.

78
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,820
Hello.

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm diddling a chicken with a chicken feather.

80
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,420
For the waters, my lord.

81
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,540
I said, do you come here for the waters, my lord?

82
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,620
I say, where?

83
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,240
No, certainly.

84
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,120
Lord Squanderfield.

85
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,220
This way, gentlemen.

86
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,460
We are having parquet in the margarine room.

87
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,700
Yes, parquet in the margarine room.

88
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,020
My favorite margarine.

89
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,260
I remember this from my childhood.

90
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,380
Well, we're all going to meet the king.

91
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,400
And, you know, as great and as glorious

92
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,660
as his majesty is, and the sunlight,

93
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,260
it's shining over the benevolence of his reign in this realm.

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,660
There is one problem, which is that he can't eat his meat

95
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,620
while it's hot, because he's got so many courtiers

96
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,320
to carry it to him.

97
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,760
I cannot eat my meat while it's hot.

98
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,680
By the time it gets to his majesty, it is cold,

99
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,820
and so the scurviest cook in his kitchen gets his meat hot,

100
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,640
but his majesty does not.

101
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,420
Oh!

102
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:22,700
Oh!

103
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,860
You have a bit of snuff.

104
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,640
Just a bit of the old snuff.

105
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,020
The snuff, I say.

106
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,500
That snuff is enough.

107
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,080
Not strictly speaking, up to snuff.

108
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,300
Oh, there you go, sir.

109
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,040
Oh, yes.

110
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:38,940
No.

111
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,900
Oh, no.

112
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,680
Try a bit of this metaphysical tobacco.

113
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,660
Stop that.

114
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,540
Fetched from far Morocco.

115
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,300
Thy rich perfume exhales the room,

116
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,200
oh, metaphysical tobacco.

117
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,100
Oh.

118
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,140
Oh.

119
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,100
You, obviously.

120
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,620
You are the ambassador of England, Dr. Halbert.

121
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,960
I was sent here by my sovereign,

122
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,720
and I will attempt to represent him to the best of my ability.

123
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,380
I was wondering what you are hiding

124
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,160
under that very big pair of pants of yours.

125
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,120
Why, nothing.

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,820
C'est la mode.

127
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,800
No fashion dictates that I wear such exaggerated pantaloons.

128
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,780
What is this I've found?

129
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,540
It is merely a fashion of the time, I assure you.

130
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,540
A fashion of the time?

131
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:22,780
No.

132
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,140
I'll have a long time checking out

133
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,700
your fashion.

134
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,980
My dear sir, I do not dictate these things.

135
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,180
Dictate?

136
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,500
Oh.

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,760
You are making so much out of whole clothes.

138
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:33,940
It's a dick.

139
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,220
It's a dick.

140
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,560
Listen, I was just wondering, what is this hiding in your pants now?

141
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,140
This happens to be my own personal doubloon changer.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,040
I can't do it on my own.

143
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,440
I was in humanities at college.

144
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,000
Humanities.

145
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,500
That is true.

146
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,660
My instructor was Dr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song.

147
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,240
All right.

148
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,680
Hal, you'll have to sing a song now.

149
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,460
And here it is.

150
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,240
I need you to sing this song, and it goes something like this.

151
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,000
No, not that one.

152
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,760
No, no, no, no.

153
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,360
Well, I had a dream.

154
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,120
A dream of yesterday.

155
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,700
You know, if you break my heart, I'll go.

156
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,020
And tomorrow.

157
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,780
But somehow.

158
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,220
But I'll be back again.

159
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,220
I got lost again in my dream.

160
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,200
In the deep of today.

161
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,680
That was sweet.

162
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,440
That really was.

163
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,500
The way you sent him off that way.

164
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,820
Well, I did what I could.

165
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,440
After all, am I not only one man?

166
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,540
I think so.

167
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,980
I think you're not only one man, but maybe two men.

168
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,580
No, don't confuse me.

169
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,020
You could be three men.

170
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,520
I could be a free man if I chose.

171
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,440
You could be yourself and someone else.

172
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,140
But who would that be?

173
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
You can be what you won't.

174
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,920
In the army?

175
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,960
As Bob said.

176
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,980
All that I can be.

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,180
You can be what you will not be.

178
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes, but you will not.

179
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,640
That's what religion is all about.

180
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,720
You can be what you will not be.

181
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,700
Yes, well, you can in the sweet by and by where there's pie in the sky, but...

182
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,560
No, I mean now.

183
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,640
Right now.

184
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,800
Yes, you're offering what no one ever has been able to...

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,780
I've become a grinning fool who thinks he can do no wrong.

186
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
I already am.

187
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,260
Because his every move is guided by the hand of some superior great wise force.

188
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,600
Sure, everything I do is on the QT because I do it, see?

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,900
Do you have green lipstick on?

190
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,740
Yes.

191
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,660
And I admit.

192
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,980
Yes, I got this at Walgreens.

193
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,700
What is the deal with that green lipstick?

194
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,820
It's just, you know, kids like it.

195
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,560
They think I'm cool.

196
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm trying to look young.

197
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,360
That's why I shaved all my hair off and got the tattoos and the nose ring and everything.

198
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,380
The tattoos, eh?

199
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,200
Well, I...

200
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,520
Yeah, see?

201
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:50,780
I'm not...

202
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,940
I'm just trying to look cool.

203
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,400
I guess that's not for everyone.

204
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,520
I think there's actually beer in this doctor now.

205
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,140
You know, if you're 57 years old and you do all the fads that young people do, that makes you look young.

206
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,900
I think this really, really, really contains real beer.

207
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,580
Reverend Stanger leaning on my leg very closely.

208
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:05,840
Tom Savini.

209
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,260
Tom Savini.

210
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,200
It's very, very...

211
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,540
Well done.

212
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,660
Yeah, he's well done.

213
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,140
That leaning you're doing is just really getting to me.

214
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,200
I was digging my elbow into Philo's leg because of the tight quarters here, and it was hurting him.

215
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,320
Now, now.

216
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,120
Gentlemen.

217
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,700
That's humorous.

218
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,460
Gentlemen, please.

219
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,020
Please.

220
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,400
That's humorous.

221
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,320
Hurting a man.

222
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,160
That's a humorous...

223
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,240
He's hurting my tight pants.

224
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,620
That's funny.

225
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,680
Radius and an ulna.

226
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,400
The pain of others.

227
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,180
That's funny.

228
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,360
It was hurting my pants.

229
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,660
I'm completely impervious to physical pain except my own.

230
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,560
Oh, somebody's calling.

231
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:34,960
Somebody's calling.

232
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,780
That's inside your head, Hal.

233
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,760
Don't, don't, don't.

234
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,660
Someone's calling.

235
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,820
No, they're calling.

236
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,080
You're just imagining it.

237
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,020
There's somebody calling.

238
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,980
You're right.

239
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,780
There is no...

240
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,080
But, no.

241
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,460
Well, what do you call that?

242
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,640
Come on.

243
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,380
I ain't hallucinating here.

244
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
You probably aren't on the air.

245
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,140
I call it a cruel, cruel hoax.

246
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,440
Hello.

247
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,220
Speak.

248
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,460
Speak.

249
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,180
Speak, speak, ye fearful guest, who, if by...

250
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,720
Take him out!

251
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,680
Hello?

252
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,820
...hallow breasts still in rude armor...

253
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,660
There he is.

254
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,960
There he is.

255
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,820
...come to don't you.

256
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,160
Hello.

257
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,360
Hi.

258
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,140
I hear you.

259
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,220
Hello.

260
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,160
Hello.

261
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,440
You're not on the air.

262
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,260
Yes, I am.

263
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,200
I can hear you.

264
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,680
I hear my voice on the air.

265
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,720
It's a cute little girl.

266
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,760
I hear his voice.

267
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,280
How are you?

268
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,740
On the air.

269
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,260
Her voice.

270
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,780
You do not.

271
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,360
Yes, I am.

272
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:19,640
Yes, I do.

273
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,280
I hear you.

274
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,880
What's your name?

275
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,620
These are the demons of the sand dunes...

276
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,040
No, no, no.

277
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,880
Dr. Howell, I can hear the calling.

278
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,520
...calling you out into the endless desert.

279
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,280
They want you to become some sort of mummy out there.

280
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,040
I hear the calling, Dr. Howell.

281
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,060
Do not pay attention to those voices.

282
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,200
How long have you been out here, Howell?

283
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,800
Far too long, but thank heaven...

284
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Is that a hawk flying above us or some sort of vulture?

285
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,720
A refreshing draft.

286
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,060
Oh, well, good for that draft.

287
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,420
For those who never drank a dram.

288
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,500
How many more miles do we have to go before we get to this damn treasure?

289
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,180
Well, that depends on...

290
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
He lost the map!

291
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,200
He lost the map again.

292
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,680
And the compass.

293
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,040
And the water purification.

294
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,200
And the water purification, but he has a beer.

295
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,980
It ain't even a beer.

296
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,240
And miles to go before we see it.

297
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,260
It's super sugary cider that's going to haunt me all the way to the Isles of Langerhans.

298
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,220
Wait, is that what I see?

299
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,860
A spy ahead of us?

300
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,020
An arched way in the sand?

301
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,100
Actually, it's not that bad.

302
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,880
It's only got 16 grams of carbohydrates.

303
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,620
Still...

304
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,140
The Isles of Langerhans.

305
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,900
Yes, I advise you all steer clear of those accursed isles.

306
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,260
Remember our camping trip years ago?

307
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,460
When we and Michael Pepe were out there and I was throwing down that lemonade.

308
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,860
The very stuff that you're talking about now.

309
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
Yeah, that was a great camping trip.

310
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,780
It made me...

311
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,520
We just had that giant tarp and we all sort of slept on the giant tarp and rolled around on it all night.

312
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,420
You may have rolled on the tarp like some...

313
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,260
You rolled out of...

314
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,360
I remember that night you sort of rolled out of your sleeping bag and were...

315
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,760
Slept?

316
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,200
Well, that's how I rolled, man.

317
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,680
Half on the tarp.

318
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,220
That's just how I rolled.

319
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,720
That's the way you rolled.

320
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,080
Yeah, he rolled down the hill and into that ditch.

321
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,700
Dr. Hill, Dr. Howell.

322
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,200
Then the brand came and washed him down to the sea.

323
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,240
He rolled down to the sea.

324
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,460
That ditch was a big...

325
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,520
He woke up on an island far away.

326
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,220
He's got a big roll.

327
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,880
Thank God I was on Monster Island.

328
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,640
He was on a roll that night.

329
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,720
By the way, that new movie I think has dinosaurs or monsters in it.

330
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,420
What about the Mysterious Island?

331
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,200
It's out now.

332
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,760
Right now.

333
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,760
I don't have high hopes for that one.

334
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,080
Did you see that?

335
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,080
Starring Train.

336
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,660
Did you see that?

337
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:18,980
Train.

338
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,060
The rock Johnson.

339
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,820
The Nazi.

340
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,720
The new Nazi.

341
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,720
Same people.

342
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,660
A new Nazi?

343
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,840
The Nazis from behind the moon.

344
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,740
Nazis from the moon invade the earth.

345
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,480
Now the Nazis are mooning us?

346
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,960
When are those guys going to go away?

347
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,180
When are we going to be through with the damn Nazis?

348
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,000
I mean, it definitely looked totally over the top.

349
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,300
Being mooned by Nazis.

350
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,760
That's also happening in our national electoral politics.

351
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,180
It turns out that on the dark side of the moon, Nazis have been there since the 40s.

352
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,320
And they've built like a supersonic Nazi.

353
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,160
Like supersonic.

354
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,460
Nazi hell creatures.

355
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,260
That news has finally been released?

356
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,140
Only they're not.

357
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,120
I thought only Bob was allowed to speak.

358
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,640
Yes, I thought they came from the center of the earth.

359
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,960
They're going to make contact with their brothers in the center of the earth.

360
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,060
It's like that Cowboys and Aliens thing.

361
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,820
Why are they behind the moon now?

362
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,840
They're supposed to come from the hollow earth.

363
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,340
Well, they're going to make contact with their Nazi brothers in the hollow earth.

364
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,260
Actually, this is the time to interject.

365
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,060
They're trivializing fact is what they're doing.

366
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,200
The moon is hollow.

367
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,940
And we're exploring that with a special probe that NASA is sending there,

368
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,460
which is specifically to figure out just how hollow our satellite, the moon, is.

369
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,400
The moon, Dr. Howell, as you know, is in fact the skull of an ancient monster.

370
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,500
And at its center, there is still viable moisture at the so-called central sea.

371
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,920
Yes, the treasure, the DNA of that thing.

372
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,800
Journey to the center of the moon.

373
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:44,960
Um...

374
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,340
Uh-oh.

375
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,900
The huge god.

376
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,580
Occasionally visits solar systems in our neighborhood.

377
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,500
And it would be bad luck if it came to visit us because it's...

378
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,080
I mean, just think of like a centipede crawling around on an apple.

379
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,120
Pay no attention to the man.

380
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,600
It's a big stupid thing and it messes up the whole planet before it leaps off.

381
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,840
Well, they show up and immediately spray for tool users.

382
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:16,020
Uh, they can bury whole lands and countries in giant walls of earth and rock

383
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,880
as the brainless thing goes.

384
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,040
Goes by.

385
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,180
It's, uh, regrettable.

386
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,120
That's why you better be on Bob's team.

387
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,660
It's just a piece of space trash.

388
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,380
Bob's space...

389
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,500
It's a piece of galactic debris.

390
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,060
Bob made friends with them creatures and that's how you can be safe.

391
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,140
If you're Bob's friend, then you're a friend of those creatures.

392
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,960
The amusing thing is...

393
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,640
They won't kill you.

394
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,300
They'll take you off in their escape vessels.

395
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:35,780
Science...

396
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,020
You can have anything you want forever and ever.

397
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,960
...does not remove the terror of the gods.

398
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,420
If you only knew the malevolent blackness that is out there behind the stars, you would

399
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,880
laugh at the terror of the gods.

400
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:47,880


401
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:47,880


402
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:47,880


403
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:54,900
The idea that here on our planet of green trees and flowing water there was any recourse

404
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,500
to be had from the most malevolent and destructive principles in the universe, as epitomized in

405
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,680
my twelve-module course in Success in Sex and Real Estate.

406
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,700
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

407
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,400
They, they, they talk all about the Whore of Babylon, but they never talk about how

408
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,040
good-looking she is, now, do they?

409
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,900
She's kinda good-looking unless you look really closely, and then she's a penitent.

410
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:17,880
Oh, yeah.

411
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,640
I mean, that's the way, uh, they, she's pictured in the Jehovah's Witnesses...

412
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,260
...pouring into those rather skillfully produced...

413
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,260


414
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,840
They seem to suck me in.

415
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,480
...regular intelligence...

416
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,020
It was just the opposite of what I had in mind when I started out.

417
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,180
Now, now, don't worry.

418
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,540
Everything's going to be all right.

419
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,800
And then the next thing I woke up and I was married to her and she was making me run

420
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,900
a vacuum cleaner up...

421
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,120
...just fine.

422
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,140
...the living room floor.

423
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,700
It's okay.

424
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,120
...she made a mistake.

425
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,860
She made a mistake.

426
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,600
We need the dishes.

427
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,260
Okay, okay.

428
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,200
What do you mean?

429
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,300
You've never done the dishes.

430
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,240
Wait a minute, uh, where the hell am I?

431
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,420
What have you done to me, Doctor?

432
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,280
This is a place I often come to meditate.

433
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,060
You will come to know it well.

434
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,060
Well, why have you strapped me into this wall like this?

435
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,600
What are you gonna do with that thing?

436
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,000
The denizens of the deep must feed Mr. Blumzack.

437
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,360
No.

438
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,960
No, please, no.

439
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,800
They must eat...

440
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,180
No.

441
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:16,740
...to live.

442
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,860
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

443
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:17,860


444
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:17,860


445
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:17,860


446
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:17,860


447
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:17,860


448
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:17,860


449
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:17,860


450
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,700
Even...

451
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,640
...as...

452
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,220
...you and I...

453
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,460
No.

454
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,780
No, no.

455
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,500
Nooooo!

456
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,300
Nooooooooo!

457
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,380
Oh, this is terrible.

458
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,020
Terrible.

459
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,720
Nooooo!

460
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,120
It's...

461
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,880
It's terrible.

462
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,260
Really, truly terrible.

463
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,060
I do regret it.

464
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,280
I'm so sorry these measures...

465
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,660
These...

466
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,300
These measures were necessary.

467
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:39,940
I...

468
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,780
I...

469
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,940
I may have some slight...

470
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,700
...twin...

471
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,740
...skills...

472
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,060
...at...

473
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,460
...having performed...

474
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,100
Oh, my...

475
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,700
...god...

476
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:47,840
...I...

477
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:47,840


478
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:47,840


479
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,800
...to think of the indignities that a...

480
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,400
...a human body could suffer.

481
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,840
Well, I thought I had seen the light.

482
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,300
And now it's actually swelling up like some sort of insane pufferfish.

483
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,340
Good lord, look at the size of...

484
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm getting out of here.

485
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,660
Come this way, Hal, quickly!

486
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,420
I'm...

487
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,860
I can't get up.

488
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,600
Help!

489
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,820
I'm...

490
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:17,820


491
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:17,820


492
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:17,820


493
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,240
...guessing...

494
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,540
...the world...

495
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,960
Are you alright?

496
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,240
Oh, I'm asleep.

497
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,600
There's nothing to be afraid of.

498
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,280
I think you might...

499
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,100
Oh, dear me.

500
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,500
I think you might be in for a tough time.

501
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,280
Hark!

502
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,320


503
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,320


504
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,320


505
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,840
We have ne facial and a slow mutuality.

506
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,020
Aside, due to the dinner at 1985...

507
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,020


508
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,660
And they're now dropped without burning towards the dried ice!

509
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,420
Seems to be alive.

510
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,760
Sus lamp pieces and something like that?

511
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:47,820
Hustlers this year don't need mày-

512
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:47,820


513
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:47,820


514
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:47,820


515
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:47,820


516
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:47,820


517
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,580
plane over there. You do, thank

518
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,820
God, but do we have enough petrol to fly

519
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,320
her out? Uh, yes.

520
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,460
I was able to find a small

521
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,600
55-gallon drum

522
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,720
worth of petrol. It will get

523
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,100
us to the farthest edges of this

524
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,400
deadly valley. Relax, settle back, and enjoy

525
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,080
our feature presentation.

526
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,820
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

527
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,060
nothing can harm us.

528
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,660
We do what we can do

529
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,500
and what we must do.

530
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,620
To bring you award-winning radio.

531
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,200
Harry, Harry.

532
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:22,920
Daddy.

533
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,620
What is it, my dear? Mother, mother.

534
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,760
Why, when you knew perhaps this would

535
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,320
end up going the way it is going.

536
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,040
Send that child to bed.

537
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,900
You, sir, back in your bed or you'll have me to deal with.

538
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,800
Mother. Foolishness is bound

539
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,880
in the heart of a child, but the rod

540
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,640
of correction shall drive it from him.

541
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,780
Don't hit him, Harry, please, don't hit him.

542
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,560
The little swine. Where's my

543
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,760
father? I'll teach him

544
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,500
to usurp his place.

545
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,500
The linch of the wound

546
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,360
cleanses away the evil.

547
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,920
Now, my boy, have you been studying

548
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,740
your Euclid? Let me

549
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,500
hear your recitation.

550
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,920
Come, come, do not

551
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,780
stammer.

552
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,820
Have you played the poppin' jay

553
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,800
instead of attending

554
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,340
to your studies? You'll notice

555
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,580
ever since we put him in the

556
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
lock-up when he was found guilty

557
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,680
of abusing the child, he's just been talking

558
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,860
to the wall all day long as

559
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,580
if he's speaking to the child. I'll have my revenge on the

560
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,500
pack of you, I will.

561
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,380
For four years he's been in there.

562
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,600
Let's see if we can get him.

563
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,600
Sometimes he comes back into sanity.

564
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,140
Sometimes a thousand

565
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,580
twangling instruments about my ears.

566
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,600
And sometimes voices.

567
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,800
Halbert, can you hear me,

568
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,640
Halbert? You do not exist, sir.

569
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,700
You are a phantom. I'll open the

570
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,540
door, Halbert, and I'll let you out

571
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,820
into the corridor. Oh, you will? Okay, I take it all back.

572
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,520
If you'll be nice.

573
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
What do you want me to do?

574
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,120
All right.

575
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,320
Oh, hey!

576
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,320
This is, uh, Dr. Stang,

577
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,480
and this is Dr. Ha-Ha.

578
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,500
This is some vile hallucination. I refuse to believe

579
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,060
in the reality of these experiences.

580
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,420
As devilishly and real

581
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,000
as they look and feel.

582
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,680
Nurse, do you

583
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,420
think that, uh, he's

584
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,380
safe enough to allow

585
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,540
into the hallway? I'll never get

586
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,540
into that hallway. Probably not, from the looks

587
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,540
of the room. The dream is

588
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,440
that you're always trying to get there.

589
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,480
You'll never get there because that's not

590
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,280
what the dream is about. The dream is about the search.

591
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,500
Halbert. I'm never gonna get there, and you're

592
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,380
never gonna get there. You searched for a supersonic Nazi hellbreacher.

593
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,760
We're stuck here forever. Don't you understand?

594
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,420
Well, I'm not gonna do it. Tell me about your wife,

595
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,480
Halbert. I'm busting out of this.

596
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:29,580
Remember your poor wife?

597
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,380
What do you know about my wife?

598
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,520
How dare you mention my

599
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,440
wife? That's the weakest excuse

600
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,420
I've heard all day. Take it back, I tell you.

601
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,420
I think you'd best go back into

602
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,080
your cell, Halbert. Never!

603
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,920
Get back in there. Get back in there.

604
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,260
You swine! I'll be

605
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,340
revenged. Hey,

606
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,280
where'd you get that, Halbert?

607
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,440
That's a revolver. What are you doing with that?

608
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,620
Get against the wall.

609
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,340
You can't get away. Give me those keys,

610
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,680
please.

611
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,340
Alright.

612
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,580
I believe I'll take these.

613
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,280
Well, not before you take them

614
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,380
over my dead body!

615
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,340
I'm sorry. I had to

616
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,740
do it.

617
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,240
Yes, those shots are particularly painful.

618
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,740
Oh, look. There's a dead body there.

619
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,100
Yeah, look at that. And it says,

620
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,120
stinking up the place. Well, I gotta take

621
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,320
a powder, so, um,

622
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,580
let me tell you one and all.

623
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,860
You're a swell bunch of guys and gals.

624
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,820
I appreciate you coming by tonight.

625
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,620
I've got a gorgeous popsicle stand.

626
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,660
It reminds me

627
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,980
of my adventures with

628
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,300
Zero Boy in the Congo. Don't forget, leave no trace.

629
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,000
So long ago. You know, there are vast

630
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,120
stretches of unexplored

631
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,240
equatorial Africa, although we hardly

632
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,340
think so. Pack your trash there, fella.

633
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,220
Snooping eyes in the sky.

634
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,240
Take your junk with you. But much of...

635
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,080
of the Congo is simply uninhabitable

636
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,400
by man. Why you'd be devoured

637
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,000
by clouds of stinging

638
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,220
insects if you tried to go 25 feet.

639
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,700
And the heat often

640
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,980
gets up above 125.

641
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,220
Well, when you wrote the book,

642
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,780
um, Mr. Robinson,

643
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,300
you were in the Congo, and, uh...

644
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,760
I was searching for the lost

645
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,680
Apatosaurus.

646
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,220
Oh, there it goes.

647
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,220
I guess I don't have to search for it.

648
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,960
There it is.

649
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Okay, well, look at it go.

650
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,180
Well, that, uh, that just

651
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,120
took care of that. Um, uh, what he said

652
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,000
was is, uh, it's gonna cost, uh,

653
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,480
45 bucks, a case of beer,

654
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,920
and, uh, a color TV.

655
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,300
Do they think I am made of money?

656
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,260
Um, either that or they're gonna cut your head off

657
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,880
and shrink you down to a size of a fist.

658
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,920
Oh, I don't want that. No, no, no. I, I, I gotta

659
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,000
shrink back at home. Okay, I'll tell you

660
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,080
what I'm gonna do. They're planning on doing some shrinking

661
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,140
of their own, I believe. And it gave me a

662
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,740
shrinking feeling to see the glare

663
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,880
in their eyes as they stared

664
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,700
toward me and our well-fleshed

665
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,120
companions.

666
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,480
Yum, yum, eat him up.

667
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,820
Calm the old boy down. What's the word for friend?

668
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,940
Bala. Uh, no.

669
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,040
Kimo Sabe. Uh, Bala

670
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,400
Reri. Pasco!

671
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,140
Excuse me, sir, but, uh, I don't think

672
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,080
you understand. Uh, for some reason in your

673
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,880
head, it's a very typical colonial

674
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,580
white, uh, Caucasian

675
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,960
way of looking at it. It's a common mistake.

676
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,800
You somehow seem to think that we don't understand

677
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,940
English when, however, we've been a trading

678
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,900
society for thousands

679
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,640
of years. Well, dog, my cat.

680
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,840
I actually went to Harvard University, and

681
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,040
my brother over here, uh, you know,

682
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,600
graduated from Cambridge at 14.

683
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,620
People don't know that. It happens.

684
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, is my

685
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,040
countenance crimson?

686
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
It just, uh, shows to go, yeah.

687
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,720
All right, uh...

688
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,940
Dr. Hell, it's...

689
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,820
It's the phone. This is ecumenical

690
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,900
radio. It's the police this time. Are you kidding?

691
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,420
It's the phone police. Another

692
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,720
phony, phony, baloney phone? They've heard that you're not

693
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,740
taking calls, and they're... It is.

694
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,760
It's the phone, all right. I'm not taking

695
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,920
calls, but I'm gonna see who it is

696
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,440
unless it's that argumentative

697
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,040
Pete Goldie fellow. Hey, get that Pete Goldie

698
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,840
guy. If only this

699
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,860
would go over the radio the way it's supposed

700
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,600
to. Why do you suppose it does not?

701
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,820
Bad telepathy.

702
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,640
It's your show. Hello, are you there on the phone? Because it's your show,

703
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,740
Dr. Hell. When you call us,

704
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,680
yes, I'm right here, and I

705
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,700
am afraid you're not on the air.

706
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,860
Connie Dobbs?

707
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,800
Oh, no, this is terrible. I

708
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,700
wish I could put you on the air, but we are

709
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,840
having a malfunction. That's Connie Dobbs.

710
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,740
Hold the phone up close

711
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,860
to the mic and turn the volume

712
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
up real high. But you should whisper.

713
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,860
I think we've all, and everyone

714
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,020
in this room has had sex with her.

715
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,400
Give me a blessed moment.

716
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,460
It's Connie Dobbs.

717
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,400
I put you on the phone by holding

718
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,680
your phone.

719
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,400
To the microphone, and here we go.

720
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,040
Think about it, man.

721
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,460
I'm sorry.

722
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,780
The next voice you hear will be that of

723
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,020
Connie Dobbs, concert

724
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,800
of the E-pop, J.R.

725
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,680
Bob Dobbs.

726
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,540
Connie, are you with us?

727
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,980
You know what?

728
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,820
I think she rung off. I think she

729
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,840
hung up. There's no more

730
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,340
Connie Dobbs. No how.

731
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,780
I would like to take a moment to

732
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,560
remember what Connie meant to me.

733
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,660
Before that historic moment

734
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,860
when she was torn apart

735
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,140
from us on that show,

736
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,520
that fateful day. It was.

737
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,940
Yes, of what's the day's date again?

738
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,840
That's a good one. I wish I could

739
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,920
tell you. It's the

740
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,540
10th of February. I'll never

741
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,160
forget that day. Or was.

742
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,420
I'll never forget. It's what happened when

743
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,860
I cried for at least 20 minutes

744
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,480
after she was ripped off the line.

745
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,440
In just a few minutes,

746
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,540
it's going to be to the next day when

747
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,800
the whole Ask Doctor,

748
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,520
Hal, so Miguel, has to

749
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,760
fall into place. All the ducks

750
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,580
have to be in a row. So are you going to go home and

751
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,380
go to sleep, Dr. Hal?

752
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,620
I haven't been able to do that all week, but

753
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,780
maybe I'm going to get some hours

754
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,940
of slumbering and snoozing.

755
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,460
Behold,

756
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,580
he that keepeth Israel shall

757
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,940
neither slumber nor sleep.

758
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,620
Let's all hear our snores, eh?

759
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:09,980
Snores?

760
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,660
Here in beautiful Snorewood,

761
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,920
California, where

762
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,540
saw through logs

763
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,840
all the night long.

764
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,920
You're going to lounge in the bosom of Morpheus.

765
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,520
A sleep apnea-induced cloud.

766
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,680
When you're laying there in Morpheus' bosom,

767
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,560
don't you be

768
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,620
fiddling with those nipples now?

769
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,260
Let me hear your snore, Hal.

770
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,500
Morpheus, you don't want to get

771
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,720
Morpheus sexually excited.

772
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,280
No, there's much complaining about my snoring.

773
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,400
People are incredibly intolerant

774
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,480
of my snoring. I don't know what's the matter with them.

775
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,460
Let me hear another snoring.

776
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,480
I slept in the same...

777
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,700
I slept...

778
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,240
God! Good God, Ben!

779
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,460
That creature is...

780
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,420
That was amazing.

781
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,000
Alright, alright, alright.

782
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,960
I was dreaming of the nightingale.

783
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,740
The beautiful song of Philomel.

784
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,520
With lullaby, sweet lullaby.

785
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Hal, have you ever had a loved one

786
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,240
record your snore and play back the recording?

787
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,040
That would be the ultimate betrayal.

788
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,420
You, man.

789
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,500
Be ready for a real shock.

790
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,660
Oh, I don't want to hear it.

791
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,260
The one good thing about it is

792
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,520
that you're asleep when it happens

793
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,940
and you don't have to listen to it

794
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,140
and now even that will be taken from you.

795
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,240
Right. You'll know what you've been doing

796
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,660
to everyone else and you won't believe it.

797
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,560
I couldn't believe it was me.

798
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,620
I'd never heard anything like it

799
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,520
short of a machine shop.

800
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,880
Well, I...

801
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,440
It was horrible.

802
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,020
And I feel terrible about

803
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,420
everyone I've kept awake forever.

804
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,860
This trip, we bought my wife

805
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,600
a white noise headphone set.

806
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,860
And it's worked.

807
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,680
It's worked for her.

808
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,600
Yeah, for her.

809
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,160
It didn't make you snore any less.

810
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,760
Well, at least you don't have to wear

811
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,320
that damn thing that they put on you

812
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,160
with a thing like an elephant's trunk

813
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,040
that sticks out.

814
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,960
You know what I'm talking about?

815
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,820
Oh, yeah, the CPAP machine.

816
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,000
The CPAP machine?

817
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,320
Every X day, another person

818
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,940
is on the phone.

819
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,980
On a CPAP machine.

820
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,420
It reminds me of my...

821
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,600
Oh, God.

822
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,740
The X's are taking...

823
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,520
What a bunch of...

824
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,060
They're rupturing us up

825
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,600
one piece at a time.

826
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,920
What a bunch of sissies.

827
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,340
Like...

828
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,100
Sissies?

829
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,860
They'll take part of your lung power.

830
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,540
They'll take part of your memory.

831
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,220
They'll take part of your morals.

832
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,520
Reverend Stang, quit fiddling with my knee.

833
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,580
They'll take one of your teeth.

834
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,120
Reverend Stang has to do something.

835
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,900
They took his hair.

836
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,300
Idle hands are the devil's playground.

837
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:38,640


838
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,100
And those brain cells.

839
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,680
Look at them hanging out there

840
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,480
where they should be.

841
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,000
The axons and dendrites.

842
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,600
The Hatfields and the McCoys.

843
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,320
It's ongoing.

844
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:45,920
It's ongoing.

845
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,660
Every second,

846
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,340
they're lifting another part of you

847
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,360
up to the saucers.

848
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,820
Do you have as much money

849
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,620
as you used to?

850
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,140
You are lifted off piece by piece,

851
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,080
particle by particle.

852
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,240
You know what?

853
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,840
I can't wait, Reverend Stang.

854
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,020
When I get up there

855
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,360
into the saucers

856
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,740
and we head over to Planet X

857
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,240
and we finally get there,

858
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,060
the sex goddess is working us over

859
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,840
all the way there.

860
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,980
We finally get to Planet X

861
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,260
and I'm going to have

862
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,940
the best comic book collection

863
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,560
just waiting for me there.

864
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,260
But in the Congo,

865
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,800
they'll run...

866
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:15,940
They'll rot.

867
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,220
You see, if Planet X is tropical...

868
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,280
You won't have to because

869
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,520
you'll have an identical one.

870
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,580
Yeah, that's true.

871
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,560
We'll all have, like,

872
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,720
identical comic book collections.

873
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,240
Have I mentioned that I have dibs

874
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,760
on the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam?

875
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,240
Yes, you have many times.

876
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,040
You mentioned that a lot.

877
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,320
Many, many times.

878
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,980
You can have those drabby old...

879
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,400
those Rembrandts,

880
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:34,780
those old dark...

881
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,660
Did I mention the Grand Canyon?

882
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,420
Yeah, you mentioned the Grand Canyon.

883
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,420
And grand it is.

884
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,040
You know, there's a nifty canyon

885
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,580
right above the Grand Canyon,

886
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,580
which few people know about.

887
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,120
You've got dibs on a whole bunch of stuff.

888
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,580
But, you know...

889
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,020
Which side?

890
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,560
You can only hold them

891
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,400
and you can only hold

892
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,520
so much in your hands.

893
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,320
Is it on the Flintstones Village side

894
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,680
or the north side?

895
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,380
You're like that monkey

896
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,260
reaching into that jar

897
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,660
and grabbing those...

898
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,680
It's a special, hidden, forbidden...

899
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,380
Oh, you're great.

900
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,400
Dr. Howell, I was at a place

901
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,360
called Hidden Valley.

902
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Hidden Valley.

903
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:01,900
Hidden Valley Ranch.

904
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,220
A campground in Joshua Tree National Park.

905
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,800
But get this.

906
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,900
If you got a hiking map,

907
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,500
it showed Hidden Valley Campground.

908
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,480
But then, behind some topographical stuff,

909
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,780
there was...

910
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,100
the name,

911
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,460
The Real Hidden Valley.

912
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,960
Oh, it's all enough

913
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,400
to make one's head spin.

914
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,040
So, needless to say,

915
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,860
Lisa and I

916
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,640
and Princess We

917
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,860
went to that place

918
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,620
as fast as we could.

919
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,300
Yeah.

920
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,660
We got into the Hidden Valley.

921
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,000
It was, in fact,

922
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,500
very much like

923
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,280
entering the Valley of Gwangi.

924
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,420
It was, in fact,

925
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,720
the guy who discovered it

926
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,400
had to dynamite it open.

927
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,860
And it was used by rustlers

928
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,700
for hiding their stolen cattle in.

929
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,960
And then it was owned by a rancher

930
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,580
who said,

931
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,260
why, now that the cattle

932
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,200
have eaten all the grass

933
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,380
and stripped this place,

934
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,400
I believe I'll open it to the public.

935
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,500
And it is a beautiful, hidden valley.

936
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,400
But these hidden valleys

937
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,440
can regenerate themselves.

938
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,020
Full of dinosaurs.

939
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,220
I know.

940
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,820
I know.

941
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,040
But few will believe it.

942
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,140
Only I could see them.

943
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,480
The actual Valley of Gwangi

944
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,940
must be in Mexico's

945
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,560
Sierra Madre Oriental.

946
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,540
You think?

947
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,780
Surrounded by mountains.

948
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,880
Oh, there's the phone again.

949
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,520
The beast.

950
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,440
Apollo Mountain.

951
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,580
Yes.

952
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,460
Greatest animated film ever made.

953
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,180
That's interesting that we can hear it ring.

954
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,380
Oh, you're on the air.

955
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,980
But we can't hear it.

956
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,520
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

957
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,480
You're not on the air.

958
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,080
You kind of are.

959
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,420
We can't get the phone to work.

960
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,180
It's Connie Dobbs.

961
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,860
Oh, come on now, honey.

962
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,540
Are you having some technical difficulties?

963
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,620
I'm here.

964
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,020
Can you hear?

965
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,640
She's at the bottom of the sound well.

966
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,900
Yeah, at the very bottom.

967
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,640
This is outrageous.

968
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,640
Try it now, Connie.

969
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,340
I'm down, Pete.

970
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,680
I'm down.

971
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,320
I'm down.

972
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,340
I'm down.

973
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,120
She's done something terrible.

974
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,000
It does sound like Connie Dobbs.

975
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,900
Turn that music off.

976
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,340
Turn that music off.

977
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,840
Good Lord, man.

978
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,560
Stinking music off.

979
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,880
This is Connie Dobbs, man.

980
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,060
Help me.

981
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,520
Help.

982
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,160
She's yelling for help.

983
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,620
She's yelling for help?

984
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,260
You'll be stuck at the bottom of the well.

985
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,460
Oh, she's stuck at the bottom of the well.

986
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,640
Well, well.

987
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,220
Like, this is a job for...

988
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,800
We need you for a...

989
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,540
You are Bob Dobbs.

990
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,340
A photo shoot.

991
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,140
Well, yeah, we do the photo shoot first,

992
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,040
and then we'll call Bob,

993
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,000
and he'll come and get you.

994
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,980
Can you hear me?

995
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,040
Just barely.

996
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,380
I'm not a liar or anything.

997
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,100
Just barely can we hear you

998
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,940
because the radio setup is so unworkable.

999
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,020
We need to get you both some money.

1000
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,240
Yes, that's right.

1001
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,900
I hope everyone heard what she said.

1002
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,360
Can you bring us some of that good home cooking?

1003
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,520
I want some of that good home cooked money.

1004
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,580
Now try it, Connie.

1005
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,080
Hello?

1006
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,180
I hear you now.

1007
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:38,980
What's going on?

1008
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,960
I think I managed to fix the technical problem.

1009
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,800
You did something.

1010
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,860
It's her.

1011
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,760
It's her.

1012
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,700
Get out of here, my dear.

1013
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,180
Listen, I'm so happy.

1014
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,020
I feel much better.

1015
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,900
I came out of that well.

1016
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,480
You're happy.

1017
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,480
I'm in ecstasy.

1018
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,180
The fucking thing is finally functioning,

1019
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,920
and I think I figured out how to do it.

1020
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,640
Well, let's hear your ruminations.

1021
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,520
Turn your mic down, Hal.

1022
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,760
You're running over money.

1023
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,580
I'm sorry.

1024
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,600
You're over how much now?

1025
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,460
Is that all right?

1026
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,800
I had it turned up.

1027
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:07,960
Oh, it is.

1028
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,840
It is.

1029
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,120
It is.

1030
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,920
Connie loves y'all so much.

1031
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,840
Thank you so much.

1032
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,640
Thank you.

1033
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,340
I had you turned up loud.

1034
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,940
You've got Reverend Stang masturbating on the air.

1035
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,380
Stang is overwhelmed by listening to Connie's voice.

1036
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,180
Oh, well, bye, kids.

1037
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,840
Take those special pills, do you?

1038
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,760
He doesn't take Reverend Stang much.

1039
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,180
He gets set off by the nearest...

1040
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,260
Please excuse this unfortunate display.

1041
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,020
A little breeze blowing by his pants will set Reverend Stang off.

1042
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,600
That was not amusing or entertaining.

1043
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,100
But anyway, Connie...

1044
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,220
I'd like to know.

1045
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,520
I'd like to know a little something.

1046
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,540
How come there's all kinds of pictures of Pete Goldie on your show?

1047
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,980
Yeah, what's the deal with Pete Goldie on your show?

1048
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,800
Yeah, and the socks.

1049
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,680
What's with the socks?

1050
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,660
You're saying there are pictures of Pete Goldie?

1051
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,380
Yeah, look right over there on your website, Dr. Hal.

1052
00:34:59,440 --> 00:34:59,580
On your website.

1053
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,280
On that website.

1054
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,640
There's Pete Goldie on your website.

1055
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,640
Well, you know, without Pete Goldie, there wouldn't be much of a website, would there?

1056
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,120
This is the Ask Dr. Hal show.

1057
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,440
This is the Ask Dr. Hal show.

1058
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,540
Well, how come there's pictures of Pete Goldie?

1059
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,420
I'm very confused.

1060
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,620
Connie is very confused.

1061
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,760
Well, I guess we consider Pete Goldie a natural phenomenon,

1062
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,440
worthy of celebrating in the decorative element of our website.

1063
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,080
I wish you were puzzling Evidence Showwife, because she's a really good cook.

1064
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,820
And so cute.

1065
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,920
She is a good cook.

1066
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,620
Connie's not so much of a good cook, because she has people cooking for her.

1067
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,440
Yeah, that's right.

1068
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,660
Connie can't cook for shit.

1069
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,480
They're cooking all the time.

1070
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,120
They're cooking for Connie, if you know what I mean.

1071
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,620
Connie can't cook worth a crap.

1072
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,520
Only Bob's best friend could get away with it.

1073
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,340
She's saying something like that.

1074
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,520
Yeah, Connie's not a good cook.

1075
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,180
She's like...

1076
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,400
Dr. Drummond, please.

1077
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,240
She's like, knows how to...

1078
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,620
We know you have unusual privileges here, but...

1079
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,080
Connie's idea of cooking is to order reservations at the...

1080
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,960
That's like saying Tammy Faye Baker was a crappy lay.

1081
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,640
Come on, let's keep things in perspective.

1082
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,500
Well, you would know that.

1083
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,120
You would know that, Reverend Stang.

1084
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,980
First hand.

1085
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,440
I used to be a good cook when I was younger, and I was, you know...

1086
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,240
Of course.

1087
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,260
I used to have Connie's recipe book.

1088
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,400
Now that Bob is gone...

1089
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,500
It's not around.

1090
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,320
Now, I just don't cook as much, and I have people who take care of that for me.

1091
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,460
As they should.

1092
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:25,820
I understand you got in trouble in your presentation up there in Point Arena recently.

1093
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,600
Is that true?

1094
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,040
No, no.

1095
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,820
I don't know any kind of cooking you're talking about.

1096
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,400
Who would have said such a thing?

1097
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,440
Just because you showed a film which was slightly racy in its contents,

1098
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,340
there seems to be some palaver, which you should completely ignore.

1099
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,020
People seemed to feel the fest when some kind was pulled.

1100
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,540
Mm-hmm.

1101
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,000
Mm-hmm.

1102
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,840
Mm-hmm.

1103
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,540


1104
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,920
Connie, dare I ask a question?

1105
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:50,900
Naturally.

1106
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,060
The trouble follows you, but it never catches up, is what I heard.

1107
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,680
Where danger threatens, trouble follows.

1108
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,500
Some of us who work for Bob do have trouble.

1109
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,300
Connie, do you know if Bob ever got that message about the money that he owes us?

1110
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,060
I need special pills to function.

1111
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,640
I hope...

1112
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,900
You gave Bob that message about the money, you know.

1113
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,860
The money?

1114
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,460
That he said...

1115
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:19,480
Money?

1116
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,840
He said we'd get.

1117
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,340
I'll tell you...

1118
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,740
I mean...

1119
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,680
What message would that mean, now, Dan?

1120
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,060
Bob wouldn't lie.

1121
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,920
He wouldn't, would he?

1122
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,460
Bob did not lie.

1123
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,840
I lied sometimes, but you know, that was a long time ago.

1124
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,320
I don't lie anymore.

1125
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:33,840
What was the time I lied?

1126
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,120
I remember when we laid together, Connie.

1127
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,580
Yes.

1128
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,180
Oh, now, stop.

1129
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,220
Everyone thinks they have sex with me, and some people I did have sex with.

1130
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,520
Some people I didn't have sex with.

1131
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,060
Some people I didn't have sex with.

1132
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,860
Because, you know, I don't have sex with everybody.

1133
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,580
But a woman has that need.

1134
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,720
It's impossible to have sex with everybody.

1135
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,200
Just don't even try it.

1136
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,680
Just a couple.

1137
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,740
Just a couple people.

1138
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,240
A couple hundred here and there.

1139
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,200
A couple hundred here, a couple hundred there.

1140
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,320
Yeah.

1141
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,240
What people don't realize is that women have that need, too.

1142
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,300
Well, I've always defended you whenever somebody called you a slut.

1143
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,600
I always, like, really stood up for you.

1144
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,020
You just called her a slut to me a minute ago.

1145
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
But I was just relating a story I'd heard.

1146
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,280
You betrayed her.

1147
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,700
You said she was a bad cook.

1148
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Well, that's true.

1149
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,400
I can't change that.

1150
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,020
That's true.

1151
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,780
That's just a basic fact.

1152
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,320
Yeah, that's not true.

1153
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,040
I'm not a bad cook.

1154
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,840
She won't even deny that.

1155
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,460
She's just said she's not a bad cook.

1156
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,760
She just doesn't cook anymore.

1157
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,060
All right.

1158
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,080
That all depends on what your definition is.

1159
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,900
I know I'm not supposed to say this, but I love you, Connie.

1160
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,780
I love you.

1161
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,980
Don't go away.

1162
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,920
That's Reverend Stang.

1163
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,000
That's Reverend Stang.

1164
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,560
That's Reverend Stang.

1165
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,200
You recognize his voice.

1166
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,020
That's Reverend Stang, ladies and gentlemen.

1167
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:49,140
I know his voice would be more recognizable if it was covered with a pillow.

1168
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,380
I can't stop thinking about you.

1169
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,120
I can't stop thinking about you.

1170
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:57,880
All right.

1171
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,400
I will do that, Connie.

1172
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,500
I will keep thinking.

1173
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,440
Keep thinking.

1174
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,140
But only of you.

1175
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,620
Yes, a lot of good may that do you.

1176
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,060
And yet, life is composed of hopes that never bear fruit.

1177
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:09,840
And that money.

1178
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,080
That money, Bob, owes me.

1179
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,780
I'm sorry, Connie.

1180
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,560
That's a different matter.

1181
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:12,800
That's a different matter.

1182
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,460
That makes sense.

1183
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,520
You know, you don't have to.

1184
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,240
You don't have to have people thinking about you.

1185
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,640
Bob always said, you've got to have thousands of people thinking.

1186
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,040
Thousands of people thinking.

1187
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,540
The thousand and one monkey.

1188
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,500
That one monk was enough to turn the tide.

1189
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,520
That little simmon was a treasure to all life.

1190
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,160
He was the first one to think of using a frog to master back with.

1191
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,480
Exactly.

1192
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,700
The most brilliant monkey since Cheetah.

1193
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,620
There we go.

1194
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,600
For Lou.

1195
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,040
Fred.

1196
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,760
Now, let's not get carried away here, ladies and gentlemen.

1197
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:56,520
You know, I want to point out something that may be getting lost in all the fray and foo-for-aw.

1198
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,320
This is simply a show.

1199
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,980
This is not anything anyone should be excited about.

1200
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,460
Worry, see, no problem.

1201
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,200
Everything's okay.

1202
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,300
There's nothing at all to worry about.

1203
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,820
Have you got any evidence with you?

1204
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,340
No, I fear not.

1205
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,820
He flaked off and, uh, finked out.

1206
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,060
Pinked out, we call it.

1207
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,500
And what about Mr. Pete Goldie?

1208
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,340
Is Pete Goldie there?

1209
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,440
Pete Goldie didn't make it either.

1210
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,480
Who's going to fight the next war?

1211
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,140
He's not there either.

1212
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,980
Pete Goldie did not make it.

1213
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,460
No, sir.

1214
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,240
No, ma'am.

1215
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,380
Well, how come there's all kinds of pictures of him on your website?

1216
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,420
Because he operates the website.

1217
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,900
I tried to get pictures of you up there, Connie.

1218
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,520
I swear to God.

1219
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:44,520


1220
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:44,520


1221
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:44,520


1222
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:44,520


1223
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:44,900
I tried.

1224
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,360
Wow, pictures of you would be great up there.

1225
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,960
Yeah, send me some and we'll use that to decorate the website.

1226
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,200
Yes.

1227
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,400
We need some more decorations.

1228
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,080
Better decoration on that website.

1229
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,620
We do.

1230
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,500
I don't know who is in charge.

1231
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,460
I wish I could personally dedicate, I mean, decorate your website.

1232
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,640
All right, gentlemen.

1233
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,040
Well, I did take my pills.

1234
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
There she goes.

1235
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,180
Goodbye, Connie.

1236
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:07,620
Goodbye.

1237
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:08,800
I love y'all.

1238
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,300
I love you guys.

1239
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,500
Come back again, please.

1240
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,760
Connie, I love you.

1241
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,280
Connie.

1242
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,100
I love you.

1243
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,200
Go, go, Connie.

1244
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,560
No, Connie.

1245
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,080
I love her so much.

1246
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,100
Connie.

1247
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,260
She's gone.

1248
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,180
I would do that forever.

1249
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,880
Just for now.

1250
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,740
It wasn't time for us to meet.

1251
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,420
If only she knew how much I love her.

1252
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,760
She might change.

1253
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,860
All right.

1254
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,120
She is gorgeous, too.

1255
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,980
I've got to tell you.

1256
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,360
Oh, Connie.

1257
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,960
Be still, my palpitating heart.

1258
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,980
Now, see, if that website switches over to pictures of Connie,

1259
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,320
we'll know that Pete was listening.

1260
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,020
All right.

1261
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,980
Let's check him out.

1262
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,140
Ooh.

1263
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,700
Came waiting.

1264
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,280
Hey, how about this?

1265
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,840
That's still pictures of Pete Goldie.

1266
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,540
These are pictures of Pete Goldie.

1267
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,840
I always wondered what he looked like.

1268
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,240
Hey, so you learned how to get the phone in the mix, Dr. Howe.

1269
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:06,320
Yes, it finally occurred to me that there was one more button I hadn't tried pushing all this time.

1270
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,540
It's always the last one.

1271
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,600
The big red one that said panic on it.

1272
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,720
It kept you from pushing it.

1273
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,160
Exactly.

1274
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:11,920
Exactly.

1275
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,660
That is the one.

1276
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,640
It said on.

1277
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,400
But I thought, why not?

1278
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:14,940
What the hell?

1279
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,500
I mean, you know, you only go around once in life.

1280
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,500
It might mean, of course, it also switched off the internet connections.

1281
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,000
We switched it back and forth.

1282
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,500
But finally, we got something we can work with, live with, exist with.

1283
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,700
And so I tell you, I'm tired of all this tension.

1284
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,720
I simply want to relax, settle back.

1285
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:41,400
And by the way, we are, as I can tell you know, over the Terminator of Midnight by 10 minutes.

1286
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,300
So we can go on as long as you.

1287
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,180
Okay.

1288
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,160
The connection comple-

1289
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,160


1290
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,160


1291
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,620
Come back, my dear.

1292
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:13,620


1293
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:13,620


1294
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:13,620


1295
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:13,620


1296
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:13,620


1297
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:13,620


1298
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,220
My God, he's listening. There's Connie.

1299
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,900
There she is on the RadioValencia.org website.

1300
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,120
He's put her up on the site.

1301
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,060
Look at what Pete Goldie has done.

1302
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,580
Praise Pete Goldie. Truly.

1303
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,460
He is all that legend says him to be.

1304
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,380
I told you.

1305
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,260
A holy man who walked alongside Bob.

1306
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,920
And by the way, tomorrow, if you manage to make it to the show,

1307
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,320
K-Rob has created a new intro for Pete Goldie,

1308
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,520
which makes him seem like the second coming of Christ.

1309
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,860
It goes on and on with stars, landscapes, planets, spaceships,

1310
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:51,000
and it builds and builds and builds and builds for about three minutes.

1311
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,640
Well, folks, I hope this is interesting to you.

1312
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,280
It certainly is to some people.

1313
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,960
Others may wonder what sort of booby hatch you've stumbled upon.

1314
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:08,300
All I can tell you is this is the Ask Dr. Hal Show live on radio.

1315
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,360
The Ask Dr. Hal Show.

1316
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,520
No toils not, nor does it spin.

1317
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,920
It has no particular use of any kind.

1318
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,480
It is anti-utilitarian and in its own way Lutheran

1319
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,780
as it interposes no interlocutor,

1320
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:33,160
but is simply a simple-ass agreement between you, the listener, and me, the broadcaster.

1321
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,920
An agreement to keep listening because you never know what might happen next.

1322
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,300
You might even see a dragon.

1323
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,580
A dragon in the bathtub bathing up.

1324
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,360
Or a flying saucer that is looking for its cup.

1325
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:54,360
So keep listening, and eventually we're going to do our outro and get off the air.

1326
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,040
We have presumed upon your patience long enough.

1327
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:05,740
Yes, we will go our separate ways and remember this night for all it was and might have been.

1328
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,940
For all it was and might have been.

1329
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,380
This night.

1330
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:10,680
This night.

1331
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,660
It only now starts to begin.

1332
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,300
Aye, shipmate.

1333
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,900
Thou hast said it.

1334
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:25,860
So we sailed away for a year and a day to the land where the bone tree grows.

1335
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:33,300
A tree that climbs into the stars and where our souls be showed.

1336
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,360
And there atop that glimmering tree,

1337
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,740
a glittering lizard sits.

1338
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,520
Its gills and puff.

1339
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,320
And all across, it feels as it does sit.

1340
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,160
And then it hurls its sinuous self down from the tree above.

1341
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,180
And only then will it find love.

1342
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,900
Because upon the ground impaled it is upon a branch.

1343
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,360
A branch.

1344
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,760
It's demised.

1345
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,020
It did see when it did sail.

1346
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,020
And now its guts are wrenched.

1347
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,900
I got that one.

1348
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,780
This, uh, sorry tale is for all ears.

1349
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,040
For nature gives it free.

1350
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:31,280
But when you're hearing dust but beget a new story we have for thee.

1351
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,340
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.

1352
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,340
Keep tuned and we'll tell you all about it.

1353
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:36,340


1354
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,900
We'll tell you another of our terrifying fairy tales.

1355
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,440
Terrifying fairy tales.

1356
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,360
Just when you thought it was safe to do whatever it was you were about to do.

1357
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,880
A small sample from our quartet of death.

1358
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,300
Ain't that nice?

1359
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,100
Well, you know, the Carnegie Company does make a popular version of that.

1360
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,820
A nice little model about five inches long.

1361
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,740
I have it too, yes.

1362
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,360
Dunkleosteus.

1363
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:05,860
The...

1364
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,700
Huge prehistoric giant fish they used to call Dionyctheus.

1365
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,560
Excuse me, but who left this Dunkleosteus in my bathroom?

1366
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,100
Discovered by a Dr. Dunkle of the Cleveland family.

1367
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,180
He wouldn't fit in most bathrooms.

1368
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,800
He wouldn't cause he's the size of a railroad boxcar.

1369
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,880
Yep, that's right.

1370
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:28,500
He's enormous in size and he's got great big ugly teeth that's all fused into one supertooth.

1371
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,660
He's so ugly he's got a skeleton around his eyeballs.

1372
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,200
And his mama's so ugly.

1373
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,120
Instead of eyelids he's got skeleton lids.

1374
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,280
Like the irons of a camera.

1375
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,820
The eyelids of God.

1376
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,660
His eyes...

1377
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,120
Behold, his eyelids try the children of men.

1378
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,240
His beak is the size of a Volkswagen.

1379
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,560
His face is the one big assembly of dots that shine in the dark.

1380
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,560
But yes, it is true, the Dunkleosteus.

1381
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,300
Now nobody really knows what the other end of the animal looks like.

1382
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,120
All depictions of its tail are pure speculation.

1383
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,560
No! No!

1384
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,900
But we know it must have had one.

1385
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,060
So did it have a hetero-circle tail like most living fish of today?

1386
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:17,560
Or did it have a primitive eel-like flipper system terminating in a point?

1387
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:25,960
Or did it have some other weird, primitive, atavistic character of the primordial ooze?

1388
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:32,300
Alright, so let's just click back one to time transfer.

1389
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,280
We're gonna...

1390
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,280
Take this Dunkleoptimus.

1391
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm glad this is only a dream and could never actually occur.

1392
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,560
We're gonna go to some sort of lake from...

1393
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,680
Let's see, what do we give?

1394
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,400
That's 8...

1395
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,740
180 million years.

1396
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,020
Lake Ukabalapanga-Wadapadawalakala.

1397
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:48,860
That's a...

1398
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,680
And that's 180 million years ago.

1399
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,560
It was formed here when an enormous meteor petulantly smacked into the earth.

1400
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,460
Now, alright, so...

1401
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,560
We've got that time, we've got the Dunkleoptimus.

1402
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,660
Is that... how do you say it again?

1403
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,280
He started as an optimist, but soon, in Darwinian conditions,

1404
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,820
defiled into a pessimistic condition.

1405
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,200
Alright, let's put a...

1406
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,760
The Dunkleosteus.

1407
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,140
Dunkleosteus.

1408
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,820
But, you know, I have no idea what a Dunkleosteus might be,

1409
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,320
but its previous name...

1410
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,060
It sounds like something that came out of the bathroom.

1411
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,080
Its previous name was Dynichtheus.

1412
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,420
Dyn as in terrible, as in dinosaur, as terrible lizards.

1413
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,820
And then ichtheus, fish, so his name is Terrible Fish.

1414
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,420
This is serious, looking fish.

1415
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,860
So isn't that a beautiful name?

1416
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,380
Why do they have to...

1417
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,640
God almighty is here.

1418
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,520
Why do they have to turn it to goddamn Dunkleosteus?

1419
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,300
Alright, so let's say we...

1420
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,420
And it's Dr. Dunkle discovered it.

1421
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,180
Well, that is true.

1422
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,980
You should name it after the discoverer.

1423
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,880
That's it.

1424
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,460
If that's what he wants.

1425
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,800
Dr. Dunkle's discovery.

1426
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,720
It's the biggest thing in the Cleveland natural history.

1427
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,540
It's pretty damn big, although there was another fish...

1428
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,520
Next to the Yeti jawbone, Dr. Howe.

1429
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,320
...that almost, even uglier, and twice as big, called Xiphactinus.

1430
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,360
A giant, hideous, buck-toothed, prehistoric fish.

1431
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,660
A fish that begins with an X.

1432
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,420
Xiphactinus.

1433
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,000
So a Chinese one?

1434
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,600
No, but he's got an undershot jaw and big, snaggly, spike-like teeth, and he's huge and

1435
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,760
predatory.

1436
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,620
And how long is he?

1437
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,660
Oh, about 35 to 40 feet.

1438
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,100
Oh, that's nothing.

1439
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,460
Philo's daughter's tongue goes from here to Alpha Centauri.

1440
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,820
Sure, and everyone knew that already, but there's no harm in repeating it again here

1441
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,340
on the air.

1442
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,040
It's a rare among friends.

1443
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:41,360
For Dunkleosteus existed in the Lower Devonian Period, long before there were any critters

1444
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:46,120
like us anywhere, even in the mind of God.

1445
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:53,280
But if we go through time, and we were allowed to bring one device, what would it be?

1446
00:50:53,500 --> 00:51:00,220
Well, I wouldn't want to go paddling in the ocean with Dunkleosteus swimming around.

1447
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,220
You would need an oxygen tank.

1448
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,040
What if you had a three-masted frigate or something?

1449
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:10,740
Would you need an oxygen tank, or would you instead be hallucinating because of the vastly

1450
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,980
greater amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, if you were breathing Earth's atmosphere at

1451
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,500
that time?

1452
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:20,880
Now, that's why they had giant spiders in the age of giant insects, because there was

1453
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,760
more oxygen in the atmosphere at this time.

1454
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,920
So their spicules could absorb more.

1455
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,660
How big were these spiders?

1456
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,460
Horribly large.

1457
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,200
Like horribly in the sense of like a monster?

1458
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:30,200


1459
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,740
Like a meter or half a meter?

1460
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,120
You wouldn't want a meter.

1461
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,240
Oh, really?

1462
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,540
It's that kind of like, how big would their web be?

1463
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,180
Sort of like that Gillian's Island episode?

1464
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,420
Nobody knows if they made a web, although I suppose they do since they appear to have

1465
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,500
spinnerets at the end of the abdomen.

1466
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,960
But really, now there's some different theory that they were aquatic or something like that.

1467
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,280
And how big are they?

1468
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,960
About the size of a bushel basket.

1469
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,340
But there were larger ones with a greater leg spread.

1470
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,180
There were large giant spiders.

1471
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,300
There were giant arthropods.

1472
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,240
And where did you see these arthropods?

1473
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:03,840
Like those of human beings.

1474
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,960
No living man has seen them.

1475
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,740
So you're telling the court right now that no living man has seen this creature?

1476
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:19,120
Fossiliferous evidence from the Carboniferous period, eon upon eon before any vertebrated

1477
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:23,000
animal was assured upon the land.

1478
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,500
But actually, that's not true either.

1479
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,000
They had good cartilage, though.

1480
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,160
Actually, there were vertebrates living.

1481
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,840
They were living side by side with these giant insects.

1482
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:38,520
And they may remember some way how bad it is to live with bugs bigger than you are and

1483
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,880
carry a resentment forward even to today where we view the insect kingdom with suspicion

1484
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,320
and alarm.

1485
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:45,860
That's me.

1486
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,200
Say the truth.

1487
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,200
That's me.

1488
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:47,700
Say the truth.

1489
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:54,360
I also don't feel a bit guilty about devouring chickens because of the age of birds.

1490
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,220
Yes.

1491
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,620
And that one TV special I saw.

1492
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,040
I thought, okay.

1493
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,360
We're just getting back at them for the day.

1494
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,300
That's all it is.

1495
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,020
Yes.

1496
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,900
There were the days when we were trod underfoot by their close relatives.

1497
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,600
But now they furnish our table.

1498
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,000
A well-rounded capon.

1499
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,260
Yes.

1500
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,400
Nothing would be more tasty when you add the spices.

1501
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,160
We need to go.

1502
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,140
Is it time to depart?

1503
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,320
Is there time for me to do the outro?

1504
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,780
Let's keep going, man.

1505
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,840
Time to do the outro?

1506
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,760
Shall we begin the end?

1507
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
The end of our hopes and dreams?

1508
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,420
It has to end sometime.

1509
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:31,840
So here we go.

1510
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,240
I'm going to pull the switch.

1511
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:33,620
Pull the plug.

1512
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,540
We have to get Philo back to the nursing home.

1513
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:36,400
I know.

1514
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,400
The old boy gets a little frisky, if you know what I mean.

1515
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,260
Okay.

1516
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,420
We're going to do it.

1517
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:42,880
We are.

1518
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:43,900
I swear we are.

1519
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,340
He thinks he's Johnny Wise-mo.

1520
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,840
I had so many plans.

1521
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,900
So many wonderful plans.

1522
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,900
Hold on there, rookies.

1523
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,940
Yes, Dr. Hal Showman.

1524
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1525
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1526
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1527
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1528
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1529
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1530
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1531
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1532
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1533
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1534
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1535
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1536
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:58,940


1537
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,980
The show is getting ready to go out in style, which we usually do.

1538
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,160
And thanks for listening to our broadcast.

1539
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:17,020
Yes, we essay to be here every week, although sometimes we find it impractical.

1540
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:25,400
There are certain personal demands on one's time for which one might, under some system

1541
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,920
of justice, be excused from the practice of justice.

1542
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:28,920


1543
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,300
from adhering to petty regularities of duty.

1544
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:41,040
I will tell you that as long as there is breath in my body...

1545
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,360
What the hell are you handing me here?

1546
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,140
What is that? That's awful. It's icky.

1547
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,940
I found it on the floor.

1548
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,360
He found some ghastly thing on the floor.

1549
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,380
Well, there it is, you know.

1550
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,760
Horrible in the extreme.

1551
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,720
I thought it was a bug at first.

1552
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,640
It looked like a bug when you handed it to me.

1553
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,840
It looks like a bug that's been covered with hippie hair.

1554
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,320
A hippie hair bug?

1555
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,960
And I happen to know exactly how a bug of that kind would look.

1556
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,480
Yes, of course.

1557
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,820
I had hippie hair.

1558
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,040
It's long still, but it's thin.

1559
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,280
I could hide it all behind my ear.

1560
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,180
That's how I travel.

1561
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,500
In your salad days,

1562
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,200
in your greener times.

1563
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,440
They tell me about those.

1564
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,960
They tell me I had those.

1565
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:41,040
I'm glad to know that I had such good times.

1566
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,040
I'm glad too, because what else do we have?

1567
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,380
Even such is time which takes in trust our youth,

1568
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,140
our joys,

1569
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,660
our all we have,

1570
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,120
and pays us with but earth.

1571
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,540
And dust.

1572
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,800
Our potency.

1573
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,900
Who in the dark and silent grave,

1574
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,540
our continents,

1575
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,500
when we have wandered all our ways,

1576
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,040
our eyesight,

1577
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,100
shuts up the story of our days.

1578
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,280
Sense of smell.

1579
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,220
But from this grave, this earth, this dust,

1580
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,680
Bob Dobbs shall boing up in triumph, I trust.

1581
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,680
Hwuh? Hwuh? Hwuh?

1582
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:25,400
Sure.

1583
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,680
Why not?

1584
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,640
Isn't that the racket we're in, gentlemen?

1585
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,480
Oh, is this on?

1586
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,300
Yes, Bob shall be back, and bring comfort to all.

1587
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,660
Ah, hwuh?

1588
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,980
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1589
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,580
the Ask Dr. Howell Show live on radio

1590
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:49,180
ends its broadcast day at RadioValencia.fm.

1591
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:54,580
Here you see file footage of ducks bobbing in the water,

1592
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,160
and now a shot of light breaking through the trees,

1593
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,300
all in scratchy old Technicolor film.

1594
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,820
The Ask Dr. Howell Show is a product of its time,

1595
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,880
and allowed by the management and staff,

1596
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:13,220
for the time being, of RadioValencia.fm.

1597
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:19,120
Despite its name, RadioValencia.fm is hardly ever an FM station.

1598
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,320
But in times to come, according to the doctrine of the faithful,

1599
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,400
at one time in the near future even,

1600
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:31,100
it will be heard as an actual radio station,

1601
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,720
as, according to some tradition,

1602
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,260
it recently was, until held back by the demons of darkness.

1603
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,320
On behalf of the staff and management of RadioValencia.fm,

1604
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:49,140
the Ask Dr. Howell Show wishes you a profound good night,

1605
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,600
and good morning.

1606
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,760
Pull somber the horses,

1607
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,560
they will not fall asleep,

1608
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,180
but rather have a few hours aue after the morning show.

1609
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,680
Triple the tears on the abacus,

1610
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,080
when in a spell about a welsh jester,

1611
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:12,080


1612
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:12,300
Top the

1613
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:12,300


1614
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:12,300


1615
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:12,300


1616
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:12,540
that fly at the stars in the depth.

1617
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:22,580
Good night, Broadway.

1618
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,240
