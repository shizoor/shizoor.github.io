00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
The Subgenius Hour of Slack

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:23,900
And this Hour of Slack number 1018 will be a rerun of Hour of Slack number 593 from April 5th, 1997.

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,000
The Heaven's Gate Show, by popular request.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, friends, in 1997, members of the rival UFO kook cult known as Heaven's Gate all committed suicide at their big California ranch house.

5
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,200
Because they thought that would get them on the saucers quicker.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,940
As you'll hear, we and Reverend Susie the Floozy and Papa Joe Mama jumped on it.

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,760
And if you're too young to remember it, this will be a great history lesson.

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,120
And an especially important one to Subgenii.

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,860
Now proper time has come for massive change.

10
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,160
Oh, ring, ring, ring, drop.

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,700
Yes, you will now, oh, you will now.

12
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,780
Oh, ring, ring, ring, drop.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,440
I don't know how you came by this record, but you are now embarked upon a journey that must certainly lead you to change your life.

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,880
Forever.

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,400
If you were never a special person, you are a special person now.

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,120
Hello, seeker.

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,840
Now don't feel alone here in the new age, because there's a seeker born every minute.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,120
Yes, I'm Dr. Happy Harry Cox.

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,440
And call me happy because I am.

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,820
Because you're listening to another in a series of my mind-breaking records.

21
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,540
Subgenius.

22
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,640
Hour of Slack.

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,580
An hour? I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,020
There it is.

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,260
This is a very exciting time for us.

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,720
Who is us?

27
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm Doe, for starters.

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:13,940
Doe!

29
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,840
No, no, no, we said wait for the comet.

30
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,460
Hail Bob.

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,020
Do not shed your containers until X-Day.

32
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,420
Stay in your containers.

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,240
Stay in your containers until 7 AM July 5th, 1998.

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,280
That is all.

35
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,480
I was right about the comet. Get them and see why.

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,620
What's everyone so worked up about?

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,960
So there's a comet. Big deal.

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,540
It'll burn up in our atmosphere and what's ever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head.

39
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,380
When the sun set and the earth lay dark in the depth of night,

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,420
primitive man gazed into the firmament.

41
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,740
And wondered with awe of what the heavens contained.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,220
Countless points of light dazzled his mind with godly grace.

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,980
And yet, what light kindles these illumined torches?

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,100
Fires kept burning by an all-powerful deity?

45
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
Bob's light.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,400
Then, as the earth revolves about the sun,

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,980
she became focused to a visitor's ship.

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,000
A traveling star.

49
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,920
That's watch out.

50
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,900
Voyaging from a planet called Lemuria.

51
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,400
Eleven astronauts came as cosmic messengers.

52
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,120
.

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,160
Hitted by the one yur territories.

54
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,180
To enlighten the Earthman of his destiny

55
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,780
and awaken within him

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,880
the wonders of the universe.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,300
We're doomed!

58
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,700
It's times like this I wish I were a religious man.

59
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,860
It's all over people.

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,420
We don't have a plan.

61
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,920
prayer.

62
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,540
Take me off to space.

63
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,260
Take me off to space.

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,840
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

65
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,580
Take me off to space.

66
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,820
Take me off to space.

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,500
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

68
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,440
Go back out of the holodeck to reality, to be with the other members on the craft.

69
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,200
Oh, my God.

70
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,280
Space aliens.

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,200
Don't eat me.

72
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,880
I have a wife and kids.

73
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,620
Eat them.

74
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,260
Silence.

75
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,460
We are travelers from a certain nearby ringed planet whose name we prefer not to mention.

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,700
My name is Kang, and this is my sister, Kodos.

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,520
Hello.

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,260
I suppose you want to probe me.

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,180
Well, might as well get it over with.

80
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,260
Fiddling needles in my belly.

81
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,500
Deep slants of my skin.

82
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,900
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man.

83
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,520
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special piece.

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,000
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

85
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,300
Stop.

86
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,080
We have reached the limits of what rectal probing can teach us.

87
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,940
This is a mission of conquest.

88
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
Take us to your leader.

89
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,860
Sickening.

90
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,520
It's shocking.

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,480
I think it's important that we get as many facts as we can.

92
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,220
About this.

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,080
And try to determine what in fact motivated those people.

94
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:37,100
And what all of us can do to make sure that there aren't other people thinking in that same way out there in our country.

95
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,700
That aren't so isolated that they can create a world for themselves that may justify that kind of thing.

96
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,840
It's very troubling to me.

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,880
That's slick Willy for you.

98
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,360
Always with the smooth talk.

99
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,740
Take the little package of pudding, eat a couple of teaspoons to make room to put the medicine in and stir it.

100
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,860
And release the fats.

101
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:07,260
And then eat it quickly, drink this vodka mixture, which they apparently had mixed up, and then lay back and rest quietly.

102
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,500
There's a lot of speculation out there regarding other groups, similar groups that do similar acts.

103
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,220
We can't tie those in at this point.

104
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,820
What?

105
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,660
As the investigation proceeded, we developed new information.

106
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:22,800
We were running.

107
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,300
We didn't have that information available to us at the time.

108
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,220
So now we want to go back and close those doors.

109
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,940
Are you here doing real work?

110
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,440
This gentleman here in the gray shirt.

111
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,620
Yeah.

112
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,260
What's your...

113
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,500
The castrations that you're referring to, can you tell us if they're recent or...

114
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,220
That's what we're doing.

115
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Wasn't so genius.

116
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,760
The question was about the castrations, how recent they are or how old they are.

117
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,700
Hey, I have nothing to do with that.

118
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,800
Every one of the cult members said goodbye on that take.

119
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,720
To their donuts.

120
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,200
They were in a good mood and very enthusiastic about what they described to be the next phase of their eternal lives.

121
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,020
And Sokka says that the group apparently believed that a UFO was hidden behind a Hale-Bopp comet,

122
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,900
and that it was coming to Earth to deliver them to Heaven.

123
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,480
Try to take the time to look at the information that T&O has brought that has been presented to you.

124
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,900
We know the media is going to do a hatchet job on us in the same way they do a hatchet job on practically every subject.

125
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,480
If the humans were told the truth about us, we would be in trouble.

126
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,700
If they knew what was going on on this planet, they'd be shocked.

127
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,580
And wouldn't continue in their 8 to 5 slavery and ignorance.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,500
And I think I probably covered that point well enough.

129
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,680
Again, these here are the most incredible individuals that I have the honor to spend time with.

130
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,840
And not just anyone could join.

131
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,580
We want people who are going to be totally dedicated to this thing.

132
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,320
You've got to give up.

133
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,340
Whatever it is you're into, your job, your family, sell your house, whatever you have to do, just come on with us.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,280
And there were a few people in Dallas that were seriously thinking about going with them.

135
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,100
They just made it sound so good it was going to be like going to Heaven or something.

136
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,160
Thanks, we agree.

137
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,720
And I hope this is not the case, but remember with the Order of the Solar Temple,

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,100
this was done simultaneously in Canada and in Switzerland.

139
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,920
So I'm hoping that they're not going to discover.

140
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,480
A house in Arizona and in New Mexico where people have undergone the same sort of thing.

141
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's go now to Kurt who joins us on the line from Tallahassee.

142
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,580
Yes, my head is reeling from the news of this.

143
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,520
This is the second incredible coincidence dealing with this other computer linked cult,

144
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,380
which seem to be in some sort of rivalry with this higher source.

145
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,620
And what is that other cult?

146
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,020
I think it's called like the subgenius or something.

147
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,740
And it has these incredible web pages.

148
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,300
I mean just page after page.

149
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,580
And they take on these Christian-based cults, especially the ones that have homepages.

150
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:05,780
And we're predicting that in their religion there's going to be like a UFO invasion in 1998 in July or something.

151
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,320
And they were predicting that there would be this comet that would come by a year before called Hail Bob.

152
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,380
And I read about this almost a half a year ago before this comet was even discovered that it wasn't called Hail Bob.

153
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,740
I guess this is the same comet.

154
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,660
They call it Hail Bob.

155
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,300
Well, it's named after the two people who discovered it.

156
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,800
Yes, I know.

157
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,040
And it was spelled differently.

158
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,460
But it was kind of close.

159
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,000
And when I first saw that coincidence, I thought, boy, that's kind of funny because, you know, they said Hail Bob and this is called Hail Bob.

160
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,600
What was the name of that group?

161
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,660
Well, it was called the subgenius something or another, the Church of the Subgenius or something like that.

162
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:49,380
And they predicted that when this comet would come by, it would prove to the other Christian-based religions that a year later the actual UFOs would land.

163
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,640
And they predicted that these comets would come by.

164
00:09:50,640 --> 00:10:01,000
And they warned these other cults that they should just kill themselves before it happens because they were going to be enslaved or tortured if they waited until the actual landings.

165
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:09,220
And I thought, you know, when I drove in, because I remember this higher source was one of the cults that was specifically taunted about this.

166
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:20,080
And when I heard this title, I went, holy cow, I mean, I can't believe that they would have actually taken their advice because, you know, that Hail Bob and Hail Bopp is, it wasn't exactly what they said it would be.

167
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,300
Mm-hmm.

168
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:20,960
And it was obviously close.

169
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,380
Yeah.

170
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,100
Turned the piece upside down, kind of like a bob.

171
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,960
You have to be careful because the Church of the Subgenius.

172
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,360
Yeah.

173
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,700
Not a real group.

174
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,500
Well, they've got a tremendous website.

175
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,600
Hold on, Curt, one at a time.

176
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:31,940
Please.

177
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:42,360
The Church of the Subgenius is an elaborate parody on religion that's been put together by some very creative people in the science fiction community.

178
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:50,320
Well, then I had also heard, too, but I had also heard that this was kind of, that was sort of the facade that they did so that nobody got after them.

179
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,500
So that's how it is now.

180
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,620


181
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,620


182
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,620


183
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,620


184
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,620


185
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Because they've just got, if you go to the West...

186
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,960
Kurt, can you hold on just a second, please?

187
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,400
Sure.

188
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,780
All right.

189
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,060
Let's go quickly to James in San Antonio, Texas.

190
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,780
Let's get off of that subgenius stuff.

191
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,380
James. Hi.

192
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,200
Yeah. Church of the Subgenius.

193
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,160
I just wanted to speak to the Church of the Subgenius.

194
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,460
Yeah.

195
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,000
That's not a cult. That's a joke.

196
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,180
I'm aware of that.

197
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,040
Oh, okay.

198
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,220
It's got a very funny-faced man who fronts all of their stuff.

199
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,680
Bob Dobbs.

200
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
Bob Dobbs, yeah.

201
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,960
No, they're no threat to anybody, I mean, except for people who hold...

202
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,680
And that might indeed be the reason it was Hail Bob?

203
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,260
Right, exactly.

204
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,800
Uh-huh. Okay.

205
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,520
Sure.

206
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,480
Thanks very much.

207
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,100
Sure. Bye.

208
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,920
Okay. Appreciate it.

209
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,280
Let's move on now to...

210
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,700
Oh, yes. They always want to move on.

211
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
Harry, who joins us from Columbus, Ohio.

212
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:34,920
Yes. Harry.

213
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:41,900
Well, as a matter of fact, this news report, not exactly just in.

214
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,040
You'll forgive us for being a couple of weeks behind the conspiracy news, dear friends.

215
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,940
But it ends...

216
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,520
And the fact that we don't have a...

217
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,880
Well...

218
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,420
The San Diego County District Attorney's Office refused to confirm or deny rumors

219
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:07,340
that poison gas canisters traced to Texas had been found at the scene of yesterday's Rancho Santa Fe mass suicide.

220
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,420
Sources close to the investigation indicated that pressure tanks labeled, quote,

221
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:19,080
Church Air, unquote, had been found in the mansion where 39 young computer programmers,

222
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,760
apparently committed suicide.

223
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,660
One tank was reported to have a shipping tag with a Texas return address.

224
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,600
There were also unconfirmed reports of a handwritten note attached to the canisters.

225
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,040
A neighbor who asked not to be identified said that the young men and women who lived in the seven-bedroom house

226
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,620
addressed each other as bobbies and spent many hours each day hooked up to the Internet.

227
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,820
I think that's where they got all these crazy ideas, another resident of the upscale neighborhood.

228
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,540
Sometimes they said their leader was a guy named Robert J. Dobbings

229
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,840
and that he was in Southeast Asia or Malaysia or someplace,

230
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,800
but then other times they stated he had been assassinated by some guy from Texas.

231
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,400
The neighbors also said that the bobbies claimed to have evidence of a vast conspiracy

232
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,060
involving huge corporations and the federal government.

233
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,680
They talked a lot about something they called the con,

234
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,060
but then they also...

235
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,520
talked about a small group of old guys in Arkansas and Texas

236
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,900
who they claimed had tried to take over the church.

237
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,840
They were always saying about how they had to rescue the church

238
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,320
from some guy named Irwin Strong, the neighbors said.

239
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,080
These bobbies figured that since this Strong or Strang guy was so old and feeble

240
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,740
that they could just shove him out of the way and take over this nut cult

241
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,060
that he apparently runs out of some foundation in Fort Worth.

242
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,400
A source close to the investigation said,

243
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,720
Looks like their plans may have hit a snag.

244
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,880
Law enforcement officials would not confirm that they were investigating

245
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,740
a post office box address in Fort Worth, Texas,

246
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,220
thought to be hometown of Irwin Strong.

247
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,740
The note attached to the gas canisters said in part,

248
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,220
quote,

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,280
have some real slack, boys and girls, unquote,

250
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,700
and is thought by investigators to have been written in a code

251
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,060
devised by the police.

252
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,160
By the cult.

253
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,720
And, well, I guess, eh, we just may have to see what happens

254
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,400
and what comes of all of this, don't you think, dear friends?

255
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,460
I think they're just beginning, possibly, to catch on.

256
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,620
They like to think.

257
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,780
Anyway, I sure hope all of this is working all right

258
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,500
because, friends, we're working on new tape decks

259
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,860
donated by Sister Friday Jones.

260
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,660
We're ranting on new microphones and...

261
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,320
You can imagine, you can imagine,

262
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,740
we've been slamming Heaven's Gate, dear friends.

263
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,860
Ah, yes, we've been...

264
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,180
Them all, them kids, them subgeniuses,

265
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,200
are out there swinging on that gate to Heaven again

266
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,360
and they're gonna throw that thing off its hinges

267
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,200
and nobody's gonna be able to get through it

268
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,160
and hell will fill up with the...

269
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,840
and the dead will walk the earth and all that.

270
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,440
Okay?

271
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,020
Dang them subgeniuses.

272
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,940
Uh, yes.

273
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,840
Yes.

274
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,920
And dang them.

275
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,160
Dang them subgeniuses, indeed.

276
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,740
We're probably banged already.

277
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,580
Um, but I should give some credits here, dear friends.

278
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,080
Uh, we have been listening to...

279
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,500
Actually, I should say that this hour of Slack

280
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,920
is produced by, uh, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang

281
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,380
and also Sister Susie the Floozy

282
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,060
of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse in WREK Atlanta.

283
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,660
The beautiful and voluptuous Sister Susie the Floozy

284
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,540
who actually does look about the way

285
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,740
you would think, uh, colla...

286
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,560
did most of that amazing collage that we've been hearing

287
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,880
and we will hear plenty more of it, dear friends.

288
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,120
Be... you can be sure of that, uh,

289
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,120
from her, uh, show on WREK in Atlanta.

290
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,800
Praise Atlanta.

291
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,160
We're gonna be doing a show in Atlanta May 10th.

292
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,700
I'll give you these instructions on that later on.

293
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,040
We're all gonna quench suicide,

294
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,040
drink vodka, take the bat pudding antidote,

295
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,160
and it's gonna be great, man!

296
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,060
But what we've been listening to,

297
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,940
aside from, uh, the collage from Susie

298
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,480
and, uh, a little bit of...

299
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,360
stuff I recorded,

300
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,880
the stuff I recorded, friends,

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,480
happened to feature...

302
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,900
Well, uh, at one point you heard

303
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,140
Reverend Emot Zipold of Cosmic Triad,

304
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,420
who you hear him playing in the back.

305
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,180
We'll hear more of...

306
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,060
He was interviewed.

307
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,020
He's a subgenius minister here.

308
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,040
Was interviewed by local news

309
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,780
because he had had some involvement

310
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,540
with that other cult, the rival cult.

311
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,040
And the call to, uh, talk to the nation,

312
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,740
I believe it is.

313
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,220
It's an NPR talk show,

314
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,140
very stuffed shirt, sort of clueless bunch.

315
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
Um, we had a lot of...

316
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,020
A lot of people called us up,

317
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,180
emailed us about that.

318
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,420
Oh, there was this pink boy.

319
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,160
It was all concern.

320
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,700
Friends, that was...

321
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,840
You, our Slack listeners,

322
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,560
will of course recognize the voice

323
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,160
of Father Joe Mama,

324
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,860
uh, a great, great prankster.

325
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,860
And yes, it is sad and tragic

326
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,220
and everything what happened

327
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,000
to those... those people.

328
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,880
But, you know, I think it's time for me...

329
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,120
Let's just go into the comparisons here.

330
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,400
I'll pull this background music.

331
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,940
I'll pull this background music down

332
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,860
to a soft rug.

333
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,640
It's my...

334
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,340
See, I don't have any...

335
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,160
I'm like a crazy little cult member here.

336
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,100
I don't have an engineer working with me.

337
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,740
Praise Bob.

338
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,000
But let's take a look at this.

339
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,880
Coincidence or conspiracy?

340
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,580
Heaven's Gate?

341
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
A cult full of computer geeks on the Internet.

342
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,140
Subgenius?

343
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,340
Cult full of computer geeks.

344
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,240
On the Internet.

345
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,900
Heaven's Gate?

subgenius in our case puzzling evidence

425
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,720
left for the police

426
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,360
Heaven's Gate 39 people were involved

427
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,400
in the entire cult suicide

428
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,360
in the church of the subgenius only 39

429
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,560
bothered to wake up for the cult suicide

430
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,640
drill in one place

431
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,340
Heaven's Gate stole a great list of keywords

432
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,820
from the Zeta Reticulin website and so did we

433
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,620
we had that same great list of keywords

434
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,520
had them there for a year

435
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,220
friends for all this time we've been sapping off

436
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,920
anybody who would be lured to the Heaven's Gate site

437
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,400
this is during the last year

438
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,220
we had the same keywords they had equal chance

439
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,080
of landing on the subgenius website

440
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,100
have you heard about any subgeniuses killing themselves

441
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,140
ok

442
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,620
ok

443
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:45,620


444
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:45,620


445
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,240
I'm not sure if you've heard that

446
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,200
in the open Heaven's Gate the leader says he's Jesus

447
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,920
well I got news for those stupid cultists

448
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,260

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,120
Reverend Emot Ziphole appeared on sleazy local news reports about the cult

452
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,700
now how can that be hmm

453
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,040
Heaven's Gate people want to become greys

454
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,540
subgeniuses want to enslave the greys

455
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,300
Heaven's Gate website's VRML doesn't work and neither does ours

456
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,960
Heaven's Gate and the Church of the Subgenius are both hilariously funny

457
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,940
and are both deadly serious

458

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,060
Heaven's Gate shed their containers to board T's cruise ship

488
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,820
comers.

489
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,340
Yes, dear friends,

490
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,280
and we're going to fly

491
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,540
away to the escape vessels of the

492
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,520
Sun's Goddesses, but friends, we are

493
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,380
not like those poor

494
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,480
cult zombies. I mean,

495
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,660
not really. I mean, sure, we call

496
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,660
the pinks, they call the pinks norms

497
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,260
just like we do, although I bet

498
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,020
in private they probably said normworms

499
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,480
or something more derogatory.

500
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,560
And they talked

501
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,700
about casting off the meat shell,

502
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,700
but they only took parts...

503
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,260
Huh? Oh, goodbye.

504
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
Goodbye, there went the last

505
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,540
of the... But now,

506
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,240
friends, I guess they found out

507
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,200
the hard way what we've

508
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,320
been trying to tell people all this time,

509
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,060
which is that the greys

510
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,040
are not your friends.

511
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,860
I'm sorry,

512
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,700
the greys are not your friends.

513
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,000
Dobbs predicted that this comment would prove

514
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,940
that alien attackers were in

515
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,100
route to enslave all the

516
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,640
non-believers who should indeed

517
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,280
kill themselves to escape gruesome

518
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,820
torture, and of course this

519
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,560
so-called higher source was

520
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,980
specifically mentioned in the prediction.

521
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,900
But these

522
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,680
geniuses, they

523
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,480
thought they

524
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,500
were going to get to become

525
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,840
greys. They actually wanted

526
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,980
to become greys. Friends, that's like wanting to become

527
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,480
a bug.

528
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
Now, seriously,

529
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,520
if

530
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,960
at the X-Day drill

531
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,760
this July 5th, 1997,

532
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,860
if we suggest

533
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,060
that everybody, oh,

534
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,200
lay down in a

535
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,900
sort of a giant star pattern

536
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,480
on the field and put these

537
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,620
cloths over your heads

538
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,620
and, you know, just take a nap,

539
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,660
don't worry and don't get all excited

540
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,740
if you hear strange noises. We're probably just

541
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,900
filming one of those funny, fake,

542
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,520
you know, Bobby's

543
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,620
execution scenes like we did

544
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,860
last year at the drill for the

545
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,680
7... We like to send that footage to the

546
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,820
700 Club and just freak them out.

547
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,400
You know, that's all we're trying to do, friends.

548
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,400
But I'll tell you, I will, I must

549
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,380
admit, when Jesus first heard

550
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,840
the news on the radio

551
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,220
about a mass suicide of a house

552
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,100
full of cult members, all male, all

553
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,140
dressed alike, working at

554
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,600
computers in rows,

555
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,800
with a website full of aliens

556
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,220
and flying saucers,

557
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,140
Jesus had his fingers crossed, friends,

558
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,280
that it was subgenius

559
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,820
as he really did. He was praying

560
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,260
to his father, which, believe me,

561
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,000
he rarely does, that when they

562
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,200
lifted those purple shrouds in front

563
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,440
of the TV cameras,

564
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,340
that they'd find everybody wearing

565
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,840
a Dobbshead

566
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,800
t-shirt.

567
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,480
Now, friends, certainly

568
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,140
death is tragic,

569
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,160
and I certainly wouldn't want to make

570
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,460
fun of those dumbasses if somebody else

571
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,320
had done it to them, but one must consider

572
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,800
the good riddance factor.

573
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,040
You'd have to be a pretty

574
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,360
spoiled, self-centered jerk to begin

575
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,380
with to feel so vastly superior

576
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,700
to everyone else

577
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,180
that you'd even start to fall

578
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,920
for this. You are a...

579
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,720
a mistreated

580
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,500
god line of

581
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:15,940
crap.

582
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,820
Present company excluded,

583
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,460
of course.

584
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

585
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,720
and before I go on any farther, and we actually will get

586
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,620
quite serious about this presently,

587
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,160
friends, I have to play...

588
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,380
Is there time at the end of this side?

589
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,840
Perhaps? Jehovah Hates

590
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,780
Fred, in their cover version of that

591
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,760
great old Denslow song, Take Me

592
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,800
Off to Space.

593
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,800
Yes, thank you.

594
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,800
Take needles in my

595
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,860
belly, take samples of my

596
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,640
skin. I don't care

597
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,960
so long as I can live with Saucerman.

598
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,020
I know that you don't

599
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,820
take quests, but I'm a special

600
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,740
case. So come on down,

601
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,780
you Saucerman, and take me off

602
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,820
to space. Take me off

603
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,840
to space. Take me off

604
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,860
to space. Come on down,

605
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,840
you Saucerman, and take me off

606
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,860
to space. Take me off

607
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,800
to space. Take me off

608
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,760
to space. Come on down,

609
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,740
you Saucerman, and take me off

610
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,640
to space. Take cattle, you

611
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,740
gladers, let me join

612
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,820
your crew. Give me a knife,

613
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,720
you bet your life, I'll cut up cows

614
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,760
for you. I don't care

615
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,680
if you're some kind of fiend without

616
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,700
a face. So come on down,

617
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
you Saucerman, and take me off

618
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,840
to space. Take me off

619
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
to space. Take me off

620
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,800
to space. Come on down,

621
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,760
you Saucerman, and take me off

622
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,740
to space. Take me off

623
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,700
to space. Take me off

624
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
to space. Come on down,

625
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,720
you Saucerman, and take me off

626
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,700
to space. Down, you tiny

627
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,580
robots with your little nipper

628
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,860
claws. You pale and bug-eyed

629
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,700
aliens with wide and plenty

630
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,720
paws. Life is just

631
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,500
a sucker's dream and death is

632
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,640
a disgrace. So come on down,

633
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,780
you Saucerman, and take me off

634
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,740
to space. Oh, take me off

635
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,760
to space. Take me off

636
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,680
to space. Come on down,

637
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,720
you Saucerman, and take me off

638
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,620
to space. Yeah! Take me off

639
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,740
to space. Take me off

640
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,740
to space. Come on down,

641
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,840
you Saucerman, and take me off

642
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,600
to space.

643
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,000
Woo! Woo-hoo!

644
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,100
Yeah!

645
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,360
Woo!

646
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,000
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

647
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh, man!

648
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,220
Superior mutants.

649
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,980
Repent. Quit your

650
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,840
job. Black off.

651
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,880
We might not be

652
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,080
a joke, but it's

653
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,780
a joke.

Yeah, but there's been...

681
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:49,420
In honor of our dearly departed 39 brothers and sisters,

682
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,140
although not members of the subgenius,

683
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,520
for if they were members, they would know what dumbasses they really were.

684
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,400
No, Doug Wellman, I don't know what he is right now.

685
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,040
We don't object to what they've done.

686
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,060
We think they've just done it a little early.

687
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,320
We believe that the space vessels of the sex goddesses

688
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:17,900
will return to this earth July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m.

689
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,400
What do they look like?

690
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,140
No, you do not have to leave your flesh vessel.

691
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,840
The spaceships will pick you up in your entirety.

692
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,240
Leave the plastic bags at home.

693
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:32,640
Yeah.

694
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,160
Please, no video cameras.

695
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,500
They will be destroyed.

696
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,300
Athletics.

697
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,660
Outdoor.

698
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,300
Take them to your car.

699
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,500
No audio gates.

700
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,520
I can tell you how much you look like.

701
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,320
There's a waffy there.

702
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,620
No, but we're going to sweep.

703
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,480
A priceless.

704
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,140
It will sweep across the earth at 7 a.m.,

705
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,220
which is great for us because we can watch a destruction on television.

706
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,760
Where's my purchase ticket?

707
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,020
Will Bob be there?

708
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,460
I'm the prince of truth.

709
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,280
Will the Bob be there?

710
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,340
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

711
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,060
Tickets are for sale.

712
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,500
That's around my shirt.

713
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:09,500


714
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,200
Thank you.

715
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,660
Am I getting royalties on that?

716
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:11,960
No.

717
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,820
Um, actually, yeah, it's in the mail.

718
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,520
Oh, thank you.

719
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,140
I've been waiting for that royalty check for all the Jesus paraphernalia for a long time.

720
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:27,640
We're listening to Jesus' sermon to the line at the Survival Research Laboratory show in Austin last weekend.

721
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:37,720
Three cult members, by the way, had done SRL's website and were actually killed in the Survival Research Labs show.

722
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,480
And we're going to get a copy of that.

723
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,060
Thank you Bob Dobbs.

724
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,800
Thanks you Bob.

725
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,580
We're going to get this idea.

726
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,160
That's kind of best known, and it has to be this year.

727
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,160


728
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,500
I'm going to know.

729
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,680
So, we want to know how we're going to do it.

730
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,080
We they said before we request you to review a new version of the movie.

731
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,760
Uh, Chris Dillard in the epキ Olympicvinacera.

732
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:57,920
pillar, not blood essay in there already, not a conveyor belt, not remember's love symbol,

733
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,400
so, um, that was Blake.

734
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,400


735
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,400


736
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Uh, it's pretty fun.

737
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,400


738
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,900
Did you watch our first movie?

739
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,680
They got a little string and I'm a little sad about theirumbs.

740
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,460
Oh, ha ha.

741
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:16,400
And it has always been the mission of Bob's Church to get you to the punchline alive.

742
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,980
And we don't mean the Jonestown punchline.

743
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,080
You know, sure, we're waiting for the saucers too.

744
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:30,540
But as Dr. Lakew put it, we're happy to wait at the corner for the bus with our corners in our pockets.

745
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,460
We don't feel we have to jump out into the path of the oncoming bus.

746
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:42,500
And, you know, sure, we'll shed our containers in 450-some-odd days.

747
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:51,300
But when the pigs find our meat shells, it'll be more like the 39,000 bodies were all wearing Timex wristwatches,

748
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,640
Reebok's shoes, Levi's jeans.

749
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:02,720
Each had an unopened back of camel-like cigarettes and was clutching an empty Dr. Pepper can.

750
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,440
Dr. Grabow pipes were clad.

751
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,900
They were clenched in each dead jaw.

752
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:13,840
And Smith & Wesson revolvers had to be pried out of all their cold, dead fingers.

753
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,980
Uh, yes, friends, it's true.

754
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,600
We do, we do indeed make fun.

755
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,940
But what I want to talk about right this minute, before we go back to the funny stuff,

756
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,940
I want to talk about the cult that makes Heaven's Gate look harmless.

757
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,800
And I ain't talking about Church of the Subgenius.

758
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,220
Because more disgusting...

759
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,180
than mockers like me,

760
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,780
or dumbasses like the Heaven's Gate people,

761
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,640
are the pompous, pious, pink pundits

762
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,000
that are oozing out of every op-ed page and talk show,

763
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:59,760
indulging in a veritable orgy of self-congratulation about how sane and normal they are,

764
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,820
and their good religion.

765
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,740
Now, the really hip ones go,

766
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,180
Well, no.

767
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,440
Some will blame me.

768
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,160
Some will blame the Internet.

769
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,780
But I'm too cool to blame the Internet.

770
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,120
I... I'm on AOL now.

771
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,100
Uh, but of course the real cause is the breakdown of family values.

772
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,040
Blah, blah, woof, woof.

773
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:25,940
And the biggest difference between Heaven's Gate and mainstream Christianity, friends,

774
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,340
is that the Heaven's Gate people never tried to brainwash my kids.

775
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,820
They stayed out of my face.

776
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,300
If you were interested, you could look them up on the web.

777
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:45,220
The Heaven's Gate people didn't feel they had to take over a dozen radio and TV stations here in Dallas alone.

778
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,880
They didn't have to have entire cable networks devoted to their particular superstition.

779
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,740
So they shunned sex.

780
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,620
Millions of Christians, called nuns, priests, and losers, are the same way.

781
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,520
And so 39 of them killed themselves.

782
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:13,300
At least they didn't kill millions of non-believers, burn all them witches, torture free thinkers, and so forth and so on.

783
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:19,280
So the cultists think some spaceship full of gods is gonna come save them.

784
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:25,660
Well, Christians, Jews, Muslims, and just about everybody else believes in an invisible monster

785
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:31,000
that will help you out if you kiss its almighty invisible butt.

786
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,060
And why do they believe all this?

787
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,580
Why?

788
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,720
Because they read it in a book, or some really sincere person told them all about it.

789
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,000
And just listen to these pinks drone on and on and on, worse than I'm doing now,

790
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:53,340
about those poor, deluded cultists, as if they themselves were somehow any different.

791
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,940
Now, I'm not talking about Christian nuts like Bob Larson and Jerry Falwell.

792
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,800
I mean, you expect it from clowns like them.

793
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,200
I hardly need to comment on the...

794
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,880
on Pat Robertson sitting there on the 700 Club playing with little pumpkins

795
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,040
and talking about how silly those cultists are.

796
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,480
I'm talking about your standard, everyday, middle-of-the-road commentator,

797
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,720
your letters to the editor-writer, your average, good American, God-fearing, religious hypocrite.

798
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,980
They are every jot and tittle

799
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,560
as vain and silly as Doe and his followers

800
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,200
and have caused infinitely more trouble.

801
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,100
And now I have to put up with listening to their condescending garbage

802
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,940
every time I check the news.

803
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,000
While all it boils down to is this.

804
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,580
See, my invisible monster's bigger than your invisible monster.

805
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,660
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

806
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,840
My invisible monster didn't kill me.

807
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,180
He's a good invisible monster.

808
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,260
And all the rest of us normal people, we all believe in the same invisible monster.

809
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,760
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

810
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,060
Friends, the cultists make me sick.

811
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,080
But the normals make me sicker.

812
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,260
And as screwed up as those Heaven's Gate idiots were,

813
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,400
oft-times, I think I'd rather be a dead weirdo than a live normal.

814
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
Praise Herf.

815
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,060
And I've said my piece there.

816
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,440
Let's go to Suzy the Floozy's incredible, incredible show.

817
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,400
I have to remember to put Dolby on for this.

818
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,360
Take it off of Chrome.

819
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,800
Okay, let's see.

820
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:38,860
Yeah!

821
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,640
Oh, hey, seeker.

822
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,860
Is that a five dollar bill and a roll of quarters in your pocket?

823
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,820
Or are you just happy to see me?

824
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,080
Hello.

825
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,940
I'm that starry-eyed little smartass irreverent Suzy the Floozy.

826
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,460
And let me point out that I am not from that particular deranged saucer cult that you think.

827
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,400
No.

828
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:20,080
I and Bob Slacktime Funhouse here represent J.R. Bob Dobbs and his Church of the Sub-Tunes.

829
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,820
Make a note of it.

830
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,420
Please make a note of it.

831
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,740
Oh, because it's getting to where you'll need a scorecard to keep track of all the lunatics that are popping up.

832
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,040
All the insane developments of the past few days have dictated that I throw out the show that I plan to do tonight.

833
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:49,160
And to labor all day today, intensively, desperately, to bring you seekers the cutting edge, up to the minute truth that you deserve about what's going on right now.

834
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,800
Oh, hey, look.

835
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Another eclipse.

836
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,600
Wow.

837
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,320
Ain't this some weather we're having lately?

838
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,560
Oh, but what about all the apocalyptic rhetoric on the news lately, seekers?

839
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,180
Oh, doesn't it all sound a little too familiar?

840
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,480
Right down to the flying saucers and the pudding?

841
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,560
Oh, it smells like the Church of the Sub-Tunes all over, but the names and the faces are all wrong somehow.

842
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,140
Oh, yeah.

843
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,780
It was a different deranged saucer cult all along.

844
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:21,780


845
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,660
Oh, yeah.

846
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,960
One in San Diego, not Dallas.

847
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:31,060
Oh, and to pull the magic flying carpet out from under the fluses' high-heeled feet.

848
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,160
Oh, I was wrong.

849
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:40,000
Because it turned out to be a different San Diego-based deranged saucer cult than I had thought.

850
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,340
Oh, I mean, what are the chances of that happening?

851
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,220
Oh, yes, silly me.

852
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,780
I thought it had to be a radical splinter group of saucer nut acolytes of Ruth Norris.

853
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:51,780


854
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,020
And of course, the P.J.

855
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,320
Con lanein' oldorman and her E Face Foundation.

856
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,080
You know, the one in the thrift store-rich suburb of El Cajon, California.

857
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:05,500
And, I mean, hey, it was logical, since that old Bat Youreal finally croaked a few years back.

858
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:14,120
And, oh, I knew they didn't stand a chance of holding together without that pink-haired superannuated old mummy figurehead from Liberace's trailer park.

859
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:14,620
Huh?

860
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,600
I mean, you just can't fake disco glitter style like that.

861
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:29,240
But dang, it seems like alien contact cults are popping up like cosmic crack houses.

862
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,740
Haven't they given serious thought to what they're doing with their hilltop beacons and shortwave signals?

863
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:42,960
At best, aliens might have as low a gag threshold for cosmic sweetness and light crap as I do.

864
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,560
Or they might find out that Klaatu Barada Nikto means,

865
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,000
Hey, Gort, rip off my head and suck down my tasty sap.

866
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,880
Oh, but I guess that's for them to find out.

867
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,980
Anyway, the logical upshot of this is that there will be the inevitable trendy suicide vogue.

868
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,100
Hey, I'm in favor of it.

869
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,420
Any way of winnowing down the horde, I always say.

870
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,940
But I'm afraid the side effect of this will be harming...

871
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,020
Of course for us, Seekers.

872
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:20,420
For the glaring light of a paranoid police state will be turned on all mutants as a result of this brouhaha.

873
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,680
Oh, yeah, because of this little copycat cult.

874
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,000
Our basic ironclad tenant of deliverance from space...

875
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,760
The very foundation of our faith as subgenius...

876
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,260
Will be assaulted, ridiculed, and dismissed as being mere bandwagon-jumping...

877
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,760
And the Church of the Subgenius, as a whole,

878
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,940
...will be regarded as the...

879
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,320
Just another bunch of blathering, feel-good, newage alien huggers.

880
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,700
Oh, you don't think so?

881
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,280
Just look at the current video poster, children for off-planet migration.

882
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,080
Oh, those astro-loonies were talking like Christians.

883
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:09,820
And that Star Trek holodeck metaphor spoutin' guy really pushed everybody's credibility over the edge.

884
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:17,240
Oh, and the best they had to offer as a leader was the poor man's Dr. Tim Marshall Applewhite.

885
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:17,880
Go.

886
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,540
No Reverend Ivan Stang for them, no, sir.

887
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,280
And what's worse, no Bob.

888
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,920
They died without Bob, seekers.

889
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:37,080
Yeah, I do have to respect them for trying to attain the level above human, but they're going about it the wrong way entirely.

890
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,380
I mean, Bob.

891
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,000
Bob won't make you give up your testicles.

892
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,820
Well, not both of them anyway.

893
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,920
No, far from it.

894
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:53,800
The only surgery we usually do on our initiates is just the routine opening of your third nostril, but...

895
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,600
Oh, that's not real painful.

896
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,920
Well, not fatal, at any rate.

897
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:05,640
And after you recover from our rituals, you can really use your equipment if you know what I mean.

898
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,360
Unlike those tacky publicity-grabbing fly-by-the-windows.

899
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,360


900
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,200
Oh, and you don't have to give anything up, seekers.

901
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:19,520
In fact, it's better for you if you actually acquire more vices.

902
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,080
Oh, unlike those poor saps out in California.

903
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,340
Oh, man.

904
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:38,260
I mean, once you cut off cigarettes and booze and drugs and sex and testicles, I guess suicide doesn't look too bad as a viable option.

905
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,940
Oh, yeah, we don't make subgeniuses commit ritual suicide.

906
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,320
Just ritual career suicide like me.

907
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,820
What's more, we offer eternal salvation or triple your money back.

908
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,760
And it's so simple.

909
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,920
You're not gonna get a crick in your neck looking for the star of Barflehem or anything.

910
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,100
All you have to do is have your subgenius membership card in your pocket come next day.

911
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,060
So write for your ticket off-planet and avoid the rush.

912
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:24,060
Write to Bob at P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

913
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,680
And be sure to Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob!

914
00:44:40,920 --> 00:45:00,040
Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob!

915
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,240
Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob!

916
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,240
Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob!

917
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,480
Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob!

918
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:02,540
Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! 올라i!

919
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:08,060
cosine Bob! UI Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob!

920
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:08,080
Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Hail Bob! Happy Bob! Hail Bob!

921
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,260
That's not on our playlist.

922
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,920
And by the way, you sound great over the phone.

923
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,040
Anyway, if you give us your request, we'll be glad to play it for you, babe.

924
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,280
So let's hear it.

925
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,400
We are observing your earth.

926
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,660
Oh, listen, Micah, I'm sorry, babe, but we can...

927
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,280
And we'd like to make...

928
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,300
I'm sorry, Micah, we...

929
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,320
...a contact with you.

930
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,020
Ready?

931
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:30,380
Ready?

932
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,540
In your mind you have capacities you know.

933
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,460
To tell a path messages through the vast unknown.

934
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:50,160
Please close your eyes and concentrate with every thought you think.

935
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:57,660
Upon the recitation we're about to say.

936
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,920
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft.

937
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:14,960
Calling occupants of interplanetary most extraordinary craft.

938
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,320
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft.

939
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,020
Open the auto-dose.

940
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,980
Enclose the earth's vessel.

941
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,060
Absoluting concentration.

942
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,240
Intermittent meditation.

943
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,920
Sha-sha-sha-sha-sha.

944
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,420
Sha-sha-sha-sha-sha.

945
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:45,320
It's a totally different energy.

946
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,280
It's what I believe.

947
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,040
I was just standing in the air.

948
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,060
You are us upon the auto-dose.

949
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,020
I was just standing in the air.

950
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,920
And you are not alone

951
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,720
And you are not alone

952
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,260
Remember it's true

953
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,980
It's true

954
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,060
It's true

955
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,620
It's true

956
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,240
I wonder where we will be in the year 2000

957
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,580
I think I'll be on the moon

958
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,100
We'll title this tape

959
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,740
Planet Earth

960
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,500
About to be recycled

961
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,780
Your only chance to evacuate

962
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,220
Is to leave with us

963
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,340
Write me here in my award winning communication trailer

964
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,040
Spill it

965
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,800
Space Nyan

966
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,440
Blue Mouse Trailer Resort

967
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,620
Hellmouth, California

968
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,960
Nyan 0666

969
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,020
Dogs flew spaceships

970
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,140
The Aztecs invented the vacations

971
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,940
Men and women are the same sex

972
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,760
Our forefathers took drugs

973
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,980
Your brain is not the boss

974
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,820
Yes, that's right

975
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,420
Everything you know is wrong

976
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,380
Sounds fair

977
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,920
Toodle-oo everybody

978
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,260
I'll scream when the comet gets here

979
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,580
Oh, I'm coming with you, Nettie

980
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:07,900
No

981
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,280
No, sweetheart

982
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,800
You, you stay here because

983
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,080
Okay

984
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,260
Terrific news

985
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:13,560
Yeah?

986
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,880
They told me it's alright to talk about them

987
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,460
They did?

988
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,540
Now listen, they want contact with you

989
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,180
With me?

990
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,500
Yeah, something's gonna happen

991
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,340
Have you received any messages lately?

992
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,040
Oh, messages?

993
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,660
No, not out here

994
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,500
Oh, hey, on my message

995
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,140
On my phone, my answer phone

996
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,740
Yeah, okay

997
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,220
You're a gal here

998
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,460
I am so happy to see you this day

999
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,760
At this time

1000
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,260
When you have such a

1001
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,220
Vital and important

1002
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,600
Decision to make

1003
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,660
So I have come

1004
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,280
To try to help you

1005
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,400
But that sounds intriguing, you know

1006
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,720
Yeah, sure

1007
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,360
He couldn't be

1008
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,000
This is it, this is it, Nino

1009
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,840
This is it

1010
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,540
This is real dance music

1011
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,300
No, that's my, that's my voice, though

1012
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,060
This is the seeker

1013
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,240
The truth speaker

1014
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,000
You know

1015
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,240
Okay, if this is them

1016
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,260
I'll, I'll accept it

1017
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:58,940
You were right all along

1018
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,900
But you know that, you know

1019
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,000
Oh, no, it's this

1020
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,700
We proved it, look, there's

1021
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,020
Oh, Nino, I'm sorry

1022
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:03,540
It's this kid

1023
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,140
That's pretty strange, you know

1024
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,400
No, no, it's just a kid

1025
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,200
This kid is really strange, you know

1026
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,520
Crazy

1027
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,720
He calls me all the time

1028
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,360
There's 14 seekers of us now

1029
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,120
And we're all coming out

1030
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,780
In the heavenly bus

1031
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,580
Oh, yeah

1032
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,060
I gotta go

1033
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,380
He just really admires me

1034
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:14,520
And

1035
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,060
Yeah, yeah, okay

1036
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,980
That's not it, okay

1037
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,760
No, here it comes

1038
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,920
Are you a friend of Jimmy Carter?

1039
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,360
Am I what?

1040
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,480
Are you a friend?

1041
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,600
Well, ladies, stop over here

1042
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,820
I've, I've, you know

1043
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,880
Been to his house a few times

1044
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,480
Well, you know

1045
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,240
Jimmy Carter says

1046
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,040
He's elected president

1047
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,720
By the international so-and-so

1048
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,800
Which means

1049
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,020
They are taking

1050
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,760
Over a one-world government

1051
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,180
Yeah

1052
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,900
They blew one planet up

1053
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,200
Yeah

1054
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,520
The planet Maldek

1055
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,940
They blew up Maldek?

1056
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,860
Well, all I have to say

1057
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,080
You're full of bulls**t

1058
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,640
If I see you again

1059
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,460
You won't be in the body

1060
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,000
Really?

1061
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,180
I've got friends

1062
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,700
And I'm an American

1063
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,400
He's waving your cane at me

1064
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,500
Okay, take it easy there

1065
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,360
They'll spoil it

1066
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,800
Like they spoiled everything

1067
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,520
Ladies and gentlemen

1068
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,320
It is an official release

1069
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,440
Of the Bible

1070
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,540
I quote

1071
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,080
Suddenly there was a threat

1072
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,740
To this world

1073
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,880
From some other species

1074
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,540
From another planet

1075
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,360
Outside in the universe

1076
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,540
We would forget

1077
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,000
All the little local differences

1078
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,440
That we have between our countries

1079
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,860
And we would find out

1080
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,960
Once and for all

1081
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,360
That we really are human beings

1082
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,600
We're human beings

1083
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,420
That's it

1084
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,520
At this time

1085
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,520
The Earthman has been killed

1086
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,280
And has practically forgotten

1087
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,940
All about we brothers

1088
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,040
For he has indeed succumbed

1089
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,080
To the dark forces

1090
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,660
Of ego, lust, and materialism

1091
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,580
For if you are not progressing upwards

1092
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,120
With we brothers of the light

1093
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,980
Then you are regressing downwards

1094
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,660
With those of the dark

1095
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,240
But we lighted ones know

1096
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,220
That within all man

1097
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,000
There exists a spark

1098
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,920
That truly wishes

1099
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,540
To grow

1100
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,160
And expand out

1101
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,760
From these dark old ways

1102
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,580
Of the past

1103
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,700
Sounds fair

1104
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,560
I feel this good feeling

1105
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,620
Within me

1106
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,140
Yet I do not know why

1107
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,180
Yes dear brother

1108
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,300
This good feeling

1109
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,680
Is our love

1110
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,800
And understanding

1111
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,640
Which we bring from our world

1112
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,820
To you

1113
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,460
expensive

1114
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:57,040
Essentially twist I knew

1115
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,500
And large parts will resonate

1116
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:02,500


1117
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,540
Man's edges after meeting

1118
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,640
I see we pay that

1119
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:04,860
In the minute

1120
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,760
to face, to face, to face, to face, to face.

1121
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,520
Report, Burt Lake.

1122
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,920
The minerals you seek are at the bottom of Lake Timberlake.

1123
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,820
Good.

1124
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,780
We will need human slaves to begin mining immediately.

1125
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:21,740
Slaves?

1126
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,300
With this planet as a mineral supply,

1127
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,240
we can easily dominate the entire galaxy.

1128
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,340
We've got to stop them.

1129
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,600
Taloka.

1130
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,400
Tambo.

1131
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,680
Good idea.

1132
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,520
Here, you hide and I'll get them to come out.

1133
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,440
So there you are.

1134
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,200
Here I come.

1135
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:40,900
Hi there.

1136
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,520
Susie.

1137
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:44,740
Dad!

1138
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,780
Susie!

1139
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,280
Zorad points his hand at him and suddenly,

1140
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,420
Wild Boy is engulfed by a yellow cloud and is frozen in place.

1141
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,860
Susie screams and backs away, but they see her.

1142
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,200
You heard me.

1143
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,020
They're alien replicants from beyond the moon.

1144
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,040
Yeah, right, pal.

1145
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,580
There comes a time in Eastman's life

1146
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,380
when he can't even believe his own eyes.

1147
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,960
Saucers seen over Hollywood.

1148
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,500
Flying saucers seen over Washington, D.C.

1149
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,360
Flying saucers, Captain, are still a rumor.

1150
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:31,200
Officially.

1151
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,360
They're flying.

1152
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:34,880
They're flying.

1153
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,440
It looks like we beat them off again, sir.

1154
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,640
What do they want?

1155
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,680
Where are they from?

1156
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,480
Where are they going?

1157
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,460
They, sir?

1158
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,200
Who?

1159
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,640
Now, this is a training maneuver, sir.

1160
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,840
We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.

1161
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,420
While I don't want to sanction stupidity,

1162
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,320
as our national sport still I have to admire,

1163
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,880
this little man's dogged nerve and rubber determination.

1164
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,280
Yes, it's a small step for this square little fellow,

1165
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,140
but he's taking a big fall for all mankind.

1166
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
This is Pat Hatt.

1167
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,020
Pat Hatt here by the big hole

1168
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,060
had parked his well outside Curio, Arizona.

1169
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,680
It's bound to bring out the curious and the kooky,

1170
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,360
don't you think, Ray?

1171
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,900
Well, it's brought a lot of experts to the area

1172
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,820
and increased activity in the Air Force from nearby Ghost Harbour.

1173
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,200
That's very good for the economy, as we all know.

1174
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,060
Good training for the boys.

1175
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,260
Uh, Mr. Suggins, did you see a flying saucer?

1176
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,120
Uh, could you describe it to us, sir?

1177
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,060
Yes, I can.

1178
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,660
I was standing there, I was just putting in cement bags up there,

1179
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,300
and I see them.

1180
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,200
I mean, this huge thing is all orange and red and green,

1181
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,020
it's cigar-shaped, oblong,

1182
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,240
and, uh, there's a face of some, my God,

1183
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,280
it's the most frightening thing I've ever seen in my life.

1184
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,220
Massive eyes and hair and tail.

1185
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,620
And, uh, and I don't drink.

1186
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,880
I don't drink, really.

1187
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,000
Don't smoke.

1188
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,880
So I know that. I had my faculties.

1189
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,720
I seen that thing.

1190
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,180
I said, by God, you better not come near here.

1191
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,540
It's out of cold cock if you do.

1192
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,780
Who could blame it for not wanting to stay?

1193
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,700
It wasn't made to feel very welcome.

1194
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,800
We laughed at its flying saucers.

1195
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,340
Who needed them?

1196
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,740
But it, and all the other its,

1197
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,360
tried so hard to get with us.

1198
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,880
To be liked for itself alone.

1199
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,760
It came from outer space,

1200
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,940
with love in its heart.

1201
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,000
So sad.

1202
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,560
When those spiritual wells of light and love,

1203
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,500
all the flowers and trees and brook,

1204
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,820
they extend this love to you as you pass them by.

1205
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,100
It is a beautiful and happy and joyous way to live,

1206
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:50,880
Zandh,

1207
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,120
and you would never want to return to your earth world

1208
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,720
of warring and hatred and resentment

1209
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,240
after you once had a peek into these beautiful worlds

1210
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,600
of ours, of the inner.

1211
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,860
And so,

1212
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:08,900
we are offering you our hand of acceptance and of love.

1213
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,880
That you will come with us now.

1214
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:17,540
Make the decision that you are through with these physical ways of reaction,

1215
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,020
resentment, and all the undesirable traits of man.

1216
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,740
On these inner worlds of life and love,

1217
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,140
we do all things with our minds.

1218
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:33,700
We do not need to use our hands to earn our way and livelihood.

1219
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,500
And this is all part of a progressive evolution,

1220
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,280
which is now your opportunity.

1221
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,520
And that you must make the decision and make the choice

1222
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:50,980
for you can move forward on this ever-progressive evolutionary pathway

1223
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,560
with three brothers at your side,

1224
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,760
helping you in all your ways.

1225
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,500
And, Dan, you may feel as though you have many, many enemies,

1226
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,800
but you know there is only one true enemy,

1227
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,040
and that is...

1228
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,460
We're doomed!

1229
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,060
Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet?

1230
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,580
It's going to be destroyed.

1231
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,520
Didn't you hear what that guy in the building said?

1232
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,020
But, Dad, don't you think...

1233
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,080
Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials

1234
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,440
is so we don't have to think all the time.

1235
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,600
Just like that rainforest care.

1236
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,780
A few years back, our officials saw there was a problem

1237
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,120
and they fixed it, didn't they?

1238
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,540
No, Dad, I don't think...

1239
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,840
There's that word again.

1240
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,200
What do you think will be the next obstacle

1241
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,740
the Earth people will put in our way?

1242
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,920
Well, as long as they can think, we'll have our problems.

1243
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,440
But those whom we're using cannot think.

1244
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,380
They are the dead, brought to assimilated life by our electrodes.

1245
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,760
You know, it's an interesting thing when you consider

1246
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,520
the Earth people who can think are so frightened by those...

1247
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:03,720
They look to the water and see a diver in a wetsuit.

1248
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,180
He hands a burlap sack of ore to a man and a woman,

1249
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,760
who pass it stiffly to each other.

1250
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,480
They're both wearing pulsating green discs on the back of their necks.

1251
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,600
Finally, they pass the bag to Lucas, then to Susie,

1252
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,240
who drags it over to a pile of sacks where Thor and Zoran stand.

1253
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,400
This is the way they are going to get the minerals.

1254
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,920
Chrome talk, Monty.

1255
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:23,600
Susie.

1256
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:24,660
You're right.

1257
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,740
Somehow they control them all.

1258
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:37,380
And they sleepここ on these objects

1259
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:37,580
and move like they can't move.

1260
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:37,920
They're all ro mają cures d'airas.

1261
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:38,180
But you shouldn't encourage them.

1262
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,220
People only bring the arrows they've gathered up.

1263
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,340
I told you to leave them repeating.

1264
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,300
I'm hella whose knows that when it comes to Tä 착

1265
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:41,880
there IS someone who's been watching,

1266
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:41,920
but one doesn't, as everyone else has.

1267
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,520
However bad all the stars ostat.

1268
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:43,720
Some even go to space and explode.

1269
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,100
We've got friendship?

1270
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,080
Renovate.

1271
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:51,080


1272
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:51,080


1273
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,080
Resolve?

1274
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,500
Yes, .

1275
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,640
absolutely impossible to work through these earth creatures. Their soul is to control.

1276
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:07,980
Plan 9. Ah, yes. Plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead. Long-distance electrodes sharpen

1277
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:12,780
the pinion pituitary glands of recent dead. Have you attempted any of this plan as yet?

1278
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,460
Yes, I suppose so. How successful has it been? We have risen to so far. We shall be just

1279
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:26,680
as successful on more. The living may have no suspicion of your movements. We had to dispose

1280
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:32,060
of one policeman. However, none of those risen have been seen, at least not by anyone who still

1281
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:43,080
remains alive. Let me say that I spent a very brief time inside the residence. When I walked

1282
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:48,620
through there, I did not see the aliens and that type of thing. And I say aliens,

1283
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:56,060
more than two, possibly three or four, in various locations in the house. Minutes later,

1284
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:03,020
the police, led by Inspector Daniel Clay, arrived at the scene. Who found them? A man and girl.

1285
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:09,680
Medical examiner been around yet? Just left. The war dragon ought to be along most any time.

1286
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:17,160
Engines, seekers everywhere. I was right. Everything I knew was wrong. Turn over this

1287
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,400
record right now and get ready for our...

1288
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:23,800
Real shocker. The most important revelation in my life.

1289
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:32,360
All you over are idiots. You're stupid minds. Stupid. Stupid.

1290
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,580
What? Idiots? Who are you calling? Mr. Alien.

1291
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:44,140
Friends, the editing in all of this was by Sister Susie, the floozy, an incredible, incredible

1292
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:48,280
job. I never even got through all of it. It's going on and on in the background here. They're

1293
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,040
fighting and killing.

1294
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:53,300
But I can't stand that Star Trek music any longer. It's just insane. You've been listening

1295
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:58,860
to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack. Praise Bob. Hail Bob. Hail Bob. Hail Bob. And

1296
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,440
that's a post office box.

1297
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:07,320
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1298
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,560
And that's the way almost everybody leaves their phone numbers on my message machine.

1299
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:14,420
And that's why I don't call anybody back. Thank y'all.

1300
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:15,680
Sigh.

1301
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:16,660
Sigh.

1302
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,060
Sigh.

1303
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,080
Sigh.

1304
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,360
Sigh.

1305
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:18,660


1306
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:18,700


1307
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:18,720


1308
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,020
Sigh.

1309
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:19,020


1310
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:19,280
Sigh.

1311
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1312
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1313
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1314
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1315
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1316
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1317
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1318
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1319
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1320
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,440


1321
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:22,680

1322
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:23,220


1323
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:24,840
Oh.

1324
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,340
Peter Hellmouth and the Low Desert Area.

1325
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,180
Thank you.
