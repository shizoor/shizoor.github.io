1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
And yea, lo, as the end times increased in horror,

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,380
the true wisdom of Robert was destined,

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,880
inevitably destined to be followed by the divine stupidity of Bob.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,000
Bob!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,580
Bob!

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,140
This is KNON 19.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,240
Please Bob! Please Bob!

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,820
Oh yes, dear friends, this is Li Li Jing, the Chinese subgenius,

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,440
and you are listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON in Dallas, Texas.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't know how you came by this record,

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,520
but you are now embarked upon a journey that must certainly lead you to change your life forever.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,340
If you were never a special person, you are a special person now.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,180
Hello seeker! Now don't feel alone here in the New Age, because there's a seeker born every minute.

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,060
Yes, I'm Dr. Happy Harry Cox, and call me happy because I am.

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,860
Because you're listening to another episode of the Hour of Slack.

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,720
Together in a series of my mind-breaking records,

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,860
Men Never Lived on Earth, which started off with I Came from Outer Space,

18
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,000
followed by Strangers at Our Door,

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,100
which includes the ultra-high-speed recording of real gas music from Jupiter.

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,520
If you haven't got them, buy them now.

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,180
I was right about the comet. Get them and see why.

22
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,500
Write me here in my award-winning communication trailer,

23
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:47,660
Space Nyon, Blue Mouse Trailer Resort, Hellmouth, California, Nyon 0666.

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,500
Dogs!

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:49,740
Dogs!

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,000
Blue Spaceships!

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,260
Blue SpaceX invented the vacations!

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,340
Men and women are the same sex!

29
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,260
Our forefathers took drugs!

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,540
Your brain is not the boss!

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,560
Yes, yes, that's right!

32
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,580
Everything you know is wrong!

33
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,280
Hello, seekers! Here we go again.

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:16,100
And hello, especially, to the skeptic inside you who might still believe that pigs live in trees

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,860
and that Faithful Rover is nothing but a pet sleeping by the doggie.

36
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,900
Well, doggone it, he's smarter than you'll ever be.

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:32,300
Yes, I've got proof here that his ancestors came from the Dog Star millions of years ago to rule the Earth.

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,240
He's been there.

39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,040
And you probably don't even know where you are.

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,500
Don't believe it? Well, listen to this.

41
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,220
Well, first I thought it was a big old dog.

42
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,560
Of course, the way it howled and how it had them big friendly eyes.

43
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,060
But I had to ask myself what the hell it was doing up in the graveyard,

44
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,080
digging up the ground with a shovel.

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,080
I thought I was crazy. I'm not a drinking man on duty, Mr. Cox, not me.

46
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,140
You know, I figured it was one of them werewolves that were having,

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,500
so I slipped a wooden load in my shotgun and then all of a sudden, now this is gonna sound crazy,

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,580
a big dark shape with flashing lights come up.

49
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,260
Over the top of the hill, that one right over there, it was about a hundred miles an hour.

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,400
This dog or wolf or whatever it was, it took off like a bug wrapper from that dry hump over there.

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,520
Hey, deputy, just a minute, will you?

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,240
I'm not a drinking man, Mr. Cox, I swear to hell I saw it.

53
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,820
That was no crazed sterno-bum, but a respected law enforcement officer,

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,060
Sheriff Luger Axe Handle of Heater County, California.

55
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,660
And that wooden marker over the grave where the creature was digging?

56
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,040
It bore a mysterious inscription.

57
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
Much faded with time and wormholes, it read,

58
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,140
No name. Died 1897.

59
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,940
With this curious epitaph,

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,460
Not from around here, but a real square little feller.

61
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,820
Now, I tracked down this story to Lim Ash Haller,

62
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,220
who's editor of the Hellmouth Heater Democrat.

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,300
Back here someplace.

64
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
Well, it published monthly back then.

65
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,840
There's a lot happening, you know.

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, 1897.

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,980
It was a big yellow jacket epidemic.

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,600
That was very fashionable in those days.

69
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,600
April 19th.

70
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,080
Yeah, it was a bunch of funny storms.

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,480
Wait a minute, here it is.

72
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,780
April 19th, 1897.

73
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,520
Strange occurrence at Pockters Well.

74
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,020
Yeah.

75
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,180
This story pops up about every ten years or so.

76
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,120
Happened over in Curio, Arizona, about 20 miles to the other side of the river.

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,400
Yeah.

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,480
Yeah.

79
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,040
Came crawling out of a well wearing ladies shoes.

80
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,180
Didn't know what milk was.

81
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,120
Repeated everything anybody said.

82
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm reading it.

83
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,360
Real little, smooth like baby's feet, with big friendly eyes.

84
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,620
He sounds like a real nice guy.

85
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,900
Took him to the Swiss picnic for a good time,

86
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,360
and he choked to death on a piece of cheese.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
And then the end of the story.

88
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,580
Just coming over the line.

89
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,300
Curio, Arizona, crumbling remnant of the old west,

90
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,060
or could it be the final resting place of a little guy from outer space?

91
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,400
Could be, could be.

92
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,960
All I know is everything you know is wrong.

93
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,360
Think your children are as innocent as the new puppy next door.

94
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,580
Well, they know something you don't know.

95
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,060
They know that their American forefathers took drugs.

96
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,720
And you probably don't even know

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
where your father is.

98
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,420
Welcome, dear friends,

99
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,540
to the subgenius hour of sloth.

100
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,460
Sloth technically.

101
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:39,020
A sad, plain maneira de tsundere sloth there to tell you

102
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,580
how to например your father.

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,460
To say this to me is like spitting under the cap,

104
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:43,620


105
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:43,620


106
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:43,640
I'll show you more interesting stuff tomorrow.

107
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,100
I'll eat mayhem and shrimp meat

108
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,700
for the Henry Scott's family dinner in the city.

109
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,420
the deep stream floats on the surface,

110
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,820
like the ancient Egyptians floated on the current of their belief,

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,860
for they thought they would never die,

112
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,080
but be reborn as gargling sarcophagi,

113
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,900
horrible mummies to march across the earth

114
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,080
and wreak and spew vengeance.

115
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,160
Give me the pyroflagellator.

116
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,460
All of the little tiny dead deities

117
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,620
march down the side of the subgenius church

118
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,960
and now live their lives.

119
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,540
Within the great pyramid,

120
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,060
the secret chamber of the subgenius.

121
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,320
Oh, my God.

122
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,260
What light and steam come from the special effects department

123
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,580
located below the pyramid?

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,420
Here, inside the heart of the mighty structure,

125
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,560
puzzling evidence broadcasts

126
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,980
from the inner chamber of the great pyramid.

127
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,380
Yeah, I'll teach you all how to talk on the radio.

128
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:27,920
Come on down.

129
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,140
Yes, these giant pyramids are actually radio stations

130
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,380
of a primitive nature,

131
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,800
which broadcast by the strange...

132
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,760
I'll play rock and roll until everybody falls apart.

133
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,400
I'll copy that old Procter & Bergman movie.

134
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,900
Then they would show the strange films

135
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,620
to the walls of the...

136
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,520
Come on, let's watch J-Man.

137
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,720
Please, Bob.

138
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,760
Oh, yes, dear friends.

139
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,560
This is Li Liqing, the Chinese subgenius.

140
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,720
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack

141
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,480
on KNON in Dallas, Texas.

142
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,780
Remember, Bob is the comrade of all people.

143
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,280
Here in China, just like in America,

144
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,660
the people need Slack.

145
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,980
In Chinese, we call slack, 六天牌.

146
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,360
But it must be true slack, not the bad slack of the conspiracy.

147
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,060
Please, Bob, help me somebody.

148
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,420
Oh, yes, dear friends.

149
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,620
Oh, thank you, Li Li Jing, for that beautiful message.

150
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,720
Oh, it's so nice to be back in power

151
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,820
and barely getting my voice back after the mighty preaching we had

152
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,400
at the Caravan of Dreams in Fort Worth this last Friday night.

153
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,660
And friends, for those of you who just tuned in

154
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,820
and have never listened to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack before,

155
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,400
this is the audio organ,

156
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,780
the secret organ of the Church of the Subgenius,

157
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,020
dedicated.

158
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,300
To the teachings of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

159
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,700
the living slack master of mystic sales training, friends,

160
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,060
the bridge between heaven and earth and hell,

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,520
the wordless bobhead, dear friends, the naked Dobbs,

162
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,720
all-knowing, all-prevailing, all-just, all-true, all-none, all-one.

163
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,040
Dobbs is the one true way by which we may finally achieve

164
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
that elusive slack,

165
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,980
which has been denied us.

166
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

167
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,180
And we're going to be getting into some of that.

168
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,580
Actually, I may play a tape of that revival

169
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,500
at the Caravan of Dreams this last Friday night.

170
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,380
Not the whole thing, just a little bit of it.

171
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,460
But in the meantime, dear friends,

172
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,240
we'll just get things moving a bit with Negative Land.

173
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,780
This is Negative Land's new,

174
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,300
un-released album.

175
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,480
Is there any escape from noise?

176
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,600
You've got a good beginning.

177
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,720
Hit and miss and trial and error.

178
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,980
It just depends again on breaking the records over radio.

179
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,120
Rock music blares!

180
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,820
Doors slam!

181
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,800
People yell!

182
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,880
Children scream!

183
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,500
Sirens whine!

184
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,960
Trucks crumble and roar!

185
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,360
And rock music blares!

186
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,280
Blares, blares, blares!

187
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,840
Is there any escape?

188
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,180
Rock music blares!

189
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,180


190
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,340
Have an Я несколько дней!

191
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,700
Юля, Ellaien!

192
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:15,700


193
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:15,700


194
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:15,700


195
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,640
Komm los F Informationen!

196
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:16,640


197
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,880
Cor backlog der Luulensch Information?

198
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:18,880


199
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,360
Is there any escape from noise?

200
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,760
Шор ты?

201
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,600
Is there any escape from noise?

202
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,040
Nee, нет.

203
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,780
baben

204
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,160
편

205
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,180
내

206
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,280
Thank you.

207
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,140
Thank you.

208
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,620
Thank you.

209
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,200
Supposing you're watching the Playboy channel.

210
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,040
And it's just about time for them to have an orgasm.

211
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,460
When all of a sudden...

212
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,620
Wham!

213
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,620
The horrible noise comes in and completely destroys you.

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,160
Oh.

215
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,160
Oh, yes, dear friends.

216
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,220
The horrible noise comes in and completely distracts you.

217
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:50,560
I turned around and, well, sure enough, there was the mighty co-host,

218
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,540
Dr. Jay Cotton, or Condom, depending on your religion.

219
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,220
Let's see, are you...

220
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah, there you go.

221
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,020
You're coming in now, Dr. Condom.

222
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,460
That's a relief.

223
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,940
I was frightened.

224
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,840
Yeah, we had a mighty...

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,060
We had a mighty preaching show.

226
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,680
We had a mighty show there at the Caravan of Dreams the other night.

227
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,260
A mighty preaching show.

228
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,360
And some of our listeners were there.

229
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,980
We were so glad to meet you all and perform the healings and the sickenings.

230
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,100
Some souls were saved.

231
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,520
Some souls were damned to hell.

232
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,180
Yeah.

233
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,840
Yeah, but which hell, you know?

234
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,920
The hell of your choice.

235
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,520
That's the wonderful thing about J.R. Bob Dobbs, my friend.

236
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,860
He's the human scrapyard.

237
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,160
And you can get compressed into...

238
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,020
Into the world of Bob so easily.

239
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,160
So easily.

240
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,420
And yet, it's also so easy to abuse it.

241
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,680
Well, Dr. Condom, I thought the song gods put in a hell of a performance.

242
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,920
It was fast-paced action that just kind of just rolled over everybody.

243
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,080
And by golly, if they didn't like it...

244
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,340
If they didn't like it, kill them.

245
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,860
Well, the beer barrel polka is favored among everybody.

246
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,240
And when it goes into the...

247
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,820
And then scoots right into that little circus song.

248
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,600
You know, that...

249
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,440
Like it did.

250
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,740
Well, they started passing out.

251
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,120
Then we moved on into Exodus.

252
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,060
And, well, then the Jewish people sort of just kind of flipped.

253
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,400
And segued from that into Haba Nagila.

254
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,520
And they flipped a little harder.

255
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,200
And there's flipping and a flopping.

256
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,080
Oh, yes, dear friends.

257
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,420
You know, look around you and face it.

258
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,160
It's obvious that the world...

259
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,220
The world is composed of complete jerks.

260
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:48,040
And yet, and yet, every now and then, you creep in with just a bit of true slack.

261
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,160
A man's not made of steel, folks.

262
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:59,200
And the song gods aren't made of the new issue of P-Dog Comics number two.

263
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,760
And when is that...

264
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,300
By the way, folks, our co-host tonight...

265
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,400
Dr. Condom is also well known as the co-author of P-Dog Comics number one.

266
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,880
No, I just front for those guys.

267
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,060
Oh, you're the distributor, huh?

268
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,420
The distributor.

269
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,940
That's Eddie Nukes and Jocko Brainiac.

270
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,340
Those two nudists from Florida.

271
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,760
And Eddie Nukes can be seen occasionally doing extra work on Miami Vice.

272
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,200
As I understand it, though, the P-Dog Comics...

273
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,780
And that is...

274
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,880
That P is...

275
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,460
What is that an abbreviation for?

276
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,660
It's not an abbreviation.

277
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,880
Yeah, as I said, I thought it was an abbreviation.

278
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
It's spelled out.

279
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,380
That's how I thought.

280
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,420
It's like P, like P your damn ass, P me.

281
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,680
And so we move on.

282
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,180
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

283
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,480
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

284
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,260
They call you the B generation.

285
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,460
You think you live as you choose.

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,520
Oh.

287
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,320
You beat generation.

288
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,340
I think you're headed for the blues.

289
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,720
Now your lives don't have a meaning.

290
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Though you're living up a storm.

291
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,440
You'll do anything at all except conform.

292
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,100
You don't have much ambition.

293
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,360
You're just aimless and depressed.

294
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,280
You think you're really with it, but you're missing all the best.

295
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,580
You be.

296
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,820
You think you're really with it, but you're missing all the best.

297
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:37,820


298
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:37,820


299
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:37,820


300
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,340
You think you live as you choose.

301
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,640
Oh.

302
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,700
You beat, beat, beat generation.

303
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,520
I think you're headed for the blues.

304
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,020
Too bad you're wedded to the blues.

305
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,480
Now your lives don't have a meaning.

306
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,780
Though you're living up a storm.

307
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,200
You'll do anything at all except conform.

308
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Now your lives don't have a meaning.

309
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:06,640


310
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,060
You don't have much ambition.

311
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,260
You're just aimless and depressed.

312
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,180
You think you're really with it, but you're missing all the best.

313
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,520
You be.

314
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:24,440
You think you live as you choose.

315
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,460
Oh.

316
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,380
You beat, beat, beat generation.

317
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,700
I think you're headed for the blues.

318
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,640
Too bad you're wedded to the blues.

319
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,640


320
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,640


321
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,640


322
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,160
Why did you do the blues?

323
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,780
You're killing me.

324
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,100
Looking sweet for good.

325
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,580
Keep you while I'm down.

326
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,900
Like I do you would.

327
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,300
You're killing me.

328
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,260
You're killing me.

329
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,140
Trying to show me your signs.

330
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,400
Calling me the brave.

331
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,680
You want to plunge a knife into my back and twist it.

332
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,420
Twist it round and round.

333
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,160
You want to plunge a knife into my back and twist it.

334
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,920
Twist it round and round.

335
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,820
You're killing me.

336
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,300
Turning against my house.

337
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,880
You think I don't see what you're all about.

338
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,640
I'm a fool on your side.

339
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,820
A bitch in your ass.

340
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
You want to see me die.

341
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,440
You want to see me crash.

342
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,060
You want to plunge the knife into my back and twist it.

343
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,620
Twist it.

344
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Twist it round and round.

345
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,300
You want to plunge a knife into my back and twist it.

346
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,940
Twist it round and round.

347
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,260
You want to plunge the knife into my back and twist it.

348
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,040
You're killing me.

349
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,460
Looking sweet for good.

350
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,940
Keep you while I'm down.

351
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,240
Like I do you would.

352
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
You're killing me.

353
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,000
Put you in the grave.

354
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
Trying to show me your signs.

355
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,740
Calling me the brave.

356
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,620
You want to plunge a knife into my back and twist it.

357
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Twist it round and round Just around and round.

358
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,440
You want to plunge a knife into my back and twist it.

359
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,960
Twist it round and round.

360
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,020
You're killing me.

361
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,440
Turning against my house.

362
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,140
You think I don't see what you're all about.

363
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,820
I'm a fool on your side.

364
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,020
A bitch in your ass.

365
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,480
You want to see me die.

366
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,740
You want to see me crash.

367
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,920
You want to plunge a knife into my back and twist it.

368
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,820
Twist it round and round Just around and round.

369
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,340
You want to plunge a knife into my back and twist it.

370
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,600
Just around and round 198 00 COACH

371
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:36,600


372
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:36,600


373
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:36,600


374
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,000
Round and round and round

375
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,620
You're killing me!

376
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,440
You're killing me!

377
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,500
You're killing me!

378
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:14,420
Ah yes dear friends, that's Zug's Rift, the mighty and pretty much terrifying Zug's Rift.

379
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:25,960
He's um, and you can actually get that record, I can't really say the name of the album on the air because it's illegal.

380
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,680
But at the same time you can yet nevertheless buy it at stores such like.

381
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,300
Zug's is quite, quite the, ugh.

382
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,440
He's like your typical subgenius recording artist, he's been trying for years and years to break through.

383
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,720
My daddy is an unqualified Hawaiian satanic convenience food store clerk for the secret marine.

384
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,000
We can say Satan on the radio.

385
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:03,740
I know, cause I pulled the string on the back of his head and he told me of how the men from the health department come in and hang the cream donuts on their wrists while saluting the flag.

386
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,580
Little old ladies from the back of the house.

387
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,980
Down the street, hang out playing the video games in the wee hours in the morning.

388
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,320
And take turns giving daddy gum jobs.

389
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:22,440
But sometimes he gets stuck to their denture cement and we have to use a blow torch.

390
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,020
We then have to throw to the introduce our super toolkit.

391
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,320
How we start, it goes like this.

392
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,320


393
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,320


394
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,660
On the gel when they pour, and I say love you and take it.

395
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:55,740
And the codes hint at some partner on the top of the şunu.

396
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,560
gitu on the left.

397
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,340
And we go pig all the way to the whiskey no no.

398
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,920
Yesterday, I went in to buy some cake and candy,

399
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,340
but Daddy was putting the pure cane sugar out on the counter in little piles

400
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,540
and told me to f***.

401
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,400
I was psychologically despondent over his compendious manner,

402
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,860
despite my usual latitudinarian tendencies.

403
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,900
What is wrong with you today, old man?

404
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,060
Got the rag on you, old hag?

405
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,360
Daddy then began to cry,

406
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,260
and I ran outside into the arms of three ruffians

407
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,340
who proceeded to bash my skull into a nearby brick wall.

408
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,740
I told them when I grow up, I want to be a brain surgeon,

409
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,460
just like my little brother.

410
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,240
Then I showed them all ran away and joined the circus.

411
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,460
And I said,

412
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,000
what's the matter?

413
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,420
Well, the number is 10,000.

414
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,740
It's true, folks.

415
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,200
I had to censor the living daylights out of that record to play it over the air,

416
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,000
but it's because I really want to turn you all on to Zug's Rift.

417
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,600
He's a...

418
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,760
He's a...

419
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:26,840
He's a...

420
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:33,060
a worthy individual. He's been struggling for a long time and is probably not doing anything at

421
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:38,720
all to get himself any more commercial success, which is why you should probably go out and buy

422
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:48,160
that thing. I think he's going to be playing in town pretty soon. We will show him how to

423
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,980
reach commercial success. Let's lessen that struggle.

424
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,320
All you rocking out cats and kitties, this is the Nightman.

425
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,120
And calling from the big bad city right down here at KNON. We have just finished our big

426
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,360
fall pledge drive and I want to ask everybody that made a pledge to a show during the pledge drive

427
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:25,900
to mail that pledge in to KNON. Post office box 710909.

428
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,720
Dollar.

429
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:40,440
Texas 75371. Again, mail that pledge in to KNON. Post office box 710909. Dallas, Texas 75371.

430
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,860
Because I tell you what, if you made that pledge, it don't do us no good unless you make it good,

431
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:53,200
baby, to KNON, the hottest station on the planet Earth, right here in Dallas, Fort Worth.

432
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,240
All broadcast programming now emanates from one source.

433
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,940
The church of the sun.

434
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,920
4,000 years ago.

435
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,320
A station with 18 billion tornads.

436
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,180
You wouldn't think they could do it. You wouldn't think in this scientific modern age such a miracle

437
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,180
could take place. But now, before your astonished ears, here on the radio, it all happens.

438
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,760
It happens at once. And to you, here on the fabulous Subgenius show, there will never be another

439
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,320
show like this. There will never be another opportunity like this to be inculcated and educated

440
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:41,500
by the vast fountains and springs of cosmic wisdom pouring out like water shot from some high crag,

441
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:52,700
falling down the water, the green earth, and to start a new generation, a thick forest of knowledge, firmly anchored in the crumbling,

442
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,780
topsoil of ancient myths and twilight lunacies.

443
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:06,340
We've learned a lot. We've learned a lot from the Subgenius show, and we hope that we're gonna learn a lot more on the Subgenius program.

444
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:13,580
I just wanna tell you guys, keep doing what you're doing, and we love it, and we want you to go on and on and on.

445
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,360
Yeah, whatever it was.

446
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:22,180
And no problem about that. We'll keep babbling, or the bibble babble we wish to bibble babble in the center of the universe.

447
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,700
Oh, I'm sorry you have reached the underwater radio show.

448
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,620
Gosh, I didn't mean to!

449
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,900
Have a new bathing suit or a good pair of swim fins.

450
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
Oh, I'm embarrassed. I left mine at home.

451
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,820
Please do not try to paddle through the show weed.

452
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,280
I'll turn around as soon as I can turn in this tiny channel. It's obstructing my movements.

453
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:50,020
Hi, I'm Smart Mark the shark. I can think and eat at the same time.

454
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,100
And clutch cargoes.

455
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,080
I've been clutched by a giant crab.

456
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,040
Suddenly, an apparition appears.

457
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,100
So, go smurfing instead of showing.

458
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,880
He has a riffing.

459
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:16,260
We'll take care of you. You'll rise to the top and then sink down to the bottom of the Titanic diaper bag. So long!

460
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,340
Uh-huh. Sure.

461
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,440
I'm not sure I believe all that anymore.

462
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,360
I don't know. Maybe it was a CIA experiment.

463
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,140
Uh, yeah.

464
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,920
Tell me, guy. Did you serve in Dobbs Army back in the 80s?

465
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,200
I helped set up Dobbs Army.

466
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,540
What did you do to Dobbs Army, man?

467
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,200
Man.

468
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,920
Rock music, man.

469
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,680
Hey, come on, buddy.

470
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,720
The 80s were hard years.

471
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,280
You don't understand what we were up against then.

472
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,480
It's time to be happy, buddy. Come on. This is a party. None of that spooky Indian scary stuff.

473
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,780
Controversy, greed, moral plight, gibberish, search and seizure of the church.

474
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,400
Church, church.

475
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,980
Yes, it was an embarrassing script search of the subgenius church so early in the morning.

476
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,180
And we're sorry.

477
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,580
We're sorry about any inconvenience it may have caused you.

478
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,040
On the other hand, we hope that it's been somewhat of an educational experience.

479
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,300
We know it has been for us.

480
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,540
Oh, yeah. Write the letter to David Byrne about the puzzling evidence.

481
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:39,020
Yes, those guinea pigs were taken to a disco and made to listen to music for as long as their little hearts could stand it.

482
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,620
Mm-hmm.

483
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:49,080
And you'll hear more about that and other puzzling mysteries as we investigate the isosceles triangle of the Bermuda Shores.

484
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,160
Mm-hmm.

485
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,160


486
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:55,500
And past wives, uh, trance, spitting, uh, mumbling, and, uh, carimba.

487
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,160
Let's pretend like your name is Jojo.

488
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,140
Okay, Raymond.

489
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,600
Son, come over here. Son.

490
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:19,160
Listen, son. I don't want you playing with, with Jenny and...

491
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,380
Joey and Jojo no more.

492
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,600
Why?

493
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,820
Well, son, because they're normal.

494
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,680
Because, because they're for the false churches.

495
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,700
I want you to...

496
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:36,620
Why don't you just go up there for a while and look at your pamphlet and color in your, your Bob coloring book.

497
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,800
Sorry, Dad. Bob's for kids.

498
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:40,800
Oh.

499
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:04,120
In Dobbs Town, when Bodhisattva Dobbs sits under the open sky,

500
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,180
unraveling small business parables to the devout zombies gathered around him,

501
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,880
birds flock overhead to give him shade.

502
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,140
They let their droppings fall only on his words.

503
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:28,700
followers. In his dhābhmā, or teaching, the master dhābs demands absolute self-deification,

504
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:37,400
the retainting and depurification of the ego, and the achievement of all selfish desires.

505
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:47,420
The only way to handle temptation, he admonishes, is to go at it until it hurts. Then it will

506
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:54,140
be finished with you and will leave you alone, unless you get hooked. Then only larger donations

507
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:04,620
to the Church can save you. That's a moving parable. This was a small business parable

508
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:13,320
from the book of the subgenius. And from an equally holy tome, Dr. Condom shall present us

509
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,940
with some of the headlines from the last week's

510
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,500
weekly world news.

511
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:27,320
Weekly world news. The most incredible encounter ever with elusive beast. Bigfoot adopts human

512
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:34,720
child. A gigantic Bigfoot has brought presents of fruit and pebbles to a six-year-old girl

513
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,880
who lives in a remote farming country, says a university team to check out the report.

514
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:46,920
As the Bigfoot brought the fruit and pebbles, birds flew overhead and provided food for

515
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:58,600
the little girl. The Bigfoot's

516
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:07,960
story is from the Shangxi province in China, where they take the Bigfoot so-called legends

517
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,020
rather more seriously than our scientists here in the United States.

518
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,920
So that's not the more common round-eyed Bigfoot I hear.

519
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:16,920


520
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:16,920


521
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:25,080
No, no, this is the Bigfoot from the center of the world. From the very bowels of humanity.

522
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,560
That counts for the fruit and pebbles.

523
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,040
And bam bam.

524
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:42,020
Don't just eat that hamburger, friends. Eat the hell out of it, said Dobbs in Economicon

525
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,680
2378. For the profundity quotient of his quotes,

526
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,220
it seems to increase geometrically the longer the student listens. Dobbs, as teacher, destroys

527
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,220
the parts of your brains you're better off without. Many happy tales are told of Bob

528
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,840
and the Kool-Aid on that great night of slack in the jungle. The Kool-Aid that made them

529
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,800
so much more alive to their own infinite potential. His lessons may be difficult, even dangerous,

530
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,880
but they work.

531
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,220
Here.

532
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,800
Oh, yeah.

533
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:16,920
Here.

534
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,200
Yes.

535
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:25,700
Here's an interesting headline. Men's sweat turns gals on. Fellas don't need fancy deodorants

536
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,120
to make a woman swoon while making love, say experts. Just sweat.

537
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:37,540
That's the pheromones, friends. You know, you never lost the instincts that your ancestors,

538
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,200
the Yetis and the Neanderthals had.

539
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,160
I have a parable about instincts.

540
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,300
I bet you do. Can we?

541
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,600
Yeah, two little Bigfeet were walking through the Chinese forest with fruit

542
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,840
and pebbles to bring to a six year old. The father Bigfoot says, My instincts tell

543
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,300
me that we're getting off the track and that we should go this way. And the little Bigfoot

544
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,220
said, my instincts too, but it don't tell me nothing.

545
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,060
cephalops upwards

546
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,840
Ah yes dear friends, the epiphany of the bob.

547
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,880
It never ends.

548
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:23,080
This music, by the way, is from my former employers, the Beijing Film Studios.

549
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:29,540
And this was, I think, actually recorded by the Chinese subgenius Li Li Jing.

550
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,360
You mean Ri, don't you?

551
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,040
Pardon me?

552
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,540
Ri.

553
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,280
Ri?

554
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,080
Yeah.

555
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,420
Well, for this reason.

556
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:37,760
Instead of Li.

557
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,320
For this reason.

558
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,240
And Ri, Ri Jing, and others to be revealed.

559
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:50,300
Bob's main drinking buddies, one might say, are primarily the more experienced Mexican brujos.

560
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,720
I think that's dinking buddies.

561
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,340
The Tibetan llamas, the Siberian shamans.

562
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,580
Is that a one-hump llama or a two-hump?

563
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:11,760
The Native American medicine men, African witch doctors, aged druids, witches, and dozens of living Christian saints that the Vatican refuses to recognize.

564
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,820
As well as the real mongrel.

565
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,760
The real man that Marvel Comics' Doctor Strange was based on.

566
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,340
Bob, yes, dares to claim that he's been drunk with Jesus.

567
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
How many of you can say that, friends?

568
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,100
Is Jesus your drinking buddy?

569
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,680
Is Bob your fropping pal?

570
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,380
Eh?

571
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,740
I can't say that.

572
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,220
Well, we're going to move on into this caravan of dreams, devival.

573
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,220
This was, uh, it wasn't really a...

574
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:53,500
a wholehearted subgenius revival, because about half the people there were unsavable, pink, artsy, smartsy, uh...

575
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,180
Trendy?

576
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,340
Yeah, whole trendy.

577
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:03,180
Oh, they had $50 haircuts, and they'd spend a lot of money to show you that they didn't care how they looked, dear friends.

578
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,200
And that was the best thing about them, except for the fact they were willing to shell out six bucks a pop to come to this thing.

579
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,140
That's right.

580
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,680
They gave.

581
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,540
And once they got there, they at least...

582
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,520
They managed to see the song gods and the church of the subgenius.

583
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,260
And we're going to bring you just a bit of that.

584
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,720
We're going to go into this revival.

585
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,300
This is an actual revival in progress.

586
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,280
That depends.

587
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,920
On your church.

588
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,640
In progress, last Friday night.

589
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,620
You could have been there, but you weren't, except for you, you, and you.

590
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,640
And thank you very much, Reverend Zafod.

591
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,200
I mean, I consider the art critic world to have completely ignored...

592
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:59,400
the vast, huge realm of quote performance art, unquote, such as, for instance, the performance art of a teenage boy trying to get laid.

593
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,280
Like a dog, friends, like a little dog.

594
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:11,180
If you've ever had a young dog entering his doggy-type teenage years and seen them hump thin air out of pure frustration,

595
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,680
then look at some young boy.

596
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,220
In high school, trying to...

597
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,280
Just trying to get what he wants.

598
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,100
That is performance art, my friends.

599
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,120
And why not?

600
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,040
Why just teenagers?

601
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,900
You've also got to go down to Greenville Avenue in Dallas or whatever it is here,

602
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,420
where the singles bars ain't just teenagers.

603
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,980
People are performing their butts off trying to get what they want.

604
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,720
That's what I call real performance art.

605
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,660
Then you've got your professional performance artists.

606
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,040
Your...

607
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,920
Your fortune tellers.

608
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,820
Your UFO contactees.

609
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,760
Your transmediums who go...

610
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,520
Who let the voices of the dead speak for them.

611
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,040
Your used car salesmen or salesmen or, in fact, any salesmen.

612
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,740
Because what an art...

613
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,320
J.R. Bob Dogg, for those of you who don't know, and I'm sure there are a few,

614
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,460
is the saint of sales.

615
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,320
Known throughout the world as the saint of sales.

616
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,080
The traveling salesman of mythology.

617
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,780
He was a real man who walked this earth.

618
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,380
J.R. Bob Dogg's walked this earth.

619
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,660
And he came here to bring you slack.

620
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,580
Slack is what it's all about.

621
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,540
How many of you can say you have enough slack?

622
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,880
Well, you were all born with original slack, my friends.

623
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,600
You were born with it.

624
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,100
But where'd it go?

625
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,140
If you don't have it, friends, slack is neither created nor destroyed.

626
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,020
And if you don't have it...

627
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,020


628
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,020


629
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,120
If you don't have slack, somebody else has it.

630
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,520
And that's what we mean by the conspiracy.

631
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,480
Now, other unsung performance artists, and there's plenty.

632
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,040
I could reel off some names of the black party record artists.

633
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:12,240
Now, how many of you are familiar with the works of the great Dolomite, Rudy Ray Moore, Wild Man Steve, or Blowfly?

634
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,260
How many? Can I see some hands?

635
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,140
Have you ever heard of any of these people?

636
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:24,120
This is a crooked and perverse station where you call yourselves art audiences

637
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,920
and have never gone out and bought into that cheesy record bin of the worst record store in town

638
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,380
and found that black party record, which actually...

639
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,880
And you might think, oh, he's being facetious.

640
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,880
These are the modern Shakespeareans of the English language, and most of you don't even know who they are.

641
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,340
Do you? Huh?

642
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,100
Poop me, John 310.

643
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,040
Can't do it.

644
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,300
I rest my case.

645
00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:01,240
But for that matter, we go on and we see the performance artists who do the most work in this world

646
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,880
are the ones least called performance artists.

647
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:10,660
And by those, I mean the wrestlers and the preachers, the TV evangelists.

648
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,660
They're both doing the same basic thing.

649
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,820
The only difference is the wrestlers are a little more honest about it.

650
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:24,200
The preachers, the preachers get up there and act holier than thou.

651
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,880
But my friends, those wrestlers really are holier than thou.

652
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,360
Hazeball, huh, help me somebody.

653
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,760
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

654
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,680
She ain't got no legs.

655
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:41,680
Now, now both preachers, but I must say, I must say,

656
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,640
both the preachers and the preachers,

657
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,560
and the wrestlers are one hell of a lot less pretentious

658
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:54,080
than what calls themselves performance artists, unquote.

659
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,640
The wrestlers and preachers are more sincere.

660
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,240
At least they truly believe the act that they're acting out.

661
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,980
They're not acting. They have commitment.

662
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,020
Real commitment.

663
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,900
Friends, like Francis, they get out there.

664
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,420
The wrestlers get out there and bleed for their art.

665
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,440
Let Christo bleed for his art.

666
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,480
Huh?

667
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,320
Hey, nay, you won't be seeing it.

668
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,500
They get audience participation going at a fever pitch

669
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,840
because they know, well, actually, the wrestlers are better at it than the preachers.

670
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,540
The sick thing is the preacher boys out there have taken all the fun out of religion,

671
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,580
which should, in fact, be more like pro wrestling.

672
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,220
Anybody have any argument with that, huh?

673
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:44,740
No.

674
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,280
All right, now, because you got, you know, you're just as effective

675
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,180
as the faith healing is for the preachers.

676
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:00,100
The wrestlers' faith injury is of the same, more or less, same ilk.

677
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,080
So, friends, there must be slack.

678
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,860
There must be slack.

679
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,480
The artists and most preachers have taken, like I said,

680
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,720
the fun out of religion.

681
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,520
Perhaps those winos hanging outside this place on the street

682
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,880
taking the sacrament out of those green bottles,

683
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,360
they know where, they are closer to the real it

684
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,180
than most of your, these dead preachers preaching dead sermons

685
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,920
to dead congregations.

686
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,120
All present company excluded, of course.

687
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,340
Now, friends, Bob, Bob Dawes,

688
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,320
this man, some call him a man, some call him a god.

689
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,840
I don't want to walk the path that Bob trod,

690
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,220
but this man, Bob, is going to someday cast them out

691
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:58,320
with the flying body block of his divine, radioactive,

692
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,120
all-scouring, all-destroying love.

693
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,300
Oh, yes.

694
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,140
It's a sick world, friends.

695
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,300
This is a sick world.

696
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,120
It's a sick world.

697
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,740
It's a sick world.

698
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,360
It's a sick world.

699
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,980
It's a sick world.

700
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:22,920
It's a sick world.

701
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:22,920


702
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,780
Oh, yes.

703
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,400
And praise Dr. Condom or Cotton,

704
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,760
depending on your religion,

705
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,940
for that fine organ music in the background there.

706
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,680
That was at the Caravan of Dreams last weekend.

707
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,580
So, Dr. Condom, when I'm playing the organ,

708
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:39,740
I'm going to play the organ.

709
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,480
Also in the news,

710
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,100
depressed because he couldn't find a job,

711
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,280
Romolo Rubolo, 42,

712
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,720
sat in his kitchen near Pisa, Italy,

713
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,460
gun in hand, threatening to kill himself.

714
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,780
For nearly an hour, his wife, Amelia,

715
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,460
pleaded with him not to.

716
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,300
Finally, he burst into tears and threw the gun to the floor.

717
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,840
It went off and killed his wife.

718
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,560
That's an amazing story.

719
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,420
Here's a good one.

720
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,360
I-22 gave her a win, but it was bad news bingo.

721
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,200
One-legged woman can't hobble to the stage in time

722
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,160
to claim her prize.

723
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,540
A farmer, aged 54,

724
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,280
using the stairs because the elevator was out of service,

725
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,780
collapsed and died after climbing five flights

726
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,500
for a heart checkup in Messina, Sicily.

727
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,400
Try this on for size.

728
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,520
Gutsy gagster uses his deformity as a gimmick.

729
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,760
That's right.

730
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,640
That story's about the thalidomide baby

731
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,800
who grew up to be a great comic in England.

732
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,260
He's the Bob Hopeless of humor.

733
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,900
We're hoping to get him on our show, friends,

734
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,040
so that you can see this amazing, you know...

735
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,240
Why don't we get him with that one-legged bingo loser

736
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,340
and have him race to the radio station?

737
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,540
And the lady who went to the doctor's office,

738
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,720
for Bob's concert, and lost her legs,

739
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,660
and they still call it an act.

740
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,040
They call doctors for Bob an act.

741
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,940
Well, that lady that lost her legs

742
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,320
going to that subgenius revival

743
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,620
deserves an Academy Award, dear friends.

Copyright 1985, Jane or Hybrid, please.

745
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,560
A fierce gust of wind blew Vittoria Luisi's bubble car

746
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,460
into the River Salai near Naples.

747
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,280
She climbed out.

748
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,320
She managed to break a window, climb out,

749
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,720
and swim to shore where a tree blew down and killed her.

750
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,240
Jeez.

751
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,100
The Reverend James Gaxeel, 43, a Baptist minister,

752
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,500
was about to baptize four new members of the church

753
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,640
in Silver Park River, Transvaal.

754
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,620
He stepped into the water praying,

755
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,580
and as he uttered the words, Holy Spirit,

756
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,660
he sank into the mud and drowned.

757
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:09,760
The girl's father, Charles,

758
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,860
actually went to court to have her birthday changed

759
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,160
from March 13, 1941 to 1951.

760
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,220
Mrs. Carson of Lake Cushwaga, New York,

761
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,480
was laid out in her coffin,

762
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,100
presumed dead from heart disease.

763
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,220
As mourners gathered round,

764
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,400
she sat up and gazed wonderingly.

765
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,760
Her daughter dropped dead from fright.

766
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,060
Crybaby Khan, a cowardly khan who got 20 years in prison

767
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,620
for abusing a dozen women,

768
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,320
is whining like a wimp because he's lonely,

769
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,900
scared, and not having any fun.

770
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,060
I'm scared and not having any fun, he says.

771
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,140
That's what he gets for going to jail.

772
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,800
Boy spends two years tied to a door.

773
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,920
Drinking Budweiser

774
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,760
Watching Bob-O-TV

775
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,600
Swallowing red-backed beer

776
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,280
He's a man

777
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,260
A name I could not die

778
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,440
Reading the pamphlet

779
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,460
Over and over again

780
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,580
I was drinking Budweiser

781
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,000
And Bob was on TV

782
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,720
The day that Uncle

783
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,860
Got kicked

784
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,380
By a mule

785
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,900
I was with Cousin Junior

786
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,240
For DNA back farm

787
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,560
I was drunk

788
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,900
I was lonely

789
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,500
I was wild

790
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:02,340
And I was drinking Budweiser

791
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,020
And Bob was on TV

792
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,080
Drinking Budweiser

793
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,000
Watching Bob-O-TV

794
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,260
Swallowing red-backed beer

795
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,400
A name I could not die

796
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,820
Reading the pamphlet

797
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,820
Watching Bob-O-TV

798
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,260
Watching Red-backed beer

799
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:37,960
I was drinking Budweiser

800
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,020
Movies I was reading

801
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:41,020


802
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,360
Music I was dram-ing

803
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:45,560
Watching the red-backed beer

804
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:45,560


805
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,840
I was drinking Budweiser

806
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,300
saw me

807
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,060
A drink-a- versuchen

808
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:49,060


809
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:49,060


810
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,200
Watching Bob-O-TV

811
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,740
HD

812
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,240
Drinking Bud-Wise pits

813
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:55,240


814
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:55,240


815
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:55,900
All together

816
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:55,900


817
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,900
Friends, that was Buck Naked and not the Jaybirds,

818
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,720
not more drunk cowboys this time,

819
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,720
but Buck with the Farlow Brothers,

820
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,120
and that's off a record.

821
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,400
Buck's on a record now.

822
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,180
Paris Records presents Made Up in Texas,

823
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,060
which I think you can probably pick up at places like the Record Gallery and so forth.

824
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:22,400
And Buck called me tonight and said that he's busy working on an album,

825
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,460
a solo Buck Naked album, if you can imagine that.

826
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,940
Dear friends, we're going to go back once again

827
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,500
to the world of puzzling evidence

828
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:42,340
as revenge on David Byrne for never giving puzzling evidence credit

829
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:48,340
for naming entire concepts after his mere moniker.

830
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,720
He burns me up.

831
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,100
Burned again.

832
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:52,740
They say.

833
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,740
Some of us been peeweeds.

834
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,860
Some of us been burned.

835
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,320
Puzzling evidence.

836
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,800
I've been to all those towns and they're all the same.

837
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,980
Don't call Napa people dumb.

838
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,020
They are dumb.

839
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,840
No, they're dead.

840
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:08,920
They're dead.

841
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,160
No, they're not dumb.

842
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:10,640
They're dead.

843
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,080
Yes, the whole world's been blown up.

844
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,240
There's nothing wrong with living in dumb town.

845
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,000
You should be damn proud of it.

846
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,780
Well, we're dumb too.

847
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,240
We're dumb and blind and deaf down here.

848
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,620
We don't mind it.

849
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,160
It's not, you know, it's an equalizer, we call it.

850
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,140
It's a damage and there's not much you can do about it.

851
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,340
Your hair falls out.

852
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,100
It's an equalizer.

853
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:27,960
You can't talk.

854
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,680
You don't even want to talk.

855
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,080
Save the doctors from this less than stimulating situation.

856
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:34,940
Yes.

857
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,460
All we have now is the sleepy time Jesus

858
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,460
and I'm curled up here in the arms of the sleepy time Jesus on the show

859
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,720
and he's kissing and smooching on me and it feels real good

860
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,940
but it's making me real tired and I don't want to talk

861
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,120
because I just want to...

862
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,420
I just want to curl up with this cute little antichrist

863
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,000
and make some running noises.

864
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,820
...and hallucination because of their feeling of...

865
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,200
Well, maybe it wasn't real.

866
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,100
...and...

867
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,160
Oh, that's Bob Nelson.

868
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,140
Do you love me?

869
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:07,680
...generation.

870
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,600
Oh, we're running the sound grid on your helmet.

871
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,460
You should have a new head in about three seconds.

872
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,020
Here it comes, Paul.

873
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,220
There.

874
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,580
Oh, that's much better.

875
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,600
Give me one of those new heads too.

876
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,900
Oh, it feels great.

877
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,000
...correction.

878
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:22,480
...and complete.

879
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,580
Hello, little caller.

880
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,320
You're stuck inside the time tube.

881
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,860
Sooner or later, you should be able to break out.

882
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,740
If we can stay with you, the Heliopter Jesus is now appearing over your head.

883
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,280
Stay down and avoid your own speakers.

884
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,720
The radio amplifier will try to kill the signal, resulting in its own demise.

885
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,660
Please stand back from Heliopter Jesus.

886
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,160
Approaching now on the left speaker.

887
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,180
...sangra 32.

888
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,160
I'll be your night...

889
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,560
La, la, la, la, la, la.

890
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,580
Good morning. What happened?

891
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,860
...professor at Harvard University.

892
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,260
...has said on the subject...

893
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,980
What kind of show is this?

894
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:55,740
...dense of...

895
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,320
Everything's okay.

896
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,480
...adolescents have to refight many...

897
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,160
Just a whole line of blanking lights.

898
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,040
...goodnight, little callers.

899
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,800
...must be the president trying to reach us.

900
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,260
You're helping invest in some child's future.

901
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:06,820
Ah.

902
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,700
I'm buying that child.

903
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,000
And it was a good thing, too.

904
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,220
Thank you for your input, caller.

905
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,760
What does it sound like where you are?

906
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,800
It sounds kind of weird.

907
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,960
What is weird?

908
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:17,460
Huh?

909
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,980
It's a weird DJ dressed up in a crown of thorns and a dirty hat.

910
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,100
...and a dirty hat.

911
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:22,100


912
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:22,100


913
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:22,100


914
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:22,100


915
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:22,100


916
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,060
Dirty sheep.

917
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:23,900
What's going on here?

918
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,980
...starts kissing on you.

919
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:26,820
I...

920
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,380
Mobius ranks...

921
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,400
Frankly, I don't give a damn.

922
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,840
...dense center.

923
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,220
Yes, liberty ranks.

924
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:38,300
...and I get to stand things that might not make any sense.

925
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,940
Now, let's get out of my brain.

926
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,780
Yes, yes, of course you can.

927
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,060
...the right brain that was actually originated for people who were tired of pointing salt.

928
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,320
The healing after Jesus was originated for your right brain.

929
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:48,680
That's true.

930
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,740
He's in a little can and we open him every 45 minutes.

931
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:50,840
Now he's just squealing.

932
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,200
...and I'm in the first year and I'm not...

933
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,980
Now he's just squealing.

934
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,060
...and I'm in the first year and I'm not...

935
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,060


936
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,460
Now he's just squealing.

937
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,400
Be scary, Colin.

938
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,040
Stand back.

939
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,420
Stand back.

940
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:54,700
Okay.

941
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,200
Please.

942
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,700
If you're coughing all over your speaker, you're saying we've got to clean it up here

943
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,100
at the station.

944
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,720
...he doesn't look well at all.

945
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,520
No, and he doesn't want to be there at all.

946
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,220
No, it's...

947
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,960
And it's late in the morning to try to be there.

948
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,740
Oh, yes.

949
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,100
It's hard to stay up.

950
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,600
Oh, yes.

951
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,060
It's hard to focus at quarter to three in the morning.

952
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:11,240
You're feeling sick.

953
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:11,720
You're sick to your stomach.

954
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,280
Oh, you better sit down, listener.

955
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,120
You better take off those headphones and we'll sing a nice little song for you.

956
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:17,280
Oh, listener.

957
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:17,660
Oh, yeah.

958
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,540
You shouldn't have listened this long.

959
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,040
Okay, here's a nice little song.

960
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:20,680
Oh, yeah.

961
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:25,680
Bob Doves, Bob Doves, headed down the road.

962
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,480
Bob Doves was a little weird throb.

963
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,860
Walking down the road.

964
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,220
Walking down the road.

965
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,240
Oh, wasn't that nice?

966
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,000
That was nice.

967
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,280
You're all under attack.

968
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,320
Oh, look at that.

969
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,320
You're going to try to get...

970
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,300
Shoot at the ground alive.

971
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,480
Hey, hold up the ukulele.

972
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:43,680


973
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,700
Got it.

974
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,360
Dead center.

975
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:48,520
Oh, my God.

976
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:48,520


977
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,300
That war.

978
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,380
Yeah.

979
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,120
The one we've been trying to start in this little room for hours.

980
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:53,680
The one you just went through.

981
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,860
The one that started already.

982
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:55,760
The only smart one.

983
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,220
It did.

984
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,080
Yeah.

985
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:57,420
Come on.

986
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:57,980
It's all right.

987
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,360
And you're wasting your time listening to us.

988
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,120
You could have been tuned into a civil defense warning station, saving your life.

989
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:10,320
But instead, you're spending your last few minutes on earth listening to a semi-humorous

990
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,260
radio program.

991
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,200
That's the only way to go.

992
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,300
And you shouldn't have taken all of your pills.

993
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,540
Well, down in your basement, quick.

994
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,160
Yes, take all the...

995
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:16,200
Oh, I can.

996
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,340
You got the pills now?

997
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:17,900
Why?

998
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:18,580
I'll get them.

999
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:18,880
But you should never...

1000
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:18,880


1001
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:18,880


1002
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:18,880


1003
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:18,880


1004
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,240
Take them out of your basement.

1005
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:19,440
No.

1006
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,620
It could be the most powerful weapon?

1007
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,220
No, no.

1008
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,820
Turn your radio up really loud so you can keep hearing us.

1009
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,280
And we'll talk to your neighbors while you're getting all of your stuff checked out.

1010
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,580
We'll talk to your neighbor until the power goes out in the radio mill.

1011
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:29,920
Yeah, okay.

1012
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:30,580
Listen up.

1013
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,020
Okay.

1014
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm going faster than I can now.

1015
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,820
You know, I walk by to stop and shut.

1016
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,500
And then I drown by to stop and shut.

1017
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,480
This is the cartoons, dear friends.

1018
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,680
The cartoons of local Dallas band.

1019
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,580
You can't buy this tape.

1020
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,400
This is a song called Necrophiliac.

1021
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,740
Necrophiliac.

1022
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,280
And I took her by the hand

1023
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,780
Well, she was deep and kind of moldy

1024
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,400
But she felt just right

1025
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,940
I dug up my baby tonight

1026
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,820
I dug up my baby tonight

1027
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,560
I dug up my baby tonight

1028
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,320
With a hammer and a pick

1029
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,800
My best friend had to do

1030
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,220
Cause he said it made him sick

1031
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,700
Well, when I start to wonder

1032
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,680
Well, she's only six feet under

1033
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,960
I dug up my baby tonight

1034
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,840
I dug up my baby tonight

1035
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,520
I dug up my baby tonight

1036
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,080
Well, I lost it

1037
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,240
So she didn't think no more

1038
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,120
When I shake her, when I poke her

1039
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,380
When I find her, then I find her

1040
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,920
Cause I'm a necrophiliac

1041
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,700
Cause I'm a necrophiliac

1042
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,440
And I'm a necrophiliac

1043
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,260
And I'm a necrophiliac

1044
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:11,840
And I sunshine the world

1045
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,620
IGBAH

1046
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,760
IGBAH

1047
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,420
IGBAH

1048
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,340
Don't ask me what the others think

1049
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,860
I don't even care

1050
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,320
Talk of my baby tonight

1051
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,080
And, uh, you know, if you listen to that on headphones,

1052
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:15,440
you can actually smell the noisome...

1053
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,120
P.U.

1054
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:22,300
P.U. of that one, of his true love.

1055
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,460
Doug, is that initial P.U.?

1056
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,460
That's right.

1057
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,620
Ah, yes.

1058
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,300
Well, you know, strangely enough, dear friends,

1059
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,000
Dr. Ron Lindsey with the show Soul Oldies,

1060
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,360
which is supposed to follow the show,

1061
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,680
well, he ain't here yet.

1062
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,200
So we're gonna keep our ears open for that doorbell to ring,

1063
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,260
but it looks like the hour of slack

1064
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,580
is gonna drag on and on and on,

1065
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,780
so get your slack collectors fired.

1066
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,780
You know, keep them open.

1067
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,300
Keep the recharger open.

1068
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,020
Friends, if you've been wondering

1069
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,560
what this is all about,

1070
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,280
well, just write to

1071
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,320
In fact, you don't even have to write to Bob.

1072
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:03,180
You just hold that letter on your lap

1073
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,820
and stand next to a mailbox

1074
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,760
and think Bob Dobbs,

1075
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,100
and he'll get the message.

1076
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,340
He's a heck of a guy.

1077
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,120
He's every heck of a guy.

1078
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,520
He's every heck of a guy, dear friends.

1079
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,900
And so what you want to do is write to

1080
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,280
Bob at

1081
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,260
P.O. Box

1082
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:26,820
140306

1083
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,860
Dallas, Texas.

1084
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:29,640
75214

1085
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,560
Now get that pencil

1086
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,140
if you didn't get it last time.

1087
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,340
We're gonna say that number again.

1088
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,500
You see, you can write for information,

1089
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:36,240
and what you get

1090
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,680
is probably twice as confusing as this show, but...

1091
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,500
Can you put a donation on your lap and he'll get it?

1092
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,340
Oh, it depends on what kind of a donation,

1093
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,120
whether what kind of chromosomes are in the donation.

1094
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,500
Depends whose lap.

1095
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,320
The seed of Bob, friends,

1096
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,160
spreads all over this mighty planet.

1097
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:55,920
Ooh.

1098
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,160
And sooner or later,

1099
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,420
we're gonna be wading up to our knees in it.

1100
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,920
In Bob's seed.

1101
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,860
That's a holy thought.

1102
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:04,860
Yep.

1103
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:05,800
Slugging it.

1104
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,380
Slugging through that...

1105
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,360
Sludge.

1106
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,380
Slip it and slide it.

1107
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,560
Trying to make it to paradise, dear friends.

1108
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,360
Has he ever burned a zilch?

1109
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,000
Yeah, how many of you all have burned a zilch?

1110
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,460
I know a lot of you get into pyroflatulation.

1111
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,940
You know, you eat a can of ranch style

1112
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,960
and get your lighter out.

1113
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:28,720
You go at it.

1114
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,240
How many of you...

1115
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,800
And worship the blue flame of glory.

1116
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,400
How many of you have burned those paper bags

1117
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,980
just to watch the psychedelic drip, drip, zzz.

1118
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,120
Plastic bags.

1119
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,940
Yeah, what'd I say?

1120
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,880
Paper bags.

1121
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,280
Oh, God.

1122
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,220
Well...

1123
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:44,860
Beatnik party.

1124
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,220
We're gonna move on over to puzzling evidence one more time.

1125
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:48,580
This is...

1126
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,000
When I say puzzling evidence,

1127
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,240
actually, I should give credits.

1128
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,340
This is the, um...

1129
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,860
more than an hour, less than a show, show

1130
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,020
from Berkeley, California.

1131
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:58,260
Yeah.

1132
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,360
Puzzling evidence.

1133
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,500
Dr. Howell, the erudite voice you hear,

1134
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,420
the evil, crazy surfer, Gary Gebrogfran...

1135
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,220
Surf's up.
