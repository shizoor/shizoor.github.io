1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
Um...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,380
It's time for, uh...

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,060
Ehh...

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,300
It's time for some...

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Uh, come on, you know what time it is.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,440
Whoa, uh...

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Huh?

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,500
Life drop by the big testy bag

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,320
Well, welcome to the hour of slack

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,420
Praise Bob, Gold, and Connie's drag

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,080
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,240
YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:47,600
Somewhere over the docks can we get high

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,300
Somewhere over the docks can we get high

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,940
Somewhere over the docks can we get high

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,280
So we can get high

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,700
Welcome to the hour of slack

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,200
And the Dave has...

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,320
The Dave man has arrived

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,800
On his flying air carpet

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,300
With his air head

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,340
His one single brain cell

23
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,800
Yes, this man

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Look at his face

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,540
If we may call this a man

26
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,140
It is glowing

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,820
But the one evil brain cell

28
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,300
Gaze upon it as it swears on you

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,400
And grows

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,300
It's growing

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,380
It's rising

32
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,080
It's pulsating as if

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,980
It will infuse with some form of life of its own

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,180
As if it had sprung

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,200
Perhaps into existence on its own

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,400
As if it would bite

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
No!

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,380
No!

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,380
The brain cell that couldn't die

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,180
Friends, we don't want the Dave brain cell to die, do we?

41
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,220
Well, uh, that's a leading question

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,280
I probably shouldn't ask you that

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm, uh, gonna put it quite to work

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,820
We'll clip and flap and drizzle just in

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,480
We don't want to see it flap around in its cage

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,700
Or bother the other prisoners

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Ah, there you go

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,780
Thanks, Nurse Mary

49
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,220
Oh, you're welcome!

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,900
It's gonna be a long time before we can stuff the rest of the detritus back in that monstrous skull

51
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,820
Yes, I know

52
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,160
But it looks really good from here, doesn't it?

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,240
Of course it looks good

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
But you can't eat it every day

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,840
Or you're gonna have the problem all over again

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,260
I know, I know, yeah, I know, I know

57
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,460
I'm gonna get this cleaned up, look at that

58
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Rambod, hit it!

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,340
The brain is between your ears, finally here

60
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,180
Cool effect with your circle sphere

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,940
It's in your head, born and bred

62
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,660
If you didn't have a brain, you'd probably be brain-dead

63
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,720
Situated below the cerebral cortex

64
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,940
Into the cerebellum, cold gen effect

65
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,100
It's the medulla and I'm not foolin'

66
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,300
Frontin' and grillin', come on, chillin' and coolin'

67
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,620
And Brooklyn, hangin' in the whole hood

68
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,900
You need a brain if you're gonna make good

69
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,040
Cause if I'm a grift, staging a drive-by

70
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,420
Homies on the corner, I'm cracked, you know it, brain-frag

71
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,620
I pull a 9mm, I told them to stop

72
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,920
Shots rain out, what if I kill the cops?

73
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,280
I'll pursue you to aim or shoot your boy in the face

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,340
Your brain is a terrible thing to do

75
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,920
Your brain, your brain, your brain

76
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Come on, get it up, get it up

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Your brain, your brain, your brain

78
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,220
Come on, get it up, get it up

79
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,940
Your brain, your brain, your brain

80
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,640
Come on, get it up, get it up

81
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,900
Your brain, your brain, your brain

82
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,460
Your brain, your brain, your brain

83
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,420
Now then, my home boys, that wasn't at all bad

84
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,000
In fact, it was rather funky fresh

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,840
But, Filbert, what are you doing now?

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm keepin' it real, you know what I'm sayin'?

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,060
I'm keepin' it fly, you know what I'm sayin'?

88
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,540
I'm fussin' up the funky mixdown, you know what I'm sayin'?

89
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,200
I'm keepin' it real and flyin'

90
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,060
With the hips, with the rifle, with the...

91
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,720
So throw your arms in the air

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,160
And wave them as if there were no consequence

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:15,960
Yo!

94
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,780
I'm a lyrical poet

95
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,800
The rhymes are in my brain

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,020
Just in case you didn't notice

97
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,440
I'm on a mic, brewing a dope rhyme

98
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,600
Dipping up to make you all go blind

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,840
Mastering the beat with my cold crush posse

100
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,120
I make a rhyme here but nothing rhymes with posse

101
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,160
That's when my brain was trained by the maestro

102
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,220
James Brown

103
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,420
I'm gonna make me all go

104
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,800
With the girlies sitting in the front row

105
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm getting bizarre after the show

106
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,060
Kissin' and touchin' and strokin' her gently

107
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,220
In my Mercedes, Lexus, and Bentley

108
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,440
Or any of the other cars that I own

109
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,600
Except for my bodyguard, Will Pino

110
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
He won't hear us cause he's so deaf

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Pleasure protection, his name is

112
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,300
That night, we go to a party

113
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,400
Everybody's there

114
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,660
On stage, spottin' rhymes in my nail

115
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,940
Then my homie, Master B

116
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,120
Juvenile Fred Durst in ODP

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,180
I hypnotize him with my brain power

118
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,540
Crossin' a rhyme, gettin' richer by the hour

119
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,740
And why not, cause they pay me to come here

120
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,980
The rhymes flow from my mouth to your ear

121
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,800
The head of your brain, and they call it read

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,100
I shouldn't, don't read, call it brain contraction

123
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,640
I make you dance till your suckers get some beat

124
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,960
You break your head like stupid baby face beat

125
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,100
I'm not the pup that ain't tougher than Kid Rock

126
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,680
And all the rest of you bops just can lick my brain

127
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,020
Your brain, your brain

128
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,860
Come on, heat it up, get it up

129
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,460
Brain, your brain, your brain

130
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,320
Come on, heat it up, get it up

131
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,900
Brain, your brain, your brain

132
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,760
Come on, give it up, give it up

133
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,260
Brain, your brain

134
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,480
Yo, get, get off of

135
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,780
Your brain, your brain, your brain

136
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,660
Come on, get it up, get it up

137
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,220
Brain, your brain, your brain

138
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,100
Come on, get it up, get it up

139
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,860
Brain, your brain, your brain

140
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,540
Come on, get it up, get it up

141
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,700
Brain, your brain, your motherfucking brain

142
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:04,400
Now that this repetitive rhapsodic rhythm has totally wrecked my concentration

143
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,080
Talk to the appendage cause the cranium doesn't want to hear it

144
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,860
I shall remedy this situation with one swift stout

145
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,980
Heditonic, hey, ready?

146
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:14,900
Pull!

147
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:15,520
Yeah!

148
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,680
Shut up!

149
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,620
This is art

150
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,720
Art, art, art

151
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,880
A little after dinner music

152
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,060
Now what are you dancing for?

153
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,180
Dancing for you

154
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,800
Dancing for you

155
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,040
Dancing for you

156
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,940
Dancing for you

157
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,120
Dancing for you

158
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,380
Dancing for you

159
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,800
Nope!

160
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,500
Well that looks better

161
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:07,500


162
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,640
I'm not gonna hurt you

163
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,140
Kill me

164
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,320
I'm not gonna hurt you

165
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,200
I'm not gonna hurt you

166
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,800
I

167
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,400
Sound

168
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,160
For you

169
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,220
Create

170
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,480
Create

171
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,240
I

172
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:40,940
I

173
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,480
I

174
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:41,700
I

175
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,560
I

176
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,740
I

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,160
I

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,320
I

179
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,640
I

180
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,220
I

181
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,280
I

182
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,320
I

183
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,400
I

184
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,400


185
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,400


186
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,400


187
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,400


188
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,400


189
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,320
I

190
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,380
I

191
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,720
I

192
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,840
I

193
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,680
I

194
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:35,840
I

195
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,160
I

196
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,280
I

197
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,360
I

198
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,240
I

199
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,240


200
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,700
I

201
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:40,720
I

202
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:40,740
I

203
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,180
I

204
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,840
I

205
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:50,860
I

206
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:50,880
I

207
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:50,900
Night

208
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,620
I

209
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:58,920
Night

210
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,780
I

211
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,620
I

212
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:11,620


213
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:11,680
Me

214
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,060
Kill Me by Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

215
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,900
And friends, you can reach Onan at onanatsubgenius.com.

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,260
In fact, you can reach a lot of subgeniuses by using their name at subgenius.com.

217
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,300
You can also reach him at, got the pencil ready?

218
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:49,920
Post Office Box 2321, Portland, Oregon 97208.

219
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:58,580
He's the subgenius answer man, and he has music as well, and occupant-related materials at a website,

220
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:08,280
which also has his P.O. Box number, because it's www.box2321.com.

221
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,480
Before that, we heard Consortium of Geniuses.

222
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,320
I got this, or rather, Consortium of Genius.

223
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:23,400
I got this CD and video and all kinds of stuff from them in New Orleans.

224
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:32,320
Consortium of Genius is evidently inspired by Monty Python, Fireside Theater, Mystery Science Theater 3000,

225
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,560
so many others that we would all recognize.

226
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,200
Their album called Free.

227
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,600
Free Brains and Dead Bodies, and that song was called Brain Rap.

228
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:50,360
Of course, friends, over the Dobbs head and all the mini collages on tonight's show are by

229
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,460
Fernanda Nande-Lee Moore, the great subgenius artist, now sound fartist.

230
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:05,780
And of course, ESO Swamp Radio with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith from WCSB every Thursday night in Cleveland.

231
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,900
And...

232
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,360
Uh...

233
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,280
Uh...

234
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,560
Uh...

235
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,220
Friends, you know, the aspects of this show tonight, number 854, will be a drag,

236
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,360
because the sad theme of this sad show is drunks.

237
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:30,500
And it was inspired by Philo, Dr. Philo Drummond, unearthing some tapes of our friend that died of drugs, like whiskey.

238
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,160
Dr. X was his name, heard in the background jamming with me,

239
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,660
a thousand years ago.

240
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:46,440
His name is in Book of the Subgenius, right under Bob's, next to mine and Philo's.

241
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,240
In the early 80s, he had a band called The Pink Boys.

242
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,800
Recognize that term?

243
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,000
And we will be playing his song called Pink Boy later.

244
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,200
The significance of this is simply that...

245
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
To me, he's mine.

246
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,660
He was my best friend in high school.

247
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,700
And...

248
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,880
And was there when we first heard the word subgenius.

249
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
He was part of the Boob Forest.

250
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,760
They moved a whole bunch of them into the cameras.

251
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,040
Do you know how slow and clumsy drunks are to a fropper like me?

252
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,960
A coffee drinker.

253
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, sure.

254
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,160
A fropp maniac.

255
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,820
And you know how little those stories that they tell you, those things say mean?

256
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,060
Oh, they got that instead of that, man.

257
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,440
They're like Spider-Man compared to these yo-yos.

258
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,520
Yeah, they're like...

259
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Oh, man.

260
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,720
Don't you blame.

261
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,480
Oh, thanks, man.

262
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:36,680
Oh, man.

263
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,860
We were waiting for that for...

264
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,460
I'm sorry, man.

265
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,460
Your show is pretty lame.

266
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,340
Okay, well, we already said...

267
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,600
Well...

268
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,400
Yeah?

269
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,520
Is there some way we can maybe...

270
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,480
Why aren't you turning the radio off or turning it to another channel?

271
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,300
He said it was lame.

272
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,980
Are you that much of a loser?

273
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,000
Is there something we can do for him, maybe?

274
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:00,260
Are you that much of a pathetic little dweeb that you can't figure out that you can turn your radio to another station?

275
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,540
Well, if he didn't like what we were saying, we could have helped him another way.

276
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,400
Is somebody sitting there with a gun to your head forcing you to listen to this station?

277
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,480
I'm just going to hear some...

278
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,120
The corporate states...

279
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,240
The blowfish man, and you blew his mind.

280
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,360
I can feel it now.

281
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,580
We're not playing Green Day tonight, kid.

282
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,900
I'm vacillating sexuality.

283
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,740
You're interpreting my mind.

284
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,780
Or, you know, they're fornicating or something.

285
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,740
I can tell that kid needed our spiritual help.

286
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,600
You can't expect responsible behavior when alcohol is served.

287
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,080
What the hell?

288
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,800
There you go.

289
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,380
You can't expect responsible...

290
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,500
As a matter of fact...

291
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,340
People, when they crucified parties, they were all ripped, roaring drunk.

292
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,280
...responsible behavior from drunks.

293
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,160
Right, right.

294
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,880
There are people who can drink, and then there's drunks.

295
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,940
I was having responsible behavior all night.

296
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,580
That's why I don't drink!

297
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,140
Think of the beer hall push.

298
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,940
Hitler knew what he was doing.

299
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,400
Oh, my God.

300
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,880
You can manipulate drunks quite easily.

301
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,840
You can't expect responsible behavior from people who have any alcohol or any other mind-altering substance in their body.

302
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,460
That's funny.

303
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,640
You know, because I've done quite a few alcoholics who are not...

304
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,880
You can't really expect people with a functioning endocrine system to behave normal.

305
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,540
You know?

306
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,320
You can be a drunk and not be a drunk.

307
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,520
You can be a jerk.

308
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,460
You can be an alcoholic and not be a jerk.

309
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,580
Then there's the drunken jerks.

310
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,620
And if you're that kind of a drunk, don't drink!

311
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,380
And then they mix swingerism with bestiality.

312
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,040
Who is putting a gun to the heads of these people and marching them into my campsite?

313
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,620
Or a pork chop, you know?

314
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,260
You know?

315
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,140
I don't get it.

316
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,600
Who was out there?

317
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,720
Who did they hire?

318
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,520
Who did Ace hire to go out there with handguns and force people to come into this thing?

319
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,500
Who forces security?

320
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,260
And drink those Mai Tais and mudsies?

321
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,140
Always unimportant for you and your family values.

322
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,940
Responsibility, friends.

323
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,640
People are trying to duck responsibility like they do here.

324
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,840
We're selling Malaysian children by the power.

325
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,720
Take responsibility for your own actions.

326
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,660
To work in sweaty little shops, that is.

327
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,820
If you don't like our actions, then don't patronize us.

328
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,840
If you don't keep up with my accents, you don't have to.

329
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,720
Are you that stupid out there?

330
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,580
Stop throwing money at us, man.

331
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,700
Shut the hell up.

332
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,980
Oh, that was a really good one.

333
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,280
Stop interpreting my inner consistency.

334
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,600
Totally.

335
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,220
Forget it.

336
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,600
Drop the alcohol.

337
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,020
Go straight for peroxide.

338
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,980
Really?

339
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,960
Now this guy's talking trash.

340
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,560
Yeah, everybody with white hair.

341
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,040
I think it'd be a beautiful world that way.

342
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,300
We're talking about squirting things out of your navel.

343
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,500
No, no, he's talking about drinking it straight, man.

344
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,040
Peroxide?

345
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,980
Yeah, hydrogen peroxide.

346
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,620
Try it.

347
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,160
Oh, man.

348
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,520
Talk about the blowhole of death, man.

349
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,460
That's going to remove a lot of your insides in one fell swoop.

350
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,560
Did you ever run up some peroxide, man?

351
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:35,940
Hello?

352
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,580
Man, drop the peroxide, man.

353
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,260
Drink gasoline.

354
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,520
That's not good.

355
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,800
No, you know what?

356
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,500
That's not a good buzz.

357
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,320
Not with, especially with the prices we've got, the world petroleum problem.

358
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,340
That's what the amateur fire breathers use.

359
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,780
You know, I've done that.

360
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,440
Who hasn't run out of gas and siphoned some gas out of another car and swallowed down a bunch of gas?

361
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,060
It's not fun.

362
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,800
I mean, who hasn't flipped their old frig frog out once in a while and put it in the tank just for a clever joke with the Polaroid crowd?

363
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,400
You know, some of them anyway.

364
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,980
Like that.

365
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,660
It's, you know, American.

366
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,480
It's macho.

367
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,400
We're humping steel.

368
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,560
I love my car, and I mean I love my car.

369
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,780
Oh, I'm feeling her headlights now.

370
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,120
They're like two round, robust, rounders.

371
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
Oh, Christine.

372
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,400
And my thing is that shift stick.

373
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,440
Yeah, baby.

374
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,560
Four on the floor.

375
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,000
That's me.

376
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,240
Or maybe that's two underneath her.

377
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,300
Here it comes.

378
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,920

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,220
There it comes.

380
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,960
There it comes.

381
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,120
Give me some loving.

382
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,480
Have all your loving.

383
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,580

Bob.

386
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,300
Yeah, we're spilling beers right and left.

387
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,960

388
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:04,960

00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:04,960


390
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:04,960


391
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:04,960


392
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:04,960


393
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,520
We got trouble in River City.

394
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,460
That's the smell of tea.

395
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,840
Which rhymes with B.

396
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,480
Which stands for beer.

397
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,500
Shake the hand.

398
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,600
Shake the hand of an honest drunk.

399
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,440
The farmer, he got plowed.

400
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,520
The bricklayer got plastered.

401
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,360
The mechanic, he got tagged.

402
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,960
And the construction worker got blasted.

403
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,200
And daddy beat up mommy.

404
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,980
And broke her collarbone for good luck.

405
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,120
And everybody's drunk.

406
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,980

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,040
And everybody's drinking on the job.

408
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,360
The garbage man got trashed.

409
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,960
The janitor got fired.

410
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:04,960

And everybody's drinking on the job.

419
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,720
There's a whole lot of places that I ain't been.

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,300
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen.

421
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,780
A whole lot of things I'll never be.

422
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:55,060
The generation that will change the world is still lookin' for its car.

423
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,180
Play!

424
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,140

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:54,820

No is it?

460
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,700
I thought you guys knew that song.

461
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,800
The Rainmakers friends from live in Oslo and now, something Philo did to something I did

462
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,580
to Bob.

463
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,760
Yes, I'm the jambal in a humping junkie that jumped the men from Mars.

464
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,480
I drank the devil under seven tables, I am too intense to die, opiates are the mess of

465
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,040
my religion, I take drugs.

466
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,100
Yes, I'm a rip snorter, I cram coca leaves right into my arm veins, before they are picked

467
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,820
off the trees.

468
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,200
I... space monsters cringe at my tread.

469
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,260
I wipe the pyramides off my shoes, before I enter my house.

470
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,100
I'm fuel injected, I'll live forever and remember it afterwards.

471
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm immune.

472
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,560
I'm radioactive.

473
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,720
Come on and give me cancer, I'll spit up the tumor and butter my bread with the juice.

474
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,180
I'm supernatural, I bend crowbars with my meat axe and a thought.

475
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,100
My droppings bore through the earth and erupt volcanoes in China.

476
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,940
Yes, I can drink more wine and stay soberer than always.

477
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,320
All the heathen hindus in Asia.

478
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,460
Yee-haw.

479
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,620
Nuts blow out.

480
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,060
Brown wavy medium.

481
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,460

00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,460

00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,620
Tashkentum's-Shelyabin.

484
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,680
Medium wavy brown.

485
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,660
A van of Ochernigavoser.

486
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,660
I like shaping.

487
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,680
Wavy brown medium.

488
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,560
I like to go out and drink beer.

489
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,280
I like to drink wavy brown beer.

490
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,220
We haven't...

491
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,920
We haven't...

492
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:04,920


493
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,300
We haven't any chance.

494
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:07,980
Chance?

495
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,880
You, uh...

496
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,320
No chance?

497
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:19,120
Naturally things happen like, uh, at the, uh, Columbia University.

498
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,100
At the other mother college.

499
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,600
Yeah.

500
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,800
No, it really is, uh...

501
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,460
Really?

502
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,020
Come on.

503
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,040
You know what?

504
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,880
I went to school at the University of Southern California.

505
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:32,880


506
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,940
You see?

507
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,180
We didn't do any of that shit.

508
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,660
We didn't do any of that shit.

509
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,320
Let me explain something to you.

510
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,860
When I was there, I went there.

511
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,360
You see me in the fightin' McBride?

512
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,740
When there was a fella...

513
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,000
I can't believe Bob was like this in front of those rotary clubs.

514
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,900
Oh, look, his butt, his butt fell right out.

515
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,360
Right on the glass, man.

516
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:50,860
Oh, my God.

517
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,640
Listen to him.

518
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,140
Anybody...

519
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,760
His butt fell off his mouth.

520
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,100
...walked into his...

521
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,360
Office.

522
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,820
Oh, man, what you doin' with your hands down there?

523
00:23:59,900 --> 00:23:59,940
...office.

524
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,860
Took a crap in the cab.

525
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,280
And tore down a picture.

526
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,100
Okay.

527
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,640
Jesus.

528
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,900
This is gonna cause awful smell.

529
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,520
Did excrement in his...

530
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,120
Bob was really upset about what those Bobbies did in Dobbs Town.

531
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,860
And did excrement in the hot tub.

532
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,760
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,820
He was really...

534
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,800
He was very pre-pubescent.

535
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,160
But...

536
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,680
This was Bob's reply after that year.

537
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,900
This was the last recording of Bob.

538
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,400
It was right after the year that they crapped in the hot tub.

539
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,200
We have member...

540
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,300
This is a very historical piece of memorabilia right here.

541
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:28,960
...would have...

542
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,420
Yeah.

543
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,740
...rem...

544
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,460
See, that's when the pipe...

545
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,820
He's trying to put the pipe back in his...

546
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,700
He doesn't like a curse.

547
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,140
...mouth to keep crawling out.

548
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,380
No.

549
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,300
There were women there.

550
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,800
He won't say bad words in...

551
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,100
No.

552
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,780
...Mix Company.

553
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,080
No.

554
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,080


555
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,120
Not unless they're showing their labia to him.

556
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,180
Even when he's that drunk...

557
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,140
Yeah.

558
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,920
...Bob has had manners.

559
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,300
Masick was an expert with the experts.

560
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,780
All serial murderers have this chair that I'm sitting on.

561
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,380
Morrison did something she had done before.

562
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,700
I looked under the bathroom and my telephone rang.

563
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,820
And it was this chair that I'm sitting on.

564
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,740
I opened the lighted phone and it was empty.

565
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,740
So, um, I went back to the telephone and I said,

566
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,660
Richard, you're not in the telephone.

567
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,340
I am in that telephone.

568
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,460
Oh!

569
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,240
Oh!

570
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,080


571
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,180
What's the magic, dragon?

572
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,840
Who's at your party?

573
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,080
If it's all natural...

574
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,800
Hey, uh, sit down and enjoy a red stripe, man.

575
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,980
I-I wanna tell you a little story, you know.

576
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,520
The palm is growing on a holly...

577
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,680
I think it was about, uh, maybe 10, 11 years ago.

578
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,780
All I read...

579
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,360
All, as far as you could see, they were cows, man.

580
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:59,480
It's like people think that there are palm trees and guava berries hanging from everything over here.

581
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,060
But not in the area of, uh...

582
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,060


583
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,900
My Little Village.

584
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,800
Where these huge doves heads fall from the sky.

585
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,920
And miles and miles.

586
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,920
As far as you can see.

587
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,520
That sounds like a Rasta Kerouac.

588
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,340
Hey!

589
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,900
That was Rasta Kerouac.

590
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,320
I don't think we've ever heard.

591
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,280
I don't think Rasta Kerouac has ever appeared on this show ever before.

592
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,560
Cold fusion of two alternative characters.

593
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,180
The Dave brain split again.

594
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,980
I like that.

595
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,060
Rasta Kerouac.

596
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,360
Again.

597
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,800
The Rasta Kerouac.

598
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,120
The Rasta Jack.

599
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,420
I like that.

600
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,380
Rasta Jack.

601
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,580
Rasta on the road.

602
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,600
That's if they were on the road and they ended up, you know, instead of like turning back in Mexico.

603
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,100
They should have kept going right on down.

604
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,380
Sweatshop in Kingston.

605
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,680
No.

606
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,860
Way down.

607
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,700
Like down in Bolivia or something.

608
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:57,560
They would have taken Jack Cassidy to, I mean Neil Cassidy, to a gun court for sure.

609
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,860
Remember the gun?

610
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,080
Of course they had for most of the subgeniuses for crying out loud.

611
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,180
Hey, first rule of gun club.

612
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,560
Don't talk about gun club.

613
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,580
If it's all natural, put it in your body.

614
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,680
Organic.

615
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,440
Yeah.

616
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
Simpson weed.

617
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,720
That's the.

618
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,000
Datura Nexus.

619
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,800
You gotta legalize it.

620
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,300
Oh, we taught it down.

621
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,300
Datura, man.

622
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,140
Make a fine tea out of local weed.

623
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,800
The devil's weed, man.

624
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,360
You don't want to smoke the devil's weed.

625
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,960
The devil's.

626
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,780
The devil's weed.

627
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,640
The devil's weed.

628
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:40,300
My bud smoked some Jimson weed and he ended up taking a dump on his living room floor in front of his parents.

629
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,900
My bud took a dump on his parents' floor.

630
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,240
He was a hedonist.

631
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,060
This guy was a Jimsonist.

632
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,060
He was about to take a dump on everybody.

633
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,380
Just like that hedonistic buddy of yours.

634
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,020
No, that's it.

635
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,800
Now, you guys aren't going to be putting.

636
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:04,340
George down when, uh, when the evil terrorist germ bomb goes off in your backyard.

637
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,060
And when they.

638
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,440
You're going to want George to save you.

639
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,700
They're going to trace you back.

640
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,220
Oh, George.

641
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,320
Aaron Fleischer's post office box.

642
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,440
Why didn't you bomb the hell out of those people before they set off that germ bomb in our backyard?

643
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,560
That's what you'll be saying.

644
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,200
Face it, Stang.

645
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,000
If you want to fight something for America, war is good.

646
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,760
You've got to fight war is good for industry, for the oil industry.

647
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,040
Yes.

648
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,740
But did you know that Iraq is sitting on one of the largest deposits?

649
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,620
There is to sit on.

650
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,460
Did you know that the slate underneath Saddam Hussein's feet was worth billions and billions of petroleum dollars?

651
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,560
Stang, you're confused about what's important in this country.

652
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,920
Look at you.

653
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,380
You're hardly a man.

654
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:44,820
Oh.

655
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,400
Ah, for crying out loud.

656
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,480
Look at those biceps.

657
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,560
What are you good for?

658
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,860
Can you lift this gun?

659
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,200
The eternal wisdom of nature's laws.

660
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,560
Which are completely opposite to the suicidal teachings of normality.

661
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,780
Whereas.

662
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,340
Normality says to love your enemies and to hate your own kind.

663
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,800
We say just the opposite.

664
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:16,460
We say that in order to survive, we must overcome and destroy those who are a threat to our existence.

665
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,900
Namely, our deadly enemies, the normals.

666
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,400
At the same time, we advocate love and protection.

667
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,820
That's not really what it's about.

668
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,980
And dear to our family and our own race.

669
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,040
The subjugation.

670
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,620
The subjugation.

671
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,060
The race.

672
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,240
Which is an extension of our family.

673
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:33,940
Nope.

674
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,960
It's just about killing.

675
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,400
It's just about our God-given right to kill.

676
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,260
Ask Ted Nugent.

677
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,480
Take as many as you can.

678
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
I'll bet Ted'll go.

679
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,700
Let God sort them.

680
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,720
I wish Ted would go.

681
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,900
And then he'll give them to the homeless center.

682
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,900
So give his kills to the homeless center.

683
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,920
When Ted realizes that some of the squirrels shoot back, he's going to be in a lot of doo-doo.

684
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I think he should go.

685
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,000
I'll bet Ted would be in there.

686
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,020
Don't.

687
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,020


688
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,020


689
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,020


690
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,260
Don't do it.

691
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,040
He's like one of those guys that came back from a golf war.

692
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,760
That's a good debate.

693
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,000
Would Ted win power?

694
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,620
I wish we could just find out those fetus ghosts are coming for us.

695
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,500
God has a heart on for Marie.

696
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,280
Because we kill everything we see.

697
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,180
He plays his games.

698
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,620
We play ours.

699
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,100
The butcher's apron.

700
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:28,220
To show our appreciation for so much power, we keep heaven.

701
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,440
Packed with fresh soul.

702
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,660
The butcher of Washington hides behind his berms.

703
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,280
The great yellow dog of the Potomac.

704
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,140
His formidable berms.

705
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,000
On the Potomac.

706
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,200
Grace, Marshall.

707
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,640
But he will not resist our special guided patriotic psychotic missiles.

708
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:58,640
Which can go straight down the premier's wife's brassiere, if that's where we want to target.

709
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,000
It was bad.

710
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,260
July in Virginia.

711
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,260
Yes.

712
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,940
The dogwood and the laurel lay heavy on the land.

713
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,880
While the virgin and the...

714
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,140
Magnolia was a blast.

715
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,260
Doc Mojo was burying Sung Lee back on the back 40.

716
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,040
That's sick.

717
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,220
Cheese lovers know that cheese lovers choose friskies.

718
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,180
Despite his sunny exterior, little Caleb is dead.

719
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,800
He doesn't even have a name.

720
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,000
For that reason...

721
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,740
Today we are proposing to add minutes to the environment.

722
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,600
Once it's added, shipments and sales would be allowed...

723
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,000
To companies that create everything.

724
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:39,880
Yay!

725
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,460
All too many demonic Israelis.

726
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,820
That would be me!

727
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,020
No!

728
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,800
And may I say...

729
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,360
From the banana.

730
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,480
Take out the pen.

731
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,380
I don't know anything.

732
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,580
Place the tip of the marker on the surface of her spirit.

733
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,980
And it's gotta be friskies.

734
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,060
You can come across the middle.

735
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,420
And then you can come high.

736
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,240
Well...

737
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,940
How...

738
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,200
Oh.

739
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,580
Or...

740
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,640
The dots in...

741
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,120
So they said...

742
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,180
Now experiencing hair.

743
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,240
Just snap.

744
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,500
And may I say I am...

745
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,160
Perfectly grilled.

746
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:24,220
Televangela has just sent in her bad dream of two hours ago.

747
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,720
And I'd like to read this to you.

748
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,540
It's short, Dave.

749
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,840
Televangela dreamed...

750
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,900
Some sort of subgenius gathering in my backyard and home.

751
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,140
The home where I grew up.

752
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Parents not home.

753
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,740
Not informed they were coming.

754
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,680
Myself either.

755
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,380
The usual group was there.

756
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,540
Plus some new faces with very unique outfits and problems.

757
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:52,440
A very loud woman in shiny spandex yelling that we should wrestle in food or something I recall vaguely thinking.

758
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,840
Oh, that was a bombastic party.

759
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,040
Is this Ziza?

760
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,720
Ziza?

761
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,460
Then people are...

762
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,840
Pasting something on the wall.

763
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,800
Some sort of decoration.

764
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,240
Look at her old pasty face, Dave.

765
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,840
Looking more like clear peaches.

766
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,560
Then, the worst part of all.

767
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,800
My grandma shows up and is seated in a circle of subgeniuses on the lawn without me being able to stop it.

768
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,140
Legume tells her about how we need more hate.

769
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,620
Jesus tells her he's Jesus.

770
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,540
Stang and we just agree and have those twinkling crazy eyes.

771
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,220
I show up.

772
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,860
But it's too late.

773
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,940
She's pissed and confused and arguing.

774
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,460
I try to help grandma but then I wake up.

775
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,140
Friend, are you even able to wake up from that dream you call life?

776
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,920
Can you open your eyes?

777
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,980
Can you awaken from that dream you call your job?

778
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,860
The sleeper must awake.

779
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,280
We call for the sleeper to awake.

780
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,540
I'm a potato.

781
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,000
You said it, bud.

782
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,900
Great.

783
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:28,940
No, no, no.

784
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,960
No, no.

785
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,120
Scraaaaaaack.

786
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,880
Pizza?

787
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,440
Omelette.

788
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,040
Herbal.

789
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,900
Call the man.

790
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,200
So Money.

791
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,840
So Money.

792
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,380
Call the man.

793
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:56,300
Fernand and Andy Lemur did that collage and now from their new CD, Reagan's Polyp.

794
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,600
Hey, any Beatles fans in the audience tonight?

795
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,100
We got a song for you.

796
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,940
It's called Daytripper now.

797
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,640
Let's do up some of that haba-fray-orang-a-tang-zip-ula-orang-a-tang.

798
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,580
Oh, let's.

799
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,600
This is a hell of a thing.

800
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,220
Ah, and the soft.

801
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,520
And the soft.

802
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,520


803
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,520


804
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,520


805
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,520


806
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,520


807
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,520


808
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,520


809
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,520


810
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,400
Noises enter the midbrain.

811
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,680
And the child gently releases its pituitarygasm.

812
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,920
And the feet are firmly placed on the ground as they should be.

813
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,560
My pituitarygasm.

814
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,940
Thanks, Mom.

815
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,860
Thanks, Dad.

816
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,380
It's gonna rip your whole spine next time.

817
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,120
Just relax, little boy.

818
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,320
Yeah.

819
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,560
They're coming back.

820
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,500
Wait, you're gonna have to hide under the bed here, kid.

821
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,200
I'm afraid.

822
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,320
Really afraid.

823
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,500
None of them pituitarygasms.

824
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,860
When they're coming by that make any noise, just hold onto this piece of wood.

825
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,400
And you can feel like you're doing something.

826
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,100
OK.

827
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,340
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

828
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,200
Be very quiet.

829
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,000
Bite onto the piece of wood if you want to make a sound.

830
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,020
If you start to .

831
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,260
Gath.

832
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:10,800
You just .

833
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:10,820
Open.

834
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,960
These people from child welfare services are creepy.

835
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,640
They are creepy as hell, man.

836
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,120
That's not the half of it.

837
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,720
They got some penis.

838
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,600
We're all in deep sh…

839
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,280
We're…

840
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,480
We're…

841
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,540
Let's just…

842
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,980
To have the circumcision machines.

843
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,960
We're in even deeper.

844
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,480
Oh, yeah.

845
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,480


846
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,480


847
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,480


848
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,480


849
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,800
To wear a bob without a Connie.

850
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,740
Oh man, no anesthetic for these guys.

851
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,100
One of the first things any of the forbidden children must learn is how to keep the pituitary

852
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,240
gasm at a minimum.

853
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:50,640
The child service workers are often vicious and barbaric in their retribution and have

854
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,780
sometimes even slothed the little old childs.

855
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:59,580
A pituitary gasm in a pre-10 year old can be a violent, earth-shaking thing.

856
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,720
This is one of the cause-ripped causes for poltergeist.

857
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,200
That's not why you get them to take your shoes.

858
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,080
Sloth.

859
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,160
Truth to children.

860
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,420
Watch how these children are now found in despair.

861
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,900
Their eyes most likely never come true.

862
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,200
They sniff the anguish.

863
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,240
They are fortunate.

864
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,580
Jerry, he says that the hardest child comes.

865
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,300
He'd sent out into the world his nine-year-old Anguish and his eight-year-old Peter.

866
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,180
They were all seven.

867
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,200
I can see these kids.

868
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,860
What a young age to live.

869
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,700
What?

870
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,440
What?

871
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:52,960
What?

872
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,140


873
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,140


874
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,140


875
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,140


876
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,140


877
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,140


878
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,140


879
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,140


880
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,540
What?

881
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,380
What?

882
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,380


883
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,380


884
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,380


885
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,380


886
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,380


887
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,240
Truth to children.

888
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
Am I still dancing?

889
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,620
I can't remember.

890
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,160
It doesn't sound like much of a dance anymore.

891
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,340
I can't hear my heels clicking.

892
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,860
I'm dancing to the dark side of the moon.

893
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,960
Oh, Dave's playing that.

894
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,140
I mean, Chance is playing that song about you.

895
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,220
The Pink Boys.

896
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,880
The Pink Boys?

897
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,000
Is that who this is?

898
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,380
Yeah, the Pink Boys.

899
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,520
Man, that was a great band before the lead singer OD'd.

900
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,560
Good.

901
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,080
New and upgraded.

902
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,320
Perfect in the box.

903
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,700
Good.

904
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,380
Good.

905
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,160
Good.

906
00:38:59,540 --> 00:38:59,820
Good.

907
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,780
Pink Boys.

908
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,000
You're gonna throw up.

909
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,480
Pink Boys.

910
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,980
Think I'm gonna throw up.

911
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,200
Pink Boys.

912
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,320
You can't forget this passion.

913
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,500
You can't put a stand with this kind of passion.

914
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,300
Still.

915
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,980
That's it.

916
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Pink Boys.

917
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,160
You need a degree.

918
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,120
I need.

919
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,560
Is that the university?

920
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,120
Because it is.

921
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,040
I'm always looking at the station.

922
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,820
I always have to find a source of any of that action.

923
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,220
Pink Boys.

924
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,420
You're never gonna throw up.

925
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,140
Pink Boys.

926
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,040
You're gonna throw up.

927
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,840
Pink Boys.

928
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,880
You can't forget this passion.

929
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,100
You can't put a stand with this kind of passion.

930
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,840
Still.

931
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Pink Boys.

932
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,140
You're gonna throw up.

933
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,580
Pink Boys.

934
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:02,880
You can't forget this passion.

935
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,300
You can't put a stand with this kind of passion.

936
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,620
Pink Boys.

937
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:09,620


938
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:09,620


939
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:09,620


940
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:09,620


941
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:09,620


942
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,400
Fuck you.

943
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:10,760
Pink Boys.

944
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,460
Pink Boys.

945
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:11,900
You can't forget this passion.

946
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:11,900


947
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:11,900


948
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:11,900


949
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,040
You can't forget this.

950
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,860
Pink Boys.

951
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,620
You can't forget this passion.

952
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,200
Pink Boys.

953
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,540
You can't forget this passion.

954
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:19,840
Yeah.

955
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,500
You can't forget this passion.

956
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,300
B-Boy, we're gonna go up

957
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,020
B-Boy, we're gonna go up

958
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,380
B-Boy, it's just a little bit of action

959
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,100
You can't really tell, but it's just a little bit of action

960
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,780
B-Boy

961
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,360
B-Boy

962
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,940
B-Boy

963
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,580
B-Boy

964
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,380
B-Boy

965
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,620
B-Boy

966
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,220
B-Boy

967
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:56,960
B-Boy

968
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:15,720
I drink and kill the whiteness in my eyes

969
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,520
Don't wanna think about those lonely goodbyes

970
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,440
I can't forget

971
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,760
All the pounding in my head

972
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,000
And waking up

973
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,120
Creatures in my bed

974
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,180
And when did this all begin?

975
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,700
Tap on the shoulder, my friend

976
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,820
Ay-ay, ay-ay

977
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,080
I drink enough

978
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,520
Ay, I drink enough

979
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,020
Ay, I drink enough

980
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,500
I drink and travel

981
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,660
Around the whole world

982
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:06,260
I drink and marry a liquor store girl

983
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,920
I drink and build

984
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,700
My cellfoil yacht

985
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,280
And small old trucks

986
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,360
Oh, I never get caught

987
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,920
For when the bar is where I want to be

988
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,120
I take my ship and I tank across the sea

989
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,640
I, I, I, I, I drink enough

990
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,260
I, I drink enough

991
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,120
I'm living at home

992
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,820
Oh, it gets old

993
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,000
And I'm at my parents' house

994
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,760
It's been so old

995
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,260
In the pubs where I want to be

996
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,360
I take my boat and we can float across the sea

997
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,660
And if I run out of cash

998
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,560
I get my meals from the trash

999
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,320
I, I, I, I drink enough

1000
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,980
I, I, I, I drink enough

1001
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,800
I, I, I, I drink enough

1002
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,800
I drink and kill

1003
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,940
The whiteness in my eyes

1004
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,900
Don't want to think about those lonely goodbyes

1005
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,740
I can't forget

1006
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,120
All the pounding in my head

1007
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,320
And waking up

1008
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,440
Creatures in my bed

1009
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,140
And when will this all end

1010
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,220
Live with cirrhosis, my friend

1011
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,680
I, I, I, I, I drink enough

1012
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,140
I, I, I, I drink enough

1013
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:16,060
I, I, I, I, I drink enough

1014
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,340
I, I, I, I drink enough

1015
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,680
Infest pain and

1016
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:30,140
I, I, I, I drink enough

1017
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,180
To clean my ears

1018
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:36,540
Where I used to live

1019
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:36,680
They'll wash them from the stain

1020
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:50,980
If I don't Ihave to think about my ways

1021
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,640
The Line.

1022
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,340
The Line, tweaked by Lemur.

1023
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,720
Before that, that song, I Drink Enough, is by Rocco Schwab

1024
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,300
from his album, The Barlight Beauty.

1025
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:26,500
Information is at www.scaryrecords.com.

1026
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,700
That's roccoshwab at hotmail.com.

1027
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,020
And before that, friends, The Pink Boys, doing that song,

1028
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,940
the titular song, The Pink Boys.

1029
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,480
That was the band of my friend Dr. X.

1030
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,660
That was recorded live in some club in Dallas in 1980,

1031
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,700
about the time that the first,

1032
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,120
subgenius pamphlet was printed.

1033
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,980
Dr. X died of drink and bad habits,

1034
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,520
and it was a bummer, man,

1035
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,040
because he was my high school best pal.

1036
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,440
And he died before he was even 40.

1037
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,260
But now, Reagan's Pollock!

1038
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,960
Any Led Zeppelin fans out here tonight?

1039
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,340
The only one that's called The Immigrant Song.

1040
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,800
这。。。

1041
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:39,480

Go GM철

1044

Go Gmail

1045
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,060
No, it's not!

1046
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:13,460
I am a gull darned visionary, I see the future and the past in comic books and wine bottles,

1047
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,520
I eat black holes for breakfast.

1048
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,260
I bend my jeans and whittle my DNA with the sheer force of my mighty will.

1049
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,560
I spear my own gull darned evolution.

1050
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,320
I ran M out of heaven and sold it to hell for a profit.

1051
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,140
I'm enlightened, I achieved nirvana and took it home with me.

1052
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,060
Yip, yip, yee-yee-ee.

1053
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:37,240
I'm so ugly the speed of light can slow me down and gravity won't tug at my cuffs.

1054
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,060
When the rapture comes, I'll make M wait.

1055
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,980
They'll never clean my cage.

1056
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,780
Now give me some more of, Take Runs Out.

1057
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,600
Summertime's here, kiddies.

1058
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,240
And it's time to take a break.

1059
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,940
Take a trip, to take a trip, to this world so bad.

1060
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:01,120
You feel so sad, you gotta take a trip, into a world so glad.

1061
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:11,100
A world of frogs, and green fountains, and flying dogs, and silver cats, and emerald rats,

1062
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:19,120
and purple clouds, and faceless crowds, and walls of glass that never passed.

1063
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,340
And pictures hanging upside down.

1064
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,160
You won't ask where you are.

1065
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,300
It's another world.

1066
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,420
You and your girl, and all your friends, will all be there.

1067
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:34,840
Oh yeah.

1068
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,240
Let's take a trip.

1069
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,200
Let's take a trip.

1070
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,060
TNT.

1071
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,060
SOS.

1072
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,260
HOB.

1073
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:46,740
TOP.

1074
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,220
Get to talk.

1075
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,900
Hey, here we go now.

1076
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,560
Let's climb some mountains, everybody.

1077
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,520
Get on your walking shoes.

1078
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,900
Let's climb some mountains.

1079
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,700
Here we go.

1080
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,900
Let's take a trip.

1081
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,720
Let's take a trip.

1082
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,700
Let's start to dream.

1083
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,780
Let's close our eyes.

1084
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,600
It's groovy now.

1085
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,600
Yeah.

1086
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,200
Floating.

1087
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,080
Because I'm swimming in beauty.

1088
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,100
It's all around.

1089
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,200
Let's take a trip.

1090
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,340
I'm from the ground.

1091
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:21,640
Whoa.

1092
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,180
Whoa.

1093
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,260
Yeah.

1094
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,880
Let's take a trip.

1095
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,800
It's really hip.

1096
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,740
No one will know what goes on.

1097
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,660
Just you and me.

1098
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,780
And the dreams we see.

1099
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,560
I'll come out of you.

1100
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,880
I'll come out of you, babe.

1101
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,280
You're doing it right.

1102
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,460
Just put your head back.

1103
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,380
Friends, The Trip by Kim Fowley.

00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,480
Austin, Texas 78720.

1109
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:21,260
And you can write to me, Reverend Ivan Stang, stang at subgenius.com.

1110
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,380
And just check www.subgenius.com.

1111
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,820
And praise Bob.

1112
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,140
I mean, everyone knows who this shit is.

1113
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,380
I got a mathematical equation for you.

1114
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,340
Here's a word problem.

1115
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,860
A math word problem.

1116
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,620
Okay.

1117
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,460
I'm going to write to you.

1118
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:43,460


1119
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,600
The universe is an infinite...

1120
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,060
Sorry, an infinite...

1121
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,720
Oh, you should write the first one.

1122
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,820
...agglomeration of energy fields resembling threads of light.

1123
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,720
That's A.

1124
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,800
Okay, threads. Remember threads.

1125
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:04,760
These energy fields radiate from a source of inconceivable proportions, metaphorically, called the eagle.

1126
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:05,760
The needle?

1127
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,640
The eagle.

1128
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,940
The eagle.

1129
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,220
Eagle?

1130
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:08,600
Eagle.

1131
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,000
Eagle.

1132
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,220
Eagle.

1133
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:09,480
Eagle?

1134
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,720
Eagle.

1135
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:09,720


1136
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:09,940
Eagle?

1137
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,020
Three.

1138
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,080
The answer is C.

1139
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:19,860
Human beings are also composed of an incalculable number of the same thread-like energy field.

1140
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,340
Whew, we are?

1141
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:26,000
So the question is, one ply or two?

1142
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,400
Oh, man, that's an easy one.

1143
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,160
Two ply.

1144
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,500
Oh, you think it is.

1145
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,140
Black hole.

1146
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,940
Yeah, if you don't pick the right answer, that's what you get.

1147
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,640
You'll be picking something else out of your sockets.

1148
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,020
Oh, is that song over?

1149
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,520
The end of the world is over already?

1150
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,880
Yes, it is.

1151
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,960
Let's sing a song about the end of the world.

1152
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,020
Let's sing a song about the end of the world.

1153
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,660
No, let's go to war.

1154
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:00,160
Let's sing a song about war and the end of the world.

1155
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,840
Sky Pilot.

1156
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,520
Oh, the beginning of the world?

1157
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,060
Yeah, let's sing a song about the beginning of the world.

1158
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:09,520
In E.

1159
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,100
Okay.

1160
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,440
The great yeti mother

1161
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,060
Squatted down

1162
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,180
And grew

1163
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:26,060
and gave birth to the universe.

1164
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:33,100
And then the great yeti father came upon the egg of the universe

1165
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:37,740
and what splurted upon it was what we call time.

1166
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,560
And so time and the universe came together

1167
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,860
and something came from nothing.

1168
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,200
And then God invented souls.

1169
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,240
And then Bob let God loose from his chain and said,

1170
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:57,920
Sack him!

1171
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,860
And the souls evolved and sent $30 to Bob.

1172
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,360
Praise Bob.

1173
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,500
And so the universe began.

1174
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,840
Well, that homily was performed by his son.

1175
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,960
His own self, his own self, the gland man,

1176
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,000
our favorite clam, the Reverend Ivan Stang.

1177
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,940
I don't think there's a dry eye socket

1178
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,900
or any other socket in this room now.

1179
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,560
The brain is the only proper receptacle for the seed of genius.

1180
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,060
The brain, the brain, look at that.

1181
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:42,980
Look at how many little tiny dendrites that are moving.

1182
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,320
Bring me more blind French maid.

1183
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,840
If you fly past...

1184
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,520
If you fly past the sonic sphere, you will die.

1185
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,960
Yes, you will.

1186
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,700
You cannot live through that.

1187
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,460
It's a storm of light.

1188
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,320
You know, it's pretty dark out there.

1189
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:03,340
Hey, what happens when two black holes come together?

1190
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,560
If two black holes meet?

1191
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,160
They suck each other up into the infinities.

1192
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,760
Gravitational ripples?

1193
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,380
Perhaps a new poo-poo on your wing?

1194
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,800
It's become like a snakey...

1195
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,640
How could anybody actually...

1196
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:16,840
...infinities?

1197
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:16,840


1198
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:16,840


1199
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:16,840


1200
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:16,840


1201
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:16,840


1202
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,280
Snakes eating each other's tails?

1203
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,440
No one could know the answer to that question.

1204
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,900
Or fabulous psychosis, any time you want.

1205
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,840
We could never observe it.

1206
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,780
We could never absorb it.

1207
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,320
We could never...

1208
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,380
Any answer could never be proven.

1209
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,560
So why is such an answer...

1210
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,620
Well, from a distance, we can observe the effects

1211
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,800
of the two black holes colliding.

1212
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,160
Perhaps in some future civilization...

1213
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,460
But you would never really know what's going on deep down,

1214
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,060
you know, in the middle of it all.

1215
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,400
No, but it would generate unthinkable energies,

1216
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,600
and with those, we could...

1217
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,800
...power our amps.

1218
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,160
Oh, yeah.

1219
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,180
What an ingenious idea.

1220
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,420
They're so much better than broomsticks and candles.

1221
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,240
That'd be a great place to do a concert, man.

1222
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,780
Right at the meeting point between the two black holes.

1223
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,980
I think that's where we did it.

1224
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,080
Sapping forces of the vortex.

1225
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,160
Friday night at X-Day.

1226
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,980
That was sort of like one of those...

1227
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,860
The conclave-age.

1228
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,720
Concert right between the two black holes there.

1229
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,500
It was the two left eyes of God.

1230
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,300
Yeah, well, I think one of the black holes was Doc Frop's camp.

1231
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,380
That's where we got sucked into.

1232
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:15,860
Yeah.

1233
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,040
Ah.

1234
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,200
Like a parasite.

1235
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,400
Like a vampire.

1236
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,000
Oh, that's right.

1237
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,120
Yeah, you missed it.

1238
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,400
You missed the big...

1239
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:21,960
Yeah.

1240
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,080
Oh, but the robots...

1241
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,300
When I get my jet fighter plane, I'm going to play this piece.

1242
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,260
When I get to kill...

1243
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,600
When I get to kill our Iraqis...

1244
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,220
Listen, honey, they're playing our romantic song.

1245
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,520
Oh, remember how many Iraqis we killed with this song?

1246
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,100
They loved it.

1247
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,480
Kill, kill, kill.

1248
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,980
The hoose wasn't so badly either.

1249
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:45,720
Kill.

1250
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,080
Kill.

1251
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,140
The black holes.

1252
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:47,820
Yeah.

1253
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,480
I think one's from a firefighter named Tom Evans when he put his fire out.

1254
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,400
What does that mean?

1255
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,220
That's a pretty metaphorical thing there, man.

1256
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,700
I don't know if we can even handle that on this show, at least.

1257
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,120
That is infatimable.

1258
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,080
We don't have the kind of, like, energy forces to deal with that.

1259
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:06,240
Beyond me.

1260
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:07,620
Okay.

1261
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,480
What happens if an irresistible pie meets an uncontrollable high?

1262
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,580
Ah, that is when you need...

1263
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,480
Sandwich time.

1264
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,600
The boundless appetite.

1265
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,300
Yes.

1266
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,000
For the infinite pie.

1267
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,180
I lust for food.

1268
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,380
Not I lust for life.

1269
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,360
The uncontrollable pie.

1270
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,440
A pie.

1271
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,460
This is making me slobbering at the mouth.

1272
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:29,780
You've missed it.

1273
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:29,780


1274
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,500
Go for a pie.

1275
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:31,820
Mildly delicious.

1276
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,260
Look, your euphemisms are on the corner of your nasal drip.

1277
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,480
Isn't that Dairy Farmers Union place open all the time?

1278
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,640
Oh, no, not at this hour of the night unless you go to a special dairy mart.

1279
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:43,660


1280
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,060
A special ice cream.

1281
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,480
Yes.

1282
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:46,900
That's what I'm gonna...

1283
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:48,620
Yum.

1284
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:50,960
Pie.

1285
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:51,800
Pie.

1286
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,360
Pie.

1287
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,060
Pie in the sky.

1288
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,080
That's what we've been offered the whole time when they're offering us death.

1289
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:56,600
Pie squared.

1290
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,020
Pie.

1291
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:57,320
Pie.

1292
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,740
I hate to sound like an old wobbly son of a bitch.

1293
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,160
I like to get down every now and then.

1294
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,200
I like to get down and...

1295
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,240
Caramel.

1296
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,420
Really, you know, I put...

1297
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,100
I do a whole different retuning for this.

1298
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,200
And get down into the roots of pie.

1299
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,900
You ever get down into the roots of pie?

1300
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:14,540
Yeah, man.

1301
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:14,940
That's...

1302
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,880
No, I'm hip to it.

1303
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,920
But I've never done it before.

1304
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,740
A lot of people aren't in touch with that.

1305
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,920
They think, you know, all you do is go down to the music store and buy the equipment and,

1306
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,960
you know, that's the next thing.

1307
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,900
You're in pie.

1308
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,880
But you gotta get into the root of pie, baby.

1309
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:28,320
Yeah.

1310
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,260
And that's something you can't buy at a store.

1311
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,240
You know, you can buy the pie there, but you can't buy the root of pie.

1312
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,020
Where does the mud of the root of pie come from?

1313
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,120
I don't know, man.

1314
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,180
You gotta answer that question.

1315
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,180
Where's the mud of the root of pie?

1316
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,280
Oh, that's deep.

1317
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,500
Well, ultimately, it comes from a point.

1318
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:51,720
A point which expands to become the circle from which we derive the pie, or vice versa.

1319
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,880
The perfect circle.

1320
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,040
The perfect hole.

1321
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,420
A zero.

1322
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,000
A nothingness.

1323
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:02,200
Like the thing in the center of Bob's brain.

1324
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,580
Perfect like a little baby's colon.

1325
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,540
An ever-growing nothingness.

1326
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,300
An all-devouring non-existence.

1327
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,120
Look at its little chunks.

1328
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,460
An anti-somethingness.

1329
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,080
Look at its little...

1330
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,100
Molecular...

1331
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:21,100
A rapacious black hole of all things.

1332
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,820
All light.

1333
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,700
All gravitational forces.

1334
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,780
Even tachyons.

1335
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,740
A ravenous boop holder of tachyons.

1336
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,220
Bob-ions.

1337
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,600
And whack-me-ons.

1338
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,620
Whack-me-ons.

1339
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,420
Yeah, I like the whack-me-ons.

1340
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,980
Oh, Bob, we call out to you in this, our darkest hour.

1341
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:45,420
We are lost in the wilderness, and we need not only your salvation,

1342
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:50,100
but your guidance and your supreme pure light.

1343
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,160
Oh, let it shine.

1344
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,840
Till next week, keep your hat on tight, you're back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.

1345
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,920
This is ESO Radio, signing off.

1346
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,340
See ya.

1347
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:12,740
Your eye, till the sun is in the sky.

1348
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,220
I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag.
