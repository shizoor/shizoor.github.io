1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello, and welcome to the Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,560
This is 89.7 WITR in Lillietta, and my name is Gobi.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,040
Yeah, it is Gobi, that's right.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,740
And I will be with you for the next hour and a half, hour and 45 minutes or so, bringing you Slack as always.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,780
Why? Because we love you.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,260
Yeah, speak for yourself, Gobi.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,260
Because we're in the mood.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,700
For Slack.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,000
For fun.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,000
For good times.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,600
For good music.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,560
For friends and drinks.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,960
For cocktails and parties.

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,760
For cheese dip, cheese whiz, little pretzel things.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,520
Yes, folks, we're in the mood for J.R. Bob Dog.

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,580
We're in the mood for Wanda.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,840
We're in the mood for Heifer, Seth, Noo Noo, Nar and NeNe.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:01,900
NeNe.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,020
NeNe.

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,400
We're in the mood for NeNe.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:09,900
NeNe.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,900
And we're not hearing it.

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,400
We're in the mood for technical difficulties.

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,260
Whoo!

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,720
We're in the mood for cassette players that don't work.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,380
We're in the mood for CD players that skip.

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,000
We're in the mood for cursed audio equipment.

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:29,980
We're in the mood for cursed audio equipment.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,340
We're in the mood for subtle, cheesy ads from the 50s.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,740
We're in the mood for plastic.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,220
We're in the mood for 45 records.

32
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,100
For CDs.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,240
For albums.

34
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,400
For cassette players.

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,240
We're in the mood for puzzling evidence.

36
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,260
We're in the mood for the end of the song.

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,860
Here it comes.

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,140
Here it comes.

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,940
Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,820
It's coming.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
It's almost there.

42
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,600
We've almost made it, friends.

43
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,120
Together.

44
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,980
As one.

45
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


46
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


47
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


48
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


49
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


50
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,880
We've almost made it.

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,360
To the end of the song.

52
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,420
Whoo!

53
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,260
Not yet.

54
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,420
Okay, all right.

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:07,780
All right.

56
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,520
We're on our way.

57
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,600
Here we go.

58
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,500
Here we go.

59
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,400
Here we go.

60
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:12,860
We're going?

61
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,440
We're going.

62
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,900
Here we go.

63
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,980
Here we go.

64
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,020
Okay?

65
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,640
Okay?

66
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,300
It, it...

67
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,800
It...

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,340
It...

69
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,480
It, it...

70
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,580
It...

71
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:23,620
It...

72
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,480
Eh...

73
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,180
It...

74
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,180


75
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,180


76
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,440
Eh...

77
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,440
Ugh.

78
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,680
Oh.

79
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,740
It's the end of the sign.

80
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,940
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

81
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,620
which reaches from the inner mind to...

82
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,480
The Soap Genius Hour of Slack.

83
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,220
Welcome potential initiates

84
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,000
and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

85
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,840
Thank you.

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,120
If you want our guns, come out and get them.

87
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
The armor will be set by Slag's heat

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,280
drinking and shooting the pistol

89
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,780
at the little pools of fire

90
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,860
waking up them in the darkness.

91
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,140
Bam, bam, bam!

92
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,140
Your bullet can't see me.

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,440
You have the eyes, the mind,

94
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,120
and the will of every bullet to fly.

95
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,300
You will not take what you can.

96
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,820
And we will not remember again.

97
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,780
That liquor always looks like

98
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,040
the best of the time.

99
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,000
That's the time to latch on the bullet.

100
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,020
This is the time.

101
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,420
Heh.

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,620
This is the one.

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,160
Wild side of life, ain't it, Wilgus?

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,620
Wilgus just grinned

105
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,240
and opened in another beer.

106
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,920
And are you married, divorced, separated, single,

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,780
uninterested, or dead?

108
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,320
Yes.

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
And do you or anyone in your household

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,640
work in publishing, television, radio,

111
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,640
or have a conviction of violent crimes with a gun?

112
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,120
With a gun?

113
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,400
Yes.

114
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:16,800
No.

115
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,140
Good.

116
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,920
Now, we're conducting research

117
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,320
into the impact of visual versus oral stimuli.

118
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,420
What you see as opposed to what you hear.

119
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,860
For the next three minutes,

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,200
we're going to either show you a slide

121
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,600
or let you hear a sound.

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,320
You tell us which of the two stimuli

123
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,480
has a greater impact on you.

124
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,980
And you're going to give me a watch for this?

125
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,080
When it's all over, yes.

126
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,340
Hmm.

127
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,040
A cheap one.

128
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,320
Hmm.

129
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,200
Okay, shoot.

130
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,420
Here's your first image.

131
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,660
Okay, a second's all you get.

132
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,640
Here's your sound.

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,200
I would have to say the sound.

134
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,780
Fine.

135
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,380
Indicate your choice by pressing

136
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,300
either one of the two blue buttons in front of you.

137
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,300
What about this big red button?

138
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,020
Don't touch that.

139
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,620
Now, indicate your choice.

140
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,700
Fine.

141
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,760
Sound over image for the first example.

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,360
All right, here's another slide.

143
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,980
Wow, put that back on.

144
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,420
Sorry.

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
A peek is all you get.

146
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,080
Who is she?

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,600
Come on, we have to continue.

148
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,440
Now, here's your sound.

149
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,720
I can't decide.

150
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,780
Maybe you'd better let me see the picture again.

151
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,440
No, your choice is obviously image over sound.

152
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:08,900
Ow!

153
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,340
Now, that was your next sound.

154
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:10,860
Hurt me.

155
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,900
And here's another slide.

156
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,040
Look at this, I'm bleeding.

157
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,440
Sound wins again.

158
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,880
Please press the appropriate button.

159
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,440
And we're ready to move on to part two of the survey.

160
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,260
An image or sound will be presented,

161
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,560
then several reactions will appear on the screen

162
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,600
with a number above each one.

163
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,200
Press the yellow button that corresponds to your reaction.

164
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,400
What about this big red button?

165
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,420
Don't touch that.

166
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,640
Now, first we have a sound.

167
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,580
Sponsors who are on the screen indicate yours now.

168
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,640
Indecisive, aren't you?

169
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,360
Sorry.

170
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,280
Is that all right?

171
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,200
It's fine.

172
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,660
Thank you very much.

173
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,080
And how about that one?

174
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,520
That one makes me want to leave.

175
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,160
Can I push the big red button now?

176
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,240
I said don't touch that.

177
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,920
We have achieved liftoff.

178
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,900
The show is lifting off.

179
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
Fasten your seat belts, please.

180
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,880
There will be a toll.

181
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,140
Please slow down.

182
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,540
The toll booth is approaching.

183
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,700
Pick up your ticket.

184
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,940
Cars only, nothing in tow.

185
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,040
Please press the button on your right.

186
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,360
Insert coin.

187
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,000
Deposit 25 cents.

188
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,120
We have achieved orbit.

189
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,700
We're now orbiting this country.

190
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:47,200
Yes, orbiting the United States in a small, slow circle.

191
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,040
And that's right.

192
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,080
We are taking requests.

193
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,960
If you'd like to hear something on the space episode of the subgenius, just ask.

194
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,540
Oh, what's that?

195
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,360
You want to hear there's no beer in heaven?

196
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,880
Well, I think we can find that.

197
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,420
Rock music.

198
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,120
It is the number one tool being used with them.

199
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,820
Rock music sets itself above God.

200
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,340
Now listen, we are programmable.

201
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,260
The devil knows how to program you.

202
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:51,160
The devil has programmed two generations of young people for absolute total destruction through his music.

203
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,060
Now, the devil wouldn't be the devil if he didn't have music.

204
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,640
You know what they said in Syracuse, New York when they were going to have a concert up there recently?

205
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,140
The police chief said it's not the violence I worry about as much as the nudity.

206
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,900
Dancing. Dancing.

207
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,040
Nudity. Violence.

208
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,220
Dancing. Dancing.

209
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,300
Nudity. Violence.

210
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,520
Young people are killing themselves at a rapid rate.

211
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,680
I believe much of it has a result of rock music.

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,820
Rock music.

213
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,940
Our homes have been torn down.

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,540
The walls of purity have been torn down.

215
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,940
Morality in general has been put in the sewer because of rock music.

216
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,020
These gods.

217
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,080
That's supposed to get you all nervous and jerky.

218
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,500
Because it can make us feel relaxed.

219
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,940
It can make us feel scared.

220
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,860
Isn't that interesting?

221
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,280
You'll notice they don't play the Tennessee Waltz in a Halloween flick.

222
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,200
Now, would you agree with me that there's patriotic music?

223
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:58,500
Yes.

224
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,800
Would you agree with me there's funeral music?

225
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,020
Yes.

226
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,720
Would you agree with me that there's scary type music?

227
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,040
Yes.

228
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,200
Would you agree with me that there's relaxing type music?

229
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,540
Yes.

230
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,000
Matter of fact, there is also boogie type music.

231
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,560
Boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity.

232
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,820
And now, here's Johnny.

233
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,920
Ask not what your country can do for you.

234
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,160
Here, our friends will be drinking all the beer.

235
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,040
Hooray!

236
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,040
In himmel gibt'st ein Bier.

237
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,760
We're drinking with a tear.

238
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,540
Den Sinten vernichten wir hier.

239
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,320
Dann trinken wir anderen unser Bier.

240
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,360
What did he say?

241
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,200
In heaven there is no beer.

242
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,100
No beer?

243
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,000
That's why we drink it here.

244
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,560
I won't go.

245
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,840
And when we're gone from here,

246
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,600
our friends will be drinking all the beer.

247
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,320
Hooray!

248
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,400
In heaven there is no beer.

249
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,320
No beer?

250
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,240
That's why we drink it here.

251
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,400
I won't go.

252
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,020
And when we're gone from here,

253
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,560
A product will be introduced whose only function is to be recycled.

254
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:56,860
As a backlash against animal rights fanatics, Cool Tea Plus products will be introduced.

255
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,760
We have one of your old favorites from the 70s, from the rocking years, the golden years

256
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,080
of rock and roll, the golden years of disco, the golden years of ugly clothing and bad

257
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,500
music.

258
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,540
Cool Tea Plus.

259
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm sure you'll remember this one.

260
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,800
This goes out to bleep all Abernathy.

261
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,900
The greenhouse effect will be used to prove that the earth is a zoo.

262
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,940
The last drive-in theater will close.

263
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,540
Low-definition television will be taken over by subgenius simpies.

264
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,820
Alex Everett will convene to try and punish bad guys with wait tech's and this is when

265
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:49,820


266
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,240
TV hypnotizes normal.

267
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,960
Conspiracy scientists will reveal that cancer and cigarettes have a single cause.

268
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,500
Learning disorders will be discovered to be teaching disorders.

269
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:15,160
And counseling centers will be opened for would-be-conspiracy teachers.

270
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,540
Shopping stores will begleard.

271
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:17,540


272
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:17,540


273
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:17,540


274
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:17,540


275
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,820
malls would become large enough that they'd begin to connect, forming walled cities of consumption.

276
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,960
You're gonna go for the dance and not die, but because they're bad for the environment.

277
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,820
Yes, they must change their ways. So let's volunteer to rip off their clothing

278
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,980
until their hair is pure and clean.

279
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:54,180
Come on now. Come on back on the comeback. We're asking you to speak your piece about perhaps the Lithuanian problem.

280
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,500
Denying peyote to the Native American church. And Earth Day, the commercialization of Earth Day.

281
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,640
One of the greatest holidays for money making and money saving in American history. So shop now

282
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:12,120
on those beautiful Evolution Echo Perfect Lawn Chairs. We got them real cheap, $49.95.

283
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,500
Ecologically perfect lawn chairs. Do it now. Only a little bit of lip zirconia.

284
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:17,900
$49.95.

285
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,460
Now that's a fan for the family.

286
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,020
I bow my head.

287
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,400
Oh, you're on air.

288
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,660
Let's hear this guy.

289
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,740
Well, hello Dave.

290
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,480
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,380
I'm Kona from the West Coast.

292
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,260
Oh, West Coast. Kona from the West Coast.

293
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,780
I don't want to say whose fault it really is, but we're still having one earthquake after another.

294
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,020
I expected you to give a full report.

295
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,040
Just having earthquakes and earthquakes and earthquakes.

296
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,800
Are you still having it?

297
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,720
Hell, it's a good idea.

298
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,180
I was thinking, I wanted to see if I could count you guys in on this.

299
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,080
What I'm going to do is buy up a bunch of surfboard magic fingers from those vibrating hotel sofa things.

300
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,580
Yes.

301
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,920
And sew them into sneakers, loafers, and baggy trousers.

302
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:07,580
And sell them as like kind of a West Coast experience kind of thing to the malls in the Midwest or something.

303
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,340
As a full market device?

304
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,140
As a full market device, I think we could clean up.

305
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,120
Oh my God.

306
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,420
He wants to sell those little like chocolate dog fingers. Is that correct?

307
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,500
Well, not the Vienna sausage ones.

308
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,760
No, those little magic Vienna sausages.

309
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
Magic Vienna sausages.

310
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,900
The ones that you find in the hotel sofas and things like that.

311
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:28,960
Yeah, yeah.

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,460
The little vibrating ones.

313
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,840
Vibrating wiener sausages.

314
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,020
Viennas.

315
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,620
Sew them into the loafers and sneakers.

316
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,200
And baseball caps.

317
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,460
So like when you're walking around in the rubble, you can feel a vibrating Vienna sausage in your rock fort.

318
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,100
There you go.

319
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,740
Oh my God. This guy's a...

320
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,120
He's a genius, Chaz.

321
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,040
I think it would be less traumatizing then, you know, the way they're setting it up now.

322
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,000
Because I understand why they're doing it.

323
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,380
Red Cross everywhere, I suppose.

324
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,400
Is it like before or is it more like now?

325
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,880
It's a lot closer to now.

326
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,040
I think it's a lot closer.

327
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,900
Can I interject here?

328
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,480
Chaz wants to interject something.

329
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,740
Are you having Earth Day out there on the West Coast too?

330
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,540
On Earthquake?

331
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,720
Yes, we are.

332
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,980
Chaz is such a brilliant man.

333
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,000
He's a genius.

334
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,340
But it's still part of it.

335
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,980
As a matter of fact, this is the state that leads in these idiotic trends.

336
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,580
It's not quite sure how long we will be.

337
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,380
It's going to be like Atlanta.

338
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,280
Yes.

339
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,420
Or Atlanta.

340
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,180
Or Atlanta would be a lot better. It would be steamy and there would be like tennis courts on your forehead

341
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,960
and people walking away serving mint juleps.

342
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,840
Uh huh.

343
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,640
Or like, you know,

344
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,520
New Elbia and Pennsylvania maybe.

345
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,920
That's what I go for is them rock fort Vienna sausages.

346
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,060
But have you ever tried low sodium Iguana?

347
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,440
No.

348
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,400
Now you have to put an awful lot of water

349
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,680
and steep it in water for like maybe three or four hours

350
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
before you bring it to a rapid boil

351
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,800
with a handful of chickpeas.

352
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,760
Now once you've got your Iguana meat

353
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,600
all bubbling and frothy

354
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,800
it'll exude kind of a brown foam.

355
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,280
That's just the bad juices coming out.

356
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,160
And you scrape those off top.

357
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,120
Put in a little bit of water

358
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,500
and drop that handful of chickpeas in there.

359
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,780
Now did you already drop the handful of chickpeas

360
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,000
into the bubbling Iguana?

361
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,440
No.

362
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,220
Let's repeat those steps.

363
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,900
The Kentucky Headhunters

364
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,440
at the Cleveland Agora Sunday

365
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,620
May 13th.

366
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,620
The Kentucky

367
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,300
Oh, you're talking to Lonesome Cowboy.

368
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,980
Oh, you interrupted there.

369
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,820
I met the island man and he said

370
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,480
ooh ee ooh ah ah

371
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,400
bing bang wah wah bing bang

372
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,760
ooh ee ooh ah ah

373
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,360
wah wah wah bing bang

374
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,200
ooh ee ooh ah ah

375
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,100
bing bang wah wah wah bing bang

376
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,820
ooh ee ooh ah ah

377
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,180
bing bang wah wah wah bing bang

378
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,580
bing bang wah wah wah bing bang

379
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,740
Hello you're talking to Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

380
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,700
I have a great marketing strategy for

381
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,640
For Earth Day?

382
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,320
Burgers without plastic containers.

383
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,380
Without plastic containers?

384
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,960
Okay, lay it on us.

385
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,940
What is this idea?

386
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,740
You just serve the burgers on your body parts there.

387
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,480
Oh, now, see, this is a form of imagination.

388
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,000
A very small part or a very small and limited example of imagination.

389
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:35,220
As a matter of fact, it's kind of an imagination, but it is an example of imagination.

390
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,980
Imagination in that the burger is just piping fresh and freezing.

391
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,900
And piping fresh.

392
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,700
Because they've grown up, learned what life is.

393
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,180
They know what to do with themselves in society.

394
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:59,020
They can now go out in the world and sit in a classroom and not spit and fling their boogers on the people next to them or anything.

395
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,280
And not be fawning obsequious.

396
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,700
They can go downtown and people won't throw them in jail.

397
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,340
Listen, you guys are making some great strides here.

398
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,680
First, it just starts by being able to not swear on the air.

399
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,800
And then the next thing you know, you'll be eating regular food.

400
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,120
You'll eat the same food that people eat and stuff.

401
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:23,640
And quibbling and fawning and obsequious and fawning and tidwiddling and...

402
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,800
Tidwiddling?

403
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:25,980
Tidwiddling?

404
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,700
Tidwiddling.

405
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,320
That's not an actual word.

406
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,860
Isn't that?

407
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,320
I think that is tidwiddling.

408
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,580
I tried it and believe me, it's not a real one.

409
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,320
Well, what other words do you got?

410
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,100
Rumble.

411
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,540
Rumble?

412
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:36,760


413
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,380
Rumble is a secret password for the prophylactic.

414
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,500
It is?

415
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,660
Yeah.

416
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,100
Well, it's rather fitting for this problem.

417
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,860
How about this one?

418
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,400
You think I've got a big vocabulary.

419
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,960
Get a load of this one.

420
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,360
Yeah?

421
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,580
What do you think of it?

422
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,820
Lay it on me, big guy.

423
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,360
Isn't that disgusting?

424
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,380
Come on, come on, admit it.

425
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen in your life?

426
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,320
Come on, I'm not going to ask you to describe it.

427
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,380
Hello, you're talking a little too complicated.

428
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,240
Doesn't that fill you with revulsion?

429
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,660
Are you going to swear?

430
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,480
No, you wouldn't want to swear on the air, would you?

431
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,620
Well, as you may be able to tell, dear friends,

432
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,480
this is one of those hour of slack shows

433
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,700
that's just a battle of the shows.

434
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,680
It's so many different subgenius and subgenius sympathizer.

435
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,020
They're all over the place.

436
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,020
They're scrambling the airwaves.

437
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,580
But yet...

438
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,200
But yet...

439
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,380
Hello?

440
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,280
I mean, a boop.

441
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,280
I mean, a beep.

442
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:40,940
Hello?

443
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,540
Other show?

444
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,340
Can you hear me?

445
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,160
Come in, please.

446
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,160
Yes, we're here.

447
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,020
Yeah, plug into other show.

448
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,340
We're here with very few sound effects.

449
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,280
Find a multimeter.

450
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,200
What is your trajectory?

451
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,500
Over.

452
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,580
The house is 4 and 4.

453
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,440
Oh, my gosh.

454
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:54,860
All right.

455
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,840
See if you can angle in a little bit behind our ship.

456
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,960
Punch in 4 and 4 and drive this show right up.

457
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,600
Radio traverse.

458
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,560
There we go.

459
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,120
We are attempting to approach your show.

460
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,380
Over here.

461
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,220
The stem ladder's rotating.

462
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,700
Hey, wait.

463
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
They're coming towards us.

464
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,920
Get that guy out of here.

465
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,220
Stop.

466
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,180
Oh, reverse.

467
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,920
Rotate tail section.

468
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,500
Reverse.

469
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:12,960
Reverse.

470
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,160
Reverse.

471
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

472
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,500
It's time for...

473
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,200
Get those plasma banks up to full power.

474
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,800
...filtration of the subspace...

475
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,500
Dr. Harris.

476
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,540
...around your craft.

477
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,960
We're attempting to rotate shows...

478
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,300
Wait.

479
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,080
Get the front deals up.

480
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,080


481
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,080


482
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,300
As we lay now, we're past the attempt phase.

483
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
If you can meet our meeting phase,

484
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,900
who two can join the Bridgman family of subgenius...

485
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,040
I think we're okay.

486
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,520
...achieved penetration.

487
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,720
I think we have transmission.

488
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,100
I think we're okay.

489
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,240
I think we have show...

490
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,820
Yeah, there's just minor damage to the sub-hole.

491
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,520
Minor difficulties.

492
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,900
We can patch that up en route.

493
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,400
Okay.

494
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,940
That's great.

495
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,260
My genitals feel all fluffy.

496
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,500
We're happy to be speaking with you tonight.

497
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,280
How are you, Dr. Howell and Berkeley Show?

498
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,400
I'm glad you're speaking to me,

499
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,360
but how about canning the personal comments?

500
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,840
You know, we're being audited by the Federal Bureau of Demonology,

501
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,760
and they sometimes object to the...

502
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,080
...lower trajectories are only usable inside the outside aspect of the gravitational pull.

503
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,940
We've been raising payments.

504
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,260
We've been raising payments.

505
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,520
Oh, not much.

506
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,400
You know, we'd like not to let these evil perverts who kill student nurses and so on

507
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,620
call us up on the show because it only encourages them.

508
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,320
That's right.

509
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,940
And there was Bob Spent, the murderer who killed all...

510
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,880
And what do you mean he likes me, then?

511
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,300
You make lots of money off of it afterwards when you sign that big record contract.

512
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,280
Well, you know, tomorrow's heroes are today's serial killers.

513
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,320
Children will buy action figures of them in department stores,

514
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,480
and tomorrow's serial killers...

515
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,080
We'll laugh at their antics on...

516
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,160
You know, if...

517
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,380
...down-down situation comedies of the near future...

518
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,080
That doesn't make any sense.

519
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,760
...we all talk at once, it sounds like we're having a party.

520
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,760
I think I'll pass out hors d'oeuvres and martinis.

521
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,120
Would anybody like a frock stick?

522
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,040
Yes, I would very much like a hot buttered rum martini.

523
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,340
Yum, yum.

524
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,460
For public service.

525
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,320
And three frock sticks.

526
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,920
Hot buttered rum martini coming up.

527
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,780
Could I have another frock stick while we're at it?

528
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,020
Pass one this way.

529
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,140
I'd like another glass of that puff more.

530
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Now, come on, gentlemen.

531
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,260
Ew.

532
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,800
Okay.

533
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,420
As I said, the...

534
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:55,820
Firing one.

535
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,320
...Solons in Washington...

536
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,520
How?

537
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,040
How?

538
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,180
How?

539
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,720
How?

540
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:00,860
How?

541
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,280
Look at this.

542
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,520
It's a secret ice cave.

543
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,900
We have our proton shirts off.

544
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,440
Yeah, there's...

545
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,560
Besides, we're friends, I mean.

546
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,980
You want to load up that proton?

547
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,780
...the show assumes the position of familiarity.

548
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,560
Oh, my goodness.

549
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,560


550
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,380
We will now have to fire the...

551
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,940
...proton pill.

552
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,660
...the crooks began to worry...

553
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,540
...they can't escape the...

554
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,580
Oh, no, no, no, no.

555
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,000
...off the...

556
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,000


557
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
...off the...

558
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,180
...off the...

559
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,380
...off the...

560
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:22,560
...off the...

561
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:22,800
...off the...

562
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,160
...off the...

563
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,160


564
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,200
...off the...

565
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,620
...off the...

566
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,360
...of the...

567
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,360


568
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,380
...of the...

569
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,720
...of the...

570
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,340
minor technical difficulties with the spaceship.

571
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,400
Please remain calm, remain seated.

572
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,340
If you need help, waitress, someone will come

573
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,080
and hit you very hard.

574
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,460
Don't worry, everything's under control.

575
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,440
I think she's right.

576
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,200
Gobi, is that your hum?

577
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,980
Or is that my buzz?

578
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,360
Oh, okay, that's right. You got it.

579
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,340
And, uh...

580
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,120
In other news, there will be a completely unjustifiable

581
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,940
but brief war between the United States and the Middle East.

582
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,540
The anti-war resistance will be firmly orchestrated by the conspiracists.

583
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,500
Communism will collapse, even in Korea,

584
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,140
when the Red Leaders finally understand Bob's deal.

585
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,020
And do you know what Bob's deal is, friends?

586
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,000
Well, good luck trying to figure it out from this particular show.

587
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,620
I just... I don't know what it is.

588
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:57,920
I'll have to figure it out myself.

589
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,580
It's...

590
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,620
But it's a beautiful thing.

591
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,420
Whatever it is, I don't know that we'll ever figure it out.

592
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,820
Not as well as the Baptists have figured it out.

593
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,440
According to this newspaper report here,

594
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,600
from the Dallas Morning News... newspaper,

595
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,780
a Southern Baptist estimate of those headed to hell

596
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,120
sparks fire brimstone in Alabama.

597
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,980
Yes, Birmingham, Alabama.

598
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,320
God only knows how to get to heaven.

599
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,380
But the Southern Baptists estimate that 46.1% of people in Alabama

600
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,540
risk going to hell.

601
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,380
Since the figure from church research on potentially doomed souls

602
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,520
was made public, it is Baptists who are feeling the fire, however.

603
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,300
The Southern Baptist Convention's county-by-county breakdown

604
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,660
of who's bound for heaven and who isn't,

605
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,020
unless they're born again and accept Jesus Christ as their savior,

606
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,700
hit the Birmingham News on September 5th.

607
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,840
It's been the buzz in some Alabama pews

608
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,760
and some radio stations ever since.

609
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,740
Under the headline, Baptists Count the Lost,

610
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,440
the front-page story included a detailed map and box

611
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,620
listing the 1.8 million unsaved by county in precise percentages.

612
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,080
The Baptists said the numbers were only a guide

613
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,700
on where to establish new churches and find more followers,

614
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,460
but some of the faithful...

615
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,000
Baptists as well as others are incensed.

616
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,140
The Southern Baptists have done such demographic research for years,

617
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,560
said Martin King, a spokesman for the denomination

618
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,620
of the Atlanta-based Home Mission Board,

619
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,240
which compiled the study and has national figures he would not disclose.

620
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,120
Mr. King added that the Baptists don't claim to be passing judgment.

621
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,120
We don't know who's lost and who's saved, he said.

622
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,680
All we know is that as we understand the doctrine of salvation,

623
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,640
a lot of people are lost.

624
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,840
Of course, they don't like hearing that they're not going to heaven.

625
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,860
The study took each county's population

626
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,520
and subtracted from it membership of all churches.

627
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,980
After that, Baptist researchers used a secret formula to...

628
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,400
a secret formula, friends, to estimate how many people

629
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,860
from different denominations and faiths were probably going to heaven.

630
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,620
Mr. King said estimates of the unsaved from other creeds

631
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,700
were based on how closely those groups' beliefs matched Southern Baptist doctrine.

632
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,360
The index, of course, applied the traditional Baptist view

633
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,180
that Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and members of other non-Christian religions

634
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,740
are not saved.

635
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,520
The paper said virtually everyone not belonging to a church congregation

636
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,820
was counted among the lost.

637
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,840
The Reverend Thomas Raynor,

638
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,640
pastor of the Green Valley Baptist Church in Hoover

639
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,000
and the Mission Board's Alabama representative,

640
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,580
said he was amazed by the fun.

641
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,940
But he has a good motive behind it,

642
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,020
and that is not one of judging, but of reaching.

643
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,120
Well, that's a great way to do it, Rev.

644
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,540
But, you know, I've got some sad news for those Baptists.

645
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm afraid 46.1% is rather an optimistic number

646
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,060
for who's going to be lost on Judgment Day.

647
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:27,300
I'm afraid that it's going to be a bit closer to the 99.999 mark,

648
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,960
which is most, well, it's all humans,

649
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,980
and unfortunately 90% of the subgeniuses,

650
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:41,820
those who did not indeed join the Church of the Subgenius properly

651
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,260
with full dues,

652
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,420
which we cannot tell you exactly on the air,

653
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,460
but we can tell you how to write for free information

654
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,620
on how to be saved in Bob.

655
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,780
It should have to be saved not in Rev. Rainer or Dr. King,

656
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,860
but in J.R. Bob Dobbs.

657
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,720
And that it would be, got that pencil ready?

658
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,700
Because, you know, if you send us a self-addressed stamped envelope

659
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,160
and the accent is on stamped, friends,

660
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,040
why, be surprised what you can get.

661
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,900
And I'm going to give you that lovely number right now.

662
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,020
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306

663
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,600
in lovely.com.

664
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,700
Dallas, Texas 75214.

665
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,480
Once again, that's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

666
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,500
Now you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour on Slack.

667
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,020
And we've been, tonight, because, well, I've been working on that book.

668
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,320
I finished the last chapters last week.

669
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,900
I did.

670
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,220
Of course, now I've got to start on the middle chapters.

671
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,800
We're working on, we're working on Connie this week.

672
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,600
Ha, ha, ha.

673
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,580
Uh, but, um, and it's such a,

674
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,140
such times as that we like to throw together show attacks

675
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,300
from barely screened, uh, tapes from other subgeniuses.

676
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,980
Yes, and those have included tonight, uh,

677
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,920
oh, who has it?

678
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,980
Who has it included tonight?

679
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,560
Um, well, we're playing lots and lots

680
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,980
from the good Reverend Gobi's show up in Rochester, New York.

681
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,700
Uh, this is from a tape compiled by Bleepo Abernathy,

682
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,040
of, uh, and it's been, you know,

683
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,940
we would have been running Gobi a long time ago,

684
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,160
but we lost the first tape and we never got the other tape.

685
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,980
But we, anyway, we got this one.

686
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,660
Also, uh, early in the show,

687
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,740
a little bit of Hub City Spoke Repair,

688
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,980
uh, semi-newly discovered, uh, radio comedy group.

689
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,780
Um, I don't know how to describe what it was that they were doing,

690
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,400
but, uh, you did hear it.

691
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,680
Uh, and the, the song about, uh, Roger, uh,

692
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,000
rock music, I believe with Steve Stein.

693
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,440
A lot of our tapes aren't even labeled, friends.

694
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,480
You know, they get used once and the sweat rubs the labels off.

695
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,460
Um, and Lonesome Cowboy Dave show,

696
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,240
uh, percolating along in there with their evil callers.

697
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:15,160
And, as always, KPFA, uh, uh, show, show,

698
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,900
uh, the less than a show, more than an hour show,

699
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,900
with Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence in that case, I believe.

700
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,220
And, uh, I, uh, uh,

701
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,140
actually, I need to flip a tape over coming up here pretty soon,

702
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,360
and then we'll hear the most amazing rant by Little Goby.

703
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,160
Uh, it, it, really, I was, I was floored

704
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,060
when I heard this, uh, seamless, uncut,

705
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,340
and probably completely unscripted spew,

706
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,880
um, from the, the, uh,

707
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,540
the little but very powerful Goby.

708
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,160
Thank you.

709
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,820
Stand by, please.

710
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,540
In Dallas, Texas.

711
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,880
It appears as though something has happened.

712
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,960
Repent, else I will come against thee with my clenched fist,

713
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,960
and it is the fist which beareth many eyes

714
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,780
and breatheth many breaths.

715
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,920
And this goes on...

716
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,600
for...

717
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,760
one, two, three, four,

718
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,540
for five more pages.

719
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,000
That was section one through...

720
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,680
thirty-five, and it goes up to...

721
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,160
one-twenty-six. That was not, I did not write that.

722
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,780
Those are not my words.

723
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,320
I in no way feel that way.

724
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,680
I, I certainly would never say that I myself am Jehovah One.

725
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,060
I'm not. Okay?

726
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,740
And, like, I don't agree with anything, well, like, some things,

727
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,940
like, you know, like the pink worms are the kind of biggest creatures, you know.

728
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,360
Um, but, like, you know, like, I don't go along with, like,

729
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,300
this whole, like, power trip that Jehovah One's on.

730
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,680
You know, he's, like, on a total, like, Mr. Swell head.

731
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,860
I'm, like, so cool, you know, if you find out where the center of the universe is,

732
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,500
hey, man, if you even ask where it is, you know, I'll smash your ass.

733
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,560
You know, he's such a big jerk.

734
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,520
He thinks he's so cool just because he, like, rules the universe or something.

735
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,180
You know, I bet he doesn't even rule the universe.

736
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,920
What do you want to bet he only rules the galaxy?

737
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,920
Yeah. Yeah, Mr., Mr. Cool, Mr. Jehovah One only rules the universe.

738
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,780
He rules one galaxy, God, out of, like, how many million?

739
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,480
And he thinks he can get off on, like, writing all these pre-scriptures and everything

740
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,100
and saying all these these and thous and threatening to do everything

741
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,820
and saying that he knows everything we do.

742
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,340
I mean, who is he, Santa Claus? He knows when you're sleeping.

743
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,200
He knows when you're awake. He knows if you've been good or bad.

744
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,900
So be good for good.

745
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,280
No, Jehovah One is not Santa Claus.

746
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,260
He's not nearly as cool as Santa Claus.

747
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,580
Maybe he's as cool as the Easter Bunny because all the Easter Bunny does is, like, lay eggs

748
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:47,900
and do things.

749
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,420
He doesn't paint them.

750
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,240
That's probably all Jehovah One can do is lay eggs and paint them to be fancy colors

751
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,200
because he thinks he's so great, but he's not.

752
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,260
He's just some puny little god.

753
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,860
That's all he is.

754
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,240
And we're so much better, aren't we, children?

755
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,800
Because we're real subgeniuses.

756
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,420
He's just some upper deity.

757
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,900
But we are subgeniuses.

758
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,200
We don't know anything at all.

759
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,800
Which makes us...

760
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,740
I mean, you can't even use the word superior.

761
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,920
I mean, that's got, like, too many syllables in it for our vocabulary.

762
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
That's how superior we are.

763
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,160
We are so superior we can't even use the word superior because it's below us

764
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,480
because it has too many syllables.

765
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,860
We are so stupid.

766
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,080
We go all the way around to genius.

767
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,000
You know how, like, everything's a circle, you know, like, stupid on the top and genius on the bottom?

768
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,780
We're so stupid we go past stupid all the way around back to genius.

769
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,360
That's how stupid we are.

770
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,920
We are so dumb.

771
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,260
The Oxford English Dictionary is like reading Dr. Seuss to us.

772
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,740
And the reason why we're so bored, why you find so many bored subgeniuses

773
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:05,600
and so many, you know, slackers and, like, you know, beer-drinking T-shirt-wearing subgeniuses

774
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,520
is because we can't find anything to stimulate our interests at all except, you know, some things.

775
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:14,960
But...

776
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,860
Where was I?

777
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,820
Oh, I got so sidetracked thinking about stimulation of interests.

778
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,080
Well, yes, anyways.

779
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,580
So, like, the Oxford English Dictionary, which for those of you who don't know,

780
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:33,780
it's like the, you know, for the word and it's got, like, 300 listings telling, like,

781
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,000
the first time anyone ever said the word and and how it's been used, you know, every single time since then.

782
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,160
And if that is like Dr. Seuss to us, well, can you figure out how bored we are?

783
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,420
We have to read, like, we have to raid scientifically.

784
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,760
We have to read.

785
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,980
We have to go to the libraries just to have a little, you know, reading on the bus to work, you know.

786
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,740
We don't even go to work, you know.

787
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,880
We can't even find jobs that are good enough.

788
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,200
It's terrible.

789
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,100
We're so stupid and we're so lazy.

790
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,300
God, this is why we get so many checks in the mail because we're so lazy.

791
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,480
We can't even work.

792
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,160
I mean, it's, it's, some of us are so lazy that we actually do have jobs

793
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,600
because we can't make the effort to not have a job.

794
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,740
It almost takes too much effort to not have a job.

795
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,020
To not work.

796
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,700
To, like, stay at home.

797
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,240
That's really actually quite hard.

798
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,560
You have to be really disciplined in order to stay at home and not work.

799
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,480
It's terrible.

800
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,700
Usually when we watch television or something, especially when it's an educational channel,

801
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,920
we have to call one of our, you know, big off-duty policeman friends over and strap us down,

802
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,980
you know, handcuff us to the chair so we'll watch TV.

803
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,080
It's like forced relaxation because we're so lazy,

804
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,380
it's almost impossible for us to relax.

805
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,800
I mean, we're dealing with all those checks that we're getting in the mail.

806
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,960
I mean, we, it's just, it's even hard enough to just, like, lift up the flap on the mailbox.

807
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,580
That, like, strains our brains.

808
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,760
We can't understand the mechanical design of a mailbox.

809
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,020
Man, we can't even understand how stairs work.

810
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,500
I'm not talking about escalators.

811
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,440
I'm talking about stairs.

812
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,980
I haven't been able to walk up the front steps to my house since I was born.

813
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,060
I have to have somebody drag me up by my knees.

814
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,520
I have to have somebody drag me down to my your我跟你.

815
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:14,900


816
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,620
because I don't understand, like you know, gravity.

817
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,540
What it? It's just so weird, man.

818
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,240
Gravity?

819
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,940
I don't understand it.

820
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,620
I don't believe in.

821
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,800
That's another thing, subgeniu Grammy I don't think so.

822
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,520
There's no such thing as gravity.

823
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,380
Reality?

824
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,360
No, wrong.

825
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,640
No such thing as watcha.

826
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,020
Let's see, what else don't we believe in?

827
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,540
We don't even believe in not believing in anything.

828
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,580
That's how stupid we are. We actually think we can get away with not believing and not believing.

829
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,240
We so therefore we don't even exist. So why are you listening to this show? Because we don't really exist.

830
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,240
We're just figment of your imagination.

831
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,500
Yeah, we're not really here.

832
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,560
You're not really listening to us. You just are you have an active imagination and you think you're listening to us, but you're not. Stop it.

833
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,360
Stop hallucinating us. This is terrible.

834
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:15,120
You're gonna frighten all the people around you when you're laughing at these jokes that aren't really happening.

835
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,580
Except inside your own head.

836
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,420
I mean, where do you think you're hearing us from anyways?

837
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,120
A radio? Yeah, those haven't even been invented yet.

838
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,560
Radios. Who knows what a radio is? It sounds like some kind of new like shoe.

839
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,360
Some kind of like, you know, sneaker or something. The radio sneakers. Maybe like, like, you know, radial tires or something.

840
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,120
Sorry.

841
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,500
Hi.

842
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:38,680
I...

843
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,300
I told you to stop.

844
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,320
What's wrong?

845
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,160
No, that's not a radio. No.

846
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,760
There's nothing there. You're pointing to thin air. Stop it.

847
00:37:52,580 --> 00:38:00,360
Geez, you know, being hallucinations, being figments of other people's imagination is really difficult and it takes a lot of time and a lot of practice.

848
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,000
Us subgeniuses have a really hard life being figments of other people's imagination.

849
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,480
You know, I had a lot of trouble getting this radio show.

850
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,760
Getting people to not be on the air at this time so that I could not be on the air either.

851
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,040
Do you know how hard it is to get things not done?

852
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:23,380
It's pretty easy to not get things done or to get things done, but to not... to... to get things not done. That's really hard.

853
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,380
You're not hearing anything right now.

854
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,280
I think something's wrong with you.

855
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,260
I don't think you're a subgenius. If you're listening to something, you're not a subgen... I don't know.

856
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,520
I don't know. Maybe you've had a little bit too much of them peels of Bob.

857
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Yes, the peels of Bob.

858
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,220
Which you can get if you join the Church of the Subgenius.

859
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,800
You put on a waiting list for the peels of Bob.

860
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:58,660
But then if you take too many of the peels of Bob, you'll end up thinking that you're actually listening to a radio.

861
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,320
And even that, you know, listening to a show on a radio.

862
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,140
Better watch out for them peels of Bob. Man, they're really bad.

863
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,480
I don't know.

864
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,500
But how can you get on this waiting list for the peels of Bob?

865
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,540
You have to join the Church of the Subgenius.

866
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,460
And how do you do that?

867
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,600
To get the peels of Bob. To get the peels of Bob.

868
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,640
You have to write...

869
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,400
Post Office Box

870
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,020
140306

871
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,940
Dallas, Texas

872
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,240
75214

873
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,720
Yes, that is the right address.

874
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,960
Where is Dallas anyways?

875
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,660
Ah, fooled you! Ha ha!

876
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,360
No such thing as Dallas. Ha ha ha ha!

877
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,640
No such thing as Texas.

878
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,560
There's no such thing as zip codes either.

879
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,800
How'd you invent such a crazy thing like that?

880
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,960
Zip codes.

881
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,400
How about those killer trucks?

882
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,040
Don't worry. Without you to press play there'd be no audio comics.

883
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
And now for Gyp Psychic.

884
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,000
Gyp Psychic's in hyperspace.

885
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,780
It's where he went.

886
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,560
Once Wendy died.

887
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,080
Turns the hyperspace rig on on himself.

888
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,640
Pulled the trigger.

889
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,000
All around him.

890
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,220
Gray paste pulled through a blender.

891
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,400
Silent and forgetful.

892
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,540
He had no place to go when she died.

893
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,840
So what better way to find out?

894
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,100
Is hyperspace the same as death?

895
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,700
Is hyperspace the same as death?

896
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:32,700


897
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,320
There's something happening here.

898
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,800
There's something happening here.

899
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,340
Two shapes.

900
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,560
Dark twisted girders growing skin and bone.

901
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:44,720


902
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,460
Plaster and paint like life run backwards from the grave.

903
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:48,460


904
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,140
Squaring out now.

905
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,960
A rumble like trucks.

906
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,340
The lights come on!

907
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,380
And then.

908
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,980
An open space.

909
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,360
A room.

910
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,540
With a hideous smell.

911
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,500
The smell of death.

912
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,060
Gyp Psychic in hyperspace.

913
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,740
Gyp Psychic in hyperspace.

914
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,260
Forget the funeral.

915
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,140
Forget the funeral.

916
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,360
I got to hear the tape.

917
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,800
Gyp Psychic in hyperspace.

918
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,240
I got to hear the tape.

919
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,160
Offend your parents.

920
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,240
For just ten bucks.

921
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,080
For just ten bucks.

922
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,000
It's a truck stop diner.

923
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,180
Name of the greasy time cafe.

924
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:34,940
Name of the greasy time cafe.

925
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,320
There's an old woman there in a wheelchair.

926
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:37,880
There's an old woman there in a wheelchair.

927
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,620
Gyp starts to push the chair outside.

928
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,800
Down the street.

929
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,920
Like he's supposed to do.

930
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,020
But Gyp's tired.

931
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,920
He's getting weak.

932
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,220
He's getting older.

933
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,280
He's getting older.

934
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,920
She's getting younger!

935
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,200
With a shock, Gyp realizes that it's Wendy in the chair.

936
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,220
With a shock, Gyp realizes that it's Wendy in the chair.

937
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:07,700
But as he reaches his aching skeletal hand down to touch her hair.

938
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:07,780


939
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,160
Everything starts to blur.

940
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,380
Everything starts to blur.

941
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,820
Heat and light.

942
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,320
Cold and emotionless air.

943
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,440
In hyperspace.

944
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,180
In hyperspace.

945
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,360
Shut up.

946
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,420
Shut up.

947
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,800
Shut up.

948
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,760
You can almost hear Gyp are both like arms open.

949
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:37,760


950
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:37,760


951
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:37,760


952
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:37,760


953
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,680
Metallic echoes traveled down,

954
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,320
down, down.

955
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,760
It was none of it real.

956
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,920
Like a dream.

957
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,360
Wendy is gone.

958
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,180
At the Belle de Candleview Memorial Hospital,

959
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,420
an aged gypsy psychic begins in his hospital bed to die.

960
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,500
But is he really there?

961
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,600
Or just lost somewhere in hyperspace?

962
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:47,860
The

963
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,600
mama innovation

964
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:49,640
is

965
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:49,860
still

966
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,680
a

967
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:50,680


968
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:50,860
She's

969
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:50,880
even

970
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:50,900
wow

971
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,020
much

972
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,020


973
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,020


974
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,020


975
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,020


976
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,400
to

977
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,640
her

978
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,360
again.

979
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:04,880
Her

980
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,220
美味

981
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:05,300
does

982
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:05,320
not

983
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,200
Yes, yes, that's right.

984
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,800
Jim Psychic in hyperspace.

985
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,660
Dear friends, I believe that's...

986
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,260
Yes, that was indeed.

987
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,060
Audio Comics, number 19.

988
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:27,900
Jim Psychic in hyperspace by Dan Rettorick.

989
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,300
And I forgot to bring the box with me,

990
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,640
so I don't have his post office box,

991
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,960
but he has apparently been creating these audio comics.

992
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,100
And, uh, oh, what a show.

993
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,460
What an odd show this has turned out to be tonight

994
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:51,060
with the long rant there by Little Gobi,

995
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,780
the she-chainer, as she was tonight.

996
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,940
Oh, the strangest.

997
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,460
And what next?

998
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,500
Why...

999
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,720
Are you... are you a moron?

1000
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,280
Hey, are...

1001
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,620
Is this...

1002
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,640
Is this a contemporaneous activity that's going on here,

1003
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,000
or is this something that happened three years ago?

1004
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,020
I think he's a fluff chick.

1005
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,680
He's not a fluff chick.

1006
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,200
You're talking about what some cowboy did.

1007
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,560
Oh, what did you say?

1008
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,240
Do you know why he's off the pajama girl?

1009
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,760
You're not the wife of the pajama girl,

1010
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,980
but you have a lot of money.

1011
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,280
Oh, you're talking about what a pajama girl did.

1012
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,720
And you want to show it.

1013
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1014
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,760
I'm going back to...

1015
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:31,760


1016
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,220
Cass-a!

1017
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,160
No!

1018
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,160


1019
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,820
Cass-a!

1020
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,520
Pass me that pa-pa-pa!

1021
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,460
This way, ca-pa-pa!

1022
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:56,300
No!

1023
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,480
Hell, we'll crash this thing...

1024
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,300
That's authentic aardvark music.

1025
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,620
Hey, what's up?

1026
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,140
Hey, come on.

1027
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,860
I don't talk to me, but you talk to me.

1028
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,120
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1029
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,840
If you have any questions, you may call.

1030
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,120
Feel free at any time to make any calls at all.

1031
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,120
You can request whatever you want, but we probably won't play this because this is a religious show.

1032
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,220
You understand.

1033
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,120
I hope you understand this isn't just another music show.

1034
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,520
This isn't just another modern music and more show.

1035
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:41,820
No.

1036
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,240
This is a special show.

1037
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:54,200
A show who inspires young men and women everywhere

1038
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,100
to reach and serve.

1039
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,120
To stretch their minds.

1040
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,460
To push forth those boundaries that the pinks and the conspiracy have set for us.

1041
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:13,140
To break through the plastic bag they try to put us in.

1042
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,880
And it's not just a plastic bag.

1043
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,240
It's a plastic bag with a twist tie around it.

1044
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,020
So we have to push and squeeze.

1045
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:34,020
Just like the twist tie strangles that plastic bag that the conspiracy has put us in,

1046
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,900
so does bad radio strangle us.

1047
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,680
Just like the twist tie that strangles us and the bag that the conspiracy has put us in.

1048
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,860
And you can be the big fingers of Bob.

1049
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,980
That takes off that twist tie.

1050
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,400
That detwists the twist tie.

1051
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:53,980
Yes.

1052
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,320
Yes, you can operate.

1053
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,880
The big fingers of Bob.

1054
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,920
Or maybe the big fingers of Jehovah One.

1055
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,100
Or maybe the big fingers of Wotan or Odin.

1056
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,360
Or, you know, Pan.

1057
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,960
Whoever you choose.

1058
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,660
You know like, you know those games at, um,

1059
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,660
you know, at like video arcades?

1060
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:16,300
The ones where you put a quarter in and you like press the buttons and maneuver the little crane to pick up the stuffed animals?

1061
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,340
It's like that.

1062
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,440
But instead of putting a quarter in and maneuvering the buttons and the crane

1063
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,200
to pick up a stupid little stuffed animal,

1064
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,960
of course they always have like the gold watches,

1065
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,000
you know, that's what you really want,

1066
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,480
but you always end up getting like some stupid like little three inch stuffed animal made out of,

1067
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,200
you know, strange leftover, I don't know, like popcorn or something.

1068
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,000
But, see, see, instead of putting a quarter in,

1069
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,600
you, you just give us a little bit of your time.

1070
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,680
Just a little bit of your brain cells.

1071
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,320
And just slide your brain cells in through that slot marked brain cells.

1072
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,200
And maneuver those fingers of Bob.

1073
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,480
So that you can detwist that twist tie.

1074
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:07,060
And remove yourself from the plastic bag that the conspiracy has put you in.

1075
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,140
And if you're lucky,

1076
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,740
if you are true in your heart,

1077
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:18,500
then you will be able to maneuver the crane over to where the gold watch is.

1078
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,780
But instead of a gold watch, it will be slack.

1079
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,080
Yes, slack for you.

1080
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,900
You will get it, finally,

1081
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,480
just by giving us a little bit of your brain cells.

1082
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,800
That's all we ask for, just a little bit of your brain cells.

1083
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,240
That's not a lot.

1084
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,440
So this is the hour of slack.

1085
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,180
The hour of slack.

1086
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,540
That you're listening to.

1087
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,620
And you will be listening to until about one o'clock.

1088
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,840
So enjoy it.

1089
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,460
When our cafe wind is Chicago

1090
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,780
What's up, boisterous New Year's party

1091
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,900
You should be able to do what makes you happy.

1092
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,920
And get paid for it.

1093
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,640
Why else are we alive?

1094
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,100
Why do people have to work to make money so that they can do the things that they like?

1095
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,940
You should be able to work at things that you like.

1096
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,320
So that you can constantly be doing things that you like.

1097
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,980
Which is what I guess I'd do.

1098
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,040
If I had money.

1099
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,440
Which I don't.

1100
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,180
But okay, alright.

1101
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,280
It's a truce.

1102
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,520
But I suppose we come one day.

1103
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,460
You can see.

1104
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,860
And ask as I gaze.

1105
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:42,660
If their door exceeds that all the room.

1106
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,280
Yeah.

1107
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,860
Yeah.

1108
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,720
Yeah.

1109
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,020
Yeah.

1110
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,560
Yeah.

1111
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,260
Yeah.

1112
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,740
That's what young people know.

1113
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:08,960
Although I'm over nine thousand feet tall.

1114
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,140
But if you have all the muscle, you'll be up in all the industry in twenty cars.

1115
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,020
They don't know until you turn yours on.

1116
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,180
They don't know until when you've earned your financial daughters' money.

1117
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:15,180


1118
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:15,180


1119
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,740
the day quicklyitu my favorite TV series.

1120
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,740
I don't like that.

1121
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:21,880
I don't know.

1122
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,960
I'm trying to set up this skinwalker shtick that some sorcerer,

1123
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,460
and it could be the government for all we know, poisoning sheep and so forth.

1124
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,460
Maybe I could, like, donate them to him or something.

1125
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,240
What?

1126
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,500
Drums.

1127
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,820
You have drums?

1128
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:35,240
Yeah.

1129
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,880
Oh, denote them to Chaz and me.

1130
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,200
I want drums.

1131
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,720
Denote them as a parcel post.

1132
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,480
Cash on delivery to you.

1133
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,600
The denotation zone.

1134
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,220
Yeah.

1135
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,120
Denotation?

1136
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,720
Yeah.

1137
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,200
He was like...

1138
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:48,820
A denotation zone.

1139
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,180
It was the worst band of the 60.

1140
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,940
See, denotation and the denotation zones.

1141
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:53,440
Yeah.

1142
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,860
Dino was real fat, remember?

1143
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,600
I try not to use too many denotation zones.

1144
00:51:59,360 --> 00:51:59,820
Yeah.

1145
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,200
I think it would be wiser if you didn't.

1146
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,220
Because sometimes it gets so vacuous and deep

1147
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,600
that you can't even clamber up a number or a denotation for anything.

1148
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,920
You can't get out of it sometimes.

1149
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,780
It's kind of like the doldrums.

1150
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,000
It is.

1151
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,940
It's like the doldrums, the box doldrums.

1152
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:20,040
And you better watch out if one of them cyclophagotic pirates from the Barbados zones

1153
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:20,160
don't...

1154
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,340
Doesn't come out there and wheeze off with one of your underwears.

1155
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,540
Come rolling up.

1156
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:23,700
Come rolling up.

1157
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,120
Yeah.

1158
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,280
With a hearty ha-ha.

1159
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:34,960
Your impotent men with their foolish wells cannot protect you from my power.

1160
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,120
And what next?

1161
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:46,860
Why?

1162
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,060
Well, it's sort of an anniversary.

1163
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,420
So I'm going to go ahead and do this.

1164
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,240
Now, ladies, I want you to listen to what his fingers are doing.

1165
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:56,840
Okay?

1166
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,020
Listen to...

1167
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:03,060
Just hold in your mind what his fingers are doing.

1168
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,200
I think you can just take it from there.

1169
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,880
I think you can just take it from there.

1170
00:53:51,660 --> 00:54:20,140
I think you can just take it from there.

1171
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:49,960
I think you can just take it from there.

1172
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:19,740
I think you can just take it from there.

1173
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,460
I think you can just take it from there.

1174
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,420
Yeah.

1175
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,600
Yeah.

1176
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:40,580
Yeah.

1177
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:40,840
Yeah.

1178
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,300
Yeah.

1179
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:41,300


1180
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,520


1181
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,520


1182
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,520


1183
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,520


1184
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,520


1185
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,520


1186
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,020
Yeah.

1187
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,020


1188
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,020


1189
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,020


1190
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,020


1191
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,020


1192
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,020


1193
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,360

1941 the german death machine rolls over europe with typical efficiency death to the ultravision destruction of all inferior subcultures long live the german reich the reich of a thousand years this however has nothing to do with our story

1231
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:41,500
it's monday morning and little timothy is gathering flowers for his little mother's bouquet

1232
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,740
when suddenly the sun's rays reflect through his magnifying glass

1233
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:51,780
they make the little plants spontaneously combust and the fumes are whipped into timmy's little nostrils

1234
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,960
that smells real good

1235
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,060
little does timmy suspect that he is hallucinating

1236
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,200
timmy

1237
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,620
he begins a strange dream

1238
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,080
timmy

1239
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,480
he is stalked by many monsters

1240
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:06,540
timmy

1241
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,260
with a thousand different wild dehydrated dilated eyes

1242
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,400
i want you to go to pop's chocolate shop

1243
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,620

1244
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,980
oh never mind about that

1245
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,180
go to pop's chocolate shop

1246
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,100
the dream voice orders timothy to do things he normally wouldn't do

1247
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,180

1250
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,540
now the people are expecting you to perform for them

1251
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,440
do not let them down timothy

1252
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,940
timothy finds himself doing all sorts of strange things he normally would never obey

1253
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,460
take this brick timothy and throw it through that window

1254
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,460
ladies and gentlemen

1255
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,200
messieurs and mesdames

1256
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,520
mesdames and messieurs

1257
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,340
little timothy will now leap from the back of the syphilitic elephant

1258
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,920
in towards the puddle of poodle piddle

1259
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,620
under a flaming arch

1260
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,900
now have a victory parade down the champs elysees

1261
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,520
and thus it was that a little nobody was able to get out of the puddle of poodle piddle under a flaming arch

1262
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,440
a little nobody from newark new jersey attained the ultimate crown of fame wealth and riches

1263
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,780
soon timothy is leading a small legion

1264
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,600
a crowd of expected do-gooders and do-evilers

1265
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,060
across the astonished face of europe they marched

1266
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,280
the iron dream given hideous reality

1267
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,900
the octopus of evil reaches out across the world

1268
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,600
its tentacles ensnared every nation

1269
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:39,920
reaching beyond the pacific the atlantic even the north pole

1270
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,920
where it digs deep beneath the earthen crush to build its ufo base

1271
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:52,440
while its huge cephalopod eyes strain through earth's pitiful atmosphere into the endless reaches of outer space

1272
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:59,860
even the aliens begin to take notice of this strange phenomena occurring on a neighboring planet

1273
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,080
and uh wouldn't you?

1274
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:04,580
i think we might be able to get out of here

1275
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,120
we must soon interfere with this earthen phenomenon

1276
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,040
well uh what would our robot know about the life below

1277
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,520
hal who you talking to?

1278
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,760
oh i see you've got a place on earth

1279
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:22,100
yeah that's right and as long as i don't move from this chair i can keep talking indefinitely to this little voice from far away

1280
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,880
i think you are right zabar

1281
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:31,880
these strange malevolent evil may soon spin out across the universe unless we stop it soon

1282
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,340
i'm fading fast

1283
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,760
i've got scoppy fever and i've come down with a horrible case of the sniffles

1284
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,800
but you know

1285
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,880
well you mean you hung out with a scopus today?

1286
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,000
he's right zabar

1287
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
it was the famous trial

1288
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,220
those strange bacterias in his nostrils may prove harmful to our alien as well

1289
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,280
but it is sweet unto the nostrils of the lord

1290
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,960
well tell him to come on over here
