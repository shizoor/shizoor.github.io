1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, after a lifetime of second thoughts and second guesses...

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,420
Yeah?

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,760
I see you standing over the grave of another dead president.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,040
That's not gonna happen.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,820
No end to you.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,740
Bob is fill-in-the-blank.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,720
I am Bob. I'm not Bob.

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,960
You are Bob. We are all Bob.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,040
We are all Devo. We are Bob.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,060
His heart was strong enough to survive the grave.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,260
You admire him.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,440
Yeah.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,000
He was in life a most remarkable man.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,740
His mind was great and powerful,

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,880
but greater is the necessity to stamp him out and destroy him utterly.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,340
Kill Bob?

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,340
Your salvation is his destruction.

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:00:59,880
No.

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,080
I can hear it.

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,940
He's coming closer.

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,300
He's calling me to him.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,440
Bob will protect you.

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,480
Bob is protecting the genetic future.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,440
Let him. Let him into your life.

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:22,720
To work with me, you must die to your racing life and be reborn to Mars.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh! Oh!

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,040
He seems to have been rather naughty.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,600
Let Bob protect you. He wants to protect you.

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,380
He must protect you. He has to protect you.

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,060
Jehovah One says Bob will protect you.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,780
Praise Bob!

32
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,820
If you send a dollar to post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,100
One dollar for salvation. One dollar.

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,880
He gave life to you and to me.

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,300
Pray to him, Antillia. He will listen to your prayers.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,640
And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth.

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,680
And he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.

38
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,720
And he exercised all the power of the first beast before him.

39
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,860
And caused the earth and them who dwell on it to worship the first beast.

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,160
Whose deadly wounds he healed.

41
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,420
And this one we fight, this one we face, has the strength of twenty or more people.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,040
And you can testify for that, Mr. Harker.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,300
But he can also control the meaner things of life.

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,160
The bat, the rodent, the wolf.

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,840
He can appear as mist, as vapor, as fog and vanish at will.

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,020
He doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.

47
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,160
And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,260
Which he hath power to do in the sight of the beast.

49
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,180
Saying to them that dwell on the earth...

50
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,500
Number four.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,040
Assume command over your prearranged sector.

52
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,300
In particular, break authority of masters who are not controllers.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,780
Allow no questions.

54
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,500
Number five.

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,340
Issue the pacifier lozenges.

56
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,820
Your kit should be sufficient for the subjects you've been allocated.

57
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,320
Use the standard line, quote,

58
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,340
They will calm you and supply energy until food comes.

59
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,160
Well said, yes.

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,340
God's sake.

61
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,300
Your impotent men with their foolish spells cannot protect you from my power.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,780
Second of all, the robber of God, the destroyer of God, Jonathan,

63
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,360
the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,400
I condemn you to living death.

65
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,900
To eternal hunger for living blood.

66
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
Number six.

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
Assume command over your prearranged sector.

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,820
In particular, break authority of masters who are not controllers.

69
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,100
The Missingçœ¦D

70
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:47,520
decades of service to the country has become soon and for those of us who

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,160
are still of large number.

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,420
Your spirit here today must not rest.

73
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:56,360
The master will come, and he has promised to make me immortal.

74
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm changing. I can feel it. I can hear everything.

75
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,200
I hear the serpents at the other end of the house whispering.

76
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,560
I hear mice in the attic stomping like elephants.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,240
Hi.

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,120
Ow.

79
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,660
And may I say, Miss Lucy is hotter than a June bride riding bareback buck naked in the middle of the summer.

80
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,740
I would watch my colonial tongue if I were you.

81
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,160
Women from all walks of life, whose inner turmoil and frustrations,

82
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,200
their burning desires for love, are restrained almost to the breaking point.

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,320
But with the coming of nightfall, all restraint is set aside,

84
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,340
and these same women, like savage animals, compete in the...

85
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,600
In the struggle to find and then hold...

86
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,280
The subgenius.

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
Hour of...

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,720
Swag.

89
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,660
Guaranteed to stagger the imagination by its bold portrayal and startling exposures

90
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,380
about the single women in today's society.

91
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,060
What is that?

92
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
A Texan.

93
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,700
Like a wild stallion between my legs.

94
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,580
You're positively indecent.

95
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,380
I just know what men desire.

96
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,140
Oh. Yes.

97
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,660
Willing to degrade themselves in any way,

98
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,280
to engage in any and all forms of orgiastic revelry,

99
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,740
in their search for satisfaction.

100
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,000
It's not a pretty story, but it is a true story based on actual facts.

101
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,540
I'll tell you.

102
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,840
It's Bob.

103
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,280
It's Bob.

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,520
It's Bob.

105
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,480
Oh, well, in my face.

106
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,060
It's Bob.

107
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,180
It's Bob.

108
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:02,920
Master!

109
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
I am here!

110
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,880
I have worshipped you!

111
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,880
I have done everything that you asked, Master.

112
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,400
All the preparations are in order.

113
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,180
Everything...

114
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,240
The show's ready to go.

115
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,500
...I await your commands.

116
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,000
For I know...

117
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,200
That...

118
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,320
That...

119
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,860
...when the rewards are given...

120
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,180
...I will be one of those who benefits from your generosity.

121
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,580
Yeah, me too, Bob.

122
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,220
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

123
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,920
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

124
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,940
A question of modern civilization!

125
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,180
The greatest sensation!

126
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,820
The greatest attraction of the century!

127
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,320
The best of people.

128
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,120
There are no limits to science.

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,340
How can you call this science?

130
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,660
Sounds like a goddamn witch doctor to me, Jack.

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,260
Oh, yes.

132
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,180


133
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,540
We are one!

134
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,520
It is no more than that, huh?

135
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,300
Eternal salvation.

136
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,680
Eternal salvation.

137
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,960
Or triple your money back.

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,120
Triple your money back.

139
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,920
Hmph.

140
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,220
He's lost his greedy mind, poor chap.

141
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,320
Well, then, I yield to the stooge, being of unsound mind.

142
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,860
The worst thing that ever happened to Johnny.

143
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,800
Alert! Alert! Alert!

144
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,380
Greetings, Bob.

145
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,060
Hello? This is Bob.

146
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,260
I'm out at the moment.

147
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,180
But I am the stooge.

148
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,080
If you leave your name and your telephone number, I'll call you back to the...

149
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,400
...the stooge.

150
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
...the unacquainted cable green room in the lands.

151
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,140
Thank you, Bob.

152
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,740
I am a resident of the ninth dimension.

153
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,220
Several of your own eminence.

154
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,820
So-so.

155
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,680
...intones the priest like a radio announcer.

156
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,720
He's on a roll now.

157
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,360
And suddenly on Wall-Eyed Street, the poor are amazed as they turn their eyes skyward to see

158
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,800
egg McMuffins neatly wrapped, flying through the air from skyscraper windows.

159
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,240
And to bring thy heavenly kingdom here on Earth,

160
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,840
they have to go to the church.

161
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,440
In a hush, the congregation steps together through the front door of the church.

162
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,180
They look out upon a shining city, flawless, perfect in every which way.

163
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,080
Next, we see them close the doors.

164
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,000
The church...

165
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,860
...VANISHES!

166
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,580
...and the church is in the dark.

167
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,620
Tired of getting all of the guilt, but none of the sex?

168
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,760
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

169
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,500
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

170
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,560
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master in his church of the subgenius.

171
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,220
An ancient society, pledging my forefathers...

172
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,280
...to defend the church against all enemies of Christ.

173
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,660
Their relationship was not entirely...

174
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,380
...successful.

175
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,040
What devil or witch was ever so great as Attila whose blood flows in these veins?

176
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,360
The veins of the subgenius.

177
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,380
Blood.

178
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,420
Blood...

179
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,140
...is the most precious thing in these times.

180
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,000
The very name venereal diseases, the diseases of Venus...

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,160
...imputs to them divine origin.

182
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,440
And they are involved in that sex problem about which...

183
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,200
...the ethics and ideals of Christian civilization are concerned.

184
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,200
In fact, civilization and syphilization have advanced to the present.

185
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,420
together.

186
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,100
Watch this man as he walks the narrow

187
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,820
line between sanity

188
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,600
and madness. One moment, the

189
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,720
extended photographer.

190
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,840
The next, the blood-maddened

191
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,120
killer. The beautiful,

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,660
the blood,

193
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,900
and the bear. The bear.

194
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,940
Is an experience in

195
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,160
naked terror.

196
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,740
Speaking of naked terror,

197
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,720
dear friends, there's...

198
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,440
There's a little news

199
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,740
piece I wanted to read to you.

200
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,560
This is from the

201
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,900
Dallas Morning News, and many of you

202
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,800
out of town

203
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,460
will probably never hear this

204
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,740
amazing story.

205
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,700
So, here,

206
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,000
this piece

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,900
I found,

208
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,100
this came out Friday.

209
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,360
Twenty naked

210
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,440
people pile out of

211
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,880
car after wreck

212
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,740
in Louisiana City.

213
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,120
Vinton, Louisiana.

214
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,220
Police were bemused

215
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,280
when a driver wearing only a towel

216
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
got out of a car, then got back

217
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,720
into the car and sped off.

218
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
But they were dumbfounded when the Pontiac

219
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,300
Grand Am hit a tree

220
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,920
and disgorged twenty

221
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,020
people wearing nothing

222
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,080
at all.

223
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,420
The Lord told them to get rid of all their belongings

224
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,400
and go to Louisiana. So, they

225
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,420
got rid of all their clothes and pocketbooks

226
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,860
and wallets and identifiers.

227
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,180
They got rid of all their

228
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,880
identification and the license plate off their car

229
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,520
and came to our gorgeous state.

230
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
This said Vinton police chief,

231
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,480
Dennis Drouillard.

232
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,800
They didn't have any money.

233
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,420
Not even a dime.

234
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,220
All twenty were from

235
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,860
Floydada, Texas.

236
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,120
That's right.

237
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,620
Floydada, Texas.

238
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,700
In the panhandle, diagonally across

239
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,660
the state from the southwest Louisiana

240
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,820
town of Vinton. Driver,

241
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,240
Sammy Rodriguez.

242
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,960
And his brother, Danny, said

243
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,140
they were Pentecostal preachers.

244
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,520
Chief Drouillard said.

245
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,840
Floydada police chief,

246
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,560
James Hale, said that he'd been

247
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,440
looking for the Rodriguez family since

248
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,740
Tuesday night, when relatives

249
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,020
reported them missing.

250
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,560
They made statements like

251
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,460
the devil was after them

252
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,740
and Floydada was going to be

253
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,600
destroyed if they stayed

254
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,360
here, Chief Hale said.

255
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,820
The family left in five or six

256
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,360
cars, abandoning one.

257
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,040
in Lubbock, and a second in San Angelo.

258
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,800
Police found yet a third in Galveston,

259
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,580
plus the family's clothes, pocketbooks, wallets, and other belongings.

260
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,800
The chase in Vinton began after a campground owner called the police.

261
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,160
A Calcasieu Parish deputy stopped their car,

262
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,920
and a man wearing only a towel got out.

263
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,840
When the officer went to ask what was going on,

264
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,800
he jumped back in and took off, Chief Drouillard said.

265
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,140
They sped down Vinton's Main Street

266
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,420
until the car hit a tree at the baseball park at the end of town.

267
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,700
Fifteen adults piled out of the car.

268
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,420
Five children were in the trunk,

269
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,680
and they were completely nude.

270
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,260
All 20 of them didn't have a stitch or clothes on.

271
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,800
I mean, no socks, no underwear, no nothing.

272
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,520
Five of them were in the trunk, Chief Drouillard said.

273
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,100
The youngest was a year old, the oldest, 63.

274
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,340
I think they were all related, he said.

275
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,520
The car was totaled, but the injuries were minor.

276
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,360
I guess when you're packed in that tight,

277
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,140
there's not much room to move around.

278
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,800
One deputy had a bag of clothes, Chief Drouillard said.

279
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,740
We got everybody at least a shirt on.

280
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,300
It was quite a scene.

281
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,720
Sammy Rodriguez, praise Sammy Rodriguez, friends,

282
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,580
was booked with reckless driving, flight from an officer,

283
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,920
property damage, and several minor traffic.

284
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,720
Violations.

285
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,280
He was kept in custody.

286
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,320
The police chief said the entire group was released

287
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,640
into the custody of a Baptist church in nearby Sulphur,

288
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
awaiting relatives.

289
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,960
We've never had any type of strange, off-the-wall actions

290
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,980
from any of the family, the Floydada police chief said.

291
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,520
The family here is going down and talk to them

292
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,620
and see what they want to do.

293
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,320
Now, that was Friday, dear friends, that that happened.

294
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,560
And, of course, we wondered what it was like

295
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,080
in that hot, blistering...

296
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,540
sweaty car with old 15-year-old Aunt May

297
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,280
sitting on top of young nephew.

298
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,060
Well, but Saturday,

299
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,000
Saturday in the paper, a new story.

300
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,680
Runaway nudes vanish without a trace.

301
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,040
And once again, Vinton, Louisiana.

302
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,500
Police were looking Friday for 19 of the 20 people

303
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
who were crammed into one car naked

304
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,760
when it crashed into a tree

305
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,720
while they were fleeing from police Thursday.

306
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,040
Officials said relatives drove all the way across Texas

307
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,580
to find the 20, only to learn that nobody knew where they were.

308
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,760
The people had been taken by police

309
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,340
to a Salvation Army facility in Lake Charles

310
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,160
after the car crashed Thursday.

311
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,780
So I guess they didn't show up at a Baptist place, eh?

312
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,720
They were at the Salvation Army.

313
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,240
Okay.

314
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,440
Okay.

315
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,220
Said Douglas Harris, a Salvation Army employee,

316
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,760
their kinfolk showed up.

317
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,120
I called the police, the sheriff's office,

318
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,140
all the other shelters.

319
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,960
Nobody.

320
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,240
Nobody knew where they were.

321
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,480
Police Chief Dennis Juillard said he thought they were related.

322
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,080
He said they told his officers

323
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,340
that their clothes had been possessed by the devil.

324
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,620
Oh, it gets deeper now.

325
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,920
We're beginning to pry the story out of the mystery.

326
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,660
Mr. Harris said the group was brought

327
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,860
to his Salvation Army shelter Thursday night

328
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,840
but did not stay.

329
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,560
They were talking Spanish.

330
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,320
They gathered all in the hall.

331
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,020
Then bang, it looked like lost cattle running.

332
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,720
They didn't know which way to go, he said.

333
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,540
Mr. Harris said police found them about 11 p.m. on a beach

334
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,780
and asked whether they could be brought back to the Salvation Army

335
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,540
but Harris' supervisors rejected the request.

336
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,900
Oh, Salvation Army, you couldn't save.

337
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,560
These people were already saved.

338
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,700
As long as they didn't have their clothes on,

339
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,860
the devil couldn't get them.

340
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,820
Authorities said,

341
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,140
especially their driver's license,

342
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,220
that's where they had the devil really sniff you out

343
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,080
is your driver's license.

344
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,180
Authorities said the 20 apparently were members

345
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,180
of a Floydada church that is not affiliated

346
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,060
with any of the organized Pentecostal denominations.

347
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,840
The Reverend Tom Tenney,

348
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,000
District Superintendent of the United Pentecostals,

349
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,960
said the group is not connected with his denomination.

350
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,980
Wayne Fry, in charge of the felony section

351
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,540
at the Calcazoo District,

352
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,020
Attorney's Office,

353
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,440
said Louisiana's Child Protection Office

354
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
has begun an investigation into reports

355
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,840
that five children in the group

356
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,360
were in the trunk of the car in 98-degree weather.

357
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,680
And there are reports that some in the group

358
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,520
may have been taken against their will.

359
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,400
Chief Hale said the group was reportedly

360
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,860
headed to Florida to preach.

361
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,020
Well, friends, let's all take our clothes off

362
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,780
and head to Florida to preach, man.

363
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,420
That's it.

364
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:39,820
That's it.

365
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,700
It's beautiful.

366
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,140
The dangerous, the bloody, the naked, and the nude.

367
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,160
Music and background, by the way, is by Brain Rot Theater.

368
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,320
We've been listening to Media Barrage No. 9,

369
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,300
just a fun little edit of the old subgenius Media Barrage,

370
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,900
intercut with the obvious movie, Draculia.

371
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,320
And, oh, the Church Vanishes clip

372
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,240
was from Audio Comics by Dan Retherett.

373
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,640
And we may be playing more of,

374
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,400
as well as we've got a couple of different

375
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,780
rock and roll songs about mass murder

376
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,500
that just seem to fit into the theme of tonight's show

377
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,200
as it has fallen together with blood and nakedity.

378
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,120
Ah, yes.

379
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,360
Unashamed, bearing everything

380
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,480
to make him a success

381
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,120
only to be paid off in blood.

382
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,300
The beautiful, the bloody,

383
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,040
and the bare.

384
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,680
A story so revealing

385
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,700
it is intended for adults only.

386
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,980
Don't you look a man.

387
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,840
You hurt.

388
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,740
You're influenced by Bob in your work.

389
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,120
Well, actually, Bob just uses me as an instrument of death.

390
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,720
Bob kills through me.

391
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,380
My artwork is my own.

392
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,340
They can take our instruments

393
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,080
and set them apart like 200,000.

394
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,600
What is it?

395
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,740
A new...

396
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,620
Oh, Bob.

397
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,540
Bob.

398
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:31,040
Well, you talk about

399
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:39,140
that, Bob.

400
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,240
What are you doing? Speak! Speak!

401
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,380
What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?

402
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,880
The slack running down your legs!

403
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,240
Explain, Bob.

404
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,220
He's really inserting his hand between Connie's hands.

405
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,020
Do not fear me.

406
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,440
Stop this. Stop this. Stop this.

407
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,520
God, who are you?

408
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,040
It is much to be learned.

409
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,340
Go ahead.

410
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,000
The time round comes to push, push comes to shove.

411
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,100
Shoves comes to look around and see where you're up above or down below.

412
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
Where you're at and how it turns.

413
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,000
Something that says it's good, says it's bad, that's good.

414
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,680
Say what it is, what it is. That's cool.

415
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,860
So when it gets cool and you got some fool coming through the door,

416
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,100
you don't know what he's doing about what.

417
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,500
He just come and fell out of the water like a fish on the floor.

418
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,500
And what it is to me is like, I say a lot of words.

419
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,540
They say they're bad words.

420
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,500
For me, they're just words.

421
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,540
I don't see good words or bad words.

422
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,640
Good and bad is up to the individual to decide whatever he feels like is good or bad.

423
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,700
So when you're talking to a man, you say,

424
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:08,880
Hey!

425
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,640
You old derry-bra-bra-bra-bra.

426
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,400
How the hell are you?

427
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,340
You old roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo.

428
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,960
We're all denied.

429
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,980
And plus he's got a swastika in the middle of his head.

430
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,860
You know, it doesn't help.

431
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,760
Here's the best part.

432
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,680
So he's talking to, I guess, what's the equivalent of a judge.

433
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,920
I don't know who these parole guys are.

434
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,000
And he just makes up some name to call him and the judge wigs on him.

435
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,380
Here's the thing.

436
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,700
Let me say this to you, Chief Thomas.

437
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,300
Hold up, hold up, just a minute.

438
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,480
My name is written right there.

439
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,960
Don't you ever call me.

440
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,260
You say, what's that name right there?

441
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,560
Do you understand?

442
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:40,960
Yes, sir.

443
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,420
Yes, sir.

444
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,120
It's not perceived.

445
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:42,940
Ooh.

446
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,000
That guy's cool.

447
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,240
The deal is, is that Manson represents himself.

448
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,100
He doesn't have a lawyer.

449
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,740
Right, that's a good idea.

450
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,260
He represents himself, so they have...

451
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,900
He's done well with his clients so far.

452
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,880
Yeah, and that's already a sign of a madman.

453
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,040
But they have to sort of, like, let him talk.

454
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,440
Right.

455
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,060
Hey, you don't have to let me out of anywhere, sir.

456
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,360
Because, you know, where I am is the world we create.

457
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,780
That's the universe, man, to dig.

458
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,920
Now, freak.

459
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,460
Freak.

460
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,040
Freak.

461
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,340
Parole denied.

462
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,400
I am the last of my kind.

463
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,760
Would you care for an order, Dr. Thurlow?

464
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,900
Carnival.

465
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,760
No, thank you, Mr. Redfield.

466
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,800
You see, it's life that I ingest.

467
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,140
It's back life to me.

468
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:29,440


469
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,240
A flood gives you luck.

470
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,400
Certainly.

471
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,540
But you might as well ask, Commander.

472
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,000
If molecules would pair of chapsticks

473
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,640
and interest me in lesser carnivore.

474
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,220
I shall have to invent a new classification of lunatic for you.

475
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,600
I do like Bob.

476
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,600
I do like Bob.

477
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,560
I like his shirt.

478
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,620
I like his shirt.

479
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,200
When I'm wearing...

480
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,300
When I'm wearing it.

481
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,600
When I'm wearing it.

482
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,980
I've never been hurt.

483
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,160
Bob feels so strongly for the pinks that rather than wear a hair shirt, Bob is much spiffier than that.

484
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,680
He wears polyester shorts so he can receive the fullness of polyester that plagues the life of pinks and understand their problems more fully.

485
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,420
Bob's compassion is as infinite as his handicap.

486
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,200
Bob itches for your sins.

487
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,400
Does that help him with his stench?

488
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,400


489
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:43,820
The stench of Bob is a psycho-phantasmagoric aura of odor which fills the seven continents in twenty seas.

490
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,740
Most human beings cannot withstand the glory of this Bob.

491
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,520
Only when the third nostril has been properly opened by the necessary corrective administration of the green energy.

492
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,440
I do like Bob.

493
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,180
I like his shoes.

494
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,620
I like his shoes.

495
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,900
And when I'm wearing them.

496
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,600
You know I never walked a blue.

497
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,660
Bob is coming.

498
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,720
Bob is coming.

499
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,440
Bob is coming.

500
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,980
Bob is coming.

501
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:31,760
Speaking as the Pope of New York, whose power at its most minimal equals the Pope of the Holy City of the Vatican,

502
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,980
and it's proven by the fact that I am not, in fact, infallible.

503
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,020
I have the power to fail and fail often.

504
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,160
Let me point out to you that the Roman Catholic Church specializes in suicide.

505
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,620
And not only suicide, but suicide with guilt.

506
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:53,820
We suggest you open yourself to the living death and life that is the infinite fulsomeness of, excepting, of Bob.

507
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,800
I do like Bob.

508
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,040
But I never want his job.

509
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,840
I do like Bob. But I never want his job.

510
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,940
I do like Bob. But I never want his job.

511
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:11,940


512
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:11,940


513
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,360
Bob...

514
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,380
Bob...

515
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,360
Bob...

516
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,680
Hey!

517
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,020
What in God's name is going on up here?

518
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,720
What in God's name is going on up here?

519
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:25,720


520
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,120
Bob...

521
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,260
Ah! Ah!

522
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,220
Won't you stop just doing a radio show, sir?

523
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,900
You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear that which you cannot account for, sir.

524
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,440
Will one of you learned doctors or whatever you are kindly tell me what is going on with my Lucy?

525
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,220
Do you not think there are things in this universe which you cannot understand and which are true?

526
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,200
Mesmerism, hypnotism...

527
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,780
You and Shark are the true hypnotism.

528
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,420
...materialization, astral bodies.

529
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,580
Where the hell did he go?

530
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,760
Bob is...

531
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,700
Some years ago he erected a mighty cross on top of a mountain.

532
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,380
It was impossible to do, but he did.

533
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,520
And each year he has a big rally there on the mountain, Mount Lynn Lowry.

534
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,800
He's a miracle Jesus friend!

535
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,980
He's a kind of Jesus friend that will cross in the name of God!

536
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,020
He's a miracle!

537
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,160
He's a miracle Jesus friend!

538
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,340
And friends, I'll tell you what sometimes...

539
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,740
Sometimes that Jesus, he'll...

540
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,640
He'll light up his eyes.

541
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,980
Yes, he'll light up his eyes.

542
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,540
He'll say...

543
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,780
He'll say...

544
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,380
He'll say...

545
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,040
If you look at Jesus, if Bob Dobbs is some kind of demonic influence, some kind of demonic spirit, he'll say,

546
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,480
Hell no!

547
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,200
He'll say, the fighting Jesus was like,

548
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,720
If Bob Dobbs, he's a very good man!

549
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,160
He's a...

550
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,500
He's a friend of mine!

551
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,200
Yeah!

552
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,200
Gentlemen, we're not fighting some disease here.

553
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,980
It stalks us for some dread purpose I do not yet comprehend.

554
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:12,020
The green fairy who lives in the absence wants your soul.

555
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,180
But you are safe with me.

556
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,620
We'd like to say right now, we've got Bob coming up in a moment with Tonight Sports.

557
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,740
We've got a story tonight that our sports director declined to read.

558
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,580
But I'm going to have it for you in just a moment.

559
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,400
It's the story of Nashville's leaping lawnmower, coming up in 30 seconds.

560
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,160
Bob is fill in the blank.

561
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,620
We're spouting the name of Bob, using the name of Bob, but all in vain.

562
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,140
Master!

563
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,020
Master!

564
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,560
You promised me eternal life!

565
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,440
But you give it to the pretty woman!

566
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Dr. Jack!

567
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,980
I'm no lunatic man!

568
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,820
I'm a clean man fighting for his soul!

569
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,460
No, Master.

570
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,840
You are not.

571
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,960
I serve you.

572
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,320
I serve only you.

573
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,000
Only you, Bob.

574
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,640
Yes!

575
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,920
Yes!

576
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,800
Glory is my love.

The dangers of Bob...

Bob the Killer...

587
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,760
He'll get your money and your blood, won't he?

588
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,040
Yes...

589
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,660
Oh, yes...

590
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:30,940
Oh, Bob's been rough on the little piggies lately, hasn't he?

591
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,880
What a rough Bob...

592
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,200
He's been so rough...

593
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,260
But...

594
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,160
But he saw to it that we'd have some records to play for you tonight.

595
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,780
Why, this one showed up, we heard it for the first time about half an hour ago.

596
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,660
From out-of-band experience...

597
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,100
The beautiful Kings of Feedback...

598
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,620
Doing their lightest called...

599
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,720
One Hell of a Tweak.

600
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,900
And the most

601
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,280
The only

602
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,280
The only sex preoccupies us more than murder.

603
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,600
It's sad, isn't it?

604
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,440
The only

605
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,980
The only

606
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,220
The only

607
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,200
The only

608
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,440
The only

609
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:13,400
A shocking tale of murder, mutilation, and cannibalism wrapped in plastic.

610
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,660
I felt it. It was one hell of a tweak.

611
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,260
One hell of a tweak.

612
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,460
It was one hell of a tweak.

613
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,960
So who are these serial killers?

614
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,160
They are more like us than we like to admit.

615
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,920
And these obsessive desires and

616
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,420
thoughts wanting to control them.

617
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,060
I just enjoy killing them.

618
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,460
I'm scared to death of failing in male-female relationships.

619
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,540
What makes their sick minds tick?

620
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,980
Believe me, they're the most despicable human beings on our planet.

621
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,940
I don't believe anybody should forgive them, certainly not you, Catoan, but we must study them.

622
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,820
It was overwhelming.

623
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,140
He was a killing machine out of control.

624
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm gonna kill you as many as I can. I'm gonna pile you up to the sky.

625
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,440
These are the left-handed people.

626
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:52,300
The serial killer is packaged and sold in magazines, books, even trading cards.

627
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,760
How do you like that, man? Pull the dummy.

628
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,860
They got too many girls out there hitchhiking. They couldn't be out there.

629
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,220
Christophe killed 300 people. It excited him.

630
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:12,540
Some people go crazy. I felt this one hell of a tweak. I mean, to just flip out and not where I was.

631
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,240
A surge of energy. This one hell of a tweak.

632
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,460
They would do less than they can. They snapped.

633
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,960
Because of their childhood discrepancies associated with violence.

634
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,480
They were killed.

635
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,200
They were killed.

636
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:34,200


637
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:43,920
And they are still killed.

638
00:34:52,040 --> 00:35:03,980
Let me be patient.

639
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,040
that number you can call OutBand Experience.

640
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:15,420
They welcome it at six, area code 617-LICK-OBE.

641
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,960
617-LICK-OBE, yes you can do that.

642
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,420
And tonight we're also playing a new tape we got in.

643
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,480
The soundtrack of the film Acid Is Groovy,

644
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,560
Kill the Pigs.

645
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,900
That's the title of a movie by our friend Joe Christ,

646
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,880
Reverend Joe Christ, and he said in his letter here,

647
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,200
here is a cassette version of the movie soundtrack.

648
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,700
The groovy cover art is by Joe Coleman,

649
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,240
Chris Spedding is the legendary Sessions guitarist,

650
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,580
blah blah blah, and Billy Atwell III,

651
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,300
the drummer for The False Prophet.

652
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,780
And he hopes we can fit it in somewhere in our program.

653
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,360
And oddly enough, tonight was just the night to fit in

654
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,520
the first song off of this lovely Joe Christ album.

655
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,580
Actually it's Joe Christ and Bigger Than God,

656
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,440
is the name of the band.

657
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,380
And this song called Your Daughter Died a Virgin.

658
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,360
Your daughter died a virgin.

659
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,220
Missing her.

660
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,200
Like a living ghost.

661
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,120
But I'm longing for the taste of your love.

662
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:53,960
Too young and sweet and innocent to be divided by the blood.

663
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:01,620
I've turned her home with me, about feeling restless

664
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:11,120
Now, your daughter died a virgin, you should know

665
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,960
And you're the queen of my ego

666
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:32,640
You know I couldn't let her, she was such a lovely girl

667
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:41,860
But now she's out of me, I'm on top of the world

668
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,680
guitar solo

669
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:30,380
When I saw that baby play, only one thing I'd like to do

670
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:38,940
I'd drive her in a man-o-murse and throw her into

671
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:46,940
Your daughter died a virgin, you're the man

672
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,080
guitar solo

673
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,940
guitar solo

674
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,740
Just a little tickle on the back of my heart

675
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,300
guitar solo

676
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:08,960
If I had never to hurt her, I'd leave her here with you

677
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,460
guitar solo

678
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:18,220
Do you want to leave with a question for me?

679
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840

00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,540

685
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,640
Oh yes, lovely, lovely Joe Christ there.

686
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,380
Joe Christ and Bigger Than God from their movie soundtrack,

687
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,960
Acid is Groovy, Kill the Pigs.

688
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,640
And you can write to,

689
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,240
Joe Christ at, for those of you illegally recording this show,

690
00:39:54,380 --> 00:40:03,120
at 151 First Avenue, number 77, New York, New York,

691
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,560
one triple oh three.

692
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,300
Yeah, we try to let you know who's doing our satanic music

693
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,060
so you can write for your own copies.

694
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,700
Oh, huh.

701
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,000

702
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,600
Let's do some cries

703
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,480

704
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,400
Let's do some cries

706

Let's do some cries

707
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,920
Let's do some crimes

708
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,220
We could hack into the bank computer

709
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,220
Then I got the code

710
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,040
Well, you got to be gentle with her

711
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,920
Until you break her hold

712
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,820
I know a pretty armored car

713
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,820
Comes by here every day

714
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,780
We don't have to kill the guards

715
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,580
Unless they get in our way

716
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,840
Let's do some crimes

717
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,860
Let's do some crimes

718
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,480
Let's do some crimes

719
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,180
Let's do some crimes

720
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,000
There's a foolish, jaded woman

721
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,720
Who hires actors to play a rape

722
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,800
To her it's all just a game

723
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,600
Until we get it on videotape

724
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,400
There's a man

725
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:39,480
Who's a man of faith

726
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,820
There's a man of faith

727
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,680
We can take a hostage

728
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,440
He likes to party down on my lawn

729
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,400
Well, his suit is silken

730
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,320
His wine is vintage

731
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,060
Cause he's Mayer's playboy son

732
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,140
I got a can of gasoline

733
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,180
I know you always got a flame

734
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,880
I've lost to these fires

735
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,960
Like a beautiful dream

736
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,020
And I know we're not playing games

737
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,060
Let's do some crimes

738
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,080
Let's do some crimes

739
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,700
Let's do some crimes

740
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,700
Let's do some crimes

741
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,300
Let's do some crimes

742
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,220
Steal the parts to a nuclear bomb

743
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,940
Think a city you can't stand

744
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,900
Do something that's overwhelmingly wrong

745
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,840
Feel the world in your hands

746
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,140
Oh, we could go to the liquor store

747
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,680
Knock over a 7-11

748
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,680
Might have to dust them

749
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,640
Just to make sure

750
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,380
Let God sort them out in heaven

751
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,680
Let's do some crimes

752
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,340
Let's do some crimes

753
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,820
Let's do some crimes

754
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,340
Let's do some crimes

755
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,300
Let's do some crimes

756
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,580
Let's do some crimes

757
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,240
Let's do some crimes

758
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Three of the white house sewage lines

759
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,800
I got a rent someone thinks it's too high

760
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:10,800


761
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,760
it, pour it on them from behind, give them a taste of their own sh**. Let's do some crimes!

762
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,840
Let's do some crimes!

763
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,760
Let's do some crimes!

764
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,540
Let's do some crimes!

765
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,420
Let's do some crimes!

766
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,540
Let's do some crimes!

767
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,480
Let's do some crimes!

768
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,360
Let's do some crimes!

769
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,300
Let's do some crimes!

770
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Let's do some trash

771
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,420
Let's do some trash

772
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,280
Let's do some trash

773
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,900
Don't be half-assed

774
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,820
What do you say, let's go downtown

775
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,320
Let's go downtown, see what we can find

776
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,120
Let's go, let's find ourselves a seat

777
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,460
I got something to do, man

778
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,500
I got an idea, man

779
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,100
Let's fuck with the elevator, man

780
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,400
I got the wire to the fence

781
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,720
Let's go, let's go downtown, man

782
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,380
Let's go downtown, that's where all of me

783
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,440
gonna go

784
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,140
Come on, man, come on, man

785
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,900
Let's do some trash

786
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,880
Let's do some trash

787
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,600
Let's do some trash

788
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,300
Let's do some trash

789
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,080
Don't need a reason, don't need rhyme

790
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,300
Let's do some trash

791
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,360
I got the time

792
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,220
Let's do some trash

793
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,760
Let's do some trash

794
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,460
Ooh, John Shirley there

795
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,740
You are reckless

796
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,280
Well, so what?

797
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,840
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it

798
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,140
John Shirley, let's do some crimes

799
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,180
But

800
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:05,680
Oh, world events can be bigger crimes, my friend

801
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,080
Unknown signs will appear in the heavens

802
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,640
And on Earth

803
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,180
The coordinates, the third dimensional coordinates

804
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,540
Will be all of Soul 3, Milky Way Galaxy Universe A

805
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,140
The first cleansing ritual to initiate

806
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,980
At Triple Underpass Sacred Octagon, Dallas, Texas, USA

807
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,120
Fourth Dimension

808
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,420
The fifth dimensional coordinate

809
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:48,440
Will be on Nuit, Form 5, July 1998, 7 AM

810
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,160
And the fifth dimensional coordinate

811
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,000
Is the nervous systems of all those who best surf

812
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,360
The psychic explosion

813
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,660
And it had better be the Church of the Subgenius, dear friend

814
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:05,660


815
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:05,660


816
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,560
Friends for all are doomed

817
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,620
Astrologically, Mercury will be in retrograde

818
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,360
The time when communications of every sort become skewed

819
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,060
Planes crash and wars start

820
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,640
Cosmoastrologically, it will be in retrograde

821
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,380
These are harmonic discordance

822
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,400
That rare and fleeting period in the history of the solar system

823
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,520
When nothing is in alignment

824
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:44,960
Nothing!

825
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,100
No planets, satellites, asteroids, meteors or comets

826
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,240
Even the rings of Saturn will be out of whack

827
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,060
Allowing the re-imprinting of fate

828
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:02,940
On the entire interplanetary sphere

829
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,340
And thereby creating

830
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,360
Momentarily the potential for ultimate slack

831
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,980
At midnight, July 4th, 1998

832
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:21,740
Bob, at a wild, just-say-yes ritual party

833
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,680
In James Joyce Park, New York

834
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,180
Will raise from the dead 23 of the homeless

835
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,700
The unexplained and the irreconcilable

836
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,320
He will then, with one phone call, purchase a new phone

837
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:34,320


838
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:34,320


839
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:34,320


840
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,300
And the phone will reach the Vatican for 144 trillion dollars

841
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:44,080
And will declare himself last pope and first anarchrist

842
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,800
Assuring his mastery over the world

843
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,760
Finally, around 6am

844
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,240
Bob will leap into a fiery crater of a live volcano

845
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,360
Causing it to erupt in a convulsive pterogasm

846
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,060
Spurting him or his charred carcass into low earth orbit

847
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,300
To intercept the alien planet!

848
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:04,300


849
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,320
And defeat this

850
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,840
And attended at the very heart of

851
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:07,920
Purgatory

852
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,200
If hisÄ±s

853
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,500
Aurorae

854
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:10,700
Lord Caesar marsenae

855
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,340
Are formed upon' Fragaham because of death and ash

856
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:31,600
Do not be ì¡°ì‹¬ engendered As failed clouds break away the storm

857
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,240
Aged many zolpels are born out on theë²ˆ

858
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,720
Real memories of being hideous, perverted life forms on other planes and planets.

859
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:45,380
They'll be sorry they ever read that first Fate magazine.

860
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:58,140
Yes, millions of idiots watching on CNN will mistake these two-bit, cheesy-looking, strictly corporeal spaceships for the X-ists.

861
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:06,520
A donut-shaped, in varying sizes, the 33 saucers will stack up on the Washington Monument like one of those baby's toys.

862
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,100
Only not correctly, with largest first ending at smallest.

863
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:16,760
Instead, they'll slide down its shaft to form the random Great Configuration.

864
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:22,420
That shape which opens the dimensional gateway for the escape vessels.

865
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,840
In other words, all of the so-called Galactic Brotherhood's beloved.

866
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:33,080
So, by UFO kooks, are all but the doormen for the X-ists.

867
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:37,280
Mere decoys to confuse the conspiracy at the crucial time.

868
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:49,780
And at that moment, when the portal is aborted, shall the time be nigh for their horizon.

869
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,920
And then, only then, will X-Day truly begin.

870
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,120
Yes, friends, I have to tell you...

871
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,020
about the rupture.

872
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,380
For one shall be taken, and the other left.

873
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:15,680
You know, you and your unsaved spouse might be sitting at the breakfast table, when suddenly, you will be caught away and your spouse will be alone.

874
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:25,820
Incidentally, pinks and bobbies who want to murder their spouses, but are afraid of getting caught, can simply buy their behated ones a subgenius membership scription ordination.

875
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,120
To guarantee their being right.

876
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,620
But the rupture, which was ruptured in 1998, is the perfect crime.

877
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,760
In the mall or the street, everything will be normal one minute.

878
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:44,400
And the next, certain people will have silently vanished, leaving empty suits of clothes eerily dotting the ground.

879
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,560
Driverless cars will veer into oncoming traffic.

880
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:55,700
Those Christians who have not heard of Bob, will be heartbroken.

881
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,000
While those who have, will curse God and cry out to the mountain.

882
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,440
Employers of subgeniuses will have to hire temps on short notice.

883
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,060
Hint for those left behind, just before X-Day invest in temporary employment franchises.

884
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:14,980
Yes, getting caught up will happen to different subgenii in different ways.

885
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,940
The houses of some subgeniuses will be enclosed by protective force field bubbles.

886
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,320
The surrounding neighborhood will then be scoured by obliteration rays.

887
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,220
And then the sex goddesses will simply beam up the bubbles.

888
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:41,220
Imagine, friends, the skyrocketing violence and panic as desperate pinks climb over each other.

889
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:46,340
Trying to purchase subgenius memberships at the last moment.

890
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,800
Our hearts fill with joy at the thought of that.

891
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,300
But we will forewarn you that the rupture may be just a moment.

892
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,280
And that is disconcerting to some subgenii as well.

893
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,920
For not all are ruptured in the same ways.

894
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,000
Few will actually be lifted up into a spaceship.

895
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,320
Although they might remember it that way, because it's easier for the mind to accept.

896
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:14,020
Some will be ripped to pieces, tearing through their roofs.

897
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:19,180
Those outdoors will rocket skyward, depressurizing in the upper atmosphere.

898
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,560
And exploding like deep sea fish hauled to the surface too fast.

899
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:31,680
Some subgenii in the process of rupturing will resemble burning monks or spontaneous human combustion victims.

900
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:44,080
Bob has told us that for those with faith, these are just the images, the useless physical shells being left behind in a hurry for something better.

901
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,300
And if we believe, without any fear or doubt, while our bodies are being vacated and trashed,

902
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:57,020
we will instantaneously be recreated on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

903
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:02,520
as athletic, youthful, genetically perfect versions of our former selves.

904
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:10,360
Of course, we'll later have the option of changing to practically any vaguely humanoid physical form we choose.

905
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:16,820
But nobody will know any of that for sure until they've already actually ruptured.

906
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,060
This is Dobbs Ultimate.

907
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,740
Test of Faith.

908
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:32,180
Thanks to the miracle of live television, most subgenii will have to watch those in earlier time zones undergoing the rupture first.

909
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:39,380
For instance, California subgenii will witness their counterparts in New York writhing and screaming,

910
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,700
bursting into flames, appearing to die in unimaginable pain.

911
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:50,280
A few may start having second thoughts and may even be superstitious.

912
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,900
They may even be superstitious enough to burn their membership cards.

913
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,200
Think that will do you any good?

914
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,540
We know that X-Day happens at 7am.

915
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,800
But starting where?

916
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,280
Eastern or Central Time?

917
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,920
All over the planet?

918
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:06,980
Simultaneously?

919
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,700
Or time zone by time zone?

920
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,580
Praise Dobbs, it is the latter.

921
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,040
And that'll make for some great TV viewing on that fady, fatal, mighty day.

922
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,280
For purposes of illustration only, folks,

923
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:26,700
I want you to, uh, envision a gigantic spaceship hovering in one place while the Earth turns beneath it.

924
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,320
Or thousands of ships lined up in a vertical row north to south,

925
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:36,300
letting each section of the Earth pass by underneath as they bathe it in their rays of glory.

926
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,260
Now the International Date Line, the place where each day on Earth begins,

927
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,940
falls on a meridian that transverses the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

928
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,280
The first populated area at which it will be set.

929
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:57,200
At 7am, July 5th, 1998, happens to be, and this is true, friends,

930
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:04,820
the island of Nuku'alafa in Tonga, just east of the Fiji Islands.

931
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:11,080
Also enjoying an early X-Day will be the Arctic subgeniuses in Pravidaniya, Russia.

932
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:17,660
If CNN has cameras there, we in the US will be able to watch their X-Day start

933
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,260
17 hours before the sun sets.

934
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,380
And we'll see what happens before it gets to us.

935
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:27,500
Plan to tune in at 2pm Central Standard Time on July 4th.

936
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:32,780
And by the way, friends, as X-Day moves across the face of the Earth,

937
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:39,320
the conspiracy will fall in Japan and Australia, then China, India, across Russia,

938
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:43,240
across Europe and across America.

939
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,600
And by the way, the last subgeniuses to be ruptured

940
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:54,380
will be those just west of Nome, Alaska and in western Samoa.

941
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:03,360
And those who write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

942
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,500
Friends, I'm going to give that post office box that I've been promising so long

943
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:13,340
so that you too can be ruptured up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

944
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:17,000
That number to write, just write, just write, write to your old friend Bob.

945
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:26,340
At post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas.

946
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:31,780
That's right, beautiful, lovely, Dallas, Texas 75214.

947
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:42,140
Once again, that's box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

948
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:47,220
You know, it just wouldn't seem right if you didn't hear me give that box number once a week.

949
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,580
No way.

950
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:47,760
I'll put it.

951
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:53,240
Eh, not that most of you pay your pledges for it.

952
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:01,160
Well, anyway, and now this one last piece of music and...

953
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:28,460
What are we doing, could we just close out now?

954
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,360
Performance for prayer.

955
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,460
Yeah, my old friend Paul praise God.

956
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,380
I'll just plan the following, best of luck out there, I this way.

957
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:36,500
See you then.

958
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:36,500


959
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:36,500


960
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:46,600
Encore a solid five.

961
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,440
THE END

962
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,640
END

963
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,460
END

964
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,060
END

965
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,320
END
