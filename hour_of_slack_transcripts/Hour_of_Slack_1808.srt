1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
I can't tell you how excited I am about our first guest this morning.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,500
He will be joining us in just a couple of moments.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,460
The Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,200
Praise Bob!

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,240
We're having operating difficulties.

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,600
Hey, what's going on here?

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,560
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:55,500
This Stang Back Saving Rerun is Hour of Slack number 128 from May 1st, 1988.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,060
And it's a really good one.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,780
Welcome to the end times, boys and girls.

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,980
We're going to shock shock the house with your brain and the world.

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,980
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,400
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,680
Bob is coming here to ease your strife.

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,860
Come on, suckers, let Bob into your life.

16
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,800
And remind you of this.

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,880
He who laughs last laughs best, but also gets his teeth kicked in.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,840
And if you can't laugh at yourself, make fun of everyone else.

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,540
Is it rolling?

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,800
Backwards masking, take one.

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,180
Satan is cool.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,160
God is a jerk.

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,640
Wonder if we fooled anybody.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,520
Yeah, I've heard about Satan trying to get people to sell their souls,

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,480
but he's not really too good at it.

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,260
Actually, he tried to get me to sell mine,

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,500
but all he offered me was crap like a Hugo and tennis shoes from Taiwan

28
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,780
and carob yogurt.

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,160
And he was like, I'm not going to sell you anything.

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,800
He was like, I'm not going to sell you anything.

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm going to sell you this thing called a cheapskate.

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,280
And he got all huffy and red in the face and called me a spoilsport.

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,640
But I told him to go straight to hell because that just wasn't good enough.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,380
I wasn't going to sell myself that cheap.

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,020
So there.

36
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,040
Oh, yes.

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,320
A dear, a friend's eye.

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,920
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack at our new place on the dial.

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,880
Eighty nine point three.

40
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,580
Unusual.

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,200
I hope you're finding us.

42
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,520
And I hope those of you who never heard us before keep listening because I have specially designed this show.

43
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,700
This is a very unusual show for you strangers to it.

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:59,680
And what we what we're doing tonight is basically sort of a revised introduction to the church.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,860
For new viewers.

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:13,360
Every three or four months, we do that just like a pledge drive just to catch you up on what the church of the subgenius is and why there must be and has always been a Bob.

47
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:20,380
Also tonight, though, we're going to preview the new album by the swinging area diets of Boston.

48
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,220
If you've never heard them, then hang in there.

49
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,620
By the way, while I'm still thinking about it, this is quark in the background.

50
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,560
Quark.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:28,760
Quark.

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:28,840
Quark.

53
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,420
Quark.

54
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,660


55
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,660


56
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,660


57
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,660


58
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,660


59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,000
Quark.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000


61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000


62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000


63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,060
Mighty stereo background.

64
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,340
Friends listen on headphones.

65
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,340
You really should.

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,120
And start your tape decks up.

67
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,800
We'll also later be doing some reading from the new subgenius book.

68
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,320
Hi, weirdness by mail, which isn't out yet.

69
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,360
So therefore, you couldn't call this an ad.

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:49,960
Exactly.

71
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:58,220
You're getting a preview, friends of a major Simon and Schuster publication, and it's going to make some of you so mad.

72
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,960
So mad.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,640
I hope if we're doing our job

74
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,860
So see if you can see if you can figure out what's going on here if you can't we don't need you

75
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,540
Understand that's the whole point of this

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,960
Okay, that's it now. You know what the Church of subgenius is about Bobby sex

77
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,720
Praise Bob dear friends. This is the radio ministry of the church

78
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,060
Let's start back at the beginning because a lot of people are not aware of

79
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,140
Exactly what J.R. Bob Dobbs and the church praise Bob are all about

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,040
Tell us all about it

81
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,000
Subgenius is the end times church for mutants

82
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,800
formed to spread the

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,280
Seed word of that great saint of sales J.R. Bob Dobbs

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,620
Bob formed the church in 1953 being the saint of sales

85
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,780
But he kind of kept it under wraps until around 1980 when he

86
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,760
recruited dr. Philodromo myself to begin

87
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,840
Releasing the secrets of his teachings to the public at large which of course

88
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,880
has had disastrous effects

89
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,760
Bob?

90
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,540
Bob?

91
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,700
Bob Bob Bob

92
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,060
Bob is

93
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,720
Bob is sex

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
That's your key phrase

95
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,880
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it

96
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,340
We are controlling transmission

97
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,520
You've got to see this boy for what he is

98
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,940
You've got to see this boy for what he is

99
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,160
He's a maniac out to rule the world

100
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,520
What can I do to make you understand him?

101
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,500
I love you

102
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,160
I love you

103
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,900
Bob Bob Bob

104
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,920
Bob loves you

105
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,340
The rewards are worth the effort

106
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,980
Oh yes dear friends the harvest

107
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,500
The Harvest

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,160
The Harvest

109
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,720
The Harvest

110
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,720
But you see if you do have some questions here you can still call

111
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,940
And speak to an actual human being who might answer your questions

112
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:28,940


113
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,140
And speak to an actual human being who might answer your questions in a linear way

114
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,880
Call the station

115
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,920
Or speak to the Will O Dobbs

116
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,680
And he'll give you information on where to get more information

117
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,060
And help you find out whether you can actually handle that information or not

118
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,020
Which is all another question altogether

119
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,760
You see

120
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,880
The keys to instant success

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,180
The keys to instant success

122
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,220
Mystic knowledge and miraculous adventures

123
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,340
Even contact with the Space Brothers

124
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,720
Even contact with the Space Brothers

125
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
Within your grasp

126
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,380
Simply by tuning in

127
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,800
To this show

128
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,900
Every Sunday night at 9

129
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,720
Do you have different tastes?

130
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,040
Intrigued by the bizarre?

131
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,140
Intrigued by the bizarre?

132
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,440
The kooky? The kinky?

133
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,340
As long as it keeps its distance

134
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,920
As long as it keeps its distance

135
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,080
Do you enjoy getting unsolicited

136
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,260
But unspeakably weird

137
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,700
But unspeakably weird things in the mail

138
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,480
For free?

139
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,120
Love to snicker in superiority

140
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,140
Perhaps largely imagined

141
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,820
At the incredible gullibility

142
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,220
At the incredible gullibility of those around you

143
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,480
Enjoy reading the headlines

144
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,540
On sleazy tabloids

145
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,880
And ads for local psychic fortune tellers

146
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,040
And ads for local psychic fortune tellers

147
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,520
Do you, my friend

148
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,120
Appreciate the unexpected

149
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,240
Glimpses of strange

150
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,920
Realities

151
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,220
Behind religions

152
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,000
Other than your own

153
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,580
Entranced by the

154
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,800
Thought processes of the mentally

155
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,200
Ill?

156
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,460
And bored to tears by any music

157
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,500
Video or literature that isn't almost

158
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,640
Shockingly original?

159
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,220
Are you painfully aware dear friend

160
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,400
That all great geniuses

161
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,380
And inventors of the past

162
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,040
Appeared totally insane

163
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,320
To everyone around them?

164
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,960
Then have we got a religion

165
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,560
For you, my friend

166
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,000
Actually that was the introduction

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,840
From the religion's second book

168
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,980
High Weirdness by Mail

169
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,160
No, let's not get technical

170
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,500
High Weirdness by Mail

171
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:34,500


172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,560
Superior mutants

173
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,020
Repent, quit your job

174
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,500
Slack off

175
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,320
The world ends tomorrow

176
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,900
And you may die

177
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,720
And you may die

178
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,340
And you may die

179
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,240
Well no, probably not

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,280
But whatever you do, just keep listening

181
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,940
The end times is here

182
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,820
At last the step by step process is revealed

183
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,940
This is it, the only thing that's left is to die

184
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,720
And that's the fate that promises

185
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,020
Action, thrill, success in sex

186
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,940
And business

187
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,760
Having all the guilt

188
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,900
But none of the sex

189
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,640
I did not put you here to suffer

190
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,700
No, I did not put you here to whine

191
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,300
I did not put you here to suffer

192
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,300


193
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,560
I put you here to love one another

194
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,060
I put you here to love one another

195
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,480
Yes, let me be that man

196
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,340
But for the time now, now, now

197
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,480
Let my people go, go, go

198
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,980
Yeah, you gotta let my people go, go, go

199
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,600
You gotta, oh, you gotta

200
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,640
Let my people go

201
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,560
Go, go, you gotta

202
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,700
Let my people go, go, go

203
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,760
Are they destroyed?

204
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,860
When you use insects to pass as Tyke-a-Bob

205
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,260
When you walk in through the woods

206
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,380
When you make out with the girls

207
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,900
When you feed up to the hounds

208
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,940
Tyke-a-Bob

209
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,000
Tyke-a-Bob

210
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,620
That's right, it's by Onan

211
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,700
Onan Kennebite

212
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,540
Friends call it

213
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,620
When I roll from the seers

214
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:10,920
These two

215
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:10,980
Onan Kennebite

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If you have any questions

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,600
Are we controlled by secret forces?

218
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,500
Yes!

219
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,000
You guys shall triumph!

220
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,580
I am completely agree

221
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,080
With all the obstacles

222
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,940
And with all the enemies

223
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,320
Who are between me

224
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,380
And what I want to do

225
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,780
I see that they cooperate

226
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,700
They are

227
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,980
They are in a providential mind

228
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,420
And they help me

229
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,560
To do exactly what

230
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,360
What I want

231
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,000
Because if I have not to fight

232
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,020
It is in the fighting

233
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,460
That I can see better

234
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,460
What I want to do

235
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,580
It is in the

236
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,840
In the friction

237
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,640
How do you say?

238
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,220
Friction

239
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,620
Friction

240
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,880
That thing become more clear

241
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,060
It become more clear

242
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,700
Just because

243
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,960
It runs the danger to be far

244
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
To go away from me

245
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,960
I want to see you in a better place than me

246
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,660
But we spread this mighty seed word

247
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,080
Of flak

248
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,920
And how to get it

249
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,000
How to fight the conspiracy

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,360
Through radio shows

251
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,420
In different cities

252
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,960
Through videotape

253
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Two books now

254
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,540
Are excuse scrolls

255
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,720
Suitable for framing

256
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,220
And live shows

257
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,020
I do a lot of science fiction conventions

258
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,420
And then there is Buck Naked

259
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,140
Reverend Buck Naked

260
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,780
Here in Dallas

261
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,560
He occasionally plays with his band

262
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,680
More Drunk Cowboys

263
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,180
Here and there

264
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,860
He preaches

265
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,740
Although he is a

266
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,860
As a true subgenius

267
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,040
He is a schismatic

268
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,660
And has formed his own splinter group

269
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,980
Which of course does

270
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,220
Intense battle with my personal splinter group

271
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,960
It always happens

272
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,220
Drunk in Budweiser

273
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,060
Watching five-ball TV

274
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,980
Drunk in Budweiser

275
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,880
It Bella

276
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,220
And Another

277
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,240
Battle

278
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,300
I can't resist

279
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,980
My passion

280
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,240
Will repeatedly

281
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
Embrace

282
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


283
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


284
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


285
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


286
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


287
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


288
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,360


289
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,380
People

290
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,880
We Christmas

291
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,480
Right Hoje

292
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,180
a truly well-rounded education,

293
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,600
you've got to study the extremists,

294
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,700
the obscure, and the so-called nutty.

295
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,360
You need the balance.

296
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,440
Your poor brain is being impregnated

297
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,460
with middle-of-the-road crap 24 hours a day,

298
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,980
no matter what.

299
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,340
Network, TV, newspapers, radio,

300
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,920
magazines at the supermarket.

301
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,720
Even if you never watch, read, listen, or leave your house,

302
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,160
even if you are deaf and blind,

303
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,500
the telepathic pressure alone

304
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,480
of the uncountable normals surrounding you

305
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,940
will ensure that you're automatically

306
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,860
well-grounded in consensus reality.

307
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,580
Screw consensus reality.

308
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,240
What we all need is more of that common-sense stuff.

309
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,520
Badly named, because it's not really

310
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,760
such a common commodity after all.

311
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,660
And our guru, the great mystic,

312
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,620
the saint of sales, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

313
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,900
often preached on this.

314
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,280
You know how dumb the average guy is,

315
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,140
he once asked his flock of apprentice sales ministers?

316
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,160
Well, by definition, half of them are even dumber than that.

317
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,640
Praise Bob.

318
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,700
Sad but true and getting worse each year, dear friends.

319
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,440
The kooks are our future.

320
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,640
So make no mistake,

321
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,540
it'll be a rich harvest for industrial skull farmers like us.

322
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,880
And those of every creed.

323
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,560
Because the brains of the all-too-willings are out there ripening,

324
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,580
ingesting a rich loam of made-for-TV UFO movies,

325
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,940
and absurd claims for holistic vitamins.

326
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,000
Radio preachers who converse with angels.

327
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,660
Millions of potential vegetables just waiting to be plucked,

328
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,540
shucked, and hauled off the market.

329
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,200
And if it ain't us that does it,

330
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,540
it's gonna be a lesser cult, or even worse,

331
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,860
some political group, dear friends.

332
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,500
So...

333
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,820
If you don't get it by now, you never will.

334
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,420
Like they say and say again.

335
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,260
I don't know what you're doing.

336
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,880
You wanna know what we're doing?

337
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,880
Sounds pink to me.

338
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,820
We've been talking about it for an hour and a half,

339
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,920
and if you haven't figured it out yet,

340
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,280
pal, you never will.

341
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,560
Well, I'm a Christian, and I think this is a sin.

342
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,640
I think this is a fake hate call.

343
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,580
Duh.

344
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,420
This is a fake hate call.

345
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,240
I wanna get some real hate calls.

346
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,580
This guy has a body.

347
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,420
We can't deal...

348
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,460
Listen, no friends out there.

349
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,920
We don't want fake hate calls.

350
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,100
We need the real thing.

351
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,480
I mean, it's just like in Dallas.

352
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,080
I mean, in the middle of the Bible Belt,

353
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,960
we've been doing this subgenius hour of Slack show

354
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,680
every Sunday night,

355
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,000
for almost a year,

356
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,060
and no one's killed us yet.

357
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,320
Well, did the Reverend ever explain to you

358
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
what subgenius meant?

359
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,500
Uh...

360
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,960
Was there a connotation to concern?

361
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,680
No, we didn't get into that today.

362
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,900
I was just wondering.

363
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,620
You know, I just kind of always took it on its face value.

364
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,860
Uh-huh.

365
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,800
Well, if you joined it, you would be subgenius, wouldn't you?

366
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,920
I believe so.

367
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,640
What is he going to be when he wakes up and starts breathing?

368
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

369
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,360
I'll tell you what.

370
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,140
I'm not going to turn my radio on Friday morning no more,

371
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,040
because I thought the little imbibing I'd done last night would pass,

372
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,660
but I ran it back into a nightmare when the radio came on.

373
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,660
Stuff happens.

374
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

375
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,280
Thank you, Kelly.

376
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,880
Thanks very much for calling, Norman.

377
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,540
How are you, sir?

378
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,360
Yeah, I'm sorry I missed Reverend Stang a while ago.

379
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,960
Uh, he mentioned a Reverend Bucknaked.

380
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,580
Mm-hmm.

381
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,160
Yeah.

382
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,840
I think I knew him years back when he played in a band.

383
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,820
I believe that Reverend Naked does still play in a band.

384
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,060
Yeah.

385
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Does he play the organ?

386
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,040
I don't know.

387
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,600
Yeah.

388
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, this Bucknaked I knew could finger an organ better than anybody I ever saw.

389
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,420
That's about enough on that one, John.

390
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,380
Ha ha ha ha.

391
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,080
Hi, Kevin.

392
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,680
How are you doing?

393
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,060
Fine.

394
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,520
How are you?

395
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,360
Good, good.

396
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,660
I've never called before, but, uh...

397
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,940
Well, we're glad you could call today.

398
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,620
Well, thank you.

399
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,280
I do listen all the time.

400
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,660
I wanted to say something about that, uh, subgenius thing.

401
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,620
Mm-hmm.

402
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,160
I had seen a piece of paper, uh, that was printed by them about six or seven years ago.

403
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,720
Mm-hmm.

404
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,000
And a friend of mine brought it over and said, look at this.

405
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,160
And we looked at it, and it was, it was the scariest thing I ever saw.

406
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,500
Um, I just wanted the, the listeners to, to, to hear this experience that I had gone through.

407
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,480
Anyway, I read it, and what it was was it looked like gibberish on the surface.

408
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:28,600
Uh, I don't know if you can hear it.

409
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:28,600


410
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:28,600


411
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:28,600


412
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:28,600


413
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:28,600


414
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,500
I don't know if you can hear it.

415
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,680
It was just, it was just a lot of weird lettering and, and words, you know, that didn't make

416
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,840
any real sense.

417
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,980
And, uh...

418
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,440
Until?

419
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,560
What?

420
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,500
Until?

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,240
Until I, I read through it, and it just, it was, it was like possessed or something.

422
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,120
It was scary.

423
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,640
It really scared me.

424
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,800
There was, uh, bad words in there and there was...

425
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,040
No.

426
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,920
...messy stuff.

427
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,240
I mean, not, not like full bad words, but like just, just really, really scary stuff.

428
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,580
Yeah.

429
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:58,580


430
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:58,580


431
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,700
And, uh, while you were reading it, did demons with fingernails begin clawing at your flesh?

432
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,340
Well, I, I know one thing.

433
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,880
I know they didn't claw at my flesh.

434
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,900
But, but it...

435
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,300
It's too bad.

436
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,420
...had me to the point to where, where I, you know, decided I better not read anymore.

437
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,220
And, and it was a question of, uh, I'm, I'm not a, you know, a religious fanatic or anything

438
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,960
by, by far, but I could tell that there, that there was definitely not wholesome stuff in

439
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,120
there.

440
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,280
And, and I just thought it was really, it, it made such an impression on me.

441
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,560
Uh, so, like I said, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it

442
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,940
was, it was, it was like a seven, seven years ago I read this thing.

443
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,800
And it was just, it was done very professionally, you know, printed and everything.

444
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,020
It wasn't just, you know, scribbling.

445
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,000
But it wasn't wholesome?

446
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:37,800
No.

447
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,600
It was, uh...

448
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,120
My word.

449
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,360
I would say it was just really, really weird.

450
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,060
Weird and not wholesome.

451
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:45,940
Yeah.

452
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,400
Yeah.

453
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,000
Uh...

454
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,740
Boy, I'm suprised they allow that kind of stuff to be printed.

455
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,240
Well, no.

456
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,220
You see, it wasn't anything you could just, you know, say, oh there is, uh, there is bad,

457
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,060
you know, bad...

458
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,800
Bad words, yeah.

459
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,040
...words being written.

460
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,340
Yeah.

461
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,540
It wasn't anything, you know, you could just say, oh there is, uh, there is bad, you

462
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,380
It was more like, it was like speaking in tongues, except it was evil.

463
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,940
If you could imagine something like that.

464
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,480
Oh, I think I could.

465
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,000
And we thank you for alerting us to it, Jeff.

466
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:26,820
Well, you know, evil is as evil does or something like that, I suppose.

467
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:35,220
I wish that I could play the entirety of the tapes that these little interviews come off of.

468
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,240
They're usually very old interviews.

469
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,940
I'd love to play the whole thing, but they're from other stations.

470
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,980
Hey, let's do something new, you know?

471
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,040
Speaking of which, there are some new things here I need to cover.

472
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,440
See, the subgenius mentality does not have to call itself subgenius.

473
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,800
You'll be saved from damnation.

474
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,620
Damnation, if you do call yourself a subgenius.

475
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,920
And especially if you're carrying the right membership cards in your pocket.

476
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,480
You can write for information about that.

477
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,480
We'll give the number at the end of the broadcast at 10 o'clock.

478
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,420
But in the meantime, there are, like I say, other ways to do the same thing that a subgenius does,

479
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,660
which is to get slack.

480
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,980
And this weekend, the lead singer of the Swingin' Aeriodites,

481
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,440
who I've played many times before in their older incarnations on the show,

482
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:40,280
the lead singer Johnny Angel, a friend of Brother Cleve Duncan's, who you all know so well,

483
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,780
he sent me their album.

484
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,560
In fact, he sent me several copies of it.

485
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:54,440
And yes, the Swingin' Aeriodites have finally made it to vinyl, or whatever it is they record on nowadays.

486
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,060
Disc, film, you know.

487
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,220
Mm-hmm.

488
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,640
I think this is analog, not digital.

489
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,420
But I'm going to play just a few bits and pieces off of it.

490
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:18,100
This one right here is probably a good one to dedicate to the worried caller who called that normal talk show,

491
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,820
saying that the nonsensical subgenius stuff he had read seemed so evil.

492
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,280
You know, to others, to some.

493
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,400
It seems neither nonsensical nor exactly evil.

494
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,260
Everybody's heading west

495
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,020
Where they hear the serpent's best

496
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,300
We'll meet a former musketeer

497
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,280
And get the hell away from here

498
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,960
Oh

499
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,460
Oh

500
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,400
Oh

501
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,580
Oh

502
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:50,800
Oh

503
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,500
Oh

504
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:51,820
Oh

505
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:51,820


506
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:51,880
Oh

507
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,400
Oh

508
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,400


509
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,780
Oh

510
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:52,780


511
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh

512
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,000


513
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,000


514
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,160
Oh

515
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


516
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


517
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


518
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


519
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


520
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


521
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


522
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


523
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


524
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


525
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


526
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,160


527
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,160
We must have fleeked the park this time once too often

528
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Frankie and the Nugget, Pete, Jim and Terry

529
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,680
And the Reverend Jerry Falwell put the last nail in the coffin

530
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,600
Frankie and the Nugget, Pete, Jim and Terry

531
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,560
We're going out west to the Golden Coast

532
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,800
I hear the preaching is peachy and the Lord is most

533
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,620
Now that we ain't got no home

534
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,240
It's praise the Lord and pass the copper tone

535
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,800
Go to where it never first came from

536
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,820
And wind it no crbanking

537
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,200
What?

538
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,320
What?

539
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,780
What's stopping us?

540
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:52,780


541
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,420
We're going to the

542
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,700
earth

543
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,400
And burn our casa

544
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,940
survival

545
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,460
we got the

546
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,100
hoedads and

547
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,880
wahineys and

548
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,680
we had a big

549
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,160
revival

550
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,820
they claim a

551
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,560
rolling stone

552
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,760
shall gather

553
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,440
no moss

554
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,420
we'll build a

555
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:09,840
bitchin'

556
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,360
woody from

moved to

594
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:14,940
Kansas

595
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,720
we coulda

596
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,100
moved to

597
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,640
Texas

598
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,520
Frankie and

599
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:17,980
Annette

600
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,760
meet Jim

601
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,560
and Tammy

605
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,220
likes both

606
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,020
sexes

607
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,720
Frankie and

608
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,860
I would have moved to New York City, but boy, oh boy, there's two Jews for every car.

609
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,600
Two Jews for every car.

610
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,060
I really wish to hell I was the Holy Father.

611
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:49,400
I wouldn't need a surfboard, I could walk on water.

612
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,320
Frankie and Annette meet Jim and Tammy.

613
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,640
David Lee Roth hears Hagar Sammy.

614
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,180
Oh.

615
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,600
And hang town.

616
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,360
Oh, yes, indeedy.

617
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:45,440
Well, we've certainly had some interesting calls tonight, since we've switched frequencies with KCBI, you see.

618
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,380
This used to be KNON, the station for open mic.

619
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,460
Blinded weirdos and rednecks and minorities of all kinds.

620
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,440
Anybody not totally into the mainstream and anybody into the mainstream.

621
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:06,340
Whereas KCBI was somewhat more narrow readership or listenership.

622
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:13,000
So half of the calls have been saying, hey, KNON, where are you on the dial?

623
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,340
And if you're hearing me, you already know.

624
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,060
And if not, then what's the point in trying to tell you?

625
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,000
We're a little bit to the left.

626
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:29,340
And the other half of the callers have called expecting to hear KCBI, which used to occupy this airspace.

627
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:39,640
And, well, for those of you wishing that you were hearing your good old KCBI Christian station that you're used to,

628
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,940
you are the lucky ones.

629
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,780
You are really lucky because you are now finally by accident being delivered from the false religion.

630
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:56,040
The biggest trick the devil ever pulled on you to the church of the subgenius.

631
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,500
The biggest trick ever pulled on the devil.

632
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,420
Let's see.

633
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,660
He and the devil thinks I'm kidding right now.

634
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,620
Don't you, Satan?

635
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,640
Oh, yes, yes.

636
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,600
It's a study in opposites, dear friends.

637
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,060
But at the same time, I mean, we're on the side of right.

638
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:19,660
And good.

639
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:29,800
The only difference between us and what you may have used to be listening to is that it doesn't really matter to us how much money you make.

640
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,060
See?

641
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,480
Or what religion you are, what color you are, what sex you are.

642
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,320
To us.

643
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,480
Now, I'm not speaking for Kano.

644
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,540
And it's not solid church of the subgenius.

645
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:44,780
We are.

646
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,740
We only do this one hour a week.

647
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,140
That's all.

648
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,300
The.

649
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,320
Slack you're going to get for a week in this form.

650
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,220
However, stay tuned for further slack of many different kinds.

651
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,880
This is a station that has it has gospel in the morning.

652
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,880
Hispanic music during a chunk of the day.

653
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,020
Soul and hip hop rap stuff.

654
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,280
Another chunk of the day.

655
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,340
Country redneck.

656
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,060
Good old Texas stuff.

657
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,500
And then the weird punk late on into the night.

658
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,380
Plus special days of talking.

659
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,000
Talk shows and.

660
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,340
And alternate news that you may not quite get the uncensored versions of another station.

661
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:26,740
So.

662
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,460
Yeah.

663
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,820
Yeah.

664
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,940
Why don't you use those of you who've never who have stumbled upon us upon our new frequency.

665
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,740
Please just keep listening.

666
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,120
Don't judge the whole station by this show.

667
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,580
How could any other show keep up with this?

668
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,720
They don't all have Bob.

669
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,960
Some of them just have records.

670
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,020
What you just heard a little while ago.

671
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,620
Was the swinging area.

672
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,000
Dice version of Frankie and Annette meet Jim and Tammy.

673
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,900
We're going to play some more swinging area.

674
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,400
Dice.

675
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,060
It's nice to reach out.

676
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,380
It's nice for a change not to be preaching to the saved.

677
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:18,120
That is the downfall of everybody from the early Christians to the new age fakers to the modern day Christian fakers.

678
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,660
Two.

679
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,600
In fact.

680
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,680
The subgenius fakers preaching to the saved.

681
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,780
I hope that you all you that you all who do who cannot figure out what's going on.

682
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:36,100
Keep listening and become ever more confused until the fear and puzzlement builds up in your mind to the point where you can't quit talking about it.

683
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,080
And those of you who work with you in your office and think you're a religious fanatic.

684
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,140
They'll think it sounds like a pretty interesting idea and probably ended up contributing money either to the station or.

685
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,780
Some.

686
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,940
Other agent there.

687
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,900
Oh you see.

688
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,620
You tried everything.

689
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,800
You ain't seen nothing yet.

690
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,640
Learn to think big.

691
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,920
Develop the tricks of length extension.

692
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,160
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

693
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,500
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

694
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,280
Get some.

695
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,280
And for game.

696
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,740
Everything.

697
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,180
The student of Dobbs training is practically forced to bring his strangest desires into rampaging life.

698
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,180
I used to get embarrassed about my glass madness.

699
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,080
Now I get paid.

700
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,140
The pinks pay me fabulous sums of money for what they used to put me in jail for.

701
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,020
Thanks to Bob.

702
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,880
You've got the double.

703
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,160
Who does?

704
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,260
I'm hurting more and more.

705
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,880
On the toucher, dude.

706
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:12,880


707
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:12,880


708
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:12,880


709
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:12,880


710
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:12,880


711
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:12,880


712
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:12,880


713
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:12,880


714
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:12,880


715
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,060
It's a good deal.

716
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,280
We're behind even.

717
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,440
Wasn't lean at all about speed specialist?

718
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,000
I am basta there good with cash.

719
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,880
really wants to know.

720
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,180
Smell like pudding and it ain't on fire.

721
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,160
Same thing that you know you have to buy.

722
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,060
What that smell like fish?

723
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,840
Good if you really want to know.

724
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,640
I mean, good if you really want to know.

725
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:33,820
Yeah.

726
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,960
Dobbs has seen to it that he exercises this abnormality.

727
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,980
To do otherwise, he teaches, would be nothing short of spiritual suicide.

728
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,820
Man is a way of life to millions.

729
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,320
Yet half of them don't even know.

730
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:14,040
He's the one true living slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

731
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,000
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

732
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,140
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

733
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,920
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

734
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,880
Become physically attractive overnight.

735
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,940
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

736
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,040
All the way.

737
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,400
Even though that wasn't actually...

738
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,880
Talk about the amusement park.

739
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,700
Oh, well, yes.

740
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,120
If we give, we'll never be able to raise the money for that amusement park now.

741
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,720
Amusement park?

742
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,780
What amusement park?

743
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,040
Oh, the subgenius amusement park in Oklahoma.

744
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,860
On the highway, across from the Stucky.

745
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,680
Near that big cement dinosaur.

746
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,720
They got out there?

747
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,040
Yes, there's a giant crude cement bob now with a cafe inside.

748
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,600
Talk about the nail slide.

749
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,020
They must have had some of the hot chili.

750
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,600
The nail slide.

751
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,000
Cafe.

752
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,660
Yes, and...

753
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,880
Listen to that reaction.

754
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,660
You know, the shower of razors and a lot of fun in the funhouse.

755
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,660
Of course, my favorite.

756
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,520
Of course, you know what a funhouse is.

757
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,480
The distorto chamber.

758
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,480
It seems there are some people who have been locked in there since 1944.

759
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,620
A six million year cycle will end in 1944.

760
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,380
1998.

761
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:40,660
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon, which, in a few years, will bring more wondrous and

762
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:46,540
miraculous change and carnage, insanity, and destruction than all of mankind's history

763
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,620
and prehistory before it.

764
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,420
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

765
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:59,120
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power for those

766
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,260
in the know.

767
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,860
While billions of deserving people will be left to die.

768
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:02,860


769
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,640
Plagued with populism, consequences, or even deaths as it'sン縱ked.

770
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,760
On the surface, incredible gibtards.

771
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,580
Trạn Cameron, star Jim Collins says that the recent

772
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:12,640
global disaster is yet another one.

773
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,520
...in his delusion.

774
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,360
Eternity will bebour Preparing for savauter Wack.

775
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,840
And ai-

776
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,840
We'r e gonna uhh Though, we're going to drop away from this...

777
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:32,840


778
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:32,840


779
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:32,840


780
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,000
from the dogma for a while.

781
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,180
That is an old classic

782
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,100
subgenius media barrage material,

783
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,740
by the way,

784
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,820
co-produced by myself,

785
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,720
Reverend Ivan Stang,

786
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,320
your host,

787
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,920
and Dr. Bleepo Abernathy,

788
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,440
and I believe Brother Cleve Duncan,

789
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,440
who was at one time

790
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,260
involved in the band.

791
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,220
We're going to continue playing

792
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,100
the Swinging Aeriodites.

793
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,380
This is the Paul McCartney Massacre.

794
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,400
You're going to love it.

795
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,320
This album is crammed with stuff.

796
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,180
A whole lot of it has,

797
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,520
each song has one or two words

798
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,560
that I, because of our dedication

799
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,800
to decency and morality,

800
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,880
and that this is a family show,

801
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,400
that we have to censor

802
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,120
some of those words.

803
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,640
This upcoming material,

804
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,600
I don't think I do,

805
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,820
this is from the Swinging Aeriodites,

806
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,480
and before I forget,

807
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,800
why don't I give you their address

808
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,700
so you can write for information

809
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,380
on procuring the amazing music

810
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,080
by these guys,

811
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,540
or tell your record store

812
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,180
to write them,

813
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,880
because they need,

814
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,420
all the support they can get

815
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,540
in this part of the country.

816
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,460
They're well known in New York,

817
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,160
L.A., Boston, and so forth,

818
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,820
but down here,

819
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,480
it takes a little longer,

820
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,640
and that's

821
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,740
Swinging Aeriodites

822
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,660
at P.O. Box

823
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,960
in Northampton, Massachusetts.

824
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:54,900
Yeah.

825
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,180
No.

826
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,600
And this is,

827
00:36:59,260 --> 00:36:59,560
I mean,

828
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,540
you can't,

829
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,040
this,

830
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,240
I'm sorry,

831
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,580
I'm sorry for what we're doing to music

832
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,540
in the name of the Aeriodites,

833
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:06,860
but,

834
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,340
but I'm glad,

835
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,500
I'm glad if it hurts you.

836
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,760
I'm so glad,

837
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,580
and those of you who it most hurt

838
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,000
should listen closest to the lyrics here.

839
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:18,880
Thank y'all.

840
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,660
Thank y'all.

841
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,960
You think that people would have had it up

842
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,600
before McCartney?

843
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,180
I look around me and I see

844
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,820
that this is so

845
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,560
Oh no.

846
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,480
It's Yoko.

847
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,960
Some people wanna rid the world

848
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,080
of Paul McCartney.

849
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,320
What's wrong with that?

850
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,020
We'd like to know.

851
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,140
So here we go.

852
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,040
Oh girl.

853
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,800
Yeah

854
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,180
Oh.

855
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


856
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


857
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


858
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


859
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


860
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


861
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


862
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


863
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


864
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


865
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


866
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


867
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


868
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


869
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


870
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


871
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


872
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


873
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


874
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


875
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


876
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


877
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


878
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


879
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


880
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


881
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


882
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


883
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


884
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


885
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


886
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


887
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


888
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


889
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


890
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


891
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


892
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:31,860


893
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,100
Yesterday

894
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:47,360
All my troubles seemed so far away

895
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:53,440
Now I need a place to hide away

896
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,040
I believe in yesterday

897
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,800
Suddenly there's a hand overshadowing me

898
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,800
Pretty rubble standing next to me

899
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,720
I believe in yesterday

900
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:17,940
Why she had to go

901
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,860
I don't know

902
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,840
She wouldn't say

903
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,880
I said

904
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,440
Something

905
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,340
Wrong

906
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,300
Now I long

907
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,500
For yesterday

908
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,280
Yesterday

909
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,760
Yesterday

910
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,820
Yesterday

911
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,920
Yesterday

912
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:58,420
Yesterday

913
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,420


914
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,980
Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away

915
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,860
Now I need a place just to hide away

916
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,540
I said something wrong

917
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,220
Now I look for yesterday

918
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,140
Oh yeah

919
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:28,940
Oh yeah

920
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,280
Yesterday

921
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,380
We were in the studio

922
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,640
Someone said play

923
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,340
Yesterday

924
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,340
It wasn't yesterday

925
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,480
It was rock lobster

926
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,320
Oh yeah

927
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh yeah

928
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,980
There goes Ringo

929
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,560
Yesterday

930
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,280
Because he's got so many rings

931
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,960
Yesterday

932
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,760
And here comes Linda

933
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,440
She's a dog with wings

934
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,940
Down

935
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,280
Down

936
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,080
I'm really down

937
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,220
Down

938
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:13,580
Wow

939
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,640
Picture yourself killing time in the studio

940
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,400
Trying to pad this line

941
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:28,760
I'm gonna make this record

942
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,000
Two LP size

943
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,600
Suddenly someone says you're out of money

944
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,860
Did I mention Van Allwhite's thighs

945
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,080
Yesterday

946
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,420
All my troubles seemed so far away

947
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,740
Now I need a place to hide away

948
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,580
Oh I figured

949
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,880
That yesterday

950
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,200
Oh yeah

951
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,440
Say hoje

952
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:22,820
Oh God

953
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,800
砸

954
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:25,820
Oh man

955
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Great

956
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:31,600
religious broadcast and then sounded like the most blasphemous, heretical, evil, satanic thing.

957
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,100
And then suddenly it's rock and roll. And suddenly it's, it's, uh, I mean,

958
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:44,320
imagine what they think. And I will, I will lower myself to clarifying a couple of things.

959
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:52,440
Number one, the church of the subgenius is not satanic. Uh, we do occasionally make minor

960
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,620
financial arrangements with lesser demonic entities. Uh, only our guru, Bob Dobbs,

961
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,860
makes deals with Satan, but he's not friends. And the only reason he does that is because Satan

962
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:09,540
owes both Bob and his buddy, the fighting Jesus, quite a bit of, uh, what you might call money.

963
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:17,820
Uh, souls actually is the commodity used. Uh, J.R. Bob Dobbs is an old drinking buddy of the

964
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:22,420
fighting Jesus. Uh, Bob has instructed us that, uh,

965
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,560
that, uh, most everything Jesus said was really cool considering this. It's a, it's a bit dated.

966
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:42,360
I mean, you know, but relax friends in your own delusions, pull the wool over your own eyes.

967
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,820
Place to hide and reach your confusion.

968
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,040
Faith makes you whole.

969
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,420
We will save you from the evil of Satan.

970
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,900
We will save you from the clutches of the conspiracy.

971
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,800
We will save you from the chains of time.

972
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,640
We will save you from the men in black.

973
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,160
Because every subgenius must have Slap Prey, Bob.

974
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:14,200
Yes. Dear friends, we are praising Bob real hard tonight and praise the fighting Jesus too.

975
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:20,400
What the heck? It's just the fan clubs of the fight Jesus that make us mad sometimes.

976
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,000
And, uh, see,

977
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,160
See, we're just not as forgiving.

978
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,180
You know, Bob isn't as well-connected as Jesus or any of the other G's I.

979
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,920
There's so many of them running around nowadays.

980
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,760
But there's only one true Bob, friends.

981
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,820
Let me hear you say it.

982
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,180


983
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,560
Hey, Bob.

984
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,000
Oh, hey, Bob.

985
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,840
Oh, hey, Bob.

986
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,600
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob,

987
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,940
will usher in a spiritual rebrand

988
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,360
from a cascade of astounding mysteries,

989
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,640
supernatural bridges,

990
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,440
and a restoration of lost psychic abilities

991
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:13,120
that will transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

992
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,220
That's right.

993
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,920
You're lucky to live in the end time.

994
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,660
Here's my money, Bob.

995
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,860
The mile is 666.

996
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,860
Anybody knows that?

997
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,420
Oh, but actually it's 999, friends.

998
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,140
Bob's number is 999.

999
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,020
He's not the Antichrist.

1000
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,240
He's not Christ either.

1001
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,280
He's more like the Anti-Antichrist.

1002
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,760
Whatever the heck that means, we just have to trust in Bob and have faith.

1003
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,860
Faith is what it's all about, just like with your other religions.

1004
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,500
Unquestioning faith.

1005
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:56,360
We don't need to know why or wherefore or where the proof came from.

1006
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,240
Bob said it.

1007
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,820
I believe it.

1008
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,160
That settles it.

1009
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,920
Remember the motto.

1010
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,840
Perform the salute.

1011
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,660
Yeah.

1012
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,560
I slack off and study the pamphlet.

1013
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,540
And you can get those pamphlets, friends, by writing for information.

1014
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,000
Free information from...

1015
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,560
Got that pencil ready?

1016
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,380
We'll try to give it again at the end.

1017
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,100
Bob, there's a pipe in the sky, friends.

1018
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,600
And you'll follow it anywhere, especially to P.O. Box.

1019
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,660
807 Glen Rose, Texas.

1020
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,520
76043.

1021
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,780
Subgenius.com.

1022
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,480
There is a pipe in the sky and it follows you everywhere, dear friend.

1023
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:07,820
Are you gonna be ready to dive into Bob's pipe like a pinch of his frock and rise on

1024
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:15,220
the smoke up to the escape saucers of the sex goddesses on X-Day 1998?

1025
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,900
Or are you gonna be left behind?

1026
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:24,600
Like the rest of the unbelievers, frying, frying in a hell of your own making.

1027
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,580
...for the time in the end.

1028
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:35,740
This randomness that finds all our colors in the air.

1029
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:42,540
But before I go any further, I do have to give a, um, a little bit of a, uh, well, actually,

1030
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,880
let's just, let's just, uh, calm down here for a second and put on some music.

1031
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,220
Let's put on some more, oh, what kind of pleasant music here.

1032
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,980
We Killed Elvis by the Epstein Brothers.

1033
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,200
That ought to be good background for this little announcement here.

1034
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,200
Ha.

1035
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,900
You are a slack fan, so love this one.

1036
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,960
It's doggy dip in garland time again.

1037
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,380
Yes, it's time again to begin dipping your dog and my dog too.

1038
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:16,180
Pesticide dips and baths for all dogs, uh, no cats please, to help get rid of a pesty,

1039
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,560
fleas, and ticks.

1040
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,600
Which can carry, uh, pretty serious, uh, diseases.

1041
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,160
Some of them designed by our own defense department.

1042
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,780
Uh, this happens, uh, these are like, uh, uh, special dip deals.

1043
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,320
Uh, I believe it's a free, free dog dips.

1044
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:41,420
And the reason why is, you know, you gotta get an early jump on those little, uh, arachnid-toid

1045
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,820
fleas and ticks.

1046
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,180
Ticks!

1047
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,340
Shoot those ticks down, man.

1048
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,500
They come in, let's, oh, oh, it's so fun to hear them pop.

1049
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,860
When you put the match head on them.

1050
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,040
But you understand.

1051
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,440
You know, it's hard to, it's hard to know sometimes where to take the show.

1052
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,420
It becomes so ugly and frightening, even for us.

1053
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:16,120
The challenge of trying to, to save the unsavable, to find the unfindable cassettes, sometimes

1054
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:21,620
drives us to use bits and pieces of actually, this whole show is composed of bits and pieces

1055
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,340
of other subgenius shows.

1056
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:30,340
Uh, however, the one I'm about to play is the probably most original of them all.

1057
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,760
KPFA, Berkley, uh, excerpts here from more than an hour, less than a show.

1058
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:45,180
Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence, Mobius Rex, Gary Grogfran, Lies, and Glass Madness sometimes.

1059
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,100
And even more.

1060
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,100
And even once in a while, me, me.

1061
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,400
All right, all right, we'll be quiet.

1062
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,480
Okay, everybody, keep it down.

1063
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,360
The show wife hates the show.

1064
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,280
There has to be a show wife hating the show.

1065
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,020
Full voice effect can't be, uh, yeah.

1066
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,740
Oh, there it goes.

1067
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,100
I'm gonna show show wife my show thing.

1068
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,980
Now who has unbuckled my buckling and unsnapped my shield?

1069
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,820
He's doing that buckly buckling for the engine.

1070
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he really likes that.

1071
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:19,320
Yeah, well, I like to get out my bullwhip and, uh, just remove that buckle if it's got a badge attached to it.

1072
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,440
Buck naked before Bob.

1073
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,660
What? Naked before who?

1074
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,480
I don't wanna be that. I don't wanna be that guy.

1075
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,920
The buck passeth not.

1076
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:31,380
Yes, it's possible someone was naked before Bob.

1077
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:31,920
The buck is Bob.

1078
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,080
Could be, you know, could have been.

1079
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,820
As a philosophical thing, could have been, I guess.

1080
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,420
Who is thing that you...

1081
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,320
And why is he allowed to talk twice as fast as me?

1082
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,720
I don't know.

1083
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,200
Because you had too much show error, Gary.

1084
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,420
And so did I.

1085
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,580
It sure felt good.

1086
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,400
How can you keep talking like that? I have noticed that you just...

1087
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,900
It's beautiful. It's like poetry.

1088
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,740
This? Yes. It's a constant.

1089
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,720
It's like an isosceles triangle stacked onto...

1090
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,640
Plank's number.

1091
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,300
Wow, that's pretty good.

1092
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:13,880
That's pretty scientific.

1093
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,200
Well, how do you kill it?

1094
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,620
Do you just, uh, like, plug it in?

1095
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,460
Or do you reduce its potentiometer level to the minus 18th power?

1096
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,820
Oh, it is still there. You just hand it over to Sid and he'll...

1097
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,660
You gotta be able to pull yourself together pretty soon.

1098
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,420
And now it's time for the show to be itself.

1099
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,660
You wish, buddy.

1100
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,300
How right he is.

1101
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,220
Go on, show. Let your hair down.

1102
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,960
Yeah, this show is self.

1103
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,560
Take your pants off. Shake your shoes out. Take it easy.

1104
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,980
Yeah, shake your booties.

1105
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,740
Yeah, lean back and just, uh, ride with the slack.

1106
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,740
Surf that bug plane.

1107
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,440
Climb onto the slack wagon.

1108
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,380
That magic surfboard of Bob.

1109
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,980
Oh, God, it's messy in here.

1110
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,180
God, my pants are getting all wet.

1111
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,440
I guess I just get too excited around the show or something.

1112
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,380
I don't know. Why are we doing this in an ice skating rink?

1113
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,160
This is terrible. It's cold in here. It's cold, yeah.

1114
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,940
These skates don't really fit.

1115
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,240
But it's got the best snack bar for miles of water.

1116
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:16,900
My feet hurt.

1117
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,280
I don't know if I want to be here anymore.

1118
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,560
Well, take those skates out of me. You've got them on upside down.

1119
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,960
Oh, that's why they hurt.

1120
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,160
When did we run up the show?

1121
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,620
Is it like... last time...

1122
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,320
What show? What?

1123
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,360
We didn't get to run up the show until half an hour after we finished.

1124
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,380
Oh, yeah.

1125
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,220
By then, it had gotten kind of stale. It wasn't as good anymore.

1126
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:37,800
I don't know how to explain that exactly.

1127
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,720
Well, friends, I don't know if I really want to, uh,

1128
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,700
to expose my audience as to what happens after the show is, uh,

1129
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,820
and what is actually done with the souls of the listeners afterwards,

1130
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,540
of which we collect here on the ends of the microphone in these special condensers.

1131
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,440
Actually, it's not the microphone.

1132
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,500
It's like a bounce back from your speakers that goes back to the transmitter

1133
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,080
and then is mailed to the church.

1134
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,680
Once again, at B.O. Box 14306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1135
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,160
And you can also get information about, um...

1136
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,480
Well, actually, actually,

1137
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,720
friends, it's almost time for us to go.

1138
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,760
I'm gonna play one more Swingin' Erudite song pretty quick here to get us out

1139
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,780
and sort of, uh, transfer the Slack awareness over to, uh,

1140
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,920
Robert Wisdom's show, American Music Party.

1141
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:29,440
I had meant originally to start on this show this new little...

1142
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,720
a department, a new department of the Hour of Slack,

1143
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,620
which we will start next week, reading from the, uh, book,

1144
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,700
High Weirdness by Mail, which tells you where to get the weirdest stuff,

1145
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,740
from the weirdest groups, uh, under the categories of weird science,

1146
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,220
UFO contactees, Jesus contactees,

1147
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,540
even weirder religions than our own or yours,

1148
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,880
uh, health and self-improvement scams,

1149
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,700
new age saps, cosmic hippie stuff,

1150
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,240
great catalogs, uh, and weird politics,

1151
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,720
funny clubs, weird art, comics,

1152
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,860
sleaze and rudeness,

1153
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,800
and of course, the cassette revolution in independent music,

1154
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,880
and so forth.

1155
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,840
We'll read like one selection per chapter or per show

1156
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,740
and tell you the addresses of where to write for free information

1157
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,540
from these amazingly either brilliant or completely insane people.

1158
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,560
Thank you so much for bearing with...

1159
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,940
the truth...

1160
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,660
and the fragments of it that hurt so bad.

1161
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,120
On the Hour of Slack.

1162
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,540
Thank you all.

1163
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,380
And this is the swinging area that's coming right...

1164
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,320
coming right...

1165
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,140
I met him at the candy store

1166
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,360
The first hit was free

1167
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,480
Yeah, we get the picture

1168
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:02,760
That's how I got hooked by the dealer of the crack

1169
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:11,180
He lit the pipe and what did I do?

1170
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,580
Do, do, do

1171
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,880
I talked to Jesus and all of his crew

1172
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,280
His motley crew

1173
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,300
Little then did I suspect

1174
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,580
In twenty minutes I'd be a wreck

1175
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,780
Thanks for the craving

1176
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,740
The dealer of the crack

1177
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,000
I saw all those corny ads on TV

1178
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,900
The blue tube

1179
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,660
But what did they mean to a nice girl like me?

1180
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,240
Not Jack

1181
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:59,100
My parents said take care of yourself

1182
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:03,940
But they're always wrong about everything else

1183
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:08,620
That's how I got hooked by the dealer of the crack

1184
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,700
They kept saying don't be pushed over and over, man

1185
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,760
Till I pushed my TV set out the window

1186
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,120
It just increases my paranoia, man

1187
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,140
Lookin' in my mirror and seein' a police car

1188
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,540
I mean, I'm gettin' better

1189
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,100
Thank you, David Crosby

1190
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,100
No charge, you...

1191
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:32,930
I felt so helpless, what could I do?

1192
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,570
Sell blood

1193
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:41,230
I pawned mom's purse and her wedding rings, too

1194
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,930
To the house of correction

1195
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:47,870
I could run a three minute mile

1196
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:52,230
Just to get my hands on that little brown vial

1197
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:57,030
You made me a track star, the dealer of the crack

1198
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:08,870
I saw all those corny ads on TV

1199
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:08,870


1200
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:14,550
But what did they mean to a nice girl like me?

1201
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:15,170
Not Jack

1202
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,010
My parents said take care of yourself

1203
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:17,350
But they're always wrong about everything else

1204
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,250
That's how I got hooked by the dealer of the crack

1205
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,390
They kept saying don't be pushed over and over again

1206
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:28,310
To the house of correction

1207
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,670
To the dealer of the crack

1208
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,270
Like, wow, like I met like the most awesome

1209
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,970
Celebrities here at this hospital, you know

1210
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,370
I'm a little campier

1211
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:44,630
Like I met Dee Dee Nicks and Richard Pryor

1212
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:47,450
And like Kimmy Baker, like she's really cool, you know

1213
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,710
And like she had me some really neat makeup

1214
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,470
And uh, Jerry Lee Lewis

1215
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,570
And like Boyer Zero, a lot of chicken goin' on there

1216
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:57,290
And uh, and Julie from the Love Boat

1217
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,310
And uh, she's not a perky anymore

1218
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,930
But like, other people are like really cool

1219
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:04,290
And like, now I feel like one of them, you know

1220
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,290
And like thanks to you, dealer of the crack

1221
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,570
Like, I'm a celebrity too

1222
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:22,550
And now the people of South Africa would like to thank Paul Simon for his efforts

1223
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:24,950
Okay boys and girls

1224
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,930
One, two, three, ah!

1225
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:31,950
Ohhhh

1226
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,050
Ohhhh

1227
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:39,270
Ohhhh

1228
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,570
Hello darkness, my old friend

1229
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,430
Ohhhh

1230
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,810
I've come to talk with you again

1231
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,090
Ohhhh

1232
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:52,490
Ohhhh

1233
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:58,490
Because a vision's a black ribbon

1234
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,610
Ohhhh

1235
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,090
Left in peace

1236
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:03,290
Ohhhh

1237
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,710
Ohhhh

1238
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:07,610
Ohhhh
