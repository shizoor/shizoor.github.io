00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
And now the subgenius hour of swag

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,940
Computer activate emergency medical holographic program

3
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,560
I believe your world wonders me

4
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,620
With your majestic

5
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,900
and superior

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,120
cackling hand

7
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,180
Your people I do not understand

8
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,360
So to you I shall put an end

9
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,500
And you

10
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,080
will never hear

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,440
surf music again

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,120
Sounds like a lie to me

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,640
Swaying

14
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,380
Oh, no.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,200
Swaying

16
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,420
Swaying

17
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,120
Swaying

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,440
Swaying

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,700
Swaying

20
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,020

Swaying

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,640
My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,080
that will outlaw Russia forever.

27
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,460
We begin bombing in five minutes.

28
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,120
The mission and rule program in this baby has really gone.

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,640
The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired and chemically corrupted by the fake

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,960
artificial food coloring.

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,640
We're the lucky ones, the handful with the chance to reach another world.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,520
And we'll use those guns, you'll use them, doctor, to keep your only chance to stay alive.

33
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,700
Somebody tell me.

34
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,620
Who are you?

35
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:29,620


36
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,120
Who is this guy?

43
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,620
Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place that ain't far from here, it's in outer space

44
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,900
Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place that ain't far from here, it's in outer space

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,580
That's a good chicken there.

46
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,500
So fast.

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:08,560
You say a toad over there.

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:08,560


49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,400
I found something my toad back then.

50
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,240
I'll throw it now.

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,240


52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,240


53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,240


54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,240


55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,000
I've only ever been hidden in that nether time I've got someROA positive, not negative.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Never mind.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,080
Love you!

58
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,200
Love you!

59
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,380
Oh.

60
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,720
Don't.

61
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,280
I put on the uniform to your little children.

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,320
I'm gonna kill that W argued toute, go in and get you exactly sent

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,400
off to work.

64
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,480
It'sはNO

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,620
I'd give you a Netherlands Islam for a full self

66
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,440
Amazing as it might seem to some of us

67
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,880
Musicians have basic physical needs

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,540
Just like real people

69
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,460
If I could just get my hands on a big, fat, juicy prairie squid

70
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,880
Oh, yeah!

71
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,340
Prairie squid, prairie squid

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,320
Prairie squid, prairie squid

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,340
Whenever you're a weird man, you're a dis-and-you-bullet

75
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,180
Connie is coming

76
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,780
Let's kiss, let's do it, yes

77
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,760
Pissed off Connie

78
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,420

A diva of debauchery, mistress of hot swivory

87
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,820

First of all, my wife, Frances.

173
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,680

Forgive me.

178
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,940
God could never give a man, a father, a minister of the gospel,

179
00:09:52,120 --> 00:10:00,900
a finer son than he has given me and his mother.

180

Donnie and Deppie.

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,620
And I have a perfect ending for them all of this.

194
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,560
I know that so many would ask, why?

195
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,320
Why?

196
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,020
Why?

197
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:58,980
I have asked myself that 10,000 times through 10,000 tears.

198
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,740
Why?

199
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,440
Why?

200
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,420
Why?

201
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,220
I call it sin.

202
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,640
I have sinned against you, my Lord.

203
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,400
And I would ask that your precious blood

204
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,260
would wash and cleanse every stain

205
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,860
until it is in the seas of God's forgetfulness

206
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,840
never to be remembered against me anymore.

Where do they all belong?

213
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,440
Look at this moron

214
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,080
Cutting me off on the freeway

215
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,560
Because he can't drive

216
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,940
He should not be alive

217
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,080
Here comes George Jr.

218
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,500
Constructing sentences badly

219
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,460
While he smirks and grins

220
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,060
Will he get in?

221
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,780
All the stupid people

00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,120

225
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,440
I look at all the stupid people

226
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,460
I look at all the stupid people

Down on her knees in an office

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,760
That's all she's got

230
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,680
She's got an oval in shape

231
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,440
They have her on tape

232
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
Limbaugh and Laura

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,440
Turning it into a radio moral crusade

234
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,120
They need to get laid

Your cue time is a week away

250
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:41,360
we just played was from an old subgenius CD called A Squid for Connie, I think.

251
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,940
And the one we just heard, All the Stupid People, was by Reverend Phineas Narco, who

252
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,860
has his own show on National Cynical Radio.

253
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,260
Praise Phineas!

254
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,600
You might want to check him, too.

255
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,280
Praise Phineas, indeed.

256
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,460
He actually has a very nice singing voice.

257
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,120
Yes, he does.

258
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,020
Before that, we had Jimmy Swaggart preaching business there.

259
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:17,280
The amazing confession of Jimmy Swaggart was from, it was a band called Panting Antics,

260
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,000
and that's all I know about them.

261
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:26,820
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, who is the voice on our titles, by the way, sent us that in

262
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,260
the 90s, and it's great.

263
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,460
Right.

264
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,060
The song Sister Connie, kind of a disco song, that was by Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket,

265
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:45,120
who aren't around as a band together anymore, although we ran into Saint Anne in Detroit,

266
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,160
the previous Detroit revival before the one that was last night that we missed.

267
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,920
There was a revival in Detroit, and I forgot about it because we were invited back in November,

268
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,140
and we thought for sure we were going to be out of town all this time.

269
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,180
So when it actually happened, I didn't get reminded until...

270
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,040
What's going on in the background here?

271
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,880
I'm listening to...

272
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,540
Oh, no, wrong.

273
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,380
That's because wrong...

274
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,920
That one.

275
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,940
Yeah, whenever Dave gets here, then we can...

276
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,780
We won't have to be doing two levels of credits at once, see?

277
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,120
...was the message from space by champion Jack Codini.

278
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,240
All of those sequences off of...

279
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,700
A squid for Connie.

280
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:40,120
Oh, well, the thing that didn't get mentioned in there was there was a collage by Chaz Smith,

281
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:52,260
VSO Radio, which was on WCSB for a thousand years until Reverend Dances with Rockets went

282
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,840
to dance on his escape vessel before the rest of us.

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,120
But that was a great collage.

284
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,660
It was a kind of rock and roll.

285
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,220
Hey, I'll tell you, talking about medical matters, right, you know,

286
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,360
I went to see me old mate Fat Larry in the hospital.

287
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,720
He's having his tonsils out.

288
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,360
Now, I had mine done about six months ago.

289
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,440
I remember I was having a lot of trouble, and my very, very handsome man friend, Dr. Simon,

290
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,900
you know, he's from Leicester's a shire, right, said I better let him operate.

291
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,320
Well, I submissively laid back while he came over me.

292
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:28,640
And after a few tentative probes and pokes, he whipped out me big swollen pear as soon as you could say Jack Robinson,

293
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,660
brought me instant relief, I can tell you.

294
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:36,240
Although, of course, he did leave me a little raw, and it was quite a while before I could swallow properly.

295
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,740
Well, anyway, I went to see Fat Lass.

296
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:44,680
I took him some chocolates, and for a gag, I hid them under my ankle-length black fur coat with the single vent at the rear.

297
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,400
Well, when I got there, Fat Lass looked at the bulge down below and turned him around,

298
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,280
prized open the slit at the back to get a good look at the old big box.

299
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Well, he greedily grabbed it and was just about to get stuck in when I remembered,

300
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,000
Oi!

301
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,580
Lass!

302
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,100
Kneel by mouth, our kid!

303
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,880
Oh, well, he was right, act off.

304
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,460
Said he was fed up, not getting what he wanted.

305
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,060
Said that very morning, the hospital cook had presented him with his lovely spotted dick,

306
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,020
and he hadn't been able to take that either.

307
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,860
Oh, blimey!

308
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,560
Well, I felt sorry for him, but I fancied the chocolates meself,

309
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,760
and fair play to Larry, he helped me push them all in me mouth.

310
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,940
And what a sight the very, very sexy ward sister friend found when she came in,

311
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,980
saw Fat Lass stuffing me between the cheeks, you know.

312
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,840
Well, I left him soon after, feeling very sorry for himself,

313
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,480
but I know it won't be too long before he'll be able to gobble away to his heart's content.

314
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,580
But, you know, I mean, you should look after yourself, shouldn't you?

315
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,400
Which is why me and my very, very sexy lady friend, Foxy Fiona, went to a health farm just the other week.

316
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,420
Well, we got there, we got to our bedroom with our luggage.

317
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,480
I was just about to unload my big bag in the corner when very sexy lady friend, Foxy Fiona,

318
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,000
asked me if I'd be, you know, rising early.

319
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,800
Well, when I told her I wanted to be up at six, her jaw dropped.

320
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,340
She said it might be a bit too hard for her, you know, getting up so early.

321
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,240
Still, she soon got used to it, and particularly enjoyed an early dip in the pool just before breakfast.

322
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,180
I'd recommend it too, you know, a quick length first thing in the morning, always puts a spring in your step.

323
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:26,100
Well, when it came to breakfast time, we were at it like rabbits, you know, scoffing away at all the lettuce and carrot salad.

324
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,160
I also enjoyed the celery that was available, but when I offered some to Foxy Fiona, she refused.

325
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:40,260
She said she didn't really fancy Goblin on a full store just then, but if I, you know, gave it to her later in the sauna, she might have a nibble.

326
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:48,800
Well, as we were on a strict vegan diet, we weren't allowed to eat any dairy produce, which personally, I found very difficult indeed.

327
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,760
And I've got to confess, I did try to smuggle some butter in, but unfortunately, would you adamant believe it, I got caught.

328
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:04,420
I mean, I only had a small knob, and was really surprised when the elf farm manager walked into my bedroom, grabbed hold of it, and tossed it out of the window.

329
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:12,380
Still, apart from that, we had an enjoyable time. It's anecdotal, really, but look after your health, and then you'll be in the mood for lovin'.

330
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,820
Mmmmmm, come over to the good doctor.

331
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,300
Mmmmmm.

332
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,380
That was the great Fat Harry White.

333
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,460
Yes, dear friends.

334
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,840
From England, merry old England, of course.

335
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,980
And, uh...

336
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,080
Mmmmmm.

337
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,480
This is Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

338
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,620
Yes, it is.

339
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,360
Oh, it is?

340
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,240
It's Dave!

341
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,900
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,980
Excuse me.

343
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
So, you made it.

344
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,840
You made it!

345
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,460
I made it. I made something. I don't know if I made it or not.

346
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,280
It's about three foot high.

347
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,080
It has green hair and sharp yellow teeth.

348
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,120
It's alive!

349
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,840
And, yes, more than alive, it's supra-alive.

350
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,040
It's got a huge beak.

351
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,320
It's a little, uh, banana-enclosed in the middle.

352
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,140
And, uh, little maraschino cherries under the eyeballs.

353
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,820
That reminds me of the creation of J.R. Bob Dobbs in the Church of the Subgenius late that night in Dr. Howell's laboratory.

354
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,340
Yes, and he still has the bolts in his neck to prove it.

355
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,320
Yep. Well, actually, they ran out of bolts, that's why they used the pipe in his neck.

356
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,880
Yes, I do remember the story.

357
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,020
So...

358
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,320
Which you've told so many times.

359
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,400
It's apocryphal, of course. We all know that it was the monster who created Dr. Howell.

360
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,480
Dr. Howell didn't create J.R. Bob Dobbs.

361
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,900
How would you do the stitching? How could you stitch...

362
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,120
You know, it's... He's invulnerable.

363
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,420
That's the worst word.

364
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,880
Unless he wants to be stitched.

365
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,800
Do you want to be stitched, my friend?

366
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,880
Not you. I was talking to the audience.

367
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,820
You know, the real people. Not us.

368
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,560
Do you, my listener friend, want to be stitched?

369
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,440
Maybe.

370
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,360
And go on...

371
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,180
Reverend Stein is such a stitch.

372
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,240
Eh...

373
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,060
Maybe.

374
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,560
I have these prune-shaped objects. I thought it was a hernia at first.

375
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,620
Are you sure you want to talk about this on the radio?

376
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,320
Well, it has to do with stitching, with good stitching, which is important.

377
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,500
Well, yeah, because they'll...

378
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:28,660
If they poke out of your gut sac, those intestine loops become herniated.

379
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,920
And that hurts.

380
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,460
Yeah.

381
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,460
And they become argumentative, too.

382
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:41,240
They want to, you know, pick up the fight for something or another, whether it's the return of Hong Kong to the Asiatic continent or...

383
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,380
That's right.

384
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,940
You know, Speelunker's ideas, you know.

385
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,160
Caves and boners and things.

386
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,500
Well, J.R. Bob Dobbs was...

387
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,740
was memoryless, you know, when he started out.

388
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,740
And so that was like a pure slate.

389
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,800
Much like what I thought I was about to say, which just went completely away.

390
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,580
Pablo Rosso.

391
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,300
Yeah.

392
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,240
Yeah, a blank... a blank slate.

393
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,900
Listener, go ahead and put your thoughts into our mouths, because we don't know what we're talking about.

394
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,580
Hell no.

395
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,980
You just imagine.

396
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,160
You can just turn the radio off and imagine what we're saying.

397
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,140
And you'll probably...

398
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,260
It'll probably be funnier, better, smarter, more informed.

399
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,040
We use a form of communication known as collateral meaning.

400
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,460
It's very similar to free association, except for it costs us dearly.

401
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:47,360
But basically, one word or two will suspend a number of ideas upon its axis and become a type of monogram sentence for the evening.

402
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,860
And then the meaning is created out of that.

403
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,060
Everybody thinks we're damn brilliant and stuff instead of what we really are.

404
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,040
Which is bad jugglers of bad words.

405
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,400
And bad thoughts.

406
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,300
Well, we can't do anything about the thoughts.

407
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,000
We could probably practice the juggling a little bit more, but...

408
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,640
Yeah, really.

409
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,400
I'd rather play video games these days.

410
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,520
And juggle words.

411
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,340
Yeah.

412
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,940
Well, I mean, after 40,000 years of it, you know, you get tired.

413
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,700
Me and Ramtha, my old buddy, it...

414
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:19,840
Yep.

415
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,860
Immortal caveman.

416
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,900
He got to speak through kind of an attractive blonde lady when he was channeling, but I have to channel through this shrimpy little old man with glasses.

417
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,980
You're not shrimpy.

418
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,000
Are you talking about yourself?

419
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm not channeling either.

420
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,440
I'm... I was kidding.

421
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,200
I don't know what caused me to think about Ramtha.

422
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,240
The... Do you know who that is?

423
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,160
Sounds like some sort of Egyptian deity, but I know it isn't.

424
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,460
It was...

425
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:49,920
No.

426
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:59,400
It's a new age lady who channels a 50,000 year old caveman, and she talks like this with kind of a gruff voice when she's doing it.

427
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,340
Oh, that's really funny.

428
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,260
Well, I'm sure to believe her.

429
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,880
She was huge.

430
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,040
She made a lot of money.

431
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:09,300
In fact, her foundation is behind that terrible movie, What the Bleep Do We Know?

432
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:09,780
Mm-hmm.

433
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,480
Which was a hodgepodge of aberrant superstition.

434
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,440
Yes, that movie was...

435
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,520
Well, wasn't Bleep Do We Know one of the subgenius?

436
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,860
Yeah, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

437
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,080
We know Bleepo.

438
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:33,200
He's the only professional recording engineer in the whole Church of the Subgenius, and we're depending on him to mix our...

439
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,420
Our...

440
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,780
Link.

441
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,040
Radio.

442
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,020
Yeah, our weak link of our radio play that was going to be a movie.

443
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,760
Remember that?

444
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,720
Mm-hmm.

445
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,580
So I've decided what I'm going to do...

446
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,180
And you've been waiting for us to do that, and instead we channel a 50,000 year old caveman.

447
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,540
Well, it worked better.

448
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,960
Pays and pays better.

449
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,900
What I was thinking I was going to do is...

450
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,760
I've heard that John Huston and Ed Wood both did this.

451
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,100
It's like the script's too long, so I'll just reach in and pull out 20 pages at random.

452
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,860
Then throw all the pages that are left up in the air and shuffle them, just use them, film it however they land.

453
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:16,420
Although I was going to throw in somebody else's script too, so that it's suitably subgeniously and not too pink.

454
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,980
And then we'll record...

455
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:26,380
We have to do a Kickstarter campaign to get everybody to give us a million dollars, and then we can all have plane tickets and go record it somewhere.

456
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,440
Oh, man, that would be great.

457
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:28,920
Right.

458
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,680
Well, the technique you're calling, you think that's what got you in trouble with the Florida State Police?

459
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,180
Well, and plus the fact that we'll probably all be dead before any of this happens.

460
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,420
Let's face it.

461
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,720
I'm not going to argue with you on this.

462
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,700
No, let's not argue.

463
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

464
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Nor am I going to slip silently into this.

465
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,400


466
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:54,200
I'm going to do the Land of Oak thing, or whatever Bill and Thomas said when he was having his cerebral concussions after drinking 24 pints of ale.

467
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,620
I can't imagine you slipping silently, or even sipping silently.

468
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,480
No.

469
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,640
The last time you sipped at my house, it was like...

470
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,260
Yeah, I've taken some guff here in this tiny little town where I'm...

471
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
You were slurping up that dark night.

472
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,920
There he is, there he goes.

473
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,540
You were slurping that dark night very unpeacefully, I must say.

474
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,440
In some cultures, it's considered a compliment, though.

475
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,300
Oh, yeah, yeah.

476
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,480
Belching and so forth.

477
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,660
Yeah, making loud noises while you slurp.

478
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,560
I was raging at the dying of the light.

479
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,380
Reverend Joel is here, by the way, from African Abstract and many other shows here.

480
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,180
Howdy, dowdy.

481
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,280
He must not have had anything better to do tonight.

482
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,780
Poor guy.

483
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,520
There's some superb owl thing happening, I think.

484
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,420
An owl thing?

485
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,720
Superb owl?

486
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,160
Is that a band or...

487
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,120
I guess so.

488
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,840
I don't know.

489
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,800
It's the reason Charleston didn't want to come in here.

490
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,760
And I had to sub for him.

491
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,180
I have a CD in the bag there called The Owls of Ohio.

492
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,160
But they're not really superb.

493
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,140
They're really just owls.

494
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,840
It's a lot of different...

495
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,380
They are literally recordings of owl calls.

496
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,500
Owls hooting, yeah.

497
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,060
We've already played them on the show.

498
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,460
All different kinds, from snowies to dwarf beetles.

499
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,280
These are just Ohioan owls.

500
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,960
Mm-hmm.

501
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,260
And you know, you get the sound...

502
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:25,740
You get the feeling from listening to the way they sound that they probably all voted for Kasich.

503
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,780
Who?

504
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,020
Yeah.

505
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:30,760
Freaking out.

506
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,280
Who?

507
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,160
Who?

508
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,340
Who?

509
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,200
Who's ruining the country?

510
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,600
Who's ruining the state?

511
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,360
No, no, no.

512
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,180
No.

513
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,380
Who's on first?

514
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,280
Yeah.

515
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,340
What?

516
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,360
What's on second?

517
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,960
An owl.

518
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,160
That's what's on second.

519
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,720
Okay.

520
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,260
Now we got it all figured out.

521
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,980
Who's on first and there's an owl on second?

522
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,940
And that's why everybody's been so confused.

523
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,780
Mm-hmm.

524
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,440
And there's a...

525
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,460
And I don't give a who.

526
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,160
All of it gave me a brain owie.

527
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,600
I guess he wanted to do a double play.

528
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,500
After they threw to first base, he said, who?

529
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,240
He was yelling to get first baseman.

530
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:05,860
So he says, who?

531
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,260
Who?

532
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,360
He wants him to throw him the ball.

533
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
It all gives me a brain owie.

534
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
All of it gives me a brain owie.

535
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,320


536
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,320


537
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,320


538
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,040
Yeah.

539
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,500
Gives me a smelly owie.

540
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,920
See, I have an olfactory packet packed, packed, packed deeply in my olfactory packet.

541
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:28,060
And when I feel fit and when I deem so, the smells come out just as quick as you go.

542
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,520
I say this, I say that, and it's accompanied by the cruelest smells you could imagine.

543
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:42,300
Well, it's interesting how most people use their noses to sense smells from the nose.

544
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,920
They're not outside, whereas your nose actually creates smells.

545
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,100
It's attuned to my pancreas.

546
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,140
Can you smell the scents that your nose creates?

547
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,920
Yes.

548
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,880
That skunk tail you have for a nose?

549
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:55,900
Yes.

550
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,020
Yes, I can.

551
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,120
It doesn't just do...

552
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,980
It's funny though, the skunk tail that Dave has for a nose doesn't just do bad smells.

553
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,560
It can do patchouli and different kinds of incense.

554
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,760
It multi-tasks.

555
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,840
It's very good at imitating Nag Champa incense.

556
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,300
Yeah.

557
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,620
Yes.

558
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:24,020
It can also do many tricks and signs like hyperbolic values, calculus, advanced supercuneus algebra,

559
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,740
and techniques therein that I learned back in the 11th century.

560
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,680
That's silly.

561
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,820
It's quite a little device.

562
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,620
But does Dave's nose do pleasant smells like violet and roast beef?

563
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,600
No, that's what I was just saying.

564
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,660
Oh.

565
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,780
Yeah, I don't know.

566
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,300
Dave, can you make your nose emit the smell of the nose?

567
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,340
The smell of roast beef?

568
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,220
Or like when you go by a Chinese restaurant and you're hungry?

569
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,040
Wow.

570
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,260
Yeah, that sounds weird.

571
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,460
That mic is a little crumbly.

572
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:51,780
Excuse me, Mike.

573
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,220
I thought the phone witches were attacking my house again.

574
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,600
No, they've attacked Reverend Joel's microphone.

575
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,700
That's what that sounded like too, so we are under psychic attack right now.

576
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,280
I liked it.

577
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,960
It was a little scary.

578
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,280
It was a little scary.

579
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,740
You went, it's Reverend .

580
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:21,620
It was kind of like, why don't you talk like that, real funny, wiggling your voice box.

581
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,540
You don't have to wiggle your voice box to do that, do you, Dave?

582
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,020
Your skunk tail nose just comes up and whips your Adam's apple.

583
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,960
Well, the mastic bones are also involved too.

584
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:41,840
I make the sound also with my mouth as well as with my Adam's apple, which is quite a fruit.

585
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,600
This show doesn't make any sense.

586
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,140
That is quite a fruit.

587
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,480
Your Adam's apple.

588
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,000
Hey, would you all like to hear Elvis Presley singing Sweet Home Alabama?

589
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,900
I was hoping for King Creole, but if you must.

590
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,620
I have it queued up.

591
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,060
I don't know that we'll play the whole thing, but I think it'd be worth just listening to.

592
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,620
Just a taste?

593
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,040
Just a wee taste?

594
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,960
Let's see what happens, wee taste.

595
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,900
It really is Sweet Home Alabama, goodbye.

596
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,660
And Elvis.

597
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,560
Big wheels keep on turning.

598
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,140
Get me home to my kin.

599
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,540
Singing songs about the Southland.

600
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,820
I'm with my family.

601
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:41,820


602
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,840
Once again.

603
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,200
And I think I should say, yeah.

604
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,140
I heard Mr. Young sing about her.

605
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,740
There's no need to put her down.

606
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,560
I hope Neil Young will remember.

607
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,240
Southern man don't need him around anyhow.

608
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,640
Okay, well, we don't need you, Elvis.

609
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,760
Yeah, really.

610
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,280
But that's okay.

611
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,580
No, that was, that's a guy in Ireland.

612
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,020
It's an Irish Elvis.

613
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:22,760
Oh, really?

614
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,280
Okay.

615
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,580
Yeah, we used to perform under the name The King.

616
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,080
You want to hear a funny story about that song?

617
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,660
Maybe on this mic.

618
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,680
Okay.

619
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:40,820
A funny story about that song is that I saw this movie called 20 Feet From Stardom.

620
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,160
And it was about these people that were like backup singers.

621
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,820
These girls that were backup singers for like all the famous songs from the 60s and 70s.

622
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:55,080
And this one girl, Mary Clayton, she was hired as a backup singer for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tyndall Sweet Home Alabama.

623
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,840
But she was so not in favor of that song that she did her own version of Southern Man,

624
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,960
which was like the Neil Young song that was kind of making fun of them.

625
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,780
So, isn't it interesting?

626
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,840
I probably know the older song better.

627
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,380
Yeah.

628
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:18,740
Well, these class and divisions, which are often accompanied with rule techniques and barking and strange noises,

629
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,120
we have to just disavow them and pretend like, well, not pretend like, but assume that our minds are being toyed with.

630
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,580
They are being toyed with.

631
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,740
That's a safe assumption in any case.

632
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:31,820
Yeah.

633
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,700
In any, on any radio station, in any show, somebody's mind is being toyed with.

634
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,280
Yes.

635
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,200
Being tinker toyed with.

636
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,640
The laws of rhetoric go back thousands of years.

637
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,360
Socrates and all of those were quite aware of how to make people jump and dribble as they choose.

638
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:01,540
Well, actually, I sort of sympathize with Lynyrd Skynyrd because I'm offended as a native Southerner

639
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:12,440
sort of on a daily basis because people tend to, well, Yankees tend to equate, they love to stereotype Southerners.

640
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,580
And that song is a reaction against that.

641
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,400
And I don't blame them.

642
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:23,200
Actually, when I heard that Southern Man song, part of me was going, yeah, right on.

643
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,160
But part of me was going, wait a minute.

644
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,500
We're not all in the Ku Klux Klan.

645
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,520
Isn't this a little bit like, you know, Ku Klux Klan in Russia?

646
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:31,520


647
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,480
Or is this some kind of a song in reverse or something?

648
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:40,140
We're not all wearing sheets down here in Southern downtown Cleveland.

649
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:54,060
But how did you feel about sort of the present weather situation, how Southerners have been insulted because they can't drive in like two inches of snow and they have to shut the whole town down?

650
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,380
Oh, that happens every year.

651
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,700
That's nothing new.

652
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,760
I used to be one of those people in Dallas.

653
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:11,880
Spinning end over end in my car at five miles an hour in a parking lot, gunning the motor because I didn't know how to drive on ice and I was panicked because there was this white stuff coming from the sky.

654
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,120
Now, they had special conditions in Atlanta.

655
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,880
Satan's dandruff.

656
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:26,900
Reverend Susie the floozy caused the whole place using her witchy powers, caused instant freezing everywhere just when everyone hit the road at once.

657
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,740
Didn't the mayor say, well, God, I'm going to go to the hospital.

658
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:29,740


659
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,680
The roads aren't safe.

660
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,500
So everyone get in your car and drive home now.

661
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,700
Schools are all out.

662
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,680
Hospitals are empty.

663
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,660
You know, go home.

664
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,200
Get the car.

665
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:51,140
It was like when the in Houston a year and a half ago or so, they thought they thought there was another tsunami or something, you know, big hurricane they thought might be on the way.

666
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,940
Oh, we better evacuate Houston.

667
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,420
There's only one way out of Houston.

668
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,880
And it was a parking lot for three days or something.

669
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,360
Mm hmm.

670
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,400
So, yes, it's hilarious when the bad weather hits the south.

671
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,400
Yeah, I agree.

672
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,820
As long as I'm not in it, which I was about a month ago.

673
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,440
That's why we're back here.

674
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,920
The weather was so much worse down there.

675
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,400
We decide to come back to zero degrees below zero in Cleveland.

676
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
And what a wise choice it was.

677
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:22,960
Yes.

678
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,940
A wily choice.

679
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,180
We thought it was a wise choice.

680
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,580
I'm going to turn this background music is warming.

681
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,700
It's healing.

682
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,120
It's a Mayan ruins is the name.

683
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,600
It's a local band, semi local somewhere around here.

684
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,840
They always hand me their new album at Starwood.

685
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,060
Mayan ruins.

686
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,920
It doesn't sound very Mayan.

687
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,380
It sounds kind of Middle Eastern.

688
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:48,880
Yeah.

689
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,140
Maybe a little Siberian on the side.

690
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,500
Somewhere out in the mountains.

691
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,680
Siberian.

692
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,560
Where the camel trains used to go until the camels got there.

693
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:10,820
And they got too cold and had to turn back and bring all their worldly possessions with them and face the monikers and the art works and all the other creatures that gathered together to wish them well.

694
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,120
But they couldn't make it to Grimm Cafe.

695
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:20,040
That whole trail is littered with dead camels all the way up to the top of Mount Rushmore.

696
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:26,540
In fact, you can walk from camelback to camelback upon these dead monsters.

697
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,540
Well, except that some of them are kind of soft and gooey.

698
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,480
They're kind of mushy at this point.

699
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:36,240
Yeah, but you can gain much more purchase on a soft, gooey animal than you can on a slippery rock.

700
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,240
Yeah, about the six weeks rotten stage you just punch through.

701
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,440
It's hard to get your foot out of that mess.

702
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:55,920
I don't want to turn the audience's stomach envisioning people walking across an endless series of islands of rotting dead camel humps just to get to the top of Mount Rushmore.

703
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,520
Because once they get there, Russell Means and Dennis, they're going to be dead.

704
00:38:59,520 --> 00:38:59,520


705
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,560
Dennis Banks and the American Indian Movement guys are just going to run you off.

706
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,400
They're still camped out on top of Teddy Roosevelt's head. Did you know that?

707
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,100
I was thinking about George Washington's nose.

708
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,700
I mean, not in this particular instance, but I've been thinking about it lately and I'd just like to bite it.

709
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,100
I wish I could go back in time and bite him right on the nose and pull his wig off.

710
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,880
Now, there was that Alfred Hitchcock movie, North by Northwest, that had a climactic chase on Mount Rushmore.

711
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,020
Whose nose did Gregory Peck end up hanging off of?

712
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,360
Jefferson's.

713
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:40,060
Oh, was that it? He was swinging by like a root that looked like a nose hair as the bad guys were closing in on him.

714
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,120
I forget how he got out of that fix.

715
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:48,980
Well, that was the root canal that we'd all been waiting for, that would bring us freedom and true Jeffersonian democracy.

716
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,500
That's what it's all about. No, I'm not, I'm sorry.

717
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,400
A root canal coming through the nose.

718
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,860
Now, that's really cool.

719
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,020
That's really new.

720
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,520
With little canal boats filled with goodies for the children and sleigh rides.

721
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,660
Ah, boy, that's the America I want to live in.

722
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,220
Yeah.

723
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:12,480
To get to certain parts, they have to go through other parts sometimes.

724
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,560
Like if you've got a kidney stone, I don't want to say where they have to go in through.

725
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,820
Well, I'll come right out and say it to you.

726
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,500
I think some people with a sadistic enough imagination can imagine it.

727
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:31,400
I passed out under that, I had a kidney stone and they did that thing that you were talking about to me.

728
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,860
And the guy said, this will pinch a little bit.

729
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,340
Sure. I passed out on the floor. They had to grab me.

730
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,420
Wow. That's pain. That's real pain. That makes you pass out? Oh, yeah.

731
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,680
It made me pass out. Plus the idea of that tube going even further than that. I mean, that made me pass out.

732
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,560
Okay, it was like a tube, tubular situation.

733
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,100
Yeah, tube within tube.

734
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,160
Not knives, right? Just tubes.

735
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:02,500
No, they didn't cut me up to do it. They just, we're going to go in there and make sure we already know you've got a kidney stone.

736
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Oh, man.

737
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,960
Speaking of kidney stones, you know that stuff they sell as Himalayan pink salt?

738
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,140
Yeah.

739
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,600
Are you familiar with that? I mean, it's a real product in stores. It's kind of expensive, fancy salt and it is pink.

740
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,220
I thought it was like Hawaiian pink.

741
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,660
It's imported by Sherpas.

742
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,740
Right. It comes from, it's not really salt.

743
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,680
Those are kidney stones of Yetis and that's why it's so expensive.

744
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,880
Oh, man.

745
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,580
And the Yetis are glad to get rid of them, but they're hard to, it's hard to get them, you know.

746
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,060
But man, the flavor that those impart is just out of this world.

747
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,160
It is very salty.

748
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,960
It is a culinary treat for those who have the eyes and ears to nose it.

749
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,120
But if you don't let them dissolve all the way, they'll be your kidney stone next.

750
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,360
Yep.

751
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:04,480
I'd warn everybody in the listless audience that if they wouldn't, that if they don't take care of their kidney stones on a regular basis, they'll have to endure.

752
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,600
Well, the Andean salt.

753
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,760
Feed your kidney stones, folks.

754
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,040
You know, you don't want them to shrivel up and just die.

755
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,180
You want to make them strong, healthy, big, covered with spikes.

756
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,000
I think the spikes form where they're kind of stuck down the little urethra tubes.

757
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,140
And crystals form and it pops in and out of there.

758
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,340
I don't know.

759
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,860
I've been lucky.

760
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,400
You know, I'm eager to have my kidney stone.

761
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

762
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,400
Man.

763
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,000
Ouch.

764
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,220
You know, we've been talking tonight of kidney stones and hernias.

765
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,780
But, you know, suffering can bring great wisdom to a person.

766
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,180
In fact, J.R. Bob Dobbs himself, and this is doctrinal in Book of the Subgenius.

767
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:58,080
He received his first emaculation while he was in the hospital after a hernia operation.

768
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,760
He was all doped up.

769
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,720
And that was actually his second emaculation, his second series of visions.

770
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,020
Well, I thought that's why he was in the hospital, because he was all doped up.

771
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:16,220
No, he was in the hospital for a hernia operation that he'd gotten from trying to carry a bathtub down his stairs.

772
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,800
A claw-footed bathtub.

773
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:18,800
Yeah.

774
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,860
It sounds funny.

775
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,280
But if you're in that position.

776
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,400
I admired Bob so much that I tried to imitate his.

777
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,720
I wanted to have visions, too, so I carried a bathtub down some stairs.

778
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,300
And sure enough, I got an inguinal hernia.

779
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,240
And it made, in the long run, the operations from all that made me a lot more like Adolf Hitler.

780
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,520
That's how that came to be.

781
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,400
Yeah.

782
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,240
Did they give you some good drugs, though?

783
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,500
And did you get some good visions?

784
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:49,960
Yeah, I did.

785
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,580
I did have.

786
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,800
Well, you know what?

787
00:43:51,880 --> 00:44:03,760
Believe it or not, while I was doped up on a hospital bed, I wrote all the little ads for the church and the subgenius that you get printed out on one page.

788
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,740
There's like a page of a million little ads for you to cut out.

789
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,600
I wrote all of that stuff while I was on some kind of painkillers.

790
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,000
I was only a little child then, trying to be like Bob.

791
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,540
How did I know what was going to happen?

792
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,500
So this explains some breakaway memories of...

793
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm standing against you.

794
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,260
Put down that bathtub.

795
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,280
Lay down your weary head.

796
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,460
Bob is gonna jump up and down on you and make you wish you was dead.

797
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,440
So put down that bathtub.

798
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,020
Put down that bathtub.

799
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,060
Sorry.

800
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,780
Put down that bathtub.

801
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,520
James, I wish you could remember the last time you had a bathtub.

802
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


803
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


804
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


805
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


806
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


807
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


808
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


809
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


810
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


811
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


812
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


813
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


814
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


815
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


816
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


817
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


818
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


819
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,400
I wish you could remember the words to all your other songs as well as you remembered the words to the one you just made up.

820
00:44:54,620 --> 00:45:01,640
Are you mocking a certain professor on the East Coast who's been using my songs as parts and downloading from your site?

821
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:02,680
What?

822
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:09,460
And I saw him recently and I tried to play some of them for him and I forgot the darned words to my songs.

823
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,480
What?

824
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:11,960
What?

825
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:19,180
There is a certain professor in a certain hippie college who is part of his...

826
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:26,780
I mean, part of the synopsis for this semester is protest songs from the Bush era.

827
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,160
And he wanted iodine...

828
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,040
I couldn't even remember iodine-131.

829
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,780
That's your hint, Dave.

830
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,520
That was the one that put you on the map.

831
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,480
Yeah, it's got four words too.

832
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,780
Iodine-131, iodine-131.

833
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,840
No, no, it has a whole bunch of chemical names in it.

834
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,260
Yeah.

835
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,220
Got my thyroid on the run.

836
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,240
Yeah, there's a lot of lyrics.

837
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,060
Krypton-85.

838
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,140
Krypton-85.

839
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,000
Yeah, making it hard just to stay alive.

840
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:51,680
Stay alive.

841
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,220
See, you know him better than me.

842
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,020
But the main one he was doing was...

843
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,040
Shake the bony hand of the poisoned man.

844
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,540
Shake the bony hand and shake it good.

845
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,960
I know all your songs by heart, Dave.

846
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,360
All seven of them.

847
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,620
That one had a lot of words.

848
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,240
Yeah.

849
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,580
Yeah, and they were all pertinent when Fukushima happened.

850
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,220
And, you know, they're perennial.

851
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,060
So was somebody using your song, The President's, on the phone?

852
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,800
Yes, that is a true truth.

853
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,140
And he is an actual doctor of something.

854
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,180
You know, it's a miracle that there's any kind of a recording of that at all.

855
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,500
I think that was recorded at the Beachland Ballroom.

856
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,820
It would be a Reverend Stang miracle if it was recorded.

857
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,000
Yeah.

858
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,700
Yeah, folks, if you are desperate to see a video of The President's on the phone, Dave's song,

859
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,560
I guess type The President's on the phone into a Google window.

860
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,680
I bet it'll come up.

861
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,580
I bet it will.

862
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,180
Do you have Iodine 131 somewhere, too?

863
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:57,840
No.

864
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,200
No, it's on the wall.

865
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,740
No, I didn't make a video of that.

866
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,520
But I did make a music video of The President's on the phone because we had so much great art that year.

867
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,360
2000, it was election year or something.

868
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,660
Oh, the war was going on.

869
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,000
All kinds of stuff was going on.

870
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,020
Yeah.

871
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,160
It was an exciting year.

872
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:16,400
Yeah.

873
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,180
We're all going to get back this year.

874
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,120
Yeah.

875
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,680
You can't have too many wars for too often.

876
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,300
It gets boring.

877
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,100
You can't keep them going forever and ever and ever and ever.

878
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,120
People lose interest.

879
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,500
Well, they switch to a different place.

880
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,140
Or sometimes you start rooting for the other side, whatever that might be.

881
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,060
I don't know if it's afterlife or something but.

882
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:41,220
Anyway, Dave did a great anti-war song called The President's on the phone that was most paranoid,

883
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,140
and the artwork that goes with it we threw in with the songs, it's great.

884
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:45,240
Right.

885
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,280
Yeah, and that was done by an actual, you know, an actual paranoid schizophrenic, not just a paranoid.

886
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,140
A bunch of paranoid schizophrenics.

887
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,480
Are you kidding?

888
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,540
A whole church of the subgenius pitched in on that project.

889
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,480
Yep.

890
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,680
And I was so gratified.

891
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,540
So many straitjackets were helping me toe the line.

892
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:06,560
Yeah.

893
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,900
It takes a lot of straitjackets to have a lonesome cowboy Dave rock and roll show.

894
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:11,800
That's for sure.

895
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,160
Yep.

896
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,080
Because most of the people want to leave and they have to be strapped down on their seats.

897
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:24,580
The name of your band was so un-PC that it sort of precluded any conspiracy release.

898
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,460
Mondo Retardo?

899
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,080
Retardo's Mondo Band.

900
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,220
Oh, was that it?

901
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:30,920
Yes.

902
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,080
It kind of changed every time, didn't it?

903
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,360
Yes.

904
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,380
Princess Wee was the main backup singer.

905
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,580
And I was the only groupie.

906
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,700
Backup singer?

907
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,600
Singer and go-go dancer.

908
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,480
Yeah.

909
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:53,260
And Bobby Mosk, Mosk, Mosk, Bob, Bob, original, not original, but Bob, Bob, was a telephone artist.

910
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,340
The real Bob.

911
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,360
Bob Mosk.

912
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,260
The real Bob.

913
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:56,820
Yeah.

914
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,880
And even Charles played the organ once in a while.

915
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,560
Yeah.

916
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,380
But I remember he wore a disguise so nobody would know it was him that last time.

917
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:05,640
Yeah.

918
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,800
He didn't want to be ashamed.

919
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,880
He was ashamed of us.

920
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,960
I'm not a real musician.

921
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,220
I just...

922
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,440
They laughed at Beethoven.

923
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,160
Yeah.

924
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,860
Because, you know, every time he couldn't hear very well and he...

925
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:25,460
Well, now, Dave, just because they laughed at Beethoven and they laugh at you doesn't

926
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,500
mean they're laughing at the same things.

927
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,400
They may have been laughing with Beethoven.

928
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,020
Oh, we did...

929
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,800
We went over this last week.

930
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,260
I'm sorry.

931
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,460
I don't mean to rub it in.

932
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,040
Well, was it the saddle sores or the...

933
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,560
No, well, the bag bomb and how they're laughing at you.

934
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,880
Not with you.

935
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,300
At the bag bomb?

936
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,520
But as Onan said...

937
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,480
What did Onan say?

938
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:55,840
Something like, I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than the wrong people laughing with me.

939
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,140
Than the left people laughing on you?

940
00:49:59,260 --> 00:49:59,680
What?

941
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,800
Well, I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than the wrong people laughing with me.

942
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,740
Which is a really elitist thing to say.

943
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,860
I remember people used to go, God, this church is so genius.

944
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,320
You guys seem really elitist.

945
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,840
It's like, duh, that's right.

946
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:20,100
And we're not better than you because we're smarter or more informed.

947
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,160
We're better just because.

948
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,780
And that's all.

949
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,620
Just because.

950
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,640
So there.

951
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,260
Because we're church subgeniuses.

952
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,020
Because we said so.

953
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,680
Because we got Bob and you don't.

954
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,940
So therefore, we can look down on you.

955
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,900
And we'll pray for you, though.

956
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,980
We'll charitably...

957
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,840
How many times have you had somebody go, I'll pray for you.

958
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,180
In the same tone of voice that somebody else would say, go to hell.

959
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,140
Yeah.

960
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,880
I'm going to pray for you.

961
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,560
I'm going to kill you.

962
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,300
Yeah.

963
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,020
God, I've gotten that one a bunch.

964
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:52,840
Not enough.

965
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:58,140
The look is what, you know, tells you when they say, I'll pray for you.

966
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,400
I mean, they grit their teeth a little bit and they smile.

967
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,340
It's like one of those, you know, SS smiles.

968
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:08,400
I've had the peace sign shot at me in an officious, violent way.

969
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:08,900
Yeah.

970
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,700
Rage peace.

971
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,500
Yeah.

972
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,220
Remember that?

973
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,400
That old, that lady who was blocking the bridge at Starwood.

974
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:21,220
We were in a big hurry to get to our presentation and she was waddling along deliberately in

975
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:21,940
the middle of the road.

976
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:27,580
And I actually gave a little polite beep on my horn and she turned around and shot the

977
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,700
peace sign at me.

978
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,560
Yes.

979
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,240
She did not make a peace sign.

980
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,660
She shot the peace sign.

981
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,960
She violently shot the peace sign at you.

982
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,660
And then we later found out...

983
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,140
Like, peace out, dude.

984
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,820
Her destination was the same.

985
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,880
She was in the same place.

986
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:44,880


987
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:44,880


988
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:44,880


989
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:44,880


990
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,360
She was going to have to walk into a room where we were the ones making the...

991
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,480
Well, it was our friend, the crop circle maker, making the presentation.

992
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,080
Yes.

993
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,400
He gave lessons on how to do crop circles.

994
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,240
British guy.

995
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,360
Reverend crop circle maker.

996
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,380
Yeah, circle maker.

997
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,900
We brought him in from England.

998
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,860
And he actually makes them himself.

999
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,140
I'm not familiar with him.

1000
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:04,420
Yeah.

1001
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,400
He and his friends.

1002
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,040
He's a...

1003
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,400
He's the only circle maker who came out.

1004
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,240
And the other circle makers don't like him because of that.

1005
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:22,060
But he goes around and goes, yes, it's really done by a bunch of artists on vitamin K, I think

1006
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:22,960
was what their favorite...

1007
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,680
Yes, they call it vitamin K.

1008
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,180
They have a lot of...

1009
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:30,100
And there's a methamphetamine problem in rural England, just like there is in rural America.

1010
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,560
And what do you do if you're in a town where there's nothing to do but make elaborate Celtic

1011
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,520
designs in the middle of rapeseed fields?

1012
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,140
Well...

1013
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,180
They prefer rape.

1014
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,080
That's a type of grain.

1015
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,880
Of an oil seed.

1016
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,520
A grain crop.

1017
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:56,240
Their rape is the preferred medium of circle makers and of aliens from outer space who

1018
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,220
also make crop circles.

1019
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:57,700
Of course.

1020
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,720
I don't want to pop anybody's...

1021
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,140
Yeah, don't...

1022
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:00,580
Yeah.

1023
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,700
Don't get the aliens mad, too.

1024
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,280
Who is better?

1025
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,700
Circle makers have technology for it.

1026
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,960
They don't understand our centurions and our snake critters and our...

1027
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,200
They don't understand our centurions and our snake critters and our...

1028
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,340
Different variant...

1029
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,780
You know, the variant orifices that we have.

1030
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,060
I mean, it takes a human being to come up with a really startling...

1031
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,860
I know a guy who made...

1032
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,240
He worked for years on a documentary about how crop circles are real.

1033
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,000
And then he got...

1034
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,320
He emailed me about something and I blurted out to him,

1035
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,380
Oh, I know a bunch of the guys that make those things.

1036
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,920
Boy, did he get upset.

1037
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,520
He suddenly was like...

1038
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,980
Trying to destroy the new age, Reverend Stang.

1039
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,960
It's like, well, we've always been doing that, duh.

1040
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,000
But, you know, and not that we have to do much.

1041
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:51,860
It kind of...

1042
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,620
Does itself.

1043
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,400
Yeah, yeah.

1044
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,260
Right.

1045
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,120
But if we could, we'd really do in the new age.

1046
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:02,540
We wouldn't just do it through illusion and other delightful noises.

1047
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,520
We'd go right in there and rip its throat out.

1048
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,300
No, I'll admit it's jealousy.

1049
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,340
It's because we're facing old age.

1050
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,080
We...

1051
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,920
We can't...

1052
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,060
We can't have any more new age.

1053
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,320
Not us.

1054
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,020
Until we get on our spaceships, on the escape vessels on X-Day.

1055
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,720
July 5th, 1998, which should be coming up any minute now.

1056
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,880
Yeah, but that'll only really be a nouvelle age, so to speak.

1057
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:36,180
That reminds me, I've got to put our PR stuff up about X-Day drill number 17.

1058
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,020
17?

1059
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,280
Yes, this will be the...

1060
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,060
Actually, it was...

1061
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,940
It will technically be the 19th...

1062
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:47,700
Well, it'll be the 17th time we've sincerely waited for the aliens to destroy the world.

1063
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,120
And there are babies...

1064
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,280
Except for us.

1065
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,220
But...

1066
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,420
There are babies who were born at the first...

1067
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,180
That's exactly right.

1068
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,500
There were.

1069
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,880
And they can drink now.

1070
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,280
And whose parents took them regularly.

1071
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:06,140
And now they're waiting in the wings for a fostering angel to remove them from this group.

1072
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,060
They're the ones who say to me,

1073
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,860
Oh, yeah.

1074
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,420
That Bob Dobbs stuff.

1075
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,280
My parents made me memorize that when I was a kid.

1076
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,100
I hate that.

1077
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,000
Yeah.

1078
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,720
It's like going to Catholic school.

1079
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,460
Yeah.

1080
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,560
I became a Catholic to get away from that Bob Dobbs stuff.

1081
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,780
I became an Orthodox Jew.

1082
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,900
That's so much easier than being a subgenius.

1083
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,320
I don't know these kids today.

1084
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,780
They just don't understand the sacrifice we had to make.

1085
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:36,760
Yeah, man.

1086
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,580
Sacrifices?

1087
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,340
Sacrifices?

1088
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:38,780
Sacrifices?

1089
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:38,960


1090
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:38,980


1091
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:39,280
Sacrifices?

1092
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:39,280


1093
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:39,500
Sacrifices?

1094
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:39,740
Sacrifices?

1095
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:39,940


1096
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:39,940


1097
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:39,940


1098
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:39,940


1099
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:39,940


1100
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:39,940


1101
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,940
For one thing.

1102
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,280
Yeah.

1103
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,240
Well, I didn't have to sacrifice any because I didn't pass the genius test to begin with.

1104
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:54,460
But I think what they had to do to Dr. Howell to make him qualify for subgenius church.

1105
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,360
Yeah, they had to remove a goodly three quarters of his brain.

1106
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,440
Yeah, and he's still smarter than everybody else.

1107
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,160
Yeah, much.

1108
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,560
Even after that three quarters was replaced with mushrooms.

1109
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,900
He could still out babble anybody.

1110
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:09,760
Yeah.

1111
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:09,880
Yeah.

1112
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1113
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1114
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1115
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1116
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1117
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1118
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1119
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1120
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1121
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1122
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1123
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1124
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:09,920


1125
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:14,780
Did you know that the three quarters of the inside of Dr. Howell Robbins' brain has been replaced by mushrooms?

1126
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,660
He told me so.

1127
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,460
Oh.

1128
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,080
With the remaining brain that he had left.

1129
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:25,040
Which is more than all the rest of us have put together.

1130
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,160
It must be why he's such a fun guy.

1131
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:27,780


1132
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,560
There's another ringtone for you, folks.

1133
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,460
Oh.

1134
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:42,920


1135
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,280
Sounds quite mad.

1136
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:44,900
Oh.

1137
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,040
Yes, the Princess Wee Chortle ringtone.

1138
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,660
We really should sell those.

1139
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,620
Oh, no.

1140
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,440
I'm baby blue.

1141
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,600
I just can't imagine what they done to you.

1142
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,480
Well, we're going to have to be getting out of here pretty soon.

1143
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,300
I should mention what this all is.

1144
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,620
The Hour of Slack is the name of the show.

1145
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,920
We're doing this from the beginning.

1146
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:09,920


1147
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:09,920


1148
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:09,920


1149
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,760
We're in the studios of WCSB Cleveland right now.

1150
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:18,380
But you may be hearing this later on some other station through time control.

1151
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,320
And, oh, subgenius.com.

1152
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:23,960
Yeah.

1153
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,860
Calm yourself.

1154
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,040
It's simply subgenius.com.

1155
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:29,960
Yeah.

1156
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,080
Calm and bomb.

1157
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:38,400
And again, this music in the background is from Mayan Ruin's CD called Temple of Ancient Dub.

1158
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,620
Yes.

1159
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,260
Yes, thank you, Christian Hartman.

1160
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,460
What a fine name for a subgenius.

1161
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,200
That's actually my son's name.

1162
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,320
Christian Hartman?

1163
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:50,960
Hartman?

1164
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,820
No, remove that part, but the first part.

1165
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,060
Christian.

1166
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,060
Dub orchestra?

1167
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,600
And he has a...

1168
00:57:59,140 --> 00:57:59,800
Temple of?

1169
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:00,960
Yeah.

1170
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:01,560
Mayan?

1171
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,480
Yeah.

1172
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,600
And urine, too.

1173
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,380
Ugh.

1174
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,440
Not only Mayan.

1175
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1176
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,300
But you're...

1177
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,280
Didn't you do that joke already?

1178
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:09,600
Yeah.

1179
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:09,600


1180
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:09,600


1181
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,000
Once today?

1182
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,820
Oh, we do it three times every time we do it.

1183
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,420
We're getting on in years, and we can't tell when we've already done one of these shows

1184
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,820
all the way through, word for word.

1185
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:21,720
Yeah, that's...

1186
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,880
You know, you tend to tell the same stories over and over again.

1187
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,380
Is that ancient Mayan or ancient urine?

1188
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,220
It's terrible.

1189
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,380
Well, what do you expect?

1190
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,520
I don't know.

1191
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:39,220
We've reached the end of our tether, and all we can do is bite and bark.

1192
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,900
You've reached the end of your candor?

1193
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:43,640
Tether.

1194
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,300
That's a short...

1195
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,140
A tether.

1196
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,800
Tether, and it is a short tether.

1197
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,160
I can be candorous as long as permitted, but I dare not.

1198
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:58,220
I might step on some big, fat, stinky feet, including my own.

1199
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,540
That's a good trick.

1200
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,660
Yeah, that's a good business for you.

1201
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,860
Because if you're going to step on your feet, you need an extra foot to step on both feet.

1202
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,340
You only have two.

1203
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,860
Okay, I'm going to fight everybody out because...

1204
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,960
It's a bleeding show over.

1205
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,960
I mean...

1206
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,540
Yeah, it's over.

1207
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1208
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,360
Aye, aye, aye, aye, and all that.

1209
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,100
...

1210
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,380
...

1211
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,080
...

1212
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:52,600
...

1213
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:52,800
...

1214
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,120
...

1215
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:53,860
...

1216
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:53,900
...

1217
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:55,600
...

1218
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,280
...

1219
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:56,980
...

1220
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,640
It's the voice of the mob howling for blood.

1221
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,120
Joe, perhaps the world is sick and I'm well.

1222
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,320
Who's on the big show tonight?

1223
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,280
Listen, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1224
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:06,920
Remember, Bob.

1225
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,020
Please, call me Bob.

1226
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,240
Please, call me Bob.

1227
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,820
Please, call me Bob.

1228
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,860
Please, call me Bob.

1229
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,040
Please, Bob.

1230
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,120
Please, Bob.

1231
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,780
Please, Bob.

1232
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,860
Please, Bob.

1233
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,980
Please, Bob.

1234
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,100
Please, Bob.

1235
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,460
He will not reveal his identity,

1236
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,720
so for today, we're calling him Bob.

1237
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:22,940
Wow.

1238
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,140
Oh, yeah.

1239
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,360
I love Bob.

1240
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,340
Some people are.

1241
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,100
I love that Bob.

1242
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,740
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1243
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,140
We're even more glad that some listeners

1244
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,920
have donated enough to help us

1245
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,040
keep on going for another couple of months.

1246
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,900
Not just this show,

1247
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,560
but subgenius.com

1248
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,080
and all the other archive sites.

1249
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,760
But if you truly

1250
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,800
love Bob and want some of that

1251
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,180
slack back to rebound

1252
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,540
to you, you should go to

1253
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,100
subgenius.com front page

1254
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,620
or especially the radio page

1255
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,640
or the catalog store pages

1256
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,860
and help out financially

1257
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,020
as best you can.

1258
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,480
Now, we know what it's like

1259
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,360
to be on the brink of total poverty

1260
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,360
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1261
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,000
to make their own situations worse.

1262
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,980
But some of you still have jobs.

1263
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:19,940
Even five bucks

1264
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,300
makes a big difference,

1265
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,320
even if it's only once a month

1266
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,860
from enough of you.

1267
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,260
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1268
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,980
All we're saying

1269
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:30,580
is that

1270
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,280
blow jobs could go the way of

1271
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,060
Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1272
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,840
We also know that

1273
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,640
you can take checks and money orders to

1274
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,520
Subgenius Foundation

1275
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,600
P.O. Box

1276
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,260
181

1277
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,860
417

1278
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,280
Cleveland Heights

1279
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,340
Ohio

1280
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,000
44118

1281
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,620
Thanks for

1282
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,380
anything you can do to help

1283
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,180
let there be slack.
