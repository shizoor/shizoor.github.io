1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,100
hey if you don't call it jane's gonna hear no music now you want to all go home or what

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,880
the soul genius

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,280
but back here at the duplication hall the muffled sounds were driving

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,020
driving us driving us mad they were driving us mad the input is now it goes into analog

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:51,780
and now here at the victory theater on buenovich decor in beautiful sham from rockin cisco

6
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,900
the night of clarabelle the ding weasel people and the shouting lizards

7
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,980
sing

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,120
singing in perfect unison for your indecent delays and your artistic miscreants

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:16,300
oh yes dear friends for this episode number 1827 i'm gonna surprise myself

10
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:23,180
i'm gonna assemble the show assap without even listening to any of it first

11
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,000
well actually i did hear all of it before just not since 2001

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
and not in this

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:29,980
one

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,140
my task of making hour of slack easier for me

15
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,880
by putting all subgenius audio on one huge 14 terabyte hard drive is done

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,000
although there's more sorting to do and i'm late already my god it's thursday

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,640
april 22nd i'm doing these credits first then i'll organize the files by title

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,020
then in theory we'll both be hearing this show for the first time

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,220
the credits are easy

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,820
it's all from eso swamp radio from wcsb cleveland

21
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,000
professor chaz smith's show but with me and lone cow dave doing most of the talking

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,560
princess we was there sometimes too

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:22,120
it's all from one archival collection called best of eso number 11 or eso bo number 11

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,340
in between each track i plan to put really short clips from the short funny clips folder

25
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,060
voila!

26
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,340
voila! A show is done, and I can get back to all the other stuff on my list today,

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,520
such as slacking off and killing Bob.

28
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,060
The subgenius must have slack!

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,820
He be slack or zombie.

30
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,560
No.

31
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,380
I'll be alright. I got the dog race good and there's no outside windows.

32
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,980
Mr. Smith, he tried to kill me. He tried to kill me.

33
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,840
We were in the store and he kept going faster and faster.

34
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,820
Lay your hands on the radio! Lay your hands on the radio there in the home!

35
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,240
And we're gonna look to God!

36
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,460
I really think that Bob is enjoying it. He just has this wonderful sort of Cheshire cat smile.

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,360
No!

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,000
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers,

39
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,060
Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scriptures call

40
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,020
the advent of the angelic host.

41
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,200
Oh, this is Timothy Leary reminding you...

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,880
that just as you need slack, Bob needs your help.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,260
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

44
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,580
Oh, slacker!

45
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,360
Well...

46
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,060
Well, I just don't know.

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,540
I just don't know.

48
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,240
I wandered into this... I wandered into this little spook house restaurant or whatever it was.

49
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,080
They were...

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,020
They were all having some kind of a party.

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,900
And then they set fire to the walls and just kept partying away while the place burned down around them.

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,860
It was like a vision of hell itself.

53
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,500
Oh, Jesus! I really knew it! I just...

54
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,860
But people just kept paying money, walking in,

55
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,100
I didn't seem to have any idea.

56
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,060
sliggin' drinks at the bar,

57
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
I didn't see that.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,460
their clothes on fire,

59
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,160
They were just laughing it up as if they didn't feel any of it.

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,940
It was kind of a cult, like a...

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,020
A cult, man!

62
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,060
A cult!

63
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,580
And they were all dead.

64
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,140
I wasn't pre-elected. I reached out.

65
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,340
I stood outside, watched the place burn to the ground.

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,620
It was like they...

67
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,360
You know, they all acted like this was something they did every night.

68
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,460
You got me.

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,700
Don't ask me.

70
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,160
I don't know nothing about it.

71
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,100
I'd just as soon stay here working at the...

72
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,700
At the quick shop...

73
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,180
For a buck, two eighty an hour.

74
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,780
I ain't gonna send my money to that preacher.

75
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
That's just what he wants me to do.

76
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm supposed to believe in some kind of deliverance by alien space fellers.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,440
And if I believe on Bob, then I'm gonna get to ride them escaped flying saucers.

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,300
And I just, I don't buy into that.

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,720
Well, some of my friends...

80
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,140
Now, some of my friends are believers.

81
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,780
A psychic virus has been discovered.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,140
Some of my friends are believers.

83
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,340
I'm not trying to put them down.

84
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,080
But I ain't gonna give away all my worldly goods.

85
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,940
I've already been through...

86
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,820
I had religion once.

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,700
I was in the Jehovah's Witnesses.

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,200
Had me give my Cadillac away.

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,280
The world was supposed to end on April 23rd.

90
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,280
We all sat around the hilltop waiting for God.

91
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,240
For the end of the world.

92
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,840
But after a while we got bored waiting and wandered off.

93
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,660
So I ain't gonna fall for none of that stuff this time.

94
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,840
But you know what I heard that was really sad?

95
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,240
I saw in this newspaper it said the Loch Ness Monster was dead.

96
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,340
I seen it right on the cover of that newspaper.

97
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,460
It was so sad.

98
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,620
It looked like a giant prairie squid or a big oyster.

99
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,260
It was flipping.

100
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,400
It had little slippers on it and a cute little otter's head.

101
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,840
And she was...

102
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,900
Did you know it said in there she was over a thousand years old?

103
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,360
And left a little tiny baby Loch Ness Monster homeless.

104
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,300
Friends, you don't want to let that little baby Loch Ness Monster go hungry, do you?

105
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,360
No, for in her belly are thousands of spider eggs.

106
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,420
Well, here in the Church of the Subgenius we offer...

107
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,860
special food and toys and modeling clay and clothing to those slackless children.

108
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,600
You know...

109
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,140
Even cosmetics and toiletries.

110
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,420
Those kids that you see the pictures of on milk cartons, they're not lost, friends.

111
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,540
They've just found Bob.

112
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:18,080
They are frolicking with the baby Loch Ness Monster now in a special swimming pool at the Home for Slackless Children in Malaysia.

113
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,780
Oh, there is no secret Neptune agenda.

114
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,320
Look, Ness is...

115
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,420
Nessie's dead.

116
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,960
It was all a big hoax.

117
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:37,180
Well, we'd prefer not to go into too much detail at this time about the origins since our own research is not complete.

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:49,080
But the Church of the Subgenius does seem to have a direct connection with the program known among conspiracy nuts as the Neptune Agenda.

119
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,720
And in fact...

120
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,340
The Neptune Agenda.

121
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:58,460
Yes, the Neptune Agenda, which we can trace the beginnings back to the discovery of sonar in 1915.

122
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,460
It's a watery, fishy theory, a philosophy, a conspiracy.

123
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:16,020
Well, it seems that after the first use of sonar to detect German U-boats in the North Atlantic, unusual and cryptic Morse code messages began to be received by listeners in many different areas.

124
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,400
A separate code of a logarithmic nature was created to communicate with turntables.

125
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,260
And what turned out to be aquatic mammals.

126
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:32,260
I probably shouldn't elaborate further here because some of the things I've picked up about this seem very new-agey.

127
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,100
Nessie is a biocide.

128
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,740
Stupid.

129
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:47,120
Having to do with ley lines and a global network of crystal skulls used as mind control transmitters to direct the actions of technologically advanced, or left-brained, humans.

130
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,380
I can hear the telar code.

131
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,460
This is the way I navigate.

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,440
I move my body close to the earth.

133
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,600
The telar occurrence.

134
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,920
It will dot the insides of my ears.

135
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,120
Sonar.

136
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,880
Sonar.

137
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,660
You can hear the whales of the briny deep moan out their love songs.

138
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,240
They can hear me, yes, they can.

139
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:18,140
The lonesome cowboy Dave up there on the prairie could hear them whales all the way out in the ocean.

140
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,340
And he knew he wasn't going to be lonesome for long.

141
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:31,520
He'd heard from old Bob what fun a giant sea-cation, sea-going mammal could be.

142
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,080
Oh yeah.

143
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,760
They're not that different from human beings, really, the way their bodies are set up.

144
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,580
They're warm-blooded.

145
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,600
Warm-blooded.

146
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:39,900
Mmm.

147
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,420
When you're in the freezing, frigid Atlantic Ocean.

148
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,040
And you got you a kind of...

149
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,520
Romantically inclined she-whale.

150
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,340
And you're a particular lonely cowboy preacher with a guitar.

151
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,180
You smell that ambergris floating on the seashore there.

152
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,880
Oh yeah.

153
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,640
Oh yeah.

154
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:13,040
You'll drop your sheep and your horses and just shuck your chaps and...

155
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,180
Liquid-fired in-laws.

156
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,700
Go swimming right out there.

157
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,040
Oh yeah.

158
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,020
Lonely cowboy Dave riding them dolphins all the way out to meet his queen, the great blue

159
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,280
whale in the center of the North Atlantic.

160
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,740
Yes.

161
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,380
Dave Tristed, just as had his mentor Bob.

162
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:45,660
But unfortunately, whereas Bob was man enough to handle a female blue whale, Dave got tangled

163
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,940
in the harpoon rope.

164
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:56,160
And was last seen with his wooden leg a-floppin' as she sounded one last time.

165
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,740
I'm the Blue Dips with Davey Joe's Logger.

166
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,840
We've got a thousand ten-eighths stories of Neptune.

167
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,200
Yep.

168
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:12,400
Dave's back down there underground, underwater, underneath the great web.

169
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,040
I can't fucking breathe.

170
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,920
I can't breathe.

171
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


172
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


173
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:16,920


174
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,980
I feel like I'm suffocating.

175
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,060
This is not as fun as it was before.

176
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,140
I like to just relax and just expand and just be...

177
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,900
Shh.

178
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,580
He was deep, deep inside the blowhole of the she-whale.

179
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,560
He thought he was gonna be having some kind of a big hot date that night.

180
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,900
And here he was, stuck halfway in the blowhole, halfway out.

181
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,020
She couldn't spout.

182
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,380
And that's about all he could do.

183
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,800
Oh, baby, Leviathan!

184
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm so sorry.

185
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,060
I'd rather the Winston be thy name!

186
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,120
I've got a wooden leg!

187
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,100
And he was the denken...

188
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:01,240
But they later got over their marital differences, and Dave took up residence inside Mrs. Monstro.

189
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:01,980
You've got to be kidding me?

190
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:01,980


191
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:01,980


192
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:01,980


193
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,220
We've gotta house oughta take off the garbage.

194
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,460
Yeah, we'll take off the garbage.

195
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,900
We've got th mitts to go with it.

196
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,780
kamall he had to do is occasionally empty the garbage out of Mrs. Monstro.

197
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:27,100
He'd scrape up the old license plates and tin cans and used syringes and so forth that

198
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,320
washed into her stomach that managed to get through the baleen.

199
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,900
He'd have to empty that stuff out now and then.

200
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,280
He was like a parasitic life form inhabiting the body of the she-whale.

201
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,780
Little mangan's here, little mangan's there, little harpoon cleaning here.

202
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,400
Oh, it's so shiny.

203
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,680
The only, their only natural enemy was Eskimos and Norwegians who had broken, and Japanese

204
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,140
whaling boats who had broken the international laws against such things.

205
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,640
Dave was Dave of the whales.

206
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,120
I'll learn this baby's song and then I'll record it and make a million dollars.

207
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,760
And Dave thought he was going to be a big rock star.

208
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:14,760


209
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,800
He was a rock and roll star with the citation Whale Song Rock.

210
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,740
So you know these songs last about a year and a half.

211
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,480
It takes about two years to compose them.

212
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,240
I figure if I just shrink it down on a data bank and take it all the way down to like

213
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,440
say three vibrations for every 25 seconds or something, I could have a perfect three

214
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
minute pop rock song.

215
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,320
Whale, whale of a whale of a whale of a whale.

216
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,540
But unfortunately the new age composer Yanni beat him to it.

217
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,200
Oh.

218
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
And made all the big money.

219
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:53,700
Dave and his wife, the female blue whale Mrs. Monstro were left in the gutter singing bad

220
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:01,360
country western songs for hoping for spare change from the citizenry and tourists who

221
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,480
would walk down the boardwalk there.

222
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,180
A man who never learned to live his life and let it be his own.

223
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,180


224
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,180


225
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,180


226
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,180


227
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,180


228
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,180


229
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,180


230
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:21,560
I'm not going to say that there's a man like that or something wrong with him.

231
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:28,860
Well, no actually like I said the whale is not like it's a different order of animals.

232
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,780
They're mammals.

233
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,840
They're not that different from a person.

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,020
They have a vestigial sort of hind leg and rather a longer tail than people do.

235
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,000
But you know they breathe air.

236
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,160
They breathe air.

237
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,660
They cry tears.

238
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,740
They weep tears.

239
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,320
Just like you or I.

240
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,980
Well, like you anyway.

241
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,360
And they don't seem to be able to take very good care of their fingernails.

242
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,220
Why is that?

243
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,280
This fungal growth seems to have traveled all the way to the base of the spine.

244
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,320
And this basal area here is completely covered with the fungus.

245
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,860
Oh, it's superstitious, eh?

246
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,160
Well, it seems to be.

247
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


248
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


249
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


250
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


251
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


252
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


253
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


254
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


255
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


256
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


257
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


258
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,160


259
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,380
Dear Diary,

260
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,440
Today I have added a fourth circle to my pre-pooping ritual.

261
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,740
As before, the first circle is to verify that I do in fact need to poop.

262
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,260
The second is to check for gremlins and men with beards and hats.

263
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,220
The third is to re-verify my need for pooping.

264
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,980
And now the fourth is to honor my newly deceased toy.

265
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,880
Stuffed Llama, rest in peace.

266
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,060
I didn't mean to shake your head off.

267
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,780
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.

268
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,680
I'm not sure how much room on the saucers.

269
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,100
Holy hen!

270
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,060
Don't worry, folks.

271
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,000
This is us.

272
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,640
Gross and perverted.

273
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,500
In gross?

274
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,180
Sest and deranged.

275
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,920
In the funky Vangelint.

276
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
The eyebrow picker.

277
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,240
And the french fry curler.

278
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,840
These are a few of my favorite things here on Mars.

279
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,700
Can we just sit down here and have a little fireside snack?

280
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,360
You'll notice the person to your extreme right is catching fire right now.

281
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,700
And we'll be ready to eat in a few moments.

282
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,300
Have you guessed me yet?

283
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm the fly oozing out from your radio set.

284
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,260
You will obey me while I eat you.

285
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,460
Alright, here we go.

286
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,460
Here we got Frank Zappa's, the real Frank Zappa book here.

287
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,460
Let's read a little bit here while Frank sings.

288
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,380
If you wind up with a boring miserable life because you listen to your mother, your dad, your priest, to some guy on television,

289
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,420
to any of the people, or someone on radio for that matter,

290
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,940
to any of the people telling you how to do your sh**,

291
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,260
then you deserve it.

292
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,140
You want to be a shmuck? Be a shmuck.

293
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,980
But don't win around for respect from other people.

294
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,240
A shmuck is a shmuck.

295
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,620
I suggest we learn how to take anything bad that happens to us and polarize it.

296
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,600
Instead of being overwhelmed by a negative event, dodge to the side like those Tai Chi guys

297
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,860
and let it whiz by your pants.

298
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,020
Maybe it makes a little breeze.

299
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,060
Big deal.

300
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,640
Please don't mistake this for optimism.

301
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,120
There is an organization in Texas called the Church of the Subgenius,

302
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,600
devoted to the teachings of some guy with a pipe in his mouth named Bob.

303
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,780
I'm not a member, but part of their theology parallels mine.

304
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,220
As the planet gets more crowded, we must realize that slack is precious,

305
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,140
shmucks are plentiful,

306
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,260
impingements are impractical,

307
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,000
and werewolf etiquette is a crime.

308
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,840
The etiquette for self-defense is a personal necessity.

309
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you, St. Frank.

310
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,380
Greetings from St. Frank. Charles, you did a wonderful job.

311
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,060
You can sit down there now.

312
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,280
Frank Zappa said that, eh?

313
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,040
Yeah, right.

314
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,060
Glory be, that is a beautiful disclaimer.

315
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,260
Well, this is the same idea if you think about George Clinton saying,

316
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,840
free your mind and your ass will follow,

317
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,400
and old Sunjiata story of in order to fly you have to lose your shmuck.

318
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,940
Here, listen on. He says,

319
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,540
techniques must be developed to enable each of us to escape the other guy's bullsh**

320
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,860
just as he wishes to escape ours.

321
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,880
Heaven would be a place where bullsh** exists only on television.

322
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,000
Pull the wool over your own eyes, Mark Graham.

323
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,200
See, now this is a man who came up with nine squadsillion hundred records

324
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,420
and albums and CDs in his lifetime

325
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,020
who spent all his excess energy creating his sh**.

326
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,460
And while he was doing this, all this stuff came into his head,

327
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,140
and so he spat that out too. And he was right.

328
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,100
And he never had one hit album, not one hit song on the top 40.

329
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,780
No. I think in Genoa he was probably a big star.

330
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,200
His silliest novelty song, the Montana, moving to Montana scene,

331
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,900
the dental floss song, was the closest thing.

332
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,680
Yeah, Dynamo Hum got airplay. At least in Cleveland it got a lot of airplay.

333
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh, really?

334
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,520
Now, you must think there were a few movies, weren't there?

335
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,940
Not anymore.

336
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,800
In Dallas, nothing got airplay by Frank.

337
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,240
He was not well liked, was he?

338
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,120
Well, sure, at my house.

339
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,900
Fuck that, Dr. Drummond's house.

340
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:29,060
But, you know, but yeah, most of my fellow Texans like to torture Frank.

341
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,540
They nailed him up on sticks. They'd run him through town, painted all tarry,

342
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,800
and set him on fire.

343
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,880
Hey, they used to do that to me too. That's why I left. That's why Frank left.

344
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,260
That's why we all drifted away.

345
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,300
Frank was also abused by his mom and dad who had supper,

346
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,320
if you want to call it that, with their French poodle, Larry.

347
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,660
Frank's father was a full-blowed army colonel in the New York United States armies.

348
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,440
His mom was an insane woman who belonged to the Altar and Rose Society

349
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,300
and made him do things he didn't want to do.

350
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,740
His dad was a strict disciplinarian.

351
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,380
Who are we talking about?

352
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:08,920
Frank.

353
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,600
That's not true, is it?

354
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,060
Yeah, I think he was an army brat.

355
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,220
No, none of that's true.

356
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,260
No, he was an army brat and they drove him nuts.

357
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,840
They didn't drive him nuts. Frank Zappa was a relatively sane individual.

358
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,620
Well, no, they drove him sane if that's the result.

359
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,320
You know, there's a shame. He had good relationships with his parents and stuff.

360
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,880
Did he? I read...

361
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,480
See, then that's another myth exploded.

362
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,240
I read that his father was like real anal because he was an army colonel and stuff.

363
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,040
Well, was that Frank Zappa?

364
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:47,040
His mom was like, was one of those war-hungry, warring, Italian-American ladies who will not leave you alone for one minute.

365
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,440
Dynamo hum.

366
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,740
You with that ugly your own free whale, Doc?

367
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,460
Yes, yes I am.

368
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,280
I'd rather be lucky than smart.

369
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,220
Where are we, Bob?

370
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,620
The code is broken.

371
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,500
Trouble?

372
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,040
Big. Security.

373
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
I have the lid on tight.

374
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,980
Well, take it off for me.

375
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,240
The message is, Mars needs women.

376
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,400
Bills, bills, bills, bop, bop.

377
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,680
B-b-bop, b-b-bop, b-b-bop.

378
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,380
Brop, b-bop, zippy b-bop, b-b-bop.

379
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,700
Praise Bob!

380
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,260
Bang. Bang. There were a couple times when I didn't think you were buying it.

381
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,860
You know what Jenkum is?

382
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,300
I saw one of those TV shows that has America's most famous.

383
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,720
It's called The Fascist Home Hilarious Cop Abuses.

384
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,680
Oh, those are great.

385
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,680
And it was, I gotta admit, it was pretty funny.

386
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:54,640
This cop had pulled over this sort of a buck-toothed, hayseed, po-bucker, just-got-in-town jasper sort of a fella that talked kind of like me.

387
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,800
They love them newcomers.

388
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,980
And on the vid, there was a cop and a video cameraman talking to this guy.

389
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,120
And the cop's going, sir, I suspect that you've been smoking marijuana.

390
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,460
Now, do you know why I would suspect that?

391
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,560
And the guy's going, I don't know.

392
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,520
The whole time he's got this joint in his ear.

393
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,800
Right behind his ear.

394
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,020
The cameraman, of course, zooms in on it.

395
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:30,780
And, you know, it embarrassed me, you know, to see that pot smoker look so very, very dumb.

396
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,860
Because I know it was the beers he had.

397
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,060
And he admitted to the beers.

398
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,900
He said, well, I did just have a couple of beers.

399
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,620
Before I came out here.

400
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,860
But I don't know why you think I'd be smoking dope.

401
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,900
And the cop finally points to the joint behind the guy's ear.

402
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
And he goes, well, damn.

403
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,260
So I didn't even smoke it.

404
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,580
Now I ain't going to get a chance to smoke it.

405
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,120
If I'd have been smoking it, why would it be my own darn?

406
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,280
That's right, too.

407
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,320
Wasn't it?

408
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,220
Yes, friends.

409
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,300
It's right.

410
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,100
Right, right, right.

411
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,880
The next time you eat a beer.

412
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,380
The hamburger.

413
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,720
Don't just eat the hamburger.

414
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:19,480
Pull the damn joint out from under your ears and smoke him in remembrance of you.

415
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,300
Ah, yes.

416
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:31,980
And then when you have truly remembered you, pick pieces off of yourself.

417
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,680
Pull yourself into little tiny bits and let the seeds roll away.

418
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:42,740
And then kind of fluff yourself over into that huge bowl of Bob's giant pipe.

419
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,040
And let him smoke you.

420
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:52,240
And as you become the molecules coursing down and hitting his little airy veolia bubbles in his lungs.

421
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,240
And as you enter Bob's bloodstream.

422
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,500
And as the essence of you becomes that which is interfering with Bob's rational thought.

423
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,600
Don't forget.

424
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,660
Don't forget what you owe Bob.

425
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,760
At that moment.

426
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,720
You owe Bob more than the air you breathe.

427
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:21,940
You owe Bob the liquids you reconvert into spatial decels and brain signals like those shown in Mom's Decembered head.

428
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,740
She wanted to be Miss January, but look at her now.

429
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,220
Frozen.

430
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,760
Under a three-foot sheet of ice.

431
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,200
She's a very lackluster performance on your part, Larry.

432
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,400
I think we can cure that easily.

433
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,540
Ha!

434
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,960
Here we go.

435
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,440
Look at the monkeys and the dwarfs and midgets.

436
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,640
And the bears.

437
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,040
And the pigs.

438
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,680
And the normals and the subgeniuses all running around.

439
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,180
I can see them now.

440
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,400
As if they were right in front of me sweating and farting like the other circus animals.

441
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,720
God almighty, I love the circus.

442
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,580
The smell of the peanuts.

443
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,480
The quaint, piquant aroma of the dead chef.

444
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,420
God, I love the circus.

445
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:21,400
If I could just make Cavill perhaps live one wish, it would be to be in the circus always.

446
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,300
Front row center and front.

447
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,060
A master ceremony.

448
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,100
I am afraid, Monsieur, you have failed.

449
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,480
You have failed just miserably.

450
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:42,200
We have taken a very, very detailed log of your activities and your motor responses.

451
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,700
You are what we might call a spud animal.

452
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,120
You little spud man.

453
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,240
Little silly spud people.

454
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,600
You would do know of the roots of ice.

455
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,840
How can he see in any one direction?

456
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,240
Dirty little...

457
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,380
160 degrees.

458
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,260
He's...

459
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,760
He's...

460
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,940
He's a fallen piece of flesh that has no use.

461
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,380
So...

462
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,640
Filthy, filthy, filthy.

463
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
Dirty, dirty.

464
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,080
Steve, Dr. Dog, we're ready to tee off now.

465
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,840
Those of you who haven't watched are gonna have to...

466
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,520
Gonna have to...

467
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:22,980
Gonna have to...

468
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,420
Gonna...

469
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,140
Go back and hit...

470
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,400
Go back and hit the...

471
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:26,720
Shit.

472
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,000
This is Reverend D.K. Jones.

473
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,260
Uh, in New Jersey.

474
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,480
Great, great subgenius.

475
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,040
a song called Midnight Ramblers.

476
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,360
He dressed in midnight ramblers, yeah.

477
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,280
I don't mean just Black breed.

478
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,980
I mean you Black haunted men and women.

479
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,400
io move in, midnight ram after stayin'

480
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,680
All midnight ramblers' faces are not black.

481
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,400
But their arms are as black as midnight.

482
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,980
I'm talking to you.

483
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,880
Hold up, men.

484
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,620
And women.

485
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,920
You bank robbers.

486
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,560
You selling clothes.

487
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
And you bank robbers.

488
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,240
And kidnap.

489
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,600
Hold up, men.

490
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm talking to you.

491
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,520
And we got some people in the chat.

492
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,180
I'm sitting out just as men.

493
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,520
As a midnight rambler.

494
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,100
I don't know what time brother.

495
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,400
Cut in last night.

496
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,160
Yeah, brother.

497
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,180
They had him.

498
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,480
Yeah.

499
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,660
They had him.

500
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,040
But you haven't told why they had that.

501
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,800
Sister Belle, why did they have him at?

502
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,540
Yeah.

503
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,800
Yeah.

504
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,860
I thought he was in jail.

505
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,940
I thought.

506
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,380
I thought.

507
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,380


508
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,480
Anywhere.

509
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,720
Yes.

510
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,500
Yeah.

511
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,720
WW

512
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:34,840
w

513
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,920
,

514
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,720
.

515
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,560
I'm not all in court.

516
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,240
I'm not hold.

517
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,280
in code.

518
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,920
in code.

519
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,400
Oh, well, you don't have to tell me I'm not holding court.

520
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,660
No.

521
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,460
I'm just telling you he's got to tell the judge.

522
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,200
And you're out to tell him what to do.

523
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,980
Him what to do.

524
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,380
Him what to do.

525
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,380
Him what to do.

526
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,000
Him what to do.

527
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,840
Him what to do.

528
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,320
And in the court, if you don't mind, you get six dollars.

529
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,920
Eight.

530
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,540
Ah, ten.

531
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,980
And now I'm talking to you, midnight ram.

532
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,360
Yes.

533
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,660
Stay real nice.

534
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,220
Yes.

535
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,920
Just to rob and steal.

536
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,580
All right.

537
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,360
From a used car, I'm telling you, steal from yourself.

538
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,240
All right.

539
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,960
Eat and buy, eat and buy, eat and buy, eat and buy.

540
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,040
Sell, kill, sell, kill, sell.

541
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,640
Can't you hear?

542
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,640
Oh, bless.

543
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,460
Oh, I don't do that.

544
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,000
You got to, you got to, you got to, you got to.

545
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,700
Uh-huh.

546
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,700
Oh, yeah.

547
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,500
Out with somebody else.

548
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,100
But he's got the answer for himself.

549
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,680
Yeah.

550
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,780
I went out there for him first.

551
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,280
He's got to stand for himself.

552
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,260
That musical break was Midnight Rambler by D.K. Jones.

553
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,000
From before my life in the Bush of Ghosts, by the way.

554
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,800
And now Captain Beefheart.

555
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,740
The black paper between a mirror breaks my heart.

556
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,440
The moon frayed through dark velvet lightly apart

557
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,640
Steals softly to sunshine

558
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,860
Steals softly to snow

559
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,980
What?

560
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,700
What?

561
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,340
The princess is a creature of antiquity

562
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,240
Ten million years at least in age

563
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,920
Dear diary, I told the cat about how my dearest human has promoted me

564
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,460
Teaching me to shake so I can participate in his business dealings

565
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,600
However, cat pointed out that I'm often unaware of what I'm shaking on

566
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,480
For example, when I shook the neighbor's hand this morning

567
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,620
I have no clue what I agreed to

568
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,360
None

569
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,200
Cat says this is how the devil buys souls

570
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,460
I will pee on the bed for comfort

571
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,680
No!

572
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,980
No!

573
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:18,440
I must have a girl to call my own, for I am Dobby, son of Goom.

574
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:28,480
You pitiful, dobbings-legged earth fools milling about in your cage of only three dimensions.

575
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,120
Dobby, go find me a nymph.

576
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,880
You don't know what for you lost me.

577
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,060
Maynard, bring me a woman.

578
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,280
Bring me a bongo, bongo baby.

579
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,500
Give me a fury.

580
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,880
A hundred of little furies.

581
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,900
I want more.

582
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,120
Bring me harpies with chests of steel.

583
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,200
Bring me the furies themselves.

584
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,620
I want Medusa.

585
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,760
Yes, I will make love to Medusa.

586
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,680
Let her turn me to stone.

587
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,600
I could be no stonier of heart.

588
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,040
Then it's over.

589
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,040


590
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,200
I am already.

591
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,280
If only the fools would leave me in peace to complete my experiments.

592
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,020
They want to know who I am and what I am.

593
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,980
Well, I'll show them.

594
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,320
I'll show them all.

595
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:32,920
It's here in this dark cave on the Aegean Sea, where lights have been seen for scores and scores of years.

596
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,440
Fishermen have noticed lights in this cave.

597
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,300
For a period of five weeks at a time during the summer solstice season.

598
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,080
And after that time, the lights appear to...

599
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:55,400
These crop circles, or frock circles as they're called, originally appeared in wheat fields in England and Ireland, Scotland.

600
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,460
Lately, they've been appearing as concrete circles in the center of New York City in Chicago.

601
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,480
Decorated with the bodies of mutilated cattle.

602
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
Mysteriously mutilated cattle.

603
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,100
What could this mean?

604
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:29,920
There are no secrets in the Church of the Subgenius, and I will not be endangering myself or my family in any way despite rumors to the contrary, because you, dear listener, will probably not believe a word of it.

605
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,440
It's all just a dream.

606
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,000
It's just the migrating light out of a dark hive.

00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,720
there is no law.

619
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,960
You'll never see him again.

620
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,700
That's why I'm Lieutenant Frank Mim youngest, and Whiteforest Friends will never meet...

621
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,300
Died Minister Tasher.

622
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,420
Why should I move his head?

623
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:02,420


624
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,100
Do we tell him?

625
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,140
with the church that it is hard to choose where to start.

626
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,480
This is so like, dude, it's like the Lucians in the like,

627
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,180
Hollow Earth days, look, look, the Nazis, look,

such a weird match, like, dimensions from, I mean,

629
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,940
these people from the, you never heard of them?

630
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,040
To set the tone, let me tell you what I've seen with my own eyes

631
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,660
while visiting Palmer Vredes, actually the artist Hal Robbins,

632
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,620
aka Dr. Hal, in his San Francisco apartment in 1993.

633
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,760
Well, I, w-w-w-well, go ahead.

634
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,380
Lies and Vredes began an apparently innocent brag fight,

635
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,060
each proclaiming their abilities in the most outrageous terms,

636
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,500
but after a quarter hour without significant gain,

637
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,340
Vredes became agitated and suddenly swept lamp and telephone

638
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,780
from an end table.

639
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,600
He then seemingly lifted the table into the air.

640
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:05,500
air without touching it. It shot out the window and crashed onto the sidewalk two floors below

641
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:12,060
where it burst into flame. Vreedes changed the subject immediately and the event was

642
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:21,320
never spoken of again. Having set the tone with that story, I can pretty much say anything

643
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:28,720
I want to and be assured that no listener will believe a word of it. On the same visit,

644
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,460
I took a trip into the desert with D. Woodman Atwell of puzzling evidence, a harrowing experience

645
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,040
all around, for I saw him apparently drive his truck through a concrete wall without

646
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,360
damage of any kind to anything. I was then shown a series of missile silos from which

647
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:53,140
shone beams of bluish green light for a period of about two hours around midnight. This is

648
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,080
February of 1992. There were a number of unusual gravitational

649
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,700
and gravitational waves. I was then shown a series of missile silos from which shone

650
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:21,180
beams of bluish green light forribles of oil and moltenlaughing waves.气ğera sais

again with the world incomparably different, forged by Anaknon B. Jones drinking too much

656
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:35,060
This is nothing compared to the bizarre political and extra-legal connections of the Church of the Subgenius.

657
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,680
Ivan Stang is known to have made trips to England and South America in the past few years to meet with, among others,

658
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:52,500
high-ranking members of the P2 Masonic Group and an organization of which the Priory of Zion and Bilderberger Group are sanitized fictionalizations.

659
00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:04,960
Stang and Drummond are known to be 33rd-degree masons, and Stang's position in a control group hinted at as a Texas mafia is hereditary through his father, an ex-district attorney for Dallas.

660
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:14,040
Stang has employed a man named Doug Smith to pose as the real-life person of Ivan Stang.

661
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,000
Stang, however, is his real name, although he now uses the Smith name in his daily affairs.

662
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,480
I have met Smith and can assure you they are two very different people.

663
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,480


664
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,960
They are two very different people of entirely different capabilities.

665
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:31,840
Smith seems to be a victim of arrested development, and though he is the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet,

666
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,400
Stang is perfectly correct in calling him,

667
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,360
dumb as Dave.

668
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,040
I have never met Drummond, but the stories I've heard...

669
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,040
are as strange as anything yet.

670
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,220
Relate.

671
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,140
I've seen the real Doug.

672
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,480
I've seen the real Doug.

673
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,120
and he is just as smooth as buttermilk pie.

674
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,320
He would never do a harmful thing to another human being.

675
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,780
This other man, now you can see there's a big difference.

676
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,200
Look at his chin right there.

677
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,660
There's a big scar on his chin,

678
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,200
and I don't see how they can get away with that.

679
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,460
I told all my kin so far that this is it with me,

680
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,060
but I'm just giving up on everything

681
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,600
that God never says ever again.

682
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
I just don't believe it.

683
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,960
Did you see what they had on the head the other night?

684
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
They had a man who could actually make a man,

685
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,200
make a man, make a man, make a man, make a man.

686
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,280
Oh, you rat.

687
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,540

00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,980
Scrapple.

696
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,020
Scrapple.

697
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,060
Scrapple.

698
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,320
Scrapple.

00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,080

701
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,040
You're staying.

702
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,660
Of course you know me.

703
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,180
You were sent here to kill me.

704
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,800
A letter from a prisoner.

705
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:00,960
Prisoner?

706
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,720
A prisoner in Atlanta, or near to Atlanta.

707
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,600
Actually, his prison address here is in Delaware.

708
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,260
What's he in prison for?

709
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,280
What we have here.

710
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,700
Listen to this letter.

711
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,200
It is a favor you to fornicate.

712
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,300
I mean, communicate.

713
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,680
This was sent to us here in Cleveland, not to the Dallas headquarters.

714
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,480
He goes, almighty holy messenger, my name is Noah.

715
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:22,480


716
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,840
Noah Hughes, aka Pope Nasty.

717
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,700
Noah count.

718
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm a devout subgenius whose rights to slack are being withheld through a local department

719
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,680
of corrections.

720
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:40,140
I'm currently being held in Gander Hill Prison, located in Wilmington, Delaware, on charges

721
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,540
of-

722
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,940
Hey, you got a rack of dollars.

723
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,520
Sell it.

724
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:42,800
Hey.

725
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,560
Prop possession.

726
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,720
I'm looking at about three more years, and they repeatedly had church material refused.

727
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,460
I'm a devout subgenius.

728
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,400
And reps all scorched our walls.

729
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:02,340
I'm asking for violation of night of明白ness, and then, of course, you wantompalence?

730
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:02,780
That's fine.

731
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,020
At least if I can superpower a one and Ooooh.

732
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,400
Leave her.

733
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:17,400


734
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,460
brought religious לicheó

735
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,820
for isolation of my First Amendment rights,

736
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,960
a violation of them.

737
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,500
So please feel free to forward any and all information

738
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,740
pertaining to these topics and requests.

739
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,060
My body is totally slack-free.

740
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,920
And I'm hurting for some of your old-time religion.

741
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,280
Also, please use the church name on the return address

742
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,640
so I can receive said slack.

743
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,200
God bless you, my fine friend.

744
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:45,700
Give me slack.

745
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,780
Praise Bob.

746
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,960
Oh, that poor man.

747
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,860
Now to discuss his actual agonizing condition.

748
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,760
Just think of what he must go through every day.

749
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,040
He bangs a tin cup against the cell door.

750
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,980
A guy with one of those 1930s King Kong hats comes by

751
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,180
and pulls out his old billy stick

752
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,420
and starts clubbing him ferociously

753
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,000
until the guy next door,

754
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:13,060
who is somewhere near 455 pounds of solid muscle

755
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,980
with a shaved head,

756
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,300
has barbecue shavings with him.

757
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,280
Yeah.

758
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,800
That is so disgusting.

759
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,300
And for what?

760
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,340
What did this man do to deserve this?

761
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,240
Lick a black hole of liquor.

762
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,100
All this man did was lick a black hole.

763
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,200
That's all he did.

764
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,120
And did that hurt anybody else?

765
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:32,680
No.

766
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,660
Well, no, my friend, you don't understand.

767
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,600
The reason why we are against drugs

768
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,260
is because they are against us.

769
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,120
Don't you understand what it is saying?

770
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,480
But yet you can buy heroin down at the supermarket.

771
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,420
I mean, beer.

772
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,360
You can buy false hair anywhere, pal.

773
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:46,760
That is true.

774
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


775
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


776
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,140
It doesn't mean you're not going to stay bald.

777
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:48,780
And get cracked down at the liquor store.

778
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,720
I mean, whiskey.

779
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,600
You know, I mean, you can get,

780
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,440
you can get narcotics anywhere.

781
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,920
You could be a narcotic.

782
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,300
All this man did was have some frop

783
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:58,600
and lick a black hole.

784
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,660
He should have told the judge.

785
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,200
He should have told the judge.

786
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,540
I am drugs.

787
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,920
He's probably been staring.

788
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,400
He's probably got three more years

789
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,480
of looking in the black hole.

790
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,640
I guess they better put...

791
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,680
Or bend over.

792
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,640
I guess they better put God in prison

793
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,900
for growing frop.

794
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,660
The last time I heard,

795
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,500
Mr. God was growing marijuana.

796
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,480
And from both.

797
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,540
By the roadside, my friend.

798
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,500
All over this country and many others.

799
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,480
I guess they better put God

800
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,740
in that Dander Hill prison.

801
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,560
That God is in jail right now.

802
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,380
Well, that's kind of one of the main problems

803
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,860
or why we are having so many problems right now.

804
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,040
Hell, they're lowering the coffin of God

805
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,840
into the ground.

806
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,480
God is dead.

807
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,640
God is not dead.

808
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,700
He's doing 15 to 25 at a minimum.

809
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,040
Well, not really a minimum.

810
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,460
There is.

811
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:46,960
There's barbed wire,

812
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,900
but he can't get out.

813
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,660
For growing.

814
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,800
God's in prison for growing.

815
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,120
Well, no, actually just for consorting

816
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,520
with an angular object.

817
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,900
I think there were even more of those than that.

818
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,220
I think they're working on throwing the sun

819
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,660
in the hoose cow, too.

820
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,840
I thought God was arrested by the four...

821
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,400
Too much light.

822
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,200
By the four-dimensional sheriff.

823
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,060
Fourth-dimensional sheriff.

824
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,420
For trying to break into the fifth dimension.

825
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,380
Yeah, because we've got only a three-dimensional God.

826
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,260
Yeah.

827
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,020
He was getting...

828
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,660
So that's...

829
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,820
Oh, he was doing...

830
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,860
Well, actually, maybe it's...

831
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,120
Maybe God's just a four-dimensional critter

832
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,640
and every now and then you just see a wavering light in the air

833
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,720
and you hear a voice,

834
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,900
so everybody goes...

835
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,460
God!

836
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,240
So maybe you're saying God got thrown in jail for doing...

837
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:31,680
No, God...

838
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,200
He's just an adventurer.

839
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,160
He's like a guy who...

840
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,400
He lives in the four-dimensional world.

841
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,720
It lives in the four-dimensional land.

842
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,720
But he's just out tooling around one day

843
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,700
and stuck his head in on Earth, you know?

844
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,400
Oh, man.

845
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,000
What a mistake.

846
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,280
A mistake.

847
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,160
Just like us looking through a microscope

848
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,440
at a bunch of microbes.

849
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,980
And the people on Earth.

850
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,000
He looked around at the people

851
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,760
and he was just like,

852
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,860
you know, dudes, like, you shouldn't kill.

853
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,600
Like, don't do that.

854
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,600
And he kind of stuck his finger out when he said that,

855
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,340
but, you know, that's what came through

856
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,060
to three dimensions.

857
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,120
When he stuck his finger out,

858
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,840
he kind of, like, passed through and they said...

859
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,640
And he said, do not kill him.

860
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,720
They wrote it on a stone.

861
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,160
Unfortunately...

862
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,220
They all said, kill him!

863
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:10,740
Kill him!

864
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,640
And then they realized

865
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,000
every time they killed him,

866
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,560
he kept on coming back every Easter,

867
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,900
so they put his ass...

868
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,460
His ass in jail

869
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,920
and they're not letting him out.

870
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,720
Aren't you mixing up God with Jesus, Dave?

871
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,520
Oh.

872
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,080
The idea of the...

873
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:23,220
His son.

874
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,540
That's his little boy, God Jr.

875
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,820
I beg to differ with myself.

876
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,680
God is not only his only purified self,

877
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,340
but he's also an alien vestigal.

878
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,540
He's three in one.

879
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,420
Three great candies in one.

880
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,680
May he rest in peace.

881
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,680
Yeah, or may he get some slack time in the yards,

882
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,840
you know, without...

883
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,400
Yeah, because not only did he grow the frog,

884
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,300
but he grew the humans

885
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,960
and put...

886
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,140
Gave them these brains

887
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,340
whereby they would figure out

888
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,700
that if they chewed on the frog

889
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,860
and packed it up their eggs,

890
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,100
it would have felt kind of good.

891
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,720
And so they did it because they could.

892
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,520
Now, I think God should be thrown in jail for that.

893
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,360
I think jail should probably be

894
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,940
his most divine wish.

895
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,740
Because somewhere there's a 15-year-old smoking pot

896
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,600
and God's God's responsibility.

897
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:11,960
He brought it around.

898
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,060
He's that kid's father.

899
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,180
We're all children of God.

900
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,000
Wildwood weed.

901
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:15,700
If...

902
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:15,980
If...

903
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,060
If...

904
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,300
Man...

905
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,280
What if God actually did look like divine, though?

906
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,740
I mean, wouldn't that be a stunning surprise

907
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,520
to walk into the heavenly gates

908
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,520
and there's St. Peter

909
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,900
and he's all bespectacled

910
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,640
and he looks like he's got, you know,

911
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,280
like a foreskin around his neck?

912
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,660
Now, that's how God will look to Jesse Helms.

913
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,260
With a foreskin around his neck, right,

914
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,980
and a biting, angry, one-eyed head.

915
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,240
That's the way Jesse Helms will die.

916
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,480
God will look like the young kitten,

917
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,640
not TV Dodd,

918
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,200
in an early Russ Meyer film.

919
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,640
Kitten, not TV Dodd.

920
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:45,980
Oh, God.

921
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,340
God's boy's in the White House now,

922
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,800
so we should be seeing a lot more of this.

923
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,620
Bob's boy?

924
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,360
Well, that's the...

925
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,440
I mean, did you hear they...

926
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,040
That's the two-dimensional God

927
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,000
I think you're talking about.

928
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,400
This morning...

929
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,800
This morning, they, uh...

930
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,560
Yeah.

931
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,160
This morning, they found the Bush daughters

932
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,080
passed out in their own puke

933
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,160
on the front lawn of the White House.

934
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,640
That could be a well...

935
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,320
That could be true, couldn't it?

936
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,600
It is.

937
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,240
It is.

938
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,360
It is a true thing?

939
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:11,680
Yeah.

940
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,860
You know how you can lie to me

941
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,520
in their own puke.

942
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,600
That was when I quit.

943
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,240
That was my last drink

944
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,220
when I woke up on the White House lawn

945
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,180
in a puddle of my own puke.

946
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,420
Wearing that duck suit and a brassiere.

947
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,100
And I could tell I had scratched

948
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,360
deep gouges in the door

949
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,200
with my fingernail the night before.

950
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,280
And you realized one tooth was missing

951
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:32,820
and they were like,

952
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,180
you were wearing lipstick.

953
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,220
I was...

954
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,440
I realized that I better quit drinking.

955
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,020
But you know, those Secret Service guys

956
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:39,940
never did quit

957
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,360
because there's still guys

958
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,500
scratching at the door.

959
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,800
Those guys don't buy liquor

960
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,520
for young broads.

961
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,200
They don't pay us down.

962
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,340
They don't pay us down.

963
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:45,340


964
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,240
Everybody's drinking on the job.

965
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,700
I'll scrapple.

966
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,300
Scrapple.

967
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,120
We should live in cities

968
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,020
on our own filth.

969
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,360
We tried that.

970
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,540
That's so 14th century, Dave.

971
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,060
That's so 1400s.

972
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,220
Man, I'm so pashay.

973
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,520
You know, living like back in the 14th,

974
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,160
like the 15th century, man.

975
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,680
Yeah, right.

976
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,660
Well, the plane walked out

977
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,700
half the humans.

978
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,340
You had that going for it.

979
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,960
Cans and pieces of plastic.

980
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,480
Half the humans.

981
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,700
This was the sound of it.

982
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,540
You got it on tape.

983
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:39,880
Cups.

984
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:41,740
Styrofoam.

985
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,660
It's not that bad.

986
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,000
You got it on tape.

987
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000


988
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000


989
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000


990
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000


991
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000


992
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000


993
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000


994
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000


995
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,500
Styrofoam.

996
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:48,280
But I live in my home.

997
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,220
Feel the drill.

998
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,120
Oh, my.

999
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,700
The nose drill.

1000
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,700
My side.

1001
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,560
It hurts, doesn't it?

1002
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,060
Hold me.

1003
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,100
But you like it.

1004
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,940
It hurts more.

1005
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,100
It just keeps getting louder.

1006
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,860
Oh, my ears.

1007
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,180
My ears.

1008
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:03,940
Thanks, Bob.

1009
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,180
Oh, my ears.

1010
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:05,780
I love you.

1011
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,480
I'm losing my mind.

1012
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,120
Thanks, Bob.

1013
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,000
Oh, I can't stand it

1014
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,740
another second.

1015
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,780
More, more, more.

1016
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,360
Oh, I can't stand it.

1017
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:13,840
I can't stand it.

1018
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,720
It's being ruptured.

1019
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,080
Almost done there.

1020
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,780
And it feels so good.

1021
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,220
Now spit out of your ears.

1022
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,460
And you turn it off.

1023
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,980
Let your ears drill in the cup now.

1024
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,000
Just when you get a breath.

1025
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
My ears.

1026
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:26,860
I'm like,

1027
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,500
I'll tell you anything

1028
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,820
you want to know.

1029
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:30,920
Killing me.

1030
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,400
Don't stop, Bob.

1031
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,020
I hate this.

1032
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:36,940
Don't stop.

1033
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:37,640
Don't stop.

1034
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,180
I can't.

1035
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,960
I'm losing it.

1036
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,560
I'm losing it.

1037
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,400
I'm losing it.

1038
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,100
I got the wig on.

1039
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:43,620
I'm losing it.

1040
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,000


1041
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,640
Oh, Bob.

1042
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:45,640


1043
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:45,900
Don't.

1044
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,960
You have to let yourself

1045
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,620
be able.

1046
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,040
This is the worst thing

1047
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,800
that's ever happened.

1048
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,440
God is fair.

1049
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,240
God, Bob.

1050
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,660
I want to pay extra for that.

1051
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,000
Dear diary,

1052
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,500
my dearest human

1053
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,840
asked me where the ball was

1054
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,820
when it was clearly

1055
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,700
in plain sight.

1056
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,120
I brought it over

1057
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,060
and he threw it

1058
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,020
even farther away.

1059
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,860
Then asked me where it was

1060
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,980
and was very happy

1061
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,900
when I brought it again.

1062
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,140
Perhaps a metaphor?

1063
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,780
Dearest human leaves each day

1064
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,520
and I am happy

1065
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,280
when he returns.

1066
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,360
Wait.

1067
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,480
Maybe he is the ball

1068
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,380
and I am dearest human.

1069
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,640
This is too much.

1070
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,260
I must be on the bed.

1071
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,980
The sad dog diary clips there

1072
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,200
came from Z Frank.

1073
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,500

Frank is spelled Frank.

1076

Unless they have

control of your radio tubes.

1078
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,700
And I do too.

1079
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:46,720
Good.

1080
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,160
This is Ren Hoack.

1081
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,620
And this is Stimson J. Cat

1082
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,160
of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

1083
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,260
And you're listening

1084
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,640
to the Hour of Slack.

1085
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,440
Keep listening, you idiots.

1086
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1087
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,780
Else I shall kill you.

1088
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,300
Ha, ha.

1089
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,060
Ha, ha.

1090
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:08,060


1091
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:08,340
Ha, ha.

1092
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,900
Ha, ha.

1093
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,120
Ha, ha.

1094
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,840
B-L-N-D-N-P-G.

1095
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,440
That spells blind pig,

1096
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,580
don't you see?

1097
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,300
Teacher said with some surprise,

1098
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,320
son, you left out both the I's.

1099
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,520
Now I said, teacher, dear,

1100
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,880
won't you please say,

1101
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,160
please and listen here.

1102
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,920
Blind pigs have no eyes, you see.

1103
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,660
You're right, the teacher said to me.

1104
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,480
Ha, ha.

1105
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,160
Ha, ha.

1106
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:57,620
Ha, ha.

1107

Ha, ha.

1108
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,300
Ha, ha.

1109
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:01,540
Ha, ha.

1110
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,580
Ha, ha.

1111
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:02,620
Ha, ha.

1112
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:02,820
Ha, ha.

1113
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,620
Root for that acorn.

1114
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,040
Ha, ha.

1115
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,260
Ha, ha.

1116
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,940
Ha, ha.

1117
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,800
Ha, ha.

1118
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,780
Ha, ha.

1119
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,880
Ha, ha.

1120
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:11,880


1121
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,260
Ha, ha.

1122
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:16,720
Ha, ha.

1123
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,220
Ha, ha.

1124
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:18,240
Ha, ha.

1125
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,000
Ha, ha.

1126
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:20,660
Ha, ha.

1127
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:20,760
Ha, ha.

1128
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:20,760


1129
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:20,760


1130
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:20,760


1131
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:20,760


1132
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:20,760


1133
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:20,760


1134
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:20,760


1135
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,180
Hey, how are you doing?

1136
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,760
Yeah, I'm doing good, how you doing?

1137
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:23,700
I'm doing fine.

1138
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,040
I was thinking.

1139
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:24,500


1140
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:24,500


1141
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,920
You were talking to me.

1142
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:27,680
Yeah.

1143
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,040
Yeah.

1144
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:28,420
Yeah.

1145
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:34,340
You looked like the kind of gentleman that can appreciate a special, special interest

1146
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,540
photography, we like to call it here.

1147
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,820
What do you have?

1148
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,660
Yeah, look at this.

1149
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,080
This is.

1150
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:39,880
Are you selling something?

1151
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:51,280
Like, check that, check this out. When was the last time you saw an 8x10 color picture of a female praying mantis chewing off the head of her mate?

1152
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,440
Come on, George, that's a bad man. Let's get away.

1153
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,480
Oh, come on, take a look. Look, we got little movies here, too.

1154
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,460
Look, this one's, it's a spider chewing on a fly.

1155
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,820
Spider, do fly!

1156
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,440
Come on, these pictures are taken with an electron microscope.

1157
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,140
I want to look, I want to look, I want to look!

1158
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,160
Yeah, check it out, check it out.

1159
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,300
Oh, come on, lady. Look, this is a free country.

1160
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,420
Okay, hey, you into cockroaches?

1161
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,920
Here's a cockroach being eaten by a wolf spider wasp.

1162
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,800
Look at that, he's chewing away.

1163
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,040
You like it?

1164
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,680
Hey, look at this, these things live inside your eyelashes.

1165
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,440
Can you believe it? That's the most hideous looking thing ever seen.

1166
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,920
Oh, baby!

1167
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,380
Yeah, yeah, check it out. It's nude, man. It's all nude. You can see it.

1168
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,260
My eyebrows are nude?

1169
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,000
No, no, no, check it out, this bug, man.

1170
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,300
It's a bug?

1171
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,480
Oh, he eats me.

1172
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,740
Bug, porno.

1173
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,700
It's so dirty, bug's so dirty.

1174
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,600
Hey, honey, it's all relative.

1175
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,640
What do I do?

1176
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,680
Oh, no, no, don't you do it, you got it wrong.

1177
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,160
We don't have anything to do with, uh,

1178
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,200
we just developed the film and, uh,

1179
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:10,920
he's the processor.

1180
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,800
They do it, they do it, and they do it somewhere,

1181
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,880
that's why I can only do it with the bug, porno, or, uh, or the porno.

1182
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,300
Oh, baby!

1183
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,960
You're normally such a slacker, it's the first time you've heard of him.

1184
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,400
Are all four of you guys in here? Is Phil in there?

1185
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,320
He just, yeah, yeah.

1186
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:33,720
Can we?

1187
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:34,980
Do it with four?

1188
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:35,640
Yeah, all four.

1189
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,360
Okay, well.

1190
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:36,720
What are we doing?

1191
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,240
How do we, this is, this is.

1192
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,940
Oh, the armrest.

1193
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,460
They'll do the, they'll do the comedy.

1194
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:43,160
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Firesign Theatre.

1195
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:43,960
This is, okay.

1196
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:45,940
This is Phil.

1197
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,520
Phil.

1198
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,080
Let's take it again.

1199
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,140
Yeah, oh, Pete and Dave, okay, there we go, yeah.

1200
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,300
All right, you over here?

1201
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,320
You just shut up.

1202
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,640
This is Phil.

1203
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:53,880
Phil.

1204
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,420
Pete.

1205
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,720
And Dave of the Firesign Theatre.

1206
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,880
And we're listening to The Hour of Slack.

1207
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,300
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

1208
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,960
Because we're subgeniuses.

1209
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,280
And we're slacking off.

1210
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:14,060
And we're listening to the average movie viewer or listener out there in radio land.

1211
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,580
Here's the, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss.

1212
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:27,000
Here's listless Miss Minnie Smalls as she stirs the detergent into the top of the fugitive's head.

1213
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,300
And here she is now.

1214
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:34,220
Oh, it's spooky for her up here on this escape vessel.

1215
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,680
And of course, pouring the liquids into the fugitive's heads can be very dangerous.

1216
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,240
And so she always makes sure to wear the rubber gloves provided her by dad.

1217
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:50,580
She's not about to make the same mistake little sis made last January when she lost an eye

1218
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,880
somewhere in the backyard.

1219
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,880
Have you found that mystic eye?

1220
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,160
Have you, have you found it, dear?

1221
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,160
Have you found that mystic...

1222
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,480
What you're looking for, friend and seeker and peeker and peeker?

1223
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,860
What you want in your truest heart?

1224
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:20,280
Why have you been standing on the sidelines when you could be standing on the front lines

1225
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,160
with your foot planted firmly in your own ass?

1226
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,640
Lonesome Cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1227
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:38,220
Thank you, the late Professor Chaz Smith and the early Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1228
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,660
And thanks to a million people who have been watching this show.

1229
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,540
And thanks to a million subgeniuses for the short clips.

1230
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,660
You've been listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1231
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,960
Everything is at subgenius.com.

1232
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,020
And if you don't believe me, just look at all of it.

1233
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,020
Good luck with that.

1234
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,320
And praise Bob.

1235
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,900
Praise Bob!

1236
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,680
Get down with my sickness.

1237
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,460
We messed up.

1238
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,700
And neither can we!

1239
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:17,680
Yeah!

1240
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,200
No!

1241
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,960
No!

1242
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,680
No!

1243
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:36,780
No!

1244
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:41,980
No!

1245
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,500
No!

1246
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,080
No!

1247
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,440
No!

1248
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,040
No!
