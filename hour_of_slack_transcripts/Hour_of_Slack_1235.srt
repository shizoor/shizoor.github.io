1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,000
Bob!

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,640
Bob!

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,480
Bob!

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,260
Doves!

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,680
Bob?

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,340
Dove!

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,140
Oh, hello, Dove. What is it?

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,760
Well, it's probably not...

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,480
The subgenius power of Slack!

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,280
By God!

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,860
Thank you, Fernandin Andy Lemur!

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,840
Now, yes, dear friends,

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,520
Radio Synesthesia is Dr. Sinister's show on WCSB Cleveland,

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,340
and it happens to follow the hour of Slack at that station on Sunday nights.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,360
Dr. Sinister plays music for a while and then takes calls from listeners.

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:50,080
On December 6th, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and myself called in and chatted with Dr. Sinister

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,100
and regular caller No Money Mark for a whole hour.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,820
Normally, any given hour of Slack episode contains at least 30 different audiences,

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,240
including audio tracks.

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,900
But this time, because we have to crank out four hours of Slack in advance

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,980
before we split this beaver for Christmas,

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,260
I, Reverend Stang, your host and prayer partner,

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,380
am slacking off and just letting this single meandering conversational track

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,580
run for an entire hour unbroken with all its warts and Tourette's outbursts.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
It's an hour of subgenius conversation.

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,760
Imagine being halfway passed out,

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,820
out at a drunken party,

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,920
and this is what your subconscious hears.

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,860
Hello, you're on the air.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,060
On the air?

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm on the air now,

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,440
and I'd like to remind you I'm on the air.

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,880
Welcome to the program, sir.

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,540
Welcome to the program.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,760
I mean, thank you for welcoming me to the program.

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,160
I must say, tonight's program is, if not exciting,

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,980
at least it's on the air right now.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,620
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,740
For what that's worth.

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,540
You know, it's funny.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,740
I think you've called me a few times,

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,900
and I didn't recognize your voice at first,

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,020
and I think I might have actually hung up on you before,

44
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,440
before I realized who I was talking to,

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,380
like after I hung up.

46
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,640
Well, this is Dr. Daryl Scopes, as you know,

47
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,780
a famed editor and commentator on...

48
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,260
Monkey Trial?

49
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,020
Pardon?

50
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,080
Things haven't been the same for you since the Monkey Trial, have they?

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,880
Oh, no, no.

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,260
That Darwin stuff, I don't know.

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,960
I don't know what I'm going to do about it.

54
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,640
In the first place, what's his name?

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,800
The one who had the monkey brains.

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,200
He wanted to live under a gold standard, whatever the hell that is.

57
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,320
The cross of gold.

58
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:35,580
William Jennings Bryan?

59
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,160
He was opposed to the gold standard.

60
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,320
That's what his whole cross of gold speech was about.

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

62
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,840
Yeah, but no, William Jennings Bryan was the prosecutor in the Scopes Monkey Trial.

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,320
And he had an opposable thumb, of all things,

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,640
and he just wouldn't give credit.

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:49,860
Two of them.

66
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,880
You were chewable as well, yes.

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,880
Two of them, I said.

68
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,420
Two.

69
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,440
But they were chewable.

70
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,000
Two opposable thumbs, and he wouldn't give credit where it was due.

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,540
Wherever it was.

72
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,660
When the bill comes due, credit.

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,840
I don't know.

74
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,420
I have no idea.

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,920
Well, the most important thing is the invoice.

76
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,060
Of course.

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,180
Where they send you the money.

78
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,080
Send me the money.

79
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,880
Hello, you're on the air.

80
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,480
Take your film.

81
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,260
Oh, that was staying.

82
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,900
That was staying.

83
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,720
I just realized that as soon as I hung up on him.

84
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,380
The whole thing, you call up with a funny voice.

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,760
I don't recognize you guys at first.

86
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,540
It sounded like RC.

87
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,600
No, that was...

88
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,080
It did at first.

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,520
It did at first.

90
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,800
First, I thought it was RC, actually.

91
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,440
That was RS.

92
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,600
Reverend Stangen.

93
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,360
He's abjured.

94
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,960
If not, he'd treat it.

95
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,220
Please call back quickly.

96
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,240
Yes, please call back.

97
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,720
I apologize.

98
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,560
Okay.

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,540
Well, if anyone understands that kind of mistake, it's going to be Ivan Stang.

100
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,180
Hello, you're on the air.

101
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:42,940
I don't know.

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,620
I didn't think...

103
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:43,940
Stang.

104
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,740
No, no.

105
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,240
No?

106
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,140
See, we're not...

107
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,460
No.

108
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,120
Maybe he just assumes that you hate him because of the things you said last night.

109
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,320
Over a cup of warm urine.

110
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,220
I mean, oh, man.

111
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,820
I'm sorry.

112
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,320
I'm really sorry about that.

113
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,000
That's okay.

114
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,800
You know, the secret was bound to get out sometime.

115
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,860
You're on the air.

116
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,900
Dr. Scopes.

117
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,260
Scopes.

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,420
Scopes, I hear you.

119
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,300
I know you're there, you damn dirty ape.

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,180
Take your filthy paws off me.

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,220
You and your little primitive, slow-browed tribesmen.

122
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,200
Now we're on the...

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,800
Cavemen.

124
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,320
...part of it.

125
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,780
And cave girls.

126
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,120
We're going to eat your liver with some fava beans.

127
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,000
And a nice Chianti.

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,220
Now, is that revenge, or is that justice, or is that fairness?

129
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,100
I don't know.

130
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,240
I actually was trying to...

131
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,680
When I asked, what is justice, I was kind of alluding...

132
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,980
We mentioned Socrates earlier, and I was kind of alluding to Plato's Republic there.

133
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,120
Anybody ever try to read that?

134
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,920
I couldn't get very far into it.

135
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,080
I read the comic.

136
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,200
All the Aristotelians were just so crazy.

137
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,140
I mean, they had some...

138
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,760
They were, you know, the influence...

139
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,800
You know, Sophocles, who was also a playwright and stuff like that.

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,260
And he just started all this big, huge movement...

141
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,900
Sophocles and his sophistry.

142
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,280
...about a hundred years before Rome, wasn't it?

143
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,920
It was happening in southern Italy.

144
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,320
And...

145
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,660
I had the Aristotle action figure.

146
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:22,080
But I think that's as far as I went into philosophy or other rule books or formulae for living human life.

147
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,240
I tell you what, though...

148
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,740
Yeah, the Sophocles figurine has himself looking at himself in a mirror.

149
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


150
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


151
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


152
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


153
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,240
In the mirror, trying to figure out who he thinks he is.

154
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,680
I tell you the best part about living today...

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
And there aren't too many good things about living in this time.

156
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,760
But one of the good parts is being able to look back and say,

157
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,200
That Aristotle, what did he know?

158
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,520
Four elements, come on.

159
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,060
The jokes about the Americans and stuff.

160
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,680
You know, that doesn't amount to anything compared to the intellect that's been released like a foul gas.

161
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,320
You know, he's responsible for the Jesuits, you guys.

162
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,380
They can argue better than everybody.

163
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,140
That's all he was good for was argument.

164
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,700
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

165
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,380
Well, everybody's always looking for a formula that perfectly predicts human behavior.

166
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,220
I can't think of a more vain goal.

167
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,160
Ain't gonna happen.

168
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,980
But, boy, those philosophies sure sound good.

169
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,900
And they always have justice and fairness and rules for revenge.

170
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,120
Well, yeah, the funny thing is, is in that discussion, you know, in the part that I did read, you know...

171
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,360
So...

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


174
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


175
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


177
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


179
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


180
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


181
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,440
So, what is justice?

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,020
And people trying to give these explanations of what it was, and nobody could really explain what justice was.

183
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,240
Justice is where if somebody messes with my little girl, I'm gonna...

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,220
I want the right to skin them alive on live TV, on a reality show.

185
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,400
It might not make anything better, but it sure make me feel good.

186
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,300
Put them right on the bumper, on the hockey stick right there.

187
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,420
That's right. That's what counts.

188
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,560
Yeah, and for over 2,000 years, nobody has yet been able to explain what justice is.

189
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,280
I think eventually he tried to...

190
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,360
He tried to...

191
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,020
He tried to settle on the idea that, oh, well, it's everybody having one role in one place and sticking to it and doing it well.

192
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,700
And that's where the whole concept of the Utopian Society began.

193
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,440
But then they invented lawyers, and that went downhill from there.

194
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,760
For everybody but the lawyers. It was great for the lawyers.

195
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,860
Dr. Sinist... Plato would hate us, you see, for doing this, what we're doing right now.

196
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,980
I welcome his hatred.

197
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,480
And trying to...

198
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,840
Have you ever eaten Play-Doh?

199
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,060
It doesn't taste bad.

200
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,220
It smells good.

201
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,340
Yeah. That's what you're talking about, right? Play-Doh's Republic?

202
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,460
Yeah. You can sculpt an entire castle out of it.

203
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,360
I have a question about eating Play-Doh. Now, which colors did you eat?

204
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,200
Pink. Everybody ate pink and green. It turned brown, too, when you mixed them.

205
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,720
Oh, okay. That's too bad.

206
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,020
If I didn't need to hear that...

207
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,140
It turns brown on the way out, too.

208
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,000
I was actually eating ammonium carbonate.

209
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,580
He doesn't know that right now the gangly in the back of his head are slowly disintegrating.

210
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,280
Everything turns brown.

211
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,540
Monium carbonate.

212
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,180
It does.

213
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,160
Before it comes out.

214
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,480
Do you know why that is?

215
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,520
Dead red blood cells excreted in the large intestine.

216
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,020
Oh, is that what it is? Well, it's not the corpses of bacteria.

217
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,520
I remember reading somewhere that it's caused by dead red blood cells, yes.

218
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,180
The corpses of millions of Yevgenians floating down the river.

219
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,800
Yang Lu.

220
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,360
We figured out a...

221
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,740
Silently and...

222
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,300
There's a philosophical approach to all that.

223
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:42,420
We figured out one day on alt.slack that dirt is mostly excrement, and excrement is mostly corpses.

224
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,160
Isn't that the truth? I can't remember what the name of the poet was, but some, like...

225
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,360
There was some famous poet who wrote about that. I think it was French or something.

226
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,920
Isn't dust, like, some sort of material?

227
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,300
Not sure.

228
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,500
It comes off of human bodies.

229
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,820
House dust is mostly dead human skin. House dust is.

230
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,380
It's not to be confused with lunar dust.

231
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,760
Like, say, if you collect dead flies, just, you know, because you...

232
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,620
Well, you want to look at them or something.

233
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,540
Have I mentioned on the radio that my new hobby is looking at micro-life through microscopes?

234
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:24,180
I have a collection of slime water that I keep as sort of a jar of life from which I extract various animalcules.

235
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,920
It's true.

236
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:34,520
And I watch them have sex and fight and die and live out their tiny lives all in a drop of water on a slide.

237
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,040
Like...

238
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,140
He squeals out...

239
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,520
Like in the olden days, before television.

240
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,220
He squeals out, come look at this.

241
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,880
And other people go over there to the magnifying tubes and look down and they go, what, what?

242
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,120
They can't see it at first, right?

243
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,920
And he tells them to do some things, you know.

244
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,100
And then they go, ha, ha, ha, ha, like that.

245
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,740
I don't know what to make of it.

246
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,260
Maybe he put an ad for them in comic books.

247
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,340
Like, come look at this.

248
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,220
Have your family of slime monkeys.

249
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,560
Yeah.

250
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,880
No, the sea monkeys were actually brine shrimp.

251
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,740
Whoever thought...

252
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,720
Actually, they're called Artemia salina, not to be confused with Reverend Artemia salina.

253
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,240
But whoever thought those things looked like monkeys?

254
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,100
They look like Satan if you look at them up close.

255
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:18,960
Yeah, they do.

256
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,940
They have like a little goatee and looks like horns.

257
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,380
My...

258
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,900
I had a great moment a couple of days ago watching swallowing.

259
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,560
That was...

260
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,040
I had a great day of watching.

261
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,740
It was nematodes, which are tiny little worms.

262
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,180
But they're like dinosaurs compared to everybody else in the water drop.

263
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,920
And there were a lot of them in this particular drop.

264
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:51,400
And they were swimming around devouring these little barrel-shaped single-celled protests called co-lapses.

265
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,240
Hmm.

266
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,100
And they...

267
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,180
Maybe just more than one.

268
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,320
The great thing is these worms are transparent when they're lit from underneath.

269
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,000
So when you see it, like, suddenly snap its head around and suck a co-lapse down its mouth,

270
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,320
which is in its neck, actually,

271
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,080
it then convulses mightily and forces the co-lapse down further into its gut,

272
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,220
where you notice that there are already a bunch of co-lapses of ever-decreasing size

273
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,320
waiting to meet their new brother in death.

274
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,560
Yeah.

275
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,900
Nematodes, are those flatworms?

276
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,960
No, that's...

277
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,580
Or roundworms?

278
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,980
They're very, very little simple worms.

279
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,220
Nematoda is like a...

280
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,420
They're not the same as planarian worms, and they're not flatworms.

281
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,620
Do they have a light sensor of any kind?

282
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,100
Like, not eyes, but, you know...

283
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,840
Yeah, they do.

284
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,300
They have a photo sensor.

285
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,360
It's a little black spot on their face.

286
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,100
Right.

287
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,220
Like many worms have a black spot.

288
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,580
It's fun to watch these creatures because you're...

289
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,200
Let's face it.

290
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
You're like God to them.

291
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,940
You've...

292
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,900
You're beyond God to them.

293
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,180
They are not even...

294
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,480
The idea that you exist would never even occur to them.

295
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,840
Well, and that, of course, leads us, in turn, to wonder if maybe they're...

296
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,880
Who's looking at us through a big lens?

297
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,240
Well, staying on the world, so to speak.

298
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,740
You know, some ultra-dimensional lens.

299
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,380
They are roundworms.

300
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,860
They are the nematodes.

301
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,320
They are roundworms as opposed to flatworms.

302
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,700
Nematodes are everywhere.

303
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
They are very important worms.

304
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,040
They help, like all worms, they keep the environment working.

305
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,120
Not to be confused with segmented worms.

306
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,840
You know what I mean?

307
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,000
Right.

308
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,720
Like an earthworm.

309
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,380
It's also round, but it's a segmented worm.

310
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,780
It's different.

311
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,440
And they're not quite the same as a microanalyd, which is a very, very tiny worm.

312
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,720
Those are the furworms, I think.

313
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,320
Girls, girls, girls.

314
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,820
Let's lay off the ladies-only talk.

315
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,700
Now, you can...

316
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,860
Remember, there's a lot of secular gentlemen out there who don't understand it.

317
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,180
You can get preachy.

318
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,780
A nematode actually will look back up at you like, oh my God, what is that?

319
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,320
Actually, that is a really creepy moment.

320
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,600
There have been a couple of animalcules that as soon as...

321
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,960
It seemed as if as soon as I centered them under that microscope, they turned what they

322
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,920
have for a head upwards and glared at me balefully.

323
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,040
Much like...

324
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,160
It kind of reminded me of my attitude towards the Lord God Almighty.

325
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,580
Shaking your fist at the heavens.

326
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,220
Damn you.

327
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,340
Isn't that biological quantum theory?

328
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,020
Damn you, fights.

329
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,980
That's like biological quantum theory, Dan.

330
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,600
If an atom is going to move around funny just because you're staring at it and it takes

331
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,900
energy, he's taking it out of it to stare at it, then that means the worm knows that

332
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,480
you're staring at it somehow on some warmish level.

333
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,880
Well, it gives me the creeps as much as it creeps them out, I'm sure.

334
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,140
Yeah, I'm saying I had a question.

335
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,660
Do you think the Lord ever glares balefully at whoever might be watching him?

336
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,000
Well,

337
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,200
that's why I don't pray.

338
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,940
I don't want to draw more attention to myself.

339
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,500
You know,

340
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,360
you never know what they're going to do.

341
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
Stay undercover.

342
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,000
God is really trying to kill everyone.

343
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,200
Unfortunately.

344
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,100
So far,

345
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,440
he has succeeded in almost every case,

346
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,440
except for Jesus,

347
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,320
who supposedly lived forever or something.

348
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,420
Because of that,

349
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,580
my dad insists on being buried in Jerusalem,

350
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,000
because he figures the odds are better there.

351
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,620
That there's going to be a rock in front of his tomb.

352
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,440
Put a rock in front of his tomb.

353
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,940
There's going to be zombie martyrs walking around.

354
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,720
Well, it's like out of his zombiedom.

355
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,280
I guess that's what he's hoping.

356
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,560
No, I can tell.

357
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,980
It was obvious from the beginning

358
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,700
that Christianity was going to be divergent from Judaism, okay?

359
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,380
Because, you know,

360
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,700
the crucifixion and resurrection occurred around the time of Passover.

361
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,120
And, you know, during Passover,

362
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,720
it's just not kosher to have any leavening in your food.

363
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,380
And what did Jesus do during Passover?

364
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,140
He rose.

365
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,820
Surprising.

366
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,220
It's obviously not.

367
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,920
He is our bread.

368
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,480
And yeasty God is he.

369
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,800
He's changing from Easter to Yeaster.

370
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,060
There you go.

371
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,020
That's terrible.

372
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,460
Yes, it's my specialty.

373
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,620
View from the best.

374
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,080
515 if you want to get in on the conversation.

375
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,600
Quite ethnic on Easter Day.

376
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,360
Maybe people think about the leavening of the matcha

377
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,620
into a human figure that rolled stones.

378
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,320
No, we shouldn't make fun,

379
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,580
because Xmas is coming up,

380
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,880
and that's an important holiday.

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,200
Xmas.

382
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,040
It's an important holiday for many people.

383
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,500
And as well as X-less-ness-mas,

384
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,760
the subgenius holiday.

385
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,880
From the advent of the Spurl,

386
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,340
which some celebrate when they're...

387
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,180
They call it Christmas, but can you say that?

388
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,760
It's like at X-Day, you welcome the aliens,

389
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,460
but at X-less-ness-mas,

390
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,980
you sort of are thankful that they've spared the Earth

391
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,060
for one more six-month period.

392
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,140
Yeah.

393
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,860
Close-held twice a year?

394
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,900
No, no.

395
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,900
It's just that we expect the end of the world,

396
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,060
on an annual basis.

397
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,120
And at the halfway point,

398
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,740
we kind of give thanks that we got a little breather there.

399
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,660
X-less-ness-mas.

400
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,900
Don't ask me to explain it.

401
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,800
It's a religious thing.

402
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,960
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

403
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,340
Bob said that.

404
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,340
I don't know if they're ancestral people,

405
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,360
or if they just had both eyes poked out,

406
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,060
but I was at a reunification camp meeting the other day,

407
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,980
and there on the dais was a huge picture of Burl Ives,

408
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,080
of all insane.

409
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,680
relatives who's probably dead,

410
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,880
who I assume he is,

411
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,140
and that was the object of their worship.

412
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,940
Burl Ives?

413
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,160
Yeah, singing those weird songs,

414
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,200
like, you know, Christmas,

415
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,760
sort of that noise, you know?

416
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,840
It's a holly jolly Christmas.

417
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,780
Right, that you hear in any mall area,

418
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,780
or, you know, any mart.

419
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,660
Well, he was the snowman in that

420
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer special,

421
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,340
the stop-motion special that we all loved.

422
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,200
Temporarily.

423
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,900
He had a varied career,

424
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,700
and beyond that, though,

425
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,200
he had several other musical hits.

426
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,400
He was an actor in various things.

427
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,700
My parents hated him,

428
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,200
because he was some kind of a wobbly,

429
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,400
or a leftist, or a communist, or something.

430
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,660
Yeah, but then I heard that he was...

431
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,180
A socialist Santa Claus.

432
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,060
But then I heard he was one of the guys

433
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,320
who informed to the McCarthy hearings.

434
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,620
Oh, then he was also...

435
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:11,800
Oh, really?

436
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,560
He was a very, very fine transsexual

437
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,020
and transvestite, I guess, too,

438
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,800
before the evisceration.

439
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,440
He finked out?

440
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Well, that's...

441
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
Earl Os was a fink?

442
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,040
Yep.

443
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,300
I would say check it on Wikipedia, but...

444
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,040
Who was?

445
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,060
It is sort of interesting to note that

446
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,020
the same guy who's best remembered

447
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,460
for playing this snowman

448
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,340
also played, you know,

449
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,900
the father in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,

450
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,860
the movie version.

451
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,340
Oh, yeah.

452
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,940
Not to be confused with Sebastian Cabot.

453
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,580
Ah, no, no.

454
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,040
Or other rotund jolly guys.

455
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,880
Rotund jolly?

456
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,960
I was just thinking about Victor Bono,

457
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,820
another rotund jolly.

458
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,100
There you go, Victor Bono and Dom DeLuise.

459
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,160
Now, Dom DeLuise is worshipped as a god

460
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,560
by some people that I know,

461
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,060
or a guy that I know.

462
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,260
Casting directors would...

463
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,760
I mean, casting people would just

464
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,500
throw those names in a hat

465
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,820
when they were looking for the rotund jolly fella.

466
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,180
Right.

467
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,160
And often they'd explode on set.

468
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,320
And it was the company's fault,

469
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,480
and the production house usually had to pay the bill.

470
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,500
By the way, if anyone listening

471
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,480
who belongs to the Church of Dom DeLuise,

472
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,800
we'd like to hear from you.

473
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,500
2-1-6.

474
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,400
The message is 3-5-1-5.

475
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,920
Well, you know, he did play Caesar

476
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,060
in History of the Universe.

477
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,080
Huh?

478
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,600
He did play Caesar in History of the Universe.

479
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,040
Yes.

480
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,080
You know, and Caesar was a god among men.

481
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,340
Speaking of Mel Brooks,

482
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,140
who was honored recently at a Fetted Fet.

483
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,720
Yes, he played Caesar,

484
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,740
and he gave thumbs down after being insulted.

485
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,600
Mm-hmm.

486
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:50,440
And he was also best known for his work in Fat Joe.

487
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,940
Yeah, I don't know if any of you remember Fat Joe.

488
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,000
It was kind of an art film,

489
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,280
which featured him as a very,

490
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,800
as a jolly rotund fellow

491
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,760
who couldn't stop being jolly and rotund.

492
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,000
Did you ever hear that one?

493
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:04,620
No.

494
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,300
No?

495
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,800
Fat Joe?

496
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,980
Fat Joe.

497
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,420
All right, we got a new caller here.

498
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,920
Hello, you're on the air.

499
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,380
There's only one god out there.

500
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,600
Yeah?

501
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,580
And the anniversary of his death is coming up,

502
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,540
and that's John Lennon.

503
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,480
Aw.

504
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
You know, I disagree that he was a god,

505
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,300
but, um...

506
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,860
The anniversary of his death is coming up this very week.

507
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,040
December 8th.

508
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,920
December 8th.

509
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,240
John Lennon!

510
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,260
Hey, man, I'm a Hendrixist!

511
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,380
Death to all Lennonites!

512
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,620
I'm a Marxist-Lennonist, you know.

513
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,280
Groucho Marx and John Lennon.

514
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm a Keith Moore.

515
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,420
That's what we all are, isn't it?

516
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,400
Truly, really, if it really, truly is,

517
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,920
bringing this world together and rending it asunder.

518
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,360
Jesus Christ himself, though.

519
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,540
I'm sorry, what's that?

520
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,040
You know, he did say at one point he was,

521
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,640
he thought he was bigger than Jesus Christ.

522
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:50,760
What?

523
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,660
Actually, if you read the entire statement,

524
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,120
he was lamenting the fact that, uh...

525
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,500
He was lamenting how obsessed fans were becoming.

526
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,500
The Beatles, he said, yeah,

527
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,560
the Beatles were more popular than Jesus,

528
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,300
and he wasn't bragging and saying that was a good thing.

529
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,540
He was pointing out how incredibly shallow

530
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,800
the listening public was.

531
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,680
The shallowness of the vapid culture, which he did.

532
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,040
Yeah, they loved those jolly love songs

533
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,380
by the fabulous, mop-top, lovable singers.

534
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,100
Hey, I want to hold your hand, too.

535
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,780
Now worship me.

536
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,240
Yeah, and also, no one else mentions the, uh,

537
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,240
what, uh, Lennon said immediately after, uh,

538
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,680
the more popular Jesus thing, which is, um,

539
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,020
I'm paraphrasing here, but it's pretty close to the original quote.

540
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,500
Um, Jesus was all right, but his followers were thick and ordinary.

541
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,500
Uh, yeah, it's them twisting it that ruins it for me.

542
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,320
If John Lennon is Jesus Christ, too, then...

543
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,340
Jesus was an asshole.

544
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,420
I think, I think Jesus Christ was an asshole.

545
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:49,940
You do?

546
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:50,580
Oh, yeah.

547
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,140
You'll go on a...

548
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,580
What do you think about crepes?

549
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,780
That's who I worship.

550
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,960
I worship crepes.

551
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,300
I worship crepes.

552
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,340
Crepes almighty!

553
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,420
I worship crepes because they're tasty.

554
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,600
You always pray to them as you stub your toe.

555
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,400
Right.

556
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,120
Right.

557
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,060
He thinks you're not...

558
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,620
Why do you think Mark David Chapman assassinated him, then?

559
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,580
Mm.

560
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,300
No, it was actually Stephen King who assassinated him.

561
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,480
I ordered Mark David Chapman.

562
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,480
Yeah, he was getting orders from, uh...

563
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,000
I, acting alone, I, Reverend Ivan Stang,

564
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,400
ordered by using a telepathic headset.

565
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,440
I ordered Chapman to assassinate John Lennon that tragic day.

566
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,260
Really? Why?

567
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Well, he got the wrong person.

568
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,160
Well, I meant I was actually trying for Paul McCartney.

569
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,880
But I got mixed up as to which was the cute one and which was the smart one.

570
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,620
And, you know, thank God I didn't have Ringo knocked off.

571
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,900
It was actually my favorite.

572
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,080
Yeah, Ringo is...

573
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,500
He was funny. He was the funny one.

574
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,200
He was a jolly good fellow.

575
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,260
And if I could have any drummer in my dream...

576
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,840
band, I would pick Ringo.

577
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,280
Now, a working class hero is something to be.

578
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,200
Uh, but, uh, a rich working class hero, that's...

579
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,700
Man.

580
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,300
Then you're...

581
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,200
Then you got your cake and you're eating it, too.

582
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,160
I must say as an homage to the gentleman, the Spaniard in the works himself,

583
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,760
he did, uh, tour... Just before Chapman, and whoever's behest,

584
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,500
if you read different works of literature, some are actually...

585
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,160
Well, Stephen King, actually. I was kidding. It wasn't me.

586
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,240
It was me and Stephen King.

587
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,160
Stephen King ordered Chapman.

588
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,800
That is not as creditable, but we all know about that fellow

589
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,060
who, uh, claims that, uh, Stephen King, uh, looks so much like David Chapman

590
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,180
that that meant he assassinated...

591
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,600
Who will be the next Beatle to go?

592
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,600
Pardon?

593
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,900
Charlie Manson.

594
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,540
I'm afraid Paul McCartney is gonna be the longest-lived one

595
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,660
because he's the biggest, uh, jerk out of all of them.

596
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,100
Could you see Charlie Manson on a surfboard, you know, with Beach Boys music in the background?

597
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,120
He's got, like, the swastika in his forehead, like,

598
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,600
there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there.

599
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:55,040
There was a time when that may have happened, you know, uh, uh, Brian, uh, Wilson was into Charlie for a while there.

600
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,960
Yeah, and Anton...

601
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,680
And he recorded some of Charlie's songs.

602
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,880
Why does that not surprise me?

603
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,760
Both Brian and Anton were in the, uh, short movie.

604
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,820
See, and Guns N' Roses took an awful lot of flack for covering, uh, Charles Manson's song.

605
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,880
Why didn't Brian Wilson? Or did he?

606
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,340
I don't know. It's, it's like a, it's like a great mystery.

607
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,280
Maybe each layer is like a layer of an onion.

608
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
Maybe he could have brought Wilson to re-wrote the...

609
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,880
He could have mentioned the little, uh, cave there in, uh, Pilar Shilo's, or...

610
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,600
I'm a robot boy, I'm my mama's toy.

611
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

612
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,920
You know, maybe he could have brought Wilson to re-wrote the lyrics...

613
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,820
Uh, sorry, we could be, we could be excommunicated for saying that.

614
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,120
Which song was it that he covered, Mark?

615
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,000
Uh, it was originally called Cease to Exist, but the Beach Boys version is called Never Learn Not to Love.

616
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,100
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

617
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,100
That's rather a different approach to the theme.

618
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,880
Did you see him trying to pick up a Ned Funicello?

619
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,900
Ha, ha, ha.

620
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,360
He was walking off the beach to get a hangin' net.

621
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,180
Well, he was good at doing that.

622
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,700
He was really good at picking up stupid middle-class girls who hated their parents,

623
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,880
giving them LSD, saying he was their daddy while he had his way with them,

624
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,720
and after that, why they'd do just about anything.

625
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,800
You ever read about any of the, uh...

626
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,260
It didn't work for me. I have tried that so many times. God.

627
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,840
Well, I guess he just had to gift a gab, you know?

628
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,060
You had to have been there at the right time, you know what I mean? It was...

629
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,200
Right, yeah, yeah. I mean, when I was doing it, it was in the middle 80s,

630
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,120
and it just wasn't the same.

631
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,360
Yeah.

632
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,480
The middle 60s.

633
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,120
Well, you did...

634
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,340
The women were 20 years older, for one thing, and they'd all learn their lesson.

635
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,700
Gotta get them when they're young.

636
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,040
Yeah, yeah.

637
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,580
Yep.

638
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,500
Oh, gents. What a chauvinistic, anti-pluralistic...

639
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,760
Charlie was before...

640
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,380
...view of way of looking at...view of looking at things,

641
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,520
and clearly, unless a lot of young ladies, or even in between, or older young ladies call up

642
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,480
and voice their discontent with this,

643
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
do you...

644
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
You're not gonna let us get away with this, are you?

645
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,760
No, no.

646
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,040
No, no.

647
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,320
I mean, what is this? Pornography or empowerment?

648
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,300
Yeah.

649
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,040
That's the question.

650
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,940
And who's in charge here?

651
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,540
And who's really being exploited?

652
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,700
And who's wearing the...

653
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,620
Speaking of...

654
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,240
...number one depend...

655
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,900
Speaking of exploitation...

656
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,260
I feel exploited.

657
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,760
I'm starting to feel exploited in my pnats.

658
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,400
Speaking of exploitation, I...

659
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,760
Down in my pnats, I'm feeling exploited. I'm wishing people wouldn't exploit me and get me turned on like this.

660
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,180
Gotta pause for a moment here.

661
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,460
Portions of the following broadcast are for free.

662
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,240
Any objectionable to at least a few of you out there in the audience,

663
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,980
which is why WCSB advises listener discretion.

664
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,680
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not those of WCSB or Cleveland State University.

665
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,100
Carry on.

666
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,160
Well, of course...

667
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,720
I found a disturbing note this morning written in my own handwriting,

668
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:40,460
but I could tell that I must have either been asleep when I wrote it, or under...

669
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,440
I don't know what happened.

670
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,020
I don't know what happened to me, but my note says...

671
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,820
And about half the word's been crossed out and then rewritten in again.

672
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,080
It'll all be normal again after I take my pills.

673
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,700
Huh.

674
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,760
Why did I write that note to myself?

675
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
What? I'm not even on...

676
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I don't have any pills.

677
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,300
Did...

678
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,220
Now, you actually wrote that note to yourself?

679
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:02,660
Yeah.

680
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,440
And I don't remember doing it, and I found it this morning.

681
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,560
I know that I wrote it last night because of a piece of paper it was torn from.

682
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,060
That is weird.

683
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,420
It'll be normal again after I take my pills.

684
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,240
Now, I crossed out the word my.

685
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:16,820
Maybe...

686
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,860
So, really, I guess it's like it's supposed to be...

687
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,800
It'll be normal again after I take pills.

688
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,360
Maybe you just need a beer, and you were going to write Pilsner, and you couldn't...

689
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:27,580
Yeah.

690
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,060
Yeah, that makes sense.

691
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,640
You know, now that you mention it, I think I do need a beer.

692
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,100
Yeah, you know, one a day...

693
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,840
A nice Pilsner Urquell.

694
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,760
One or two a day, it's good for you.

695
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,460
I know this is not a commercial station, but it's a beautiful beer.

696
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,100
What is?

697
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,520
A Pilsner Urquell.

698
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,040
I've heard that...

699
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,480
It's a commercial now.

700
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,400
It's a Pilsner Urquell.

701
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,460
Yeah, you can get the real stuff from Czech Republic.

702
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,080
There's a...

703
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,600
There's a...

704
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,720
Victory makes a beer called Prima Pils, spelled P-I-L-S.

705
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,840
Did you write two Ls in your note to yourself?

706
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,680
Yeah, I did.

707
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,500
So, I did...

708
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,200
Obviously, it didn't mean Dobbs approved subgenius pills, because that's always spelled with

709
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,360
one L, as in more them kind pills, bod.

710
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,680
So, yeah.

711
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,080
Yeah.

712
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,840
It's very...

713
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,220
It obviously means other pills, not church pills.

714
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,620
Everything will be fine once I take my cyanide pill.

715
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,580
Yeah, really.

716
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,360
Well, that too, but that's like a different sort of fine.

717
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,700
Well, along those lines...

718
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,560
It's a fine you don't have to really think about or notice or...

719
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,520
What about the other note along those lines?

720
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,280
That was the F-flat.

721
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,720
The other note that you said you found and you didn't know you wrote or under what circumstances,

722
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,080
and it looked kind of old and said, Kiltrotsky, Kiltrotsky.

723
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,500
What was that all about?

724
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,640
Did you ever figure that out?

725
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,620
I've been in the room where Trotsky was killed.

726
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,540
You were down there in Mexico?

727
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,360
In Mexico City, yeah, Cuyhuacan.

728
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,320
It's a neighborhood there.

729
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,020
It's kind of like...

730
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,900
This is like 12 years ago, but it was kind of a hippie neighborhood, actually.

731
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,840
And they made a museum out of the house that he lived in.

732
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,720
Wow.

733
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,000
It's really cool.

734
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,180
Well, that is quite a Kerouacian vacation.

735
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,060
Let's go down to Trotskyland, where he got an ice pick shot.

736
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


737
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


738
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


739
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


740
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


741
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


742
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


743
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


744
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


745
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


746
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


747
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


748
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


749
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


750
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


751
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,060


752
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,720
He had a cup in his head.

753
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:16,020
I would show off the pictures of me next to his statue there, but I was an ugly teenager

754
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,660
at the time.

755
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,260
Well, I have a cup.

756
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,020
I have a coffee cup with Joe Stalin on it.

757
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,000
You know what I mean?

758
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,660
It's like it's...

759
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,660
Never mind.

760
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,600
Dave, you could be in big trouble for having a coffee cup like that.

761
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,680
Well, it was a joke because everybody, no matter left, right, or in between, if you

762
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,960
follow the dialectical so forth, would agree.

763
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,040


764
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,040


765
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,640
That he was not a very nice person.

766
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,700
Right.

767
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,820
Oh, I have a whole...

768
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:49,460
I have a couple of Mao buttons I picked up in China back when, about 30 years ago.

769
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,100
Mao Zedong.

770
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,140
A friend of mine has a T-shirt that says that.

771
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,420
What does that mean?

772
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,880
Well, figuratively, it means long live Chairman Mao, but literally it means Chairman Mao,

773
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,200
10,000 years old, which is how they say long live in Chinese.

774
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,380
Yeah, it's like, may they be 10,000 years old.

775
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,740
I know how to say it.

776
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,040
In Yi San Xun.

777
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,040


778
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,260
I know how to say it.

779
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,000
I know how to say it.

780
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,860
And also, hao la, hao la, ha ha ha ha ha ha.

781
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,260
That means I'm laughing while I go, okay, okay.

782
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,380
Hao la, hao la, you know.

783
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,560
I want a beer.

784
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,480
I want a beer.

785
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,740
That actually means, apparently means I want a basketball, but I thought it meant please

786
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,820
give me a beer.

787
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,260
Lan Qiu is basketball.

788
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,240
Beer is beer.

789
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,040
Well, apparently the way I was pronouncing it, which got my ear kicked out.

790
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,040


791
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,040


792
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,040


793
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,040


794
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,040


795
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,120
I can't detect the difference in tones, but.

796
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,800
You, Jung Wah devil you.

797
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,780
I don't know.

798
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,120
Maybe.

799
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,860
What's your fluency in the Beijing dialect?

800
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,560
Is it the main language?

801
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,540
You know, probably what it means is please give me a wedgie.

802
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,280
No.

803
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,800
And they just tell us round eyes that it means please give me a beer.

804
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,180
No, yao is want.

805
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,680
And they laugh at it every time we do it.

806
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,360
Yao can mean want or it can also mean like to require.

807
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:04,880
Like, um.

808
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,700
Well, you.

809
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,020
Like, I don't know.

810
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,020


811
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:15,180
Like, uh, from Beijing to Shanghai, yao duo jiu, which literally means how much time

812
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,940
does it take to go from Beijing to Shanghai?

813
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,700
And in that case, yao is like, you know, requires how much?

814
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,040
Oh, incidentally, but what we're mentioning.

815
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,060
There is a subgenius devival coming up in Shanghai, China.

816
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,000
You're kidding me.

817
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,020
No, no, I'm not.

818
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,640
It's, uh, there really is.

819
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,180
It's several months away.

820
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,800
I think, uh.

821
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:48,580
My guess is that there will be a.

822
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,620
Oh!

823
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:50,780


824
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,780
Anyway, I just amount one year to China and China which hundred percent depends

825
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,140
on how around China, she said China will grow and then China ultimately will also participate.

826
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,480
Yeah.

827
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,240
She's shuddering and she's about talked.

828
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,960
Russia's got a smaller population than Taiwan so China's not going to under our control.

829
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,120
Oh.

830
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,020
Will it be Shanghainese or Beijing or will it be in Mandarin or Shanghainese?

831
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,020
I don't know.

832
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,080
Did you hear when Obama went to China, he greeted the crowd with the local Shanghainese dialect?

833
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,940
He said Donghao instead of Da Jiahao, which is how you would greet a crowd in Mandarin.

834
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,060
That's pretty hip.

835
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,960
His PR flags are pretty good there.

836
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,980
Well, that was kind of a jab.

837
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,120
That was kind of a jab at China when he did that.

838
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,000
That's kind of a jab at the Chinese government, which is trying to encourage the Shanghainese to speak more Mandarin and less Shanghainese.

839
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,880
So that was kind of a subtle jab there.

840
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,300
They want to haunt people to honor the whole place all the time everywhere.

841
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,940
That's not very good for democracy.

842
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,940
God, man, I feel like I'm there again.

843
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,640
You don't want to be there again?

844
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,640
No, it's nice now, or it's bad now.

845
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,100
You know, nothing changes.

846
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,800
It gets worse and better at the same time.

847
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,900
Oh, if they can do this and they can do that, then we find out that materialism is stupid and crass,

848
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,880
and it's just responsible for as much evil as any form of collectivism.

849
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,560
And then the next thing, you know, it's even, in my opinion, you know, I'm...

850
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,260
Well, you're like some kind of a commie weirdo.

851
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:13,720
Like?

852
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,320
Like a wiggly or whatever they call him.

853
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,460
A Marxist-Leninist.

854
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,700
John Marx and Groucho Lenin.

855
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,360
Yeah, yeah, I see.

856
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, I see.

857
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
Say the secret word and be bigger than Jesus.

858
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm a Keatonist.

859
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,040
Buster Keatonist.

860
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Buster Keatonist.

861
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,340
Busty Keaton.

862
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,280
Yeah.

863
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,440
I am not a jelly roll, as John Kennedy told the people of Berlin when he arrived.

864
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,680
You know, the whole jelly roll thing, it's not really...

865
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,100
There is a type of pastry called a Berliner, but nobody took what he said as,

866
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,880
I'm a jelly roll.

867
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,580
Nobody took that.

868
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,120
Now, a friend of mine...

869
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,080
The reason the crowd laughed after that is because he had a translator there

870
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,700
who was translating everything he said into German,

871
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,520
and then the translator had to pause after he said,

872
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,460
Ich bin ein Berliner, and then like...

873
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,480
Fuck you.

874
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,360
And the crowd kind of laughed and said,

875
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,080
I will wait there while the translator translates my German.

876
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,020
We had a funny moment in Germany when I was there.

877
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:23,500
This friend of mine in a grocery store asked for a grocery bag to carry his stuff on,

878
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,860
but the way he put it was he looked at the clerk and said,

879
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,980
Do you have a sack?

880
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,440
And the fellow looked at him and said in English,

881
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,360
Yes.

882
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,140
I have...

883
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,760
I have a sack.

884
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,500
Sack in German, of course, refers to the testicular sack.

885
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:51,020
And so the German man was rather dryly answering in the affirmative,

886
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,340
but obviously the way he said it, he meant both ways.

887
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,020
He said, yes, I have a sack.

888
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,520
I also have a bag, if that's what you're asking for, you know.

889
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,320
And it'll be one Deutschmark, please.

890
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,360
Or one euro.

891
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,080
They charge for bags there because they don't want you to waste them like we do here.

892
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,660
Well, they do in California.

893
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,220
Uber, all is my income.

894
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,500
Oh, to California they charge for you to have a shadow.

895
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,060
Because they're going broke.

896
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,840
Five little baskets for each...

897
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,000
See, actually, they should subsidize people's shadows because it will be environmentally friendly.

898
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,500
It will help fight global warming.

899
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,100
That is a beautiful thought.

900
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,500
That is beautiful.

901
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,120
Speaking of global warming, I've noticed that it's December 6th in northern Ohio,

902
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,580
and it hasn't snowed.

903
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,840
Not substantially.

904
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,560
My backyard didn't freeze over until yesterday.

905
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,680
I've been collecting nematodes up until the day before yesterday.

906
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,420
How can this be?

907
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,360
Well, considering that I am now in a job where I spend most of my time outdoors,

908
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,680
I hope it waits a while.

909
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,360
Right, but isn't that a little unusual?

910
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,380
I seem to remember normally having to fight through the snow in October.

911
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,560
You know, if it didn't shrink the...

912
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,040
What is unusual in the past 10 years of bitter, bitter winters?

913
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,680
Because even with the crappiest, crappiest weather in the nation,

914
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,840
we still had Indian summers once in a while, and we still had, like...

915
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,020
How?

916
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,780
In December, it would go up about 50 or something.

917
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,300
Man, what's going on? This is weird.

918
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,120
I remember Election Day last year. It was like 75 or something.

919
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,400
15 years ago was really, really bad.

920
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,220
The gods are angry.

921
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,680
They were very angry.

922
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,080
The volcano god is angry.

923
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,600
Welcome to the wonderful world of global warming.

924
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,120
Which we all know is a hoax, thanks to those...

925
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,460
What's that?

926
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,120
Well, the interesting thing...

927
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,760
The greatest thing about global warming is it could...

928
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,360
The latest thing is it could lead to a sudden ice age.

929
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,380
In Europe?

930
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,940
Within only just a few months, just like in that terrible movie.

931
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,800
No, in Europe, actually, they've been...

932
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,600
This is something I heard about years ago, actually.

933
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:59,580
As the ice caps melt, it can mess up the salinity of the ocean currents,

934
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,040
such as the Gulf Stream.

935
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,460
And if the Gulf Stream were to be reversed,

936
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,060
or stopped altogether, then...

937
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,680
Keep in mind, Europe is like, you know...

938
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,680
The same latitude we're at is like Italy, Greece, Southern Europe.

939
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,800
We're at the same latitude there.

940
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,520
We are.

941
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,800
And the same as Napa Valley and...

942
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,200
Yeah, England.

943
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,220
Which is why grapes grow fairly nicely all the way along there.

944
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,860
North of England is the same latitude as Alaska.

945
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:27,940
Yep.

946
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,860
People just don't know this.

947
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,160
They don't know this stuff.

948
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,440
I didn't know...

949
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:33,780
I didn't know that.

950
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,420
I was really messed up there.

951
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,000
I thought that Cleveland was roughly about the same latitude as London.

952
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,460
London is over...

953
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,840
Yeah, like the southern tip of Britain is like around 50 degrees north.

954
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,960
Yeah, I'm not surprised...

955
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,200
This time of year it gets dark at 2 o'clock, man.

956
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,620
I mean, it's like real early.

957
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,400
And the moon looks real weird.

958
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,520
I'm not surprised I'm wrong.

959
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,320
Huh?

960
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,540
I'm not surprised to be wrong.

961
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,720
Well, most people go their entire lives never knowing what latitude they're at.

962
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,440
Dallas is at 33 degrees north.

963
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,520
Well, of course.

964
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,720
I know this from the Big Book of Conspiracies.

965
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,680
Yeah, it's the only...

966
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,440
The king kill.

967
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,380
It's the only way...

968
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,760
The only place to properly kill the king in the right ritual way.

969
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,840
I don't know if you heard this a couple of years ago, but this guy called up the show

970
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,260
who...

971
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,440
I still hear him calling into CSB occasionally.

972
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,600
He hasn't called this show in a long time.

973
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,540
But he called up and asked, why is Texas the king?

974
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,360
And I said, what on earth are you talking about?

975
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,280
And he said, well, of all the states, Texas represents the king.

976
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,720
And I want to know why.

977
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,240
And I said, what are you talking about?

978
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,040
He says, look on the $1 bill.

979
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,580
And he says, if it was issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Texas, it's got a letter K in the middle of that seal off to the left of George Washington there.

980
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,220
Huh?

981
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,560
Why?

982
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,560
K for king?

983
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,220
Why is...

984
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,100
Well, the answer to that question is that there are 12 Federal Reserve Districts around the country numbered 1 through 12.

985
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,200
Dallas is the 11th district.

986
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,700
You'll also see 11s in all four corners of a $1 bill issued by that seal.

987
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,820
And K is the 11th...

988
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
Boy, they got you fooled.

989
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,320
K is the 11th letter of the...

990
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,580
Who would argue one of the sheeple?

991
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,420
Why is Cleveland getting a D?

992
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,920
You know, we're just barely passing.

993
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,580
DNA level D.

994
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,420
We didn't fail, but we...

995
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:14,620
We're getting killed.

996
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,520
D.

997
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,140
Didn't some band, didn't there a band in Cleveland called DNA Level C?

998
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,320
That is a very old take on a very old brain rot joke.

999
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,700
Well, I know, I know.

1000
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,200
That's where I remember it from.

1001
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,100
But they're...

1002
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,800
About five years ago, I remember reading about some...

1003
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,440
It was a girl band in Cleveland called DNA Level C.

1004
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,120
And I thought, how nice.

1005
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,060
I think I know where they got that gag.

1006
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,860
Although it's pretty obvious, really.

1007
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,840
I don't get it.

1008
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,000
Nice to see them wearing...

1009
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,440
It's Cleveland.

1010
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,860
DNA Level C is Cleveland backwards.

1011
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,740
Ah, okay.

1012
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,440
See, I don't think in backwards, right?

1013
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,680
Well, that's because you're not quite psychotic and kooky enough.

1014
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:03,120
I ran into a visionary who was really agitated over the little TM.

1015
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,520
And circled C's that he found on all of his rock and roll CDs.

1016
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,580
And he decided that...

1017
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,600
He knew that, you know, no one else could explain this,

1018
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,320
but he had deduced on his own that the little C with the circle around it

1019
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,540
meant conspiracy or something like that.

1020
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,960
And the TM meant transcendental meditation or something.

1021
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:31,020
So some were ruled by heaven and other CDs and bands were ruled by Satan,

1022
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,800
depending on which of those marks.

1023
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,440
But most...

1024
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,320
Most of them were ruled by both.

1025
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,600
Well, I would only trust...

1026
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,180
I would only trust if it were ruled by Satan.

1027
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,280
You know, I believe...

1028
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,820
Well, I believe the Bible justifies Satanism.

1029
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,260
Well, now, Satan would be C or TM.

1030
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,640
He is both and then some.

1031
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,540
Which would Satan be, TM or C?

1032
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,560
He is both and all and so much more.

1033
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,180
So he'd actually be the copyright and the trademark of all things?

1034
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,240
And then some.

1035
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,920
And then some.

1036
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,100
And then he is on top of that.

1037
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,440
He is all of it and he is in addition to it, yes.

1038
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,720
If you're a true Aristotelian,

1039
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,740
then that means that you accept that evil is as natural as...

1040
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,640
You're making the mistake of assuming that Satan is evil.

1041
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,440
Evil.

1042
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,580
Well, or...

1043
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,400
To Bob, good and evil are the same thing.

1044
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,740
Yeah, what about Nietzsche and all those other people with syphilis in the brain?

1045
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,040
They thought that the Uberman was beyond good and evil

1046
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,320
and so that Zusser and them guys could all...

1047
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,540
Yeah, well, guys that think they're over men always say that.

1048
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,140
Well, here's...

1049
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,320
Here's my explanation for that very briefly.

1050
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:41,060
I mean, let's take a look, you know, at the Garden of Eden situation in Genesis there.

1051
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,340
You know, the God tells them,

1052
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,720
hey, don't eat that fruit there or you will die that very day.

1053
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,320
And the serpent comes along and says,

1054
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,740
oh, no, no, no, that's not really so.

1055
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,780
You will actually...

1056
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,720
Your eyes will be opened and you'll understand the difference between good and evil

1057
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,700
and then you'll be just like God

1058
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,920
and that's why he doesn't want you to eat it.

1059
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,320
So go ahead.

1060
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,240
You won't die.

1061
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,900
Your eyes will be open.

1062
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,760
You'll be like God's.

1063
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,420
You'll know good from evil.

1064
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,460
And then what happens when they eat the fruit?

1065
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,760
Their eyes were opened.

1066
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,120
So...

1067
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,680
Suddenly they realized they knew good from evil

1068
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,860
and then suddenly they felt bad about disobeying God

1069
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,240
which kind of proves that it was a setup.

1070
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,680
You know what I mean?

1071
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,920
They had no way of understanding what a divine command was.

1072
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,660
So it really was a setup from the very beginning

1073
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,040
and then they realized what had happened.

1074
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,340
Then they got expelled.

1075
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,900
But they didn't die that day.

1076
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,140
They lived to be like 900 years old

1077
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,420
which is longer than anybody I know has ever lived.

1078
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,280
Well, but Stan would argue with his, you know,

1079
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,440
going around crushing time pieces and stuff

1080
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,000
and other such absurd behavior

1081
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,900
that their conception of time,

1082
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,820
they did indeed.

1083
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,740
They did indeed die the next day

1084
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,060
which was 900 years later.

1085
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,180
And then, you know,

1086
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,460
and then the Lord basically says,

1087
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,820
you will do as I say

1088
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,960
or you will burn in hell for all eternity.

1089
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,220
And that's, you know,

1090
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,920
that's a very harsh, cruel thing to say.

1091
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,380
And what is Satan?

1092
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,640
He's the opposition.

1093
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,360
You know what I mean?

1094
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,700
When you've got a dictator who says,

1095
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,420
do as I say

1096
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,200
or you'll be tortured for all eternity,

1097
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,260
that's obviously an evil thing.

1098
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,020
And then you've got somebody who is the resistance.

1099
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,140
So there's a moral imperative to support the resistance

1100
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,100
when you've got somebody

1101
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,280
holding the entire world hostage like that.

1102
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,660
You must support the resistance.

1103
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,520
Moral imperative.

1104
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:05,960
War on God!

1105
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,160
Yes.

1106
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,040
It's a tough, we're still not, I mean, death.

1107
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,040
It's a bit quixotic, you know what I mean?

1108
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,620
You're tilting at windmills, basically.

1109
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,460
Right, exactly.

1110
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,460
What could be more vain?

1111
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,420
But, you know, what are you going to do?

1112
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,860
Sit around and let this big man in the sky push you around?

1113
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,760
If you ever get a chance to see a movie

1114
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,640
that came out this year called

1115
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,580
The Invention of Lying,

1116
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,000
it is a,

1117
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,980
a real must-see

1118
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,300
for disbelievers,

1119
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,420
mutants, misfits,

1120
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,380
and those who believe anything.

1121
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,180
It takes place in a world

1122
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,240
where lying has never been invented.

1123
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,160
So it's kind of allegorical, you might say.

1124
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,220
People there must be pretty dumb.

1125
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,600
Oh, yeah.

1126
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,000
And it's kind of like the first subgenius comes along

1127
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,920
and invents the lie.

1128
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,960
And that leads to having,

1129
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,540
well, I don't want to spoil it for everybody,

1130
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,760
but the upcoming hour of Slack,

1131
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,660
we'll spoil it for everybody.

1132
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,960
All right, what's the title of that film again?

1133
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,600
Huh?

1134
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,920
What's the title of that film?

1135
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,300
It's called The Invention of Lying.

1136
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,100
It was not a big Hollywood release.

1137
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,020
I get the impression it's kind of low budget,

1138
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,380
but it has a lot of very recognizable character actors,

1139
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,760
comedy actors in it.

1140
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,060
Ricky Gervais is the star.

1141
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Mark, you've heard of it.

1142
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,740
If I have.

1143
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,620
See, you're hip to a lot of things I don't know about.

1144
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,660
That's why we keep you around.

1145
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,340
I read about it in the Onion movie reviews.

1146
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:31,860
The Onion,

1147
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,500
the Onion covers, you know,

1148
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,800
art house movies and documentaries and stuff.

1149
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,320
How exactly does one approach

1150
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,180
reading a review in The Onion,

1151
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,580
considering how one must approach

1152
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,760
reading everything else in The Onion?

1153
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,020
Yeah, that's a good question.

1154
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,220
I don't know where all the reviews are.

1155
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,180
Answer it.

1156
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,660
I suppose if The Onion's reviewing it in the first place,

1157
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,580
that's a vote of confidence.

1158
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,620
Well, The Onion AV Club is a different publication

1159
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,080
than the regular paper.

1160
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:57,800
Uh-huh.

1161
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,520
Right, right.

1162
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,980
So that means you can't believe it.

1163
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:01,980


1164
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,720
You can only believe the reviews.

1165
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,020
You can only believe what they print in the regular Onion.

1166
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,980
Oh, God, boy.

1167
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,160
Every now and then,

1168
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,280
they have a fabulous little bit.

1169
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,140
My favorite one recently was,

1170
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,180
I'll be damned if I'll let a black president

1171
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,340
pay for my kidney dialysis.

1172
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,500
It had me weeping with laughter.

1173
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,240
It was such a,

1174
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,480
I'm going to dig my own grave

1175
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,740
rather than let a black president

1176
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:31,980
pay for my kidney dialysis.

1177
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,620
It was such a,

1178
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:32,620


1179
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,840
help me prolong my life.

1180
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,860
Praise The Onion.

1181
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,420
I remember back when they was new.

1182
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,340
I used to read Onion news on The Hour of Slack

1183
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,400
20 years ago,

1184
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,060
and they really appreciated it

1185
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,300
because in those days,

1186
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,860
nobody knew who they were.

1187
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,460
And it was like,

1188
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,980
oh, wow, we've made the big time.

1189
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,100
The Hour of Slack is reading our stuff.

1190
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,880
Of course, now they have their own TV network,

1191
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,780
and we're still on the air in Madison, Wisconsin.

1192
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,020
I wonder how they make it.

1193
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,900
And everybody important

1194
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,380
still has their own TV syndicate,

1195
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,020
and everybody's well ensconced.

1196
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,240
That's the damn thing.

1197
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,540
Everybody but us.

1198
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,000
We don't got no TV show.

1199
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,040
But in the spirit of things,

1200
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,180
shouldn't we be grateful and thankful

1201
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,180
that others are doing well,

1202
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,720
even using our material,

1203
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,600
outright?

1204
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,520
Did you know that Reverend Angry Larry

1205
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,900
has a TV show now?

1206
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,100
Really?

1207
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,640
Is this like a public access show?

1208
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,300
No.

1209
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,420
It's a,

1210
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,640
he is producing a show

1211
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,020
for one of the network affiliates in Detroit.

1212
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,700
It'll only be in Detroit,

1213
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,080
but it's a broadcast TV network.

1214
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,740
Gosh, if only I could do.

1215
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,040
It's called The Dead Dave Show,

1216
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,120
and it's a skitcom

1217
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,540
about what living,

1218
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,100
dead do when they're not eating your brains.

1219
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,300
They've actually finished the pilot.

1220
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,840
It's the video work is done by Colin Dewar,

1221
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,360
who's the guy who's been doing their,

1222
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,740
that horror movie that they've been gradually making,

1223
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,960
which is pretty good.

1224
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,320
And it's a sick comedy sitcom

1225
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,460
with Reverend Angry Larry

1226
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,880
playing an angry, grouchy, living, dead guy.

1227
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,800
It's, and it's a half hour show.

1228
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,660
And they need advertising.

1229
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,180
They need advertisers.

1230
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,040
So, so if you're selling in Detroit,

1231
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,540
you might want to look into that.

1232
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,260
But yeah, The Dead Dave Show.

1233
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,980
And it, it, it premieres in January, I believe.

1234
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,460
So it's like one of our own

1235
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,900
is finally doing a proper show.

1236
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,200
And they're, and just like Pee Wee Herman had

1237
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,420
on his playhouse,

1238
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,020
there's a nice picture of Bob on the set.

1239
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,560
Now, where in the playhouse was the Dobbs head?

1240
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,640
Well, it was seen in,

1241
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,760
in the opening credits of every show

1242
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,220
during the first season.

1243
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,920
It was just on a wall, but,

1244
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,580
Like in which part of the playhouse?

1245
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,880
I'm picturing the set in my head now.

1246
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,040
With the door that,

1247
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,960
He's clocky and cherry and stuff.

1248
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,700
Was Cherry off to the left?

1249
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,360
Cherry was to the left.

1250
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,860
And so was the, the, the genie guy, right?

1251
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,780
He was like a zombie.

1252
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,640
He was like on a little,

1253
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,820
Well, the Dobbs head then would have been

1254
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,080
in a kind of an alcove full of,

1255
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,420
like bullet,

1256
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,180
bulletin board alcove in the middle.

1257
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,180
Oh yes, oh yes.

1258
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,180
There was a bulletin board.

1259
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:33,740
I, geez.

1260
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,800
And it was very clearly seen.

1261
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,100
My favorite use of it was when the word,

1262
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,080
the word of the day is okay.

1263
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,540
And he, as Pee Wee said this in closeup,

1264
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,620
the Dobbs head was very clearly visible next time.

1265
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:50,860
Seriously.

1266
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,820
Millions of five-year-olds all over the country

1267
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,500
got to see Pee Wee going,

1268
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,340
okay, with this Dobbs head, right?

1269
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,100
Next to it.

1270
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,120
Wow.

1271
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,380
And I might've been one of them.

1272
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,420
You might've been.

1273
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,460
What year did that air?

1274
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,600
That was in the 80s, around 84, 85.

1275
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,020
I would, I'm guessing.

1276
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,780
My kids were little,

1277
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,420
but old enough to really enjoy it.

1278
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:15,860
86.

1279
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,680
When did he go off?

1280
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,720
When did that go off the air?

1281
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,200
Well, he was on, I think two, two seasons.

1282
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,420
And then years.

1283
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,660
So I think I might've been like in, in, in,

1284
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,240
I remember seeing that show on Saturday morning

1285
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,400
when I was in kindergarten or something.

1286
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,900
I remember seeing it every single episode

1287
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,160
and taping them.

1288
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,760
I probably got them all on Betamax somewhere in a closet.

1289
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,540
The original pilot was very, very nice.

1290
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,840
Do you remember that one staying Pee Wee's Playhouse palette

1291
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,500
of the pilot with Captain Carl?

1292
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,780
You mean before it was exactly, oh my God.

1293
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,440
I never got to see it,

1294
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,040
but one of my buddies did the music for that.

1295
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,400
He got beaten out by Danny Elfman.

1296
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,860
When push came to shove.

1297
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,120
Mother's boy, right?

1298
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:02,940
Reverend.

1299
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:03,500
No, no.

1300
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,020
Mother's boy ended up doing the music for Pee Wee's Playhouse.

1301
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,220
Well, who did it for the pilot?

1302
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,940
Jay Condom.

1303
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,340
Reverend Jay Condom, also known as Jay Cotton,

1304
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,580
who used to work with Gary Panter.

1305
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:18,980
Right.

1306
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,100
Gary Panter did some of the set of the original.

1307
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:21,720
Yeah, right.

1308
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,180
Gary, Gary did the set design and he got an Emmy for it.

1309
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,220
But Jay did the music for Pee Wee

1310
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,400
until Pee Wee got the pilot.

1311
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,220
And as typical of Jay's luck,

1312
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,360
as soon as Pee Wee got famous,

1313
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,020
the more famous guys got to do the music.

1314
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,780
But the happy ending of all this is

1315
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,740
Jay is now dating Kitten Natividad

1316
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,680
of Russ Meyer fame.

1317
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,920
Yes, Kitten Natividad,

1318
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,040
the most beautiful softcore porno actress

1319
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,300
who ever existed.

1320
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,940
Most sweet and charming.

1321
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,940
What a beautiful smile.

1322
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,420
Well, you're just a child,

1323
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,140
but for the old perverts out there,

1324
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,560
they're going, oh my God,

1325
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,920
a subgenius is dating Kitten?

1326
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,500
And it's true.

1327
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,020
Join the church and you will get laid.

1328
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,960
Kitten had, she was famous for her wonderful knockers,

1329
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,660
but she had breast cancer a few years ago.

1330
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,800
And now, as Jay put it, has both arms.

1331
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,640
Oh, man.

1332
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,400
She actually got cut.

1333
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,080
I'm kind of mad at him for saying,

1334
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,240
for specifically telling.

1335
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,520
So they're not implants,

1336
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,340
they're prostheses that can be detached.

1337
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,060
Yeah, but apparently it still works.

1338
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,120
At least she's still alive.

1339
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:40,940
Well, it worked.

1340
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1341
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,760
At minimum wage, though.

1342
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,980
You know, let's think of this practically.

1343
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,600
If this woman expects to be considered a drawbridge,

1344
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,060
she's going to have to at least pay the piper.

1345
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,460
You know what really shocked me?

1346
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,400
Within the last couple of years,

1347
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,140
I've noticed breast-related humor

1348
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,000
getting into breast cancer awareness.

1349
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,300
It's literature.

1350
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,700
Have you ever seen anyone wearing a T-shirt

1351
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,140
that says, save the ta-tas with a little pink ribbon on it?

1352
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:06,760
No.

1353
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,100
Or save second base?

1354
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,740
I didn't see.

1355
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,340
Yeah.

1356
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,960
I didn't catch the end of a commercial

1357
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,880
that freaked me out that said,

1358
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,200
together we'll lick breast cancer.

1359
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,200
See, I was saying in that.

1360
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,740
It was later explained to me

1361
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,060
that that was a tie-in to like some ice cream promotion

1362
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,280
and breast cancer awareness thing.

1363
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,180
And, you know, it was like licking the,

1364
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,640
or lollipops or something,

1365
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,580
but it was...

1366
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,380
Well, in 2004,

1367
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,440
in 2000 and 2004,

1368
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,600
it was all about, you know,

1369
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,660
we need to go out and lick Bush.

1370
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:38,840
Yeah.

1371
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,340
The first PSA that I heard,

1372
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,080
it said...

1373
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,880
I'm just going to bleep out the little comment.

1374
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,200
One thing.

1375
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,420
That's the first thing I bleeped all night.

1376
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:53,860
Yeah.

1377
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,800
Way to go, Dave.

1378
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,580
I got bleeped?

1379
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,000
Yes, you did, actually.

1380
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:58,520
That was...

1381
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:58,900
No.

1382
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,200
Actually, it was kind of funny.

1383
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,560
You used a proper word or whatever,

1384
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,580
but it was like very specific and explicit,

1385
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,380
so I decided not to...

1386
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,540
Not to take a chance.

1387
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,860
Not that anyone's listening right now.

1388
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,360
You know I'm incapable of putting two and two together

1389
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,660
and getting the appropriate numbers afterwards.

1390
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,920
I tried very hard, so I'm sorry.

1391
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,160
Oh, dude, no.

1392
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,700
Fuck on.

1393
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,000
It's a good thing.

1394
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,280
If one of your comments gets bleeped,

1395
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,340
that's a badge of honor.

1396
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,220
It's sort of a crude, despicable...

1397
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,080
You've got to be pretty bad to get bleeped on this program.

1398
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,600
You can use nothing but scientific terminology

1399
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,740
and still be obscene.

1400
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:35,840
Yeah.

1401
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,080
Just because of the visual

1402
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,760
that you're putting into people's heads.

1403
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,520
Dave!

1404
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,420
Now, we could have an educational...

1405
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,400
You know what I want to do sometime?

1406
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,640
I want to do a sex ed program.

1407
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,000
You know, for all the kids out there

1408
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,580
who are getting abstinence-only education,

1409
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,220
I want to teach them the truth about the birds and the bees,

1410
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,760
you know, and I will be scientific and educational about it,

1411
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,900
and that's not obscene.

1412
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,620
You know, if I wanted to explain to children that...

1413
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,240
You know, well, never mind.

1414
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,580
Yeah, you don't need to explain it to us right now

1415
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,160
because we might get kicked off the station.

1416
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:06,900
Well...

1417
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,160
Because it's not a sex education show yet.

1418
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,100
Not yet.

1419
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,020
But it is in the early pilot stage.

1420
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:15,500
I took out...

1421
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,620
For part of my science requirement here at CSU,

1422
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,580
there's actually a course in the biology department

1423
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,640
on human reproduction and development,

1424
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,740
and you spend the entire semester

1425
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,540
studying the development of a sperm and an egg

1426
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,240
into a baby.

1427
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,020
And the...

1428
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,260
Yeah, like one day at the end of class,

1429
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,300
the professor was like,

1430
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,060
okay, and, you know, come back on Friday,

1431
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,600
we'll be studying genital anatomy.

1432
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,420
I'm like, well, I normally do that for fun.

1433
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,200
Oh, by the way, folks, I'm pregnant again.

1434
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,080
Well, not really.

1435
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,660
I'm not pregnant, but I'm going to be a grandpa again.

1436
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,920
Oh, I didn't even say that.

1437
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,000
Congratulations, man.

1438
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,600
You didn't even say that.

1439
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,160
Was this...

1440
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,820
Yeah, I'm going to...

1441
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,320
Is this your daughter or daughter-in-law?

1442
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,560
Or that's how you...

1443
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:58,860
Yeah, my...

1444
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,220
My...

1445
00:53:59,400 --> 00:53:59,760
My daughter.

1446
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,080
My dafter.

1447
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:01,760
Oh.

1448
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,960
She's a good girl.

1449
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:03,260
She's after birth.

1450
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,180
She's doing what I...

1451
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,400
What she should do.

1452
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,260
My son, on the other hand,

1453
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,820
is not doing his duty yet.

1454
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:12,880
Hmm.

1455
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,680
We need more little stangs out there

1456
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,040
spraying genes all over the place

1457
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,840
to make up for all the anti-stangs.

1458
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,200
You know, and smiths, too.

1459
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,960
There's never enough smiths.

1460
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,460
That's true.

1461
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,680
There's never enough to fix anything.

1462
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,380
Who else is going to...

1463
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,360
I'm going to carry on the smith name.

1464
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,820
My daughter can make a thing

1465
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,380
that has smith genes,

1466
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,060
but she can't name it smith.

1467
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,300
No, yeah.

1468
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,020
You know what, guys?

1469
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:39,360
I don't think.

1470
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,160
Hey, to all guys out there,

1471
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,860
don't downplay your family background

1472
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,280
on your mother's side of the family.

1473
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:46,720
You know what I mean?

1474
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,040
That is as much a part of you

1475
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,460
as your father's side is, you know?

1476
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,020
Technically, men get a little bit more genes

1477
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,340
from their mommies and girls.

1478
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,300
Actually, this particular...

1479
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,940
The existing grandchild

1480
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,820
did get part of his name

1481
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,440
from the mama's side.

1482
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,320
I mean, if I look at my family tree...

1483
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:03,900
My mama's side, specifically.

1484
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,620
If I look at my family tree,

1485
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,640
actually, my mother's side's

1486
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,320
a lot more interesting,

1487
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,740
and I'll claim that.

1488
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:10,960
Absolutely.

1489
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,660
Speaking of family trees,

1490
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,420
I thought it was interesting

1491
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:17,080
how Groucho Marx inverted the law

1492
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,120
by saying that...

1493
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,060
Oh, never mind.

1494
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,980
My family only came down from the trees

1495
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,920
about four generations ago.

1496
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,460
I thought that was...

1497
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,220
You said that was four million years ago,

1498
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,460
and it was only...

1499
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:28,800
We are living...

1500
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1501
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1502
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1503
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1504
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:29,500
We are long-lived.

1505
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,880
There were giants in the earth in those days.

1506
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,020
We're like Adam and Eve.

1507
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,000
We ate the tree of knowledge.

1508
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,580
That was really mushrooms, by the way.

1509
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,080
Tree knowledge, that's symbolic.

1510
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,340
That apple of knowledge,

1511
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,820
that's symbolic for mushrooms.

1512
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,400
Terrence McKenna said...

1513
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,280
I took mushrooms, and I agreed.

1514
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,040
I saw one of our ancestors was a goth,

1515
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,180
an Ostrogoth, and a sloth.

1516
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,200
I was a three-toed sloth.

1517
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,240
The funniest thing...

1518
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,720
It's funny you mentioned the Ostrogoths,

1519
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:58,800
but I'm not sure if that's true.

1520
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,220
I'm just reminded of the Visigoths, of course,

1521
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,180
immediately afterwards,

1522
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,220
and that reminded me of one of the funniest things

1523
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,820
I ever saw was somebody used the name Invisigoth

1524
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,640
as an online handle in an X-Files episode.

1525
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,140
Oh, that's pretty good.

1526
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,000
And I wondered how many people actually knew

1527
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,860
who the Visigoths were

1528
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:18,280
that were watching that very episode.

1529
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,580
In any case...

1530
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,840
There are latter-day Ostrogoths and Visigoths

1531
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,040
watching the radio right now.

1532
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,260
The Indivisigoths.

1533
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,300
I've been ostracized.

1534
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:27,760
I've been ostracized.

1535
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,160
The...

1536
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:28,680
The...

1537
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,560
The program is about to get ostracized, folks.

1538
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,280
Well, actually, I'm not being 100% accurate here.

1539
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,420
Portions of the following broadcast

1540
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,500
will be objectionable to a few listeners

1541
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,400
in the audience out there,

1542
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,240
which is why WCSB advises listener discretion.

1543
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,660
The views and opinions expressed on this program

1544
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,800
are not those of WCSB Cleveland

1545
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,560
or Cleveland State University.

1546
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,020
But, yeah, it's midnight,

1547
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,900
and technically the show ends right now,

1548
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,300
but, well, you know, unfortunately,

1549
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,220
Keith was not able to make it down here tonight,

1550
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,940
so I will be up here for another two hours.

1551
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,200
I will be here until 2 a.m.

1552
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,200
Good Lord!

1553
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,380
Yep, yep, yep.

1554
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,040
Yep, so, uh,

1555
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,920
we're gonna pause, actually.

1556
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,220
We, we, I think we do need to take a break here.

1557
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,200
Yeah, my ear hurts.

1558
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,280
Well, hey, I appreciate you, uh,

1559
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,300
you know, damaging your ear even further,

1560
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,940
uh, for the sake of my radio show.

1561
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,600
I, I cannot thank you enough for your, uh,

1562
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,580
for your call tonight.

1563
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,240
Oh, we'll hear it all again

1564
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,340
in a couple more hours of slack.

1565
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,140
I, I gotta get,

1566
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,740
I gotta get Crank out four of them before Christmas.

1567
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,500
Hey, have you ever been, uh, driving

1568
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,680
and, and heard your own voice come on the radio?

1569
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,480
Yeah.

1570
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,160
That's, that's, isn't that, isn't that,

1571
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,000
isn't that a funny thing?

1572
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:28,820
That's a funny experience.

1573
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,240
Oh, it's a thrill.

1574
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:29,880
Yeah.

1575
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,720
It's like, you know, the weirdest thing is you go,

1576
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,020
what the hell is this?

1577
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,380
I recognize this from somewhere.

1578
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:34,900
Oh, right.

1579
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,460
And then you realize it yourself,

1580
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,720
and then you get critical.

1581
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,340
Well, not me.

1582
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,120
See, the, the secret is to hold yourself.

1583
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,320
I start playing with myself, usually.

1584
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,860
I, I, I get turned on.

1585
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,880
The secret is to hold yourself to a,

1586
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,480
hold yourself to a low,

1587
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,540
to a low enough standard,

1588
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,680
and everything will be fine.

1589
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,320
That's the, that's the secret to getting by, really.

1590
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,220
Lower your standards.

1591
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:56,920
Secret happiness.

1592
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,860
Why do you think they call it,

1593
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,100
uh,

1594
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:58,860
genius?

1595
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,300
And you won't get far.

1596
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,340
All right.

1597
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:02,980
Remember,

1598
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,120
there's no place

1599
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:05,660
to go.

1600
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,600
Come on, let's gather around the stage and weep.

1601
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,460
Caller number four,

1602
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:10,860
who has been sitting quietly there.

1603
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,160
Caller number four,

1604
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,200
who's been sitting quietly there.

1605
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:14,820
You still with us?

1606
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,980
I'm, I'm with you.

1607
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,640
It's after midnight.

1608
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,060
I'm going to turn into a pumpkin.

1609
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:19,760
All right.

1610
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,020
Well, thank you very much for your contribution,

1611
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,620
you know, for the brief contribution there.

1612
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,940
You know, thanks for calling.

1613
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,680
Thanks for sticking on the line for so long.

1614
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,960
I thought he was going to be a botanist, but.

1615
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,440
Talk to you soon.

1616
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,200
Look what happened to him.

1617
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,960
Yeah, I should get off the line.

1618
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,360
Um, uh, have a good week, everybody.

1619
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,400
You too, Mark.

1620
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,640
Uh, thank you, uh.

1621
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:34,820
All right, all right, all right.

1622
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,940
Thank you, Reverend Stang.

1623
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,100
Thank you, Lonesome Cabal Dave.

1624
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,440
Good night, girls.

1625
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:37,740
Hey.

1626
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,120
Oh, you got.

1627
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,000
And I'll talk to you soon.

1628
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,720
You have been listening to Hour of Slack,

1629
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,800
number 1,235,

1630
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,060
which for efficiency's sake

1631
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,980
has been composed entirely of another show,

1632
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,040
Radio Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

1633
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,800
Happy holidays,

1634
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,100
