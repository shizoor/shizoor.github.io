1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,100
Vengeance is just one of those things that talks about human spirit and the oneness.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,000
The unity of all.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,260
The unity of all.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:21,820
You know, I've been tuned to, for the past three months really, I haven't changed my TV channel from MSNBC.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,400
Oh, okay.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,620
And Chris Matthews, you know, hardball.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,140
You know, he was here in 2008, was it 2008 election or 2004?

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,820
I don't remember, but he was here at campus of CSU and I actually went and saw him.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,100
Excellent person, excellent man.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,020
And he said, you know what, it's one race, we're all different ethnicities and different cultures, but it's just one race.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,400
Human race.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,860
Yeah, the human race and that goes with my core belief and, you know, everybody here, we know that's what it is.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,400
And anybody else telling you any different?

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,580
That's very clear.

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,100
Telling you a bold-faced lie.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,500
So I like to keep up with that and just know that it's for us all, right?

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,700
Okay.

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,680
And those who play politics of division, we've seen them go down.

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,040
They will keep on going down if they don't change.

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,340
No.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:16,980
Yes.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,780
And our slack is upon you.

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,740
Yes.

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,520
And we'll be back there working.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,480
Yes.

26
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,620
Thank you.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,120
Thanks to everyone.

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,120
One God, one aim, one destiny for all.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,600
One race.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,760
Two, one, six.

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,740
Six.

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,200
Six.

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,380
Six, nine, hundred.

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,200
No.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,240
Six, six, seven.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,440
Six, nine, hundred.

37
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,480
Yes.

38
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,180
Yes.

39
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,120
Sire, there is no more money.

40
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,580
We gotta get some money.

41
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,360
That dirty purgatory, that black...

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,800
You people think we just improvise stuff.

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,720
From the keyboard and stuff.

44
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,180
But no.

45
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,820
We have to rehearse this stuff all week long.

46
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,340
And we have to ride this bicycle treadmill that runs the electric generators

47
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,540
that make the power spew out over the airwaves out into the invisible air

48
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,340
where your ears pick up the rare material and strange music that this station plays

49
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,680
such as the hour of slack.

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,660
Stuck in an availability room somewhere deep beneath the surface of the earth.

51
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,340
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

52
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,800
No slack.

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
Made of pure cream.

54
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,760
Cream, cheese, and three pieces of toilet paper.

55
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:35,800
Has rebuilt his entire personality from a foam-like mug distributed by the Church of the Subgenius

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,380
through WCSB.

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,840
If you call the church now, it is.

58
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,900
And it's just not getting out of this underground...

59
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:50,080
Welcome to the hour of nothing.

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,740
Slack.

61
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,160
Slack.

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,260

00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,160

Slack.

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,840
It costs money to do these kinds of elaborate productions, friends.

99
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,580
But friends, it's not real money.

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,120
It's the kind of money that you need to make your life twirl around like a little Twinkie stick.

101
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,920
It's the kind of money they give you in outer space.

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,320
The kind of money from deep, deep in the cosmos.

103
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,160
It's not paper money.

104
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,300
Nothing as flaccid and tricky.

105
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,520
Nothing as...

106
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
...clinky silver dollars.

107
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,920
No, we're talking psychotronic subphonic money.

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,620
The kind that'll bring you a long-sleeved shirt.

109
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,600
Sire, there is no more money.

110
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,060
We gotta get some money.

111
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,820
That dirty, purgy shark of a black...

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,500
They're here.

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,240
A minute.

114
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,400
It's showtime.

115
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,500
Time for the subgenial...

116
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,360
...less hour and a half.

117
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,940
A show that dare not even exist.

118
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,380
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime.

119
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,920
It's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky, kooky, fun.

120
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,360
It's the subgenius hour of...

121
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,600
...saccharine!

122
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,440
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.

123
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,040
Faster signal goes out from here to the satellite.

124
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,780
And we pump it out all over the world.

125
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,380
Pretty fancy, huh?

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,780
Not too big a rhythm, is that it?

127
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,480
You're buying time.

128
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Time, friends.

129
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,780
Because Mr. Moneybags...

130
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,280
He's paying a salary.

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,280
A salary?

132
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,440
He throws in a hundred bucks a week, and consequently I can't preach against drinking because his icebox is full of beer.

133
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,580
I hope he's talking about you, my friend.

134
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,020
Pay us not to preach about beer.

135
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,160
I can't preach against cigarettes because they all smoke.

136
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,620
For me.

137
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,840
I have to let them out for 15 minutes.

138
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,500
I have to let them out for 15 minutes.

139
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,500


140
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,500


141
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,180
I have to let my son to school and worship service so they can go out and light up a Chesterfield or something or the other.

142
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,380
And what kind did Jesus smoke, friends?

143
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,460
It's time to open your heart.

144
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,320
Close your mind, unzip your lips, and bend over.

145
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,320
Because you're about to receive the word of Bob.

146
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,740
And pull out that wallet, friends, because it is pledge drive time.

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,200
Praise Bob.

148
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,360
It's either the last pledge drive for a while or the last hour of slack.

149
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,980
This could be your last chance, folks.

150
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,260
I thought you boys understood. It's business. That's all it is.

151
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,700
You still don't get it, do you, boys?

152
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,340
There ain't no countries anymore. No more good guys.

153
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,020
They're running the whole show.

154
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,320
They own everything, the whole damn planet. They can do whatever they want.

155
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,220
What's wrong with having a good for a change?

156
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,580
And they're going to let us have a good if we just help them.

157
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,260
They're going to leave us alone. Let's make some money.

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.

159
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,380
I know you want it. Hell, everybody does.

160
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,760
He's going to make a million dollars.

161
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:37,060
Dear friends, this is your dear pastor, Reverend Ivan Stang, calling out to you from the depths of my heart.

162
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,960
And I can see so many of you sitting there hovering by your phones, waiting.

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,920
Now, the phones are ringing here. We're doing great.

164
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,360
This time we got all the beautiful girls, the mighty studliest of genius ministers,

165
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,280
sitting here waiting to catch your calls.

166
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,500
They're all busy. But if you get a busy signal, just call back again,

167
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,420
because we sure ain't going to turn down a bit of your money, dear friends.

168
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,280
You know that. That's one thing you can always trust a bob.

169
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,880
Listen to those things going off in the background.

170
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,780
And so for all I know, maybe these.

171
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,720
Oh, yes. Oh, we got this is one of the callers who wanted to meet Reverend Stang at a cheap motel.

172
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,900
That comes with a two hundred dollar pledge.

173
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,200
Sire, there is no more money.

174
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
We got to get some money.

175
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,780
That dirty purgish harker, that black mutt.

176
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,220
I mean, this when this show ends, if you haven't helped the station,

177
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,380
what you know as reality is going to come to a crashing halt.

178
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,820
See what I mean?

179
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,000
We were playing that cheery music because we wanted to be positive.

180
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,760
But, you know, frankly, friends, positive thinking can kill you.

181
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,820
Look where positive thinking has gotten most of the world so far.

182
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,220
People say it.

183
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,560
Reverend Stang, he's a pessimistic booger.

184
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:00,780
But frankly, I'm worried that my most pessimistic predictions might turn out to have been in the long run idiotically optimistic.

185
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:11,300
And our fear tonight is that you out there taping this show will think we'll think, oh, well, well, they'll stay on the air or not.

186
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,100
Whether I give or not.

187
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,000
But, folks, if you don't pledge, the world will literally will literally.

188
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,040
Come to an end at the end of this hour.

189
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,340
If you and I don't mean just some of you.

190
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,160
I mean, you, the one listening right now.

191
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,460
Oh, you're laughing.

192
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,440
You're laughing.

193
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,560
It's going to collapse around your pathetic ears.

194
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,780
But you nihilistic teenagers out there.

195
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,060
Oh, no future, man.

196
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,620
No future.

197
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:42,280
You know, that's why if the rival cult that wants these airwaves had this hour, they'd raise ten thousand bucks by now.

198
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,340
And you know what they do with it?

199
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,760
They build concentration camps for the likes of you.

200
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,120
You abnormal.

201
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,300
You.

202
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,240
You punk.

203
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,720
You old hippie.

204
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:54,820
You.

205
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,460
You humanist.

206
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,180
You subgenius.

207
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,940
So, friends, you know, the money isn't just for the hour of slack.

208
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,420
It's for the totality that is this station.

209
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,400
It isn't just for us mutants.

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,740
It's for your very mind, your very soul.

211
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,480
And you wouldn't believe how close your soul is to being sold out.

212
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,720
Dear brother or sister, between your job and the drugs and the lies.

213
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,080
Listen.

214
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,240
Listen.

215
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,520
You need every bit of slack you can hang on to.

216
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,160
But we have a special form of slack in store for you tonight.

217
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,220
Not stored in souls anywhere, folks.

218
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,320
And the type of slack you're going to be getting is guilt.

219
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,420
Guilt.

220
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,280
Tonight we're going to whip us up some guilt.

221
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,360
And some of you are saying, oh, it's pledge time.

222
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,980
Reverend Stang's going to rant all night about money.

223
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,380
And you'd better be afraid that that's true, little Bobby, little gimme bob out there.

224
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,060
At this level, our salesmen can see the top of the...

225
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,700
...the ladder and as well on his way there.

226
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,540
Good old boys are here tonight.

227
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,080
We'd like to welcome you down to the television mission.

228
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:09,580
Don't forget, if all you can do is sit at home, then try to keep yourselves awake and dial the phone.

229
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,940
Call him, a pledge of...

230
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,100
687-6900.

231
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,740
Answering the phone, 687-6900.

232
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,600
The best thing you can do is dial this number that you see on your screen.

233
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,040
Uh, okay.

234
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,480
As quickly as you can with a contribution to the television mission.

235
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,860
You revolting genetic accident.

236
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,420
Take your smelly shell elsewhere.

237
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,540
See me, General Spyback.

238
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,980
See how well he obeys me.

239
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,220
He is loyal.

240
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,240
Stupid, but loyal.

241
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,720
A trait you will never share, Skeeto.

242
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,620
But little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?

243
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,120
Listen, you little listeners.

244
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Whistling in the glistening mist.

245
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,000
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Life.

246
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,880
Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, verse 10.

247
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,100
The passage runs, and I quote.

248
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,220
If you be tired, or be 12.

249
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,600
If you've got that run-down feeling, remember, you're not just anybody.

250
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,780
You're special.

251
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,860
You are living proof that God does not exist.

252
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:10,080
Yes, you, little listener, if you are like most of the people who listen to this show, are proof that no supreme being could ever exist.

253
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,800
I love you, Master Turner.

254
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
It's a duck hunt.

255
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,880
Uh, Hanson, please, don't, don't, don't start.

256
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,640
Please, please.

257
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,180
Yeah, I'm sorry.

258
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,980
I've got a star.

259
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm a little tired, anyway.

260
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,420
I don't want to start, believe me.

261
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,520
We gotta get some money.

262
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,380
Dear friends, I'm, I've got to admit, I'm just too depressed to do a, a good show.

263
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,200
Sire, there is no more money.

264
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,680
We gotta get some money.

265
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,240
What?

266
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,020
What?

267
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,340
What?

268
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:38,920


269
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,520
Come on!

270
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,260
Get up off that chair!

271
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,420
Follow me!

272
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,600
Arrgh!

273
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,980
Yes, friends?

274
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,980
The number to call.

275
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,140
216-687-6900.

276
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,580
I bet you can remember that.

277
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,840
216-687-6900.

278
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,720
And, uh, you can talk to the actual Princess Leigh Ardo, queen of all the UFOs.

279
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,660
She's here, ready to take your calls.

280
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,960
Dr. Sinister is here, ready to take your calls.

281
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,340
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is not here and can't take your calls.

282
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,300
But I should be taking his call at some point.

283
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,740
And, uh, meanwhile, back to this.

284
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,520
Now you can have something to sell.

285
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,900
We all know we're in the art of selling.

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,360
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.

287
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,800
Right in your own home.

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,280
And you can call in and you can talk to the, there's some sexy ministers on the, on the lines tonight.

289
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,460
Your prayer partners are here.

290
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,460
Uh, ready to receive your promise.

291
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,200
687-6900.

292
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,880
You're coming in with Bob, friends.

293
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:02,860
Why, the, uh, the evil, uh, Dr. Zaphod here picked up, he got one from Joseph Prowl for 200 bucks.

294
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,020
And I, I happen to know that that one's not a joke.

295
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,460
Now I know that, you know, not everybody can, can, uh, can give that much.

296
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,000
You know, Dr. Drummond and I once talked about, you know, who means the most to Bob?

297
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,440
Is it the little old lady who can, you know, give that much?

298
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,380
Who, you know, doesn't have anything at all to her name, but, but she donates a quarter, her last quarter.

299
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:29,040
Or does, or is Bob more impressed with the rich man who could give a million dollars but only gives 10,000?

300
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:37,960
We prayed on that, friends, and we realized that in Bob's eyes, that rich man is the only one that's gonna get to heaven, cause he paid more money.

301
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,620
So I want you to call.

302
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,980
We gotta sell you, friends.

303
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,100
We're not just gonna sit here and talk.

304
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,280
Bob said we had to party.

305
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,740
Didn't he?

306
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,640
Didn't he?

307
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,460
He said we had to party.

308
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,220
He didn't say we could.

309
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,760
He said we had to.

310
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,780
And so, we must also sell.

311
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Praise Bob and thank you.

312
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,360
All are there, destroyed.

313
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,700
When everybody sells...

314
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,000
We're all selling.

315
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,700
We all have something to sell.

316
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
Yes, everyone selling together mighty symphony of prosperity.

317
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,740
For we all have something to sell.

318
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,680
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

319
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,700
Now, I'm gonna go and take a look at the music.

320
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,080
Ah!

321
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:23,800
A candy-colored clown they call the Sandman tiptoes to my room every night.

322
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,220
Every night.

323
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,420
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper.

324
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,720
To whisper, dear friend.

325
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,100
To sleep.

326
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,200
To sleep.

327
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:30,700
Everything.

328
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,480
Everything is just fine.

329
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,700
It's all right.

330
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,340
It's just fine.

331
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,460
When we were born, we didn't turn that side.

332
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,700
We were best standin' to make it right.

333
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,060
We were best standin' to make it right.

334
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,540
It's predetermined.

335
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,820
And this is our fate.

336
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,420
We're singin' this song.

337
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,780
Singin' this song so you can relate.

338
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,040
We are going to save the universe.

339
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,620
We are going to save the universe.

340
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,200
We are going to save the universe.

341
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,520
This time...

342
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,060
I've got one hour to convince you how badly we and the station need your support.

343
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:19,460
And that hour is only 45 minutes now, but that's all right, dear friends, because I know

344
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,740
that you just needed a break.

345
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,420
A little break from those annoying tapes from the olden days.

346
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,600
Oh my God.

347
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:36,040
Boy, some of that stuff was from that station in Dallas back in, like, 1986.

348
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,640
That's how long we've been doing this.

349
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,400
But we can't do it forever.

350
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,380
Not because...

351
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,200
You know, the bills come due.

352
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,840
When the bill comes due, that's when you just gotta pick up the phone and go,

353
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,400
Yes, you're on the air.

354
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,580
I'm on the air, but I'm very rare and spare.

355
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,680
Spare, poor spare old Dave.

356
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,620
We're so...

357
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,700
And the station is in the same condition.

358
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,280
I wanted to sing a song about WCSB.

359
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,800
Oh, you can do that.

360
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,360
I pulled this Rudy Schwartz project out.

361
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,920
I'll just take the music down.

362
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,260
Oh, no, that's all right.

363
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,420
I'll wait till the fade.

364
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,520
It's faded.

365
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,720
It's faded.

366
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,280
Oh, okay.

367
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,260
You're faded to sleep.

368
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,840
I'd like to sing a song about WCSB.

369
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,900
In the land of Cleveland, that's Cleveland one, two, three.

370
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,540
Enjoy it while you can, you stupid girl and man.

371
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,660
Send in the money!

372
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,760
Oh my God.

373
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,320
Oh, what?

374
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,400
Whoa!

375
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,120
Dave, I've got headphones on.

376
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,380
That was the last of my hearing just then.

377
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,100
But that was a beautiful song.

378
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,400
Well, not beautiful, exactly.

379
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,380
You didn't get the old perfectimizing buzz sound tonight.

380
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,400
I don't hear no buzz at all.

381
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,980
I ain't getting a buzz because nobody's calling.

382
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,040
They ain't giving us a buzz at 216-687-6900.

383
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,080
I guess nobody cares.

384
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,620
I guess I might as well retire.

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,100
I guess nobody needs Slack no more.

386
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,260
Is that it?

387
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,880
That's the way it's going to be.

388
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,220
You're not going to be able to go away to Florida or wherever, the Cayman Islands or

389
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,520
wherever you had planned to go, if you don't get the support of those listeners around

390
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,440
you and stuff that make sure that every year you can go to the Caymans.

391
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,520
Wait a minute.

392
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,180
That's not right.

393
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,720
This is a public speaking.

394
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,240
No, no.

395
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,440
We don't get a penny.

396
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,800
That's right.

397
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,720
Because we do this out of the love of our hearts and the free advertising of the church.

398
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,900
Oh, speaking of which.

399
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:48,500
Friends, this is the only time that I get to talk about this kind of thing, money, because

400
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,620
we have a pledge premium, a special premium.

401
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,000
You know, every year, usually it's something that doesn't cost us much, like a X-rated

402
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,900
hour of Slack CD, but that you'll never hear on broadcast radio.

403
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:08,900
But this pledge drive, friends, this radiothon from WCSB, we are offering you for your $30

404
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,860
pledge.

405
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:16,940
You get the normally $35 subgenius minister's ordainment package.

406
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,660
The thing that we hint about constantly on every one of these shows, your ordainment

407
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,520
as a subgenius minister.

408
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,800
And the funny thing is it's a legal ordainment.

409
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,760
You can perform legal marriages and funerals and not divorces.

410
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,800
God, that's where the money is.

411
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,340
But not circumcisions or a vasectomy either.

412
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,180
You know, friends, when we talk about-

413
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,360
You can't perform live for a studio audience.

414
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,040
When we tell people, oh, you better send in your money to Bob, what we're usually talking

415
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,620
about is a little more than that $30 pledge that we'll send you this material for.

416
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:02,860
And you probably think, well, for 35 bucks, I probably get a letter that says I'm a minister.

417
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,960
Nay, actually, it's a bit, the package that we send out cost me $5 a piece.

418
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,920
It's a great idea.

419
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,480
In a handsome black folder.

420
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,620
It's got a bumper, two bumper, no, three bumper stickers in it.

421
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:17,800
Wow.

422
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,880
It's got a little metal Bob pin.

423
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,320
That's three times as many as I'm getting one, or one.

424
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,740
A Bob decal, a little membership pin, church of subgenius.

425
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,800
A frameable cardboard photograph of J.R. Bob Dobbs in halftone artwork.

426
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,940
Your divine excuse doctorate, which is-

427
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:38,940


428
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:38,940


429
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,640
It's like 11 by 17, frameable certificate.

430
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,080
And we'll get too far.

431
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,900
I'm sorry.

432
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,360
Your doctorate of the forbidden sciences, your little membership card that says you're

433
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,320
an ordained minister in church of subgenius.

434
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,940
It's got a million.

435
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:55,700
And pamphlets, the brag of the subgenius, a million little cutout things that you can

436
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,520
leave in mysterious places-

437
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,320
It's beautiful.

438
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,680
Like inside pencil sharpeners or the bottom of toilet lids.

439
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,320
Mystery ads for the church.

440
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,940
And this is-

441
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,740
This is the stuff I can't normally talk about, but this time because your money is going

442
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,320
to WCSB, I can.

443
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,700
And it's a deal.

444
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,200
For your $30 pledge, you will be an ordained minister.

445
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,780
And I know some of you, probably one in a thousand, have actually sent in your money

446
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:31,240
and are subgenius ministers, in which case, get you one of these for your friend.

447
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,460
It's made to be modular.

448
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:33,880
Well, that's one hell of a deal.

449
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,040
That's one hell of a deal here on the schlepping channel, on the schlepping network.

450
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,920
You can see it's quite a hassle.

451
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,860
It's a hefty package, and I wouldn't try and pick it up all with one little swoop.

452
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,320
It's 10 ounces.

453
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,700
And I definitely get that $30.10 before they're all gone, right, Dino?

454
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,940
It costs $3.14 to mail.

455
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,580
That costs $3.14 to mail, friends.

456
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,760
That's how big they are in a big padded envelope, because you can't send it in paper envelope.

457
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,740
It's too fancy.

458
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,820
It's too big.

459
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:08,900
And that's what you get for your $30 pledge, by calling 687-6900 in the 216-7000 line.

460
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:08,900


461
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:08,900


462
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:25,200
Some amazing stuff, you can re-cultivate it.

463
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:38,360
And all you need is a scan 뛰vにな el email, look upinbilynt wire

464
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,360


465
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,360


466
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,500
ownik.h installation.

467
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,860
brand new fat hefty package for only $30.

468
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,580
And that's a $3,500 worth of equipment,

469
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,560
strange lights, and abstruse ideas.

470
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,280
Now, friends, when you call,

471
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,560
you get the choice of sending in a check.

472
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,280
See, we'll take your address,

473
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,100
and we'll pester you later with a little self-addressed envelope

474
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,080
where you can mail your check.

475
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,000
Or you can get online at WCASB.org

476
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and pay by credit card by the online method.

477
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,300
Or you can show up at the open house on,

478
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,720
what, Friday, November 23rd, I think,

479
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,200
and then the Sunday after that also.

480
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,460
We'll be here at least some of the time to meet and greet.

481
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,200
We met all the Dr. Sinister's callers last open house.

482
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,460
Well, not all of them, but...

483
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,880
Stan will actually be playing the clarinet, too.

484
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,500
I'm playing the clarinet while talking.

485
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,440
Because I've got another orifice that expels air.

486
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,860
You subscribe.

487
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,380
Not a member, per se.

488
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,540
That way.

489
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,600
I've got a little klezmer attached to my orifice

490
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,120
where I can play this clarinet through it.

491
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,480
And we're putting one in every package.

492
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,080
Friends, now, if you don't have $30,

493
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,180
we understand that for $15,

494
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,820
you can get a WCASB skull pennant.

495
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,060
Yay.

496
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,580
Or you can get a $10 gift certificate to Ground Zero Comics.

497
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,500
And yet WCASB at 687-6900 still gets your $15.

498
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,140
You could also get WCASB pint glasses or ashtrays or a winter hat.

499
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,500
And that's for just a $15 pledge.

500
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,560
That ain't hardly nothing.

501
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,260
For $20, you can get...

502
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,120
It's an even more incredible deal,

503
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
but I wouldn't want to say that to your face

504
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,320
because it would make...

505
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,740
Well, no, it's still an incredible deal.

506
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,520
It is.

507
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,400
You can get a ceramic travel mug that says,

508
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,760
I am not a paper cup.

509
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,420
Isn't that conceptual?

510
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,560
For $20.

511
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,560
For $20, we also have CDs.

512
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,720
Zillions of them of bands that I never heard of,

513
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,820
but that doesn't mean anything.

514
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,220
The ones I have heard of,

515
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,360
we have Billy Mayer's show, American Astronaut,

516
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,480
and Negative Land's classic, A Big Ten Eight Place,

517
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,900
which if you haven't heard,

518
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,720
you kind of should in headphones,

519
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,180
but we only have one of them.

520
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,580
You can get two books for $25.

521
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,520
And one of the books for bucks

522
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,900
is Harvey P. Carr's American Splendor comics.

523
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,860
Wow.

524
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,060
We met Harvey P. Carr when he spoke at Starwood,

525
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,320
but then he had to go join the escape vessels ahead of us.

526
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,300
For $20, you can also get four WCASB shot glasses engraved,

527
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,260
a kid's yeller T-shirt,

528
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,440
a black WCASB bracelet,

529
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:34,920
baseball cap,

530
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,440
a casual cap with a buckle in green.

531
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,320
They're ultra nice.

532
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,720
Actually, when you call,

533
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,840
Princess Wee or Dr. Sinister can explain all this.

534
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,340
For $25, there's the T-shirts,

535
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,780
a WCASB skull T-shirt,

536
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,940
a ladies teal on gray,

537
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,080
engraved pint glass and beer set.

538
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,960
Can you imagine how cool you will look walking in a room

539
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,400
carrying an ancient ladies T-shirt

540
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,100
while wearing a skull CSB T-shirt?

541
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,400
And a stocking cap.

542
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,040
Maybe pull down over your eyebrows a little bit

543
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,440
so you look more menacing.

544
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,720
And you'll just be such a hit with the girls

545
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,300
and other, you know, living things.

546
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,160
It worked for me.

547
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,960
I've got children all over Ohio

548
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,280
just because I wore those T-shirts from WCASB.

549
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,920
They are a status symbol in the 216-300-440 area.

550
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,160
Oh, yeah, I listen to those guys.

551
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,060
Oh, yeah.

552
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,240
Did you ever call 687-69?

553
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,320
And actually pledge a little freaking money?

554
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,420
I'm sorry.

555
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,400
You know, the other option about coming down for the open house here

556
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,920
is the day after Thanksgiving,

557
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,860
Friday the 23rd of November

558
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,760
and Sunday the 25th of November.

559
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,720
Actually, that's November.

560
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,280
So it's not the day after Thanksgiving.

561
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,440
I guess.

562
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,920
It is the day after Thanksgiving.

563
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,980
The weekend after.

564
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,240
We would not be here on Friday.

565
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,080
Possibly.

566
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,560
We would be here on the Sunday open house.

567
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,380
On the Sunday the 25th.

568
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,700
Yeah, we'd be here on the Sunday open house.

569
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,820
Rub elbows.

570
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,800
Friends, where you can pick up your subgenius minister's pack.

571
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,780
We'll sign it for you.

572
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,000
It's actually already signed.

573
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,240
It's got their hands signed by yours truly, Reverend.

574
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,940
I haven't sang every single one of them.

575
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,500
We also sign all our books.

576
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,720
You're bothering me, John, many of them.

577
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,620
Well, all right.

578
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,420
We could offer scrapings from Dave's list.

579
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,180
We could offer a leg if you wanted samples,

580
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,160
cloning samples to make your own little lonesome cowboy Dave's someday.

581
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,140
If you made enough of them, they wouldn't be lonesome.

582
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,620
They'd be popular cowboy Dave's.

583
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,460
Imagine that.

584
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,600
Are you even populating the dish?

585
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,660
Overpopulation of popular cowboy Dave's.

586
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,300
And maybe even little Dave Venus, little female ones.

587
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,400
There are all these large housing populations.

588
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,660
And I had to eat like 5,000 times as much food.

589
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:14,220
Now, if you have to send your $30 to 687-6900, you may say,

590
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,720
but I've already been ordained in the church's subgenius 400 times over,

591
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,560
and I've got all of those packages full of bumper stickers and posters

592
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,440
and decals and pins and minister's cards and stuff.

593
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,480
So instead, you can get the WCSB clear bubble umbrella,

594
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,180
which I believe we got.

595
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,900
With our donation last year.

596
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,180
No, we got the big black and white one.

597
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,580
Now they have these bubble ones.

598
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,980
They're really cool, though, because you're in your own bubble world.

599
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,700
Yeah, but don't try and make drinks like by putting them in a shot glass,

600
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,980
in a CSB shot glass.

601
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,800
I'm sorry.

602
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,240
Well, you could make multiple pledges and get everything.

603
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,680
There's sweatshirts, a WCSB Animal House sweatshirt for the $40 pledge.

604
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,040
You got your WCSB ladies hoodie in dark blue or men's hoodie in blue or black.

605
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,100
We have zip-up kinds and non-zip-up for $50.

606
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,060
And I'm sure somebody out there feels like the year that they've spent listening to this station

607
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,280
might be worth $50.

608
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,120
Some of them, it might be worth $50,000, but they only have $15.

609
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,320
Well, we'll take $15.

610
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,200
We'll take a penny, but it won't make...

611
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,180
Well, no, we can't take a penny.

612
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,020
Well, they won't get anything for a penny.

613
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,940
Right, and we wouldn't have enough money to...

614
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:40,420
We wouldn't be able to send them the self-addressed stamped envelope for a penny

615
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,340
because it costs 49 cents or something.

616
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,980
But yes, friends, it's a beautiful thing.

617
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,820
It's a beautiful world that allows you to hear this station.

618
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:01,000
And have you ever lived in a town that didn't have WCSB or a similar station?

619
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,020
I have.

620
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,600
I had to listen.

621
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,220
I had to listen.

622
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,040
I had to listen to WCSB online every week and call in.

623
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,080
Actually, our Slack has been on Sunday nights and WCSB since the late 80s, I believe.

624
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,520
The early 90s.

625
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,480
Oh, no, we were on before on Sunday.

626
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,880
I just, I mailed the cassettes in, and they even paid.

627
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,620
They used to pay five bucks a show for this show.

628
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,560
And they still did after I moved here for about three weeks.

629
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,120
And then the station manager, Caroline, at the time said,

630
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:40,800
Reverend Stein, we're not going to pay you for coming in and using our studio.

631
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,800
But, friends, you can pay them for letting us come in and use the studio.

632
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,660
And not only us, but, for instance, African Abstract, the wonderful reggae show.

633
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,560
Where else are you going to hear that stuff?

634
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,720
I'm serious.

635
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,780
Where else are you going to hear the horrible music that Dr. Sinister plays for the first hour of his show?

636
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,500
Wonderful.

637
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:02,640


638
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,340
Wonderful.

639
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:03,400
Wonderful.

640
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,300
Wonderful.

641
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,400


642
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,400


643
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,400


644
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,400


645
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,400


646
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,400


647
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,040
We're driving home after our slack.

648
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
We just about have wrecks every time.

649
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,220
But you're listening to the strange, strange things that he plays.

650
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:13,960
Interesting.

651
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,420
By the way, there's a cop.

652
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,400
You don't hear that kind of thing anywhere else.

653
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,400
I noticed that last week and the week before and many weeks before.

654
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,400
Oh, you can hear it on the Internet, I guess.

655
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,480
You know, you can tune in WFMU or something in New York, but not in your car.

656
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,400
And not in your hometown when you're in your own underwear.

657
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,120
That's not if it's on the Internet.

658
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,400
That's not real radio.

659
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,660
Come on.

660
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,420
That's not real.

661
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:41,820
Argumentative.

662
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,420
Oh, speaking of real radio and real.

663
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,880
Dave, have you heard the angry Republican woman?

664
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,780
You haven't.

665
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,440
If you don't instantly go.

666
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,020
Yeah, yeah.

667
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,220
The day after.

668
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,840
The angry Republican woman?

669
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,120
Yes.

670
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:14,540
The day after the election, a woman made a YouTube video that is so butthurt that when I heard it and you can only hear it, she won't show her face.

671
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,280
She will show her ashtray and her Cheetos.

672
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,220
It's probably the face of David Koch with a weird.

673
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,960
She goes on for almost half an hour screaming.

674
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,600
And she's not.

675
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,360
She doesn't even bother with the liberals.

676
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
She's mad at the.

677
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,220
The Ron Paul people.

678
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,080
I'm going to play that.

679
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:41,080
I personally was not ready to take on the editing job of cutting all her cussing out for this show.

680
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,100
But somebody else did.

681
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,100
And I'm going to play that.

682
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,720
So, Dave, listen for four minutes.

683
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:56,320
I'll leave us all on and we'll hear the angry Obama hating woman.

684
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,640
I won't say a word.

685
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,620
Try to imagine.

686
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,720
What she what what is being bleeped out.

687
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,500
And and and then when we're finished with it.

688
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,320
Keep in mind that it actually goes on for another half hour.

689
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,400
Here she here she is.

690
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:17,140
All of the who have said over all of these years that Obama has to go.

691
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:28,820
Yet I can make 15 posts on Facebook and not one of you will share it with people who don't want to see it because you don't want to offend somebody.

692
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,560
Well, how do you like it tonight?

693
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,280
How do you like the fact that Obama won the election?

694
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,800
Is that settling well with you?

695
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,320
It's not settling well with me.

696
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,180
I have busted my.

697
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,860
I have busted my over the last four years.

698
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,980
I just got a computer four years ago.

699
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,840
So excuse me.

700
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,120
It took me about a year to teach myself how to properly.

701
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,700
Use it.

702
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,300
I had 220 videos on my first YouTube channel.

703
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,840
I had.

704
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:10,740
I think it was 200 videos and 220 subscribers with almost a million views on all of those videos.

705
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:20,460
Conservative videos that you people didn't share because you didn't want to offend people that might not agree with what you posted.

706
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,400
Yet you'd like what I posted in some of you not even bother to do that.

707
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,120
Figure out how to use the Internet or get the fuck off of it.

708
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,900
This is such bull.

709
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,940
And they're in the popular vote on Drudge.

710
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,740
Obama's about to go over Romney.

711
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,000
Here, take a look.

712
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,560
Look at your work.

713
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,720
Look at that.

714
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,040
Look.

715
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,320
Can you read those totals?

716
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,440
Romney, 44,548,000.

717
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,480
Obama, 44,332,000.

718
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,960
Oh, it's getting close now.

719
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,480
You suppose you'd like to share that with your friends that voted for Obama?

720
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:57,940
I bet.

721
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,100
You wouldn't, you little b****.

722
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,800
I'm sick and tired of this s***.

723
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:08,940
I spend hours upon hours upon hours mining the news and finding things to post for you to share with other people.

724
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,540
And yet very little of you do it.

725
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,860
Some of you do.

726
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,480
I appreciate every one of you that do.

727
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,900
And I'm not talking to you.

728
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,320
So don't comment here.

729
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:26,440
I'm talking to all you namby-pamby b****es who don't want to find your voice or put your voice out there.

730
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,100
Get the f***.

731
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,540
Off the internet.

732
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,980
You are of no use to anybody.

733
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,860
Shut your f***ing accounts down.

734
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,480
Shut your f***ing mouths.

735
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,060
Fall in line and love socialist America.

736
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,460
Because that's what you got.

737
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,540
You want to call me unhinged?

738
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,680
I am.

739
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,860
You'd be right.

740
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,800
I am totally f***ing unhinged right now.

741
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,740
Look.

742
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,700
He just got closer.

743
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,420
Romney.

744
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,760
45 million.

745
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,380
245,000.

746
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,660
Obama.

747
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,700
45 million.

748
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,100
29,000.

749
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,340
It's only within 20,000 now.

750
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,860
So Romney isn't even going to get the popular vote.

751
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,080
F*** you.

752
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,200
All you godd*** Ron Paul supporters.

753
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,680
You Gary Johnson vote b**** bags.

754
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,660
Tess my b****.

755
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,960
You want to really do it?

756
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,720
I'll give you my f***ing address.

757
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,920
Better yet, Google my godd*** name.

758
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,960
Find it yourself and show up unannounced.

759
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,900
I'll be happy to greet you at my door.

760
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,120
I'll be happy to find you in my bedroom in the middle of the night, you b****holes.

761
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,400
Come on over.

762
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,800
I'll f***ing kill you and I'll enjoy doing it.

763
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,060
You godd*** mother f***er.

764
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,720
You think another four years of Obama is going to be so much better than four years?

765
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,580
Four years of Romney?

766
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,980
You're too stupid to live here.

767
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,820
Go to f***ing libertarians.

768
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,980
Tess my b****.

769
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,600
You b****.

770
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,460
You think you voted for something.

771
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,020
You didn't vote for f***ing.

772
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,100
You helped Obama win, you b****.

773
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,960
And there is a very large segment of this society that will never forgive you for that.

774
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,700
F***.

775
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,580
Self-f***ing.

776
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,060
I think that lady had a bad night.

777
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,200
I could hear a glass and the tinkling of ice a few times.

778
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,280
I think she was inebriated as well.

779
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,260
Uh, she, well, she, she says so.

780
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,340
Psychotropics.

781
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,080
She.

782
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Remember Xanax or Haldol or whatever was wearing off.

783
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,140
Because, you know, she'd had episodes before.

784
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,720
And, uh, yeah.

785
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,200
Oh.

786
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,040
Well, actually, uh, she, you can hear a tinkling glass.

787
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,400
Uh, and she admits she's, she's drinking butterscotch schnapps.

788
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,960
Or as Reverend Susie the Flusie dubbed it, butthurt scotch schnapps.

789
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,640
Um, yeah, that was edited for a television show.

790
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:25,260
And I must say, I'm much better at cutting out cuss words than those paid TV editors,

791
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,880
if I do say so myself.

792
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,960
Uh, because, you know.

793
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,840
Well, you certainly are, but it was sufficient enough to make people call 687-6900.

794
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,800
If only.

795
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,040
This is where they heard that, that way.

796
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,260
I mean, never mind.

797
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,980
Well, uh, you can hear the whole thing.

798
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,820
Well, I can't give the title of it because it's obscene.

799
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,000
She's ticked off, just type, Google Obama hating drunk woman.

800
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,200
Uh, stop.

801
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,700
Stephen Colbert apparently did a takeoff on her the night that she put that thing out.

802
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,120
Uh, she, she posted that the day after the election on Wednesday.

803
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:15,960
And, uh, I, I saw a link to it by, by then and already 3000 people had seen it.

804
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,840
Most of her stuff had only gotten 300 views until that one went viral.

805
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:27,160
The last time I looked earlier today, it was up to about 750,000 views.

806
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:34,080
And she was, you know, in the tape, she urges people to come to her house and show up in her bed.

807
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:43,860
But then when people actually did call her up, she was so angry at them that she published their phone numbers and names.

808
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,660
Which I guess she got off of, uh, caller ID or something.

809
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,500
So she wasn't really sincere when she invited people to respond.

810
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,780
In fact, she cut off the comments for her video.

811
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:06,120
But, but it, it's really a classic example of, as she says, she's only been on the internet for four years.

812
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:24,120
So she has really had no idea how her life was going to change when that one little YouTube thing became so viral that now a million people have heard, have watched her or heard her make a, a butt hurt jerk of herself.

813
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,140
And you can too by calling 216-722-7222.

814
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,300
216-687-6900.

815
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,480
No, wait, that's not...

816
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:36,180
You would make a hero of yourself by calling 216-687-6900.

817
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,320
Where else will you hear a pledge drive show with the Rudy Schwartz Project as background music?

818
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,700
Making your butt hurt.

819
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,060
Oh wait, I don't, I better not play that.

820
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,040
He might say something naughty.

821
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,320
I thought these were all in, uh, instrumentals.

822
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,580
So maybe I should pull that one down for now.

823
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,400
That's one thing about the wonderful WCSB in Cleveland is there's no vulgar language.

824
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,900
Oh, actually there is after 11 o'clock.

825
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,320
Vulgar language isn't around anywhere, I guess. Sorry.

826
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:17,240
After midnight you can, you can't be obscene, but you can use salty language.

827
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,200
Yes, the harbor is open.

828
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,140
Uh, yeah.

829
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,420
We, however, are prime time.

830
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,320
Salty.

831
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,720
So to hear all the cuss words you have to listen to the internet version. See?

832
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,380
At subgenius.com.

833
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,480
People have said, Reverend Stang, you make it so difficult to find your radio show on your website.

834
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,060
And I always have to go, well, it's...

835
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:44,420
If you look at the first page, subgenius.com, it's the little button that says radio, hour of slack, at the top of the page.

836
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,920
And they go, oh.

837
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,520
Sorry.

838
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,100
Heh heh.

839
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,020
Ehh.

840
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,060
And they also go, how come it's so hard to find it? Just a plain old dob's head that I can print out.

841
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,480
I can't find one anywhere.

842
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:06,040
And I have to go, well, if you scroll down a little bit on the first page, you'll see a line that says, find your dob's heads here.

843
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,040
Heh.

844
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,640
And then it gives you such a baffling array of formats and choices that you give up.

845
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,480
And then you notice that it's a trademark and you can't actually legally sell it.

846
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,780
Like we can.

847
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,300
Hehehehehehehehehe.

848
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,740
And Ersol can.

849
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:32,080
And you can have that dob's head yourself, my friends, by calling 687-6900 and pledging $30.

850
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,360
But we'll take a $15 pledge.

851
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,800
We'll take a $15 billion pledge.

852
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,200
Except I don't imagine we'll be taking too many of those tonight.

853
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,840
Yes, and if you don't explain your reasons, you have to explain your reasons because if not, you'll be misinterpreted.

854
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,380
Or your rationale.

855
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah.

856
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,260
We'd hate to be...

857
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,060
We'd hate to...

858
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,940
For people to misinterpret our clear message.

859
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:05,440
Oh, by the way, speaking of WCSB clear messages and stuff like that, if you look at subgenius.com, there's also a button at the top called events.

860
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:22,240
And if you click on events, the page you get at the very top has links to photos of the WCSB Halloween party and photos of Mitt Romney with our previous host, Charleston, here in the studio.

861
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,420
Hi, Charleston, and welcome to the WCSB studios.

862
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,240
I'm very honored to be in the WCSB studios.

863
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,260
It was actually a living human being, a man.

864
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:26,840
Yes.

865
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,720
He's not a space alien like so many of the people we meet nowadays.

866
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,080
Last...

867
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,160
The people that we have to warn you about.

868
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,620
He's a real flesh-and-blood human.

869
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:42,240
And in my estimation, kind of a radio genius in his production of that music.

870
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,580
Well, he's also a musician.

871
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,220
He's very modest about that, but he's a well-known musician.

872
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:52,220


873
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:52,220


874
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,340
musician in that area himself, Charleston Okafor.

875
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,460
But you can see a picture of Charleston posing with Mitt Romney.

876
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,520
It's actually the rubber Mitt Romney mask.

877
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:10,880
He thought it was Bob when I first walked in wearing that thing, even though it didn't

878
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,260
have a pipe sticking out of it.

879
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,720
But when you stick Bob next to Romney, it's like they're twins.

880
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,780
Only one has a pipe in his mouth.

881
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,020
Yeah, you wouldn't have to do too much photoshopping to make them look identical, I don't think.

882
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:22,980
And one is...

883
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,560
He's got a little bit...

884
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,100
Romney had, I'm saying had in the past tense as a persona.

885
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:27,940
He's dead now.

886
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,320
Electable arch.

887
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,320
He had that kind of Hitler-colic going there.

888
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,860
What's up with that, you know?

889
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,980
I wondered if that was some kind of secret message.

890
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,020
Never mind.

891
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,880
687-6900 and get all kinds of cool stuff.

892
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,260
Yeah.

893
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:41,860
Yeah.

894
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:49,500
There are, with a $20 pledge, there is a vast number of CDs to choose from.

895
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,320
I'm not going to read them all off.

896
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:51,940
Yeah.

897
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,200
Yeah.

898
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,200


899
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,200


900
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,200


901
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,200


902
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,200


903
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,200


904
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,200


905
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,200


906
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,200


907
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,320
I mentioned that we have Negative Lands' greatest classic.

908
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,060
Really cool.

909
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,980
Their third album, a big 10-8 place.

910
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,320
And American Astronaut by the Billy Nair Show.

911
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,720
They played it in X-Day once.

912
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,400
Strangely enough.

913
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,200
So, hey, actually, I could put on X-Day music in the background.

914
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,140
Let me...

915
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,160
What's this number?

916
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,940
Man, what a wizard.

917
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,560
With cheese.

918
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,620
He's like, oh, he's searching, and he's like, his fingers are so nimble, and his brain is

919
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,780
so, like, sharp, like a big block of Wisconsin cheddar.

920
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,160
Who are you talking about?

921
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,180
I'm talking about you, like...

922
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:33,500
What?

923
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,720
No, that's...

924
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,620
Actually, no, you're thinking of Chaz.

925
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,900
The late Chaz Smith was able to do that.

926
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,880
What?

927
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,040
Mm-hmm.

928
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,800
Mm-hmm.

929
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,100


930
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,260
Wow.

931
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,780
I think that's the sample you need.

932
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,460
Put them all together.

933
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,960
Put them all together.

934
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:15,140
That was beautiful.

935
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,940
We didn't interact over it, though.

936
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,680
That's the only problem.

937
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,820
We just sat there with our mouths, like, kind of...

938
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,340
Well, my mouth was all agog because I didn't understand what was happening.

939
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,640
You're being infiltrated by a mass of spiritual designers,

940
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,320
some from outer space, some from the center of the Earth,

941
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,660
some from actually from Mars.

942
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,200
Our ancestors, perhaps, as you believe.

943
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,680
But what credence can we lend to such ideas

944
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,540
when people don't send in any kind of stinking checks or anything like that?

945
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,660
Are they?

946
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,260
I don't know. Are they, Princess?

947
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,960
Oh, no, Princess, we have the saddest face.

948
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,580
I'm looking through the glass window of the studio at the phone banks,

949
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,600
and she's crying.

950
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,800
Friends, you made her cry!

951
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,020
I hope you're satisfied.

952
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,620
You got Obama elected, and you made her cry!

953
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,320
I hope you are happy with yourself!

954
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,600
216-687-6900.

955
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,040
Dr. Sinister sitting over there reading a newspaper.

956
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,040
Princess.

957
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:20,920
We is...

958
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:27,240
It looks like she's asking God how he could have forsaken us.

959
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,980
Wow. I didn't know we'd been forsaken.

960
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:35,060
I thought maybe we picked up a couple thousand bucks in the last five minutes at least, you know?

961
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:35,920
Oh, man.

962
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,300
But our goal tonight, on this pledge night,

963
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,420
if you have any socks, if you have any old underwear that you want to get rid of,

964
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,500
you can't send that in.

965
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,760
But you can call 687-6900 and pledge some sort of donation.

966
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:50,900
I'm not going to do that.

967
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,620
I'm going to go to WCSB, which keeps it running on a yearly basis from...

968
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,060
She's trying to budget, and...

969
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,780
I give up.

970
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,020
I just give up.

971
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,240
Let's just shut it all off.

972
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,580
Let's just shut the whole thing down.

973
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,180
Let them know what their radio's going to sound like if they don't call in.

974
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,740
Yeah, that's the idea.

975
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,300
Just like negative campaign ads and stuff like that.

976
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,400
The good ones don't work.

977
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,340
Hi, I'm Joe Smith.

978
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,040
I mean...

979
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,760
I've had it.

980
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,440
I might be...

981
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,640
I'm fed up.

982
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,940
Listen, this vote for me, it's like Joe's.

983
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,800
You sit there.

984
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,300
I see you.

985
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,460
You can give a shout-out to Reverend Mike from Texas.

986
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,080
Reverend Mike from Texas has been donating to the Hour of Slack show.

987
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,280
One Texan, that's all we had.

988
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,300
You're kidding.

989
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,300
One Texan.

990
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,960
No Ohioans at all.

991
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,920
Oh, I guess not.

992
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,860
Well, that's it.

993
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,840
I know where to move back to.

994
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,680
I could go live on Stang Ranch, my friends.

995
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,940
But I chose for free.

996
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:56,280
I could live in a big house on a hill for nothing.

997
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,520
But I've been living in a cardboard box in Ohio because I wanted to be bringing you this show.

998
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,320
Don't make us do the Texas.

999
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,520
But I guess I've had enough.

1000
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,500
I guess this will be the last hour of Slack.

1001
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,240
Okay, that's it.

1002
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:08,520
Bye.

1003
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,320
Bye.

1004
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,760
Don't worry, Stang.

1005
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,700
The waterfall is coming soon.

1006
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,100
A huge gush of support.

1007
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,680
Hey, how are other people doing?

1008
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,640
I mean, what's going on?

1009
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,520
Well, Charleston, I was...

1010
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,000
Get out of work.

1011
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,240
I was answering phones for...

1012
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:20,860
For Charleston.

1013
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,220
He was doing great.

1014
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:22,900
$200,000.

1015
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,540
Oh, people are calling in Charleston's show like crazy.

1016
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,060
I was on the phones for that.

1017
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,240
I'm sure the minute I shut up, they'll be calling in for Dr. Sinister's show.

1018
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,480
Yep, not a single person.

1019
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:41,100
Oh, one person called because we actually told the truth, which is that one person...

1020
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,340
And it's a guy in Texas, Reverend Michael.

1021
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,800
And I remember him.

1022
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,000
He was back when we were in Texas.

1023
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
He would donate to that.

1024
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,860
Good for nothing station there.

1025
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,060
But in Ohio, well, I guess they just don't care about slack.

1026
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,680
They don't even know what slack is.

1027
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,200
They just...

1028
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,020
Oh, it's slack.

1029
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,920
I said praise Bob, and I drew a picture of Bob, and I put it on my shirt.

1030
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,160
So I'm not a Bobby.

1031
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,120
I'm a real supporter.

1032
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:17,280
I'm not just some give-me-Bob jerk that tapes, records the shows and sends them to people

1033
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,860
so people can tell how clever and smart I am.

1034
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,760
Because I listen to this show that somebody else does.

1035
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:29,700
Do you have any idea how long it takes your prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stain, to put

1036
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,280
together one of these hour of slack shows?

1037
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,440
Not the live ones like this, but the edited, canned ones?

1038
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,680
It takes two or three days.

1039
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:46,140
And plus the chimpanzee work of putting it on the internet and putting all the cuss words

1040
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,900
into it.

1041
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,380
My God, man.

1042
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,660
Well, I'm good.

1043
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,320
I guess I've gotten a signal.

1044
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,180
This happens every October.

1045
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,880
I get the signal from the listeners just what the hour of slack is worth to them, and the

1046
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,220
whole church is subgenius.

1047
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,860
As long as it's free, then they're...

1048
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,220
Oh, they're happy.

1049
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,080
I mean, we have to keep saying the number over and over again.

1050
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,080
Oh, who cares?

1051
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:18,080
6-8-7-6-9-100, pledge to the Radiothon WCSB and to the Church of the Subgenius.

1052
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,400
No, I got my marching orders.

1053
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,900
I heard the message.

1054
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,680
I got the message, Ohio.

1055
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,920
Or Cleveland.

1056
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,020
You can't hardly hear this station outside of downtown.

1057
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,760
I can pick it up in Cleveland Heights in my cardboard box if I put a bunch of tinfoil

1058
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,620
around my head.

1059
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,500
But most...

1060
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,680
I got the message.

1061
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,500
I'm reading you folks loud and clear.

1062
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,100
I can see how much you appreciate the hard work we put into this.

1063
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,560
I think it'll be reruns next week.

1064
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,560
And next six months.

1065
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,420
When I come back from my trip and...

1066
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,980
I'm going to Stang Ranch.

1067
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,120
I'm moving back to Texas.

1068
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,340
Sure, it's 130 degrees, even in winter there.

1069
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:14,780
Bitter.

1070
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,780
Butthurt.

1071
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,500
Is that what you're trying to say?

1072
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,140
Butthurt?

1073
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:18,480
Yeah.

1074
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,740
And you know what?

1075
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,580
I've got seven buttcheeks.

1076
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:27,000
I've been butthurt so bad by the subgeniuses over the course of the last century.

1077
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,740
And twice as many coldens, I might add.

1078
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:30,560
Oh, man.

1079
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,280
Because that's what happens.

1080
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,960
When you get butthurt enough, you grow a third cheek.

1081
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,700
Well, I'm up to seven...

1082
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,740
No, it's eight cheeks now.

1083
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,540
Thanks, Cleveland.

1084
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,300
And you take a lot of space on the bus.

1085
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,700
But don't worry about it.

1086
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,660
Just pledge now.

1087
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,660
I'm going home.

1088
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,940
I've had it.

1089
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,800
I've had it.

1090
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:47,940
I've had it.

1091
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:47,960
I've had it.

1092
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,040
I've had it.

1093
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,100
I've had it.

1094
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,100


1095
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:48,320
I've had it.

1096
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:48,340
I've had it.

1097
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:48,340


1098
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:48,340


1099
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:48,340


1100
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:48,340


1101
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,580
This don't cut no ice with me, Hoss and Hosses.

1102
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,100
I'd see you.

1103
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,520
I can see you from up here.

1104
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,780
I've seen you put a quarter in the collection plate.

1105
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,260
A quarter.

1106
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,200
He's got a third nostril to whiff you with.

1107
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,820
He knows where you're hiding.

1108
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,540
I know Fred Dobbs has been stepping out with Eileen Hodds.

1109
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,640
I know.

1110
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,900
I see these things.

1111
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:13,660
Don't you see?

1112
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,480
Don't you know that?

1113
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,040
You're Santa Claus and you won't be turning the pages for time.

1114
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,300
I know.

1115
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:18,540
I know.

1116
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:18,660
I know.

1117
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:18,760
I know.

1118
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,460
Whatever it is.

1119
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,020
Take it easy.

1120
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,800
Take your hand off my knee.

1121
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,460
Just relax.

1122
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:27,900
Calm down.

1123
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,020
Somebody's about to call.

1124
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,800
I need a minute now.

1125
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,160
Somebody's from New York City with millions and millions of dollars.

1126
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,780
I'm getting a shot right now off Bermuda.

1127
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,000
Bermuda.

1128
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,400
Off of Bermuda.

1129
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:39,940
Bermuda.

1130
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:40,300
Bermuda.

1131
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:40,620
Bermuda.

1132
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:40,700
Bermuda.

1133
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,220
Bermuda.

1134
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,640
Bermuda.

1135
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:41,660
Bermuda.

1136
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,020


1137
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,040


1138
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:42,220
Bermuda.

1139
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:42,240
Bermuda.

1140
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:42,240


1141
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:42,340
Bermuda.

1142
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,820
He's getting ready to call right now.

1143
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:44,940
No.

1144
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,020
They're sitting in there.

1145
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:47,540
Twitting.

1146
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,420
They ain't got nobody to talk to.

1147
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:49,980
Nobody cares.

1148
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,180
Nobody cares.

1149
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,640
Hey, is this the lovely Miss We Are Doe?

1150
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:58,120
I'm trying to get in touch with WCSB in Cleveland.

1151
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,060
Just call me.

1152
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,500
687-6900.

1153
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,820
Just call me.

1154
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,960
I got a lot of money burning a hole in my pocket and I need a shot glass in the eye

1155
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,220
and a stocking cap in my ear because you betrayed us.

1156
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,820
You won't call.

1157
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,320
I'm sorry.

1158
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:17,920
They could get a subgenius membership pack for $5 off for their $30 play.

1159
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:18,860
And it is.

1160
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,100
And the money all goes to the station, not the dogs.

1161
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,880
Amazing amassment of artworks and strangeness.

1162
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,920
That's $5 out of my pocket.

1163
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,700
But nobody wants that $5 or that membership pack.

1164
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,980
They'd rather just sit there and take for free.

1165
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,000
They're takers.

1166
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,480
You know those right-wingers are right.

1167
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,100
It's a world of takers.

1168
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:42,940
The makers are hated out of jealousy by the takers.

1169
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,460
I'm going to go home and take an overdose.

1170
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,620
I'm going to go home and take an overdose.

1171
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,400
I'm going to take vitamin E or something horrible.

1172
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,380
I'm going to kill myself.

1173
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:52,300
That's it.

1174
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,260
I think all those people who are calling right now,

1175
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,120
who have the wherewithal and the desire and the money to do it,

1176
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,980
and who are not calling,

1177
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,320
are the same.

1178
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,660
I'm just going to...

1179
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,640
I've had it.

1180
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,860
I've had it up to here.

1181
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:06,640
That's about it.

1182
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:10,920
That's the end of the line for old Reverend Stang, folks.

1183
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,420
I'm just going to walk right off that plank into the ocean,

1184
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,720
let the sharks eat me.

1185
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,020
Well, maybe the crustaceans...

1186
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,380
The crustaceans are dissolving us or something,

1187
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:24,140
or maybe there's some kind of plot afoot or something like that

1188
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:30,220
where the Petraeus knows about your affair with WCSB.

1189
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,980
And so he...

1190
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,040
WCSB is pretty hot.

1191
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,380
What's your name from the New York Times?

1192
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,720
You can save us.

1193
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,780
And then Petronius, whatever his name is,

1194
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,240
decided to quit the church and subgenius

1195
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,660
and move to Cleveland and make everybody dumb.

1196
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,400
That's right.

1197
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,660
Dr. Zaius is just going to quit preaching the law of the lawgiver

1198
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,900
and just move in with the humans.

1199
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:55,720
Might as well.

1200
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,740
One race, the human race.

1201
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,240
How's that?

1202
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,860
No subgeniuses anymore.

1203
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,420
Nobody has any use for the other race of subgeniuses.

1204
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,460
We're going to go the way of the Neanderthals

1205
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,900
and the Homo erectus, the Homo erecti.

1206
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,440
And now there are people with big, huge toes

1207
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,080
that come around and bob you in the middle.

1208
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,820
It's extinct.

1209
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,520
It's nice for crying out loud,

1210
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,220
especially when they're wearing the pancake makeup.

1211
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,340
They're going to find a fossil of a pipe

1212
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,280
and go, this pipe belonged to lonesome Ivan Stang,

1213
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,900
the saddest man that ever...

1214
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,520
Subgenius, not man.

1215
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,440
Part man, part subgenius.

1216
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,180
And he just died of sadness

1217
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,760
because he was ignored

1218
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,520
after 35 years of life.

1219
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,340
Weekly radio show.

1220
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,600
I'm so tired of doing this.

1221
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,320
Oh, man, am I tired.

1222
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,200
I could be home.

1223
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,540
I'm going to sleep.

1224
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,800
Slaying jaggies on my video game,

1225
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,940
Monster Hunter Tri.

1226
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,300
I actually did.

1227
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,780
You won't be able to filiate much longer

1228
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,500
if you can't come up with a right time.

1229
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,140
I'm not going to be able to pay my electric bills.

1230
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,440
WCSB won't be able to pay theirs.

1231
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,320
Everybody can just listen to

1232
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,640
what's the local drive time rock station

1233
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,420
with the smarmy jocks on it.

1234
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,940
Yeah, be just like high school.

1235
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,060
Let the population,

1236
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:18,840
the dealers and the jocks

1237
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,560
be the only ones that have any happiness.

1238
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,920
They don't know what slack is.

1239
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,760
They can't have slack.

1240
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,720
Except they know that somebody else had slack

1241
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,720
and they want to make sure

1242
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,840
they don't have it anymore.

1243
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,120
Well, you won.

1244
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,760
I guess you should be satisfied.

1245
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,380
There's no satisfaction for people like that.

1246
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,220
Those maso geeky and flarging,

1247
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,760
misogynistic baby haters and so forth.

1248
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,700
Those people deserve to smell,

1249
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,480
smell the same way,

1250
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,380
the way they did yesterday.

1251
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,800
And historically speaking,

1252
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,280
they deserve their permanent body odors

1253
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,520
to cling to their bodies

1254
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,340
and to forget calling WCSB

1255
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,820
because they can't remember the name WCSB

1256
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,280
or the number 687-6900.

1257
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,600
And 6900 is an important part of this message

1258
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,220
because you will be having oral sex a hundred times more

1259
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,760
when you think of that number.

1260
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,260
Think of 69,

1261
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,460
then you think of hundreds.

1262
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,280
Like, wow.

1263
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,400
Well, but see, that's all they can do is think.

1264
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,560
And they don't even do that very well.

1265
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,240
Sickening.

1266
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,820
Embrace it, man.

1267
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,820
Pick up your phone right now

1268
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,000
and use it as either a deadly object

1269
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,660
or make love to that phone.

1270
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,900
It's like a hamburger.

1271
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,120
You got to eat the, you know, out of it.

1272
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,180
Shout out thank you.

1273
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,040
There's your donations.

1274
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,380
Oh my gosh, Princess.

1275
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:41,980
Another one.

1276
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:42,820
It looks, we,

1277
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,520
oh, look at this.

1278
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,120
Two people from,

1279
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:47,680
Cleveland.

1280
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,100
Well, it's like last year when I said,

1281
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,020
if only one subgenius would send us one penny,

1282
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,520
I'd know everything is okay.

1283
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,920
Well, here's two.

1284
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,580
Well, he'll be Reverend Elton if he wasn't already.

1285
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,220
And we'll see this Reverend Elton

1286
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,740
at the WCSB open house.

1287
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,240
And here's a Reverend,

1288
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,940
do you know the last name and first name

1289
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,960
are switched?

1290
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,060
I don't know.

1291
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:18,060


1292
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,620
Reverend, Reverend Mark, let's just say.

1293
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,140
And, and of course, Reverend Michael

1294
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,340
in Carrollton, Texas in Fort Worth.

1295
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,000
He's always, he is the one person

1296
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,600
and Rock Roswell who plays Hour of Slack

1297
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,640
in Champaign, Illinois.

1298
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,640
What a guy.

1299
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:37,980
Right.

1300
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:38,440
Yeah.

1301
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,240
Another station that needs money.

1302
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,660
He donates and he was already a minister.

1303
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,660
Just straight donation.

1304
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,740
He doesn't want a premium.

1305
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,320
Do you know Rock Roswell?

1306
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,160
Well, maybe I shouldn't.

1307
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,900
He gave us such wonderful gift of a microscope

1308
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,420
that it made my whole,

1309
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,120
it made my life worth living for two years.

1310
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,760
Until you learned you'd inserted it into the wrong place.

1311
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,140
Well, I did have trouble extracting it that one night, but.

1312
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,200
Extraction is always difficult,

1313
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,140
especially if it's like $30.

1314
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,100
For a package of a lifetime.

1315
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,240
For a pleasure.

1316
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,620
And plus, worsening pleasure for a whole year to come.

1317
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,960
You know, last year,

1318
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,160
I actually ran into serious financial problems

1319
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,140
and I had to, for the first time ever,

1320
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,280
I told the truth.

1321
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,940
I admitted it.

1322
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,840
It was on an internet Hour of Slack.

1323
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,980
I didn't, I didn't use,

1324
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,440
I couldn't use WCSB for that.

1325
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,740
And a lot of people helped.

1326
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,400
But you know what I learned was that

1327
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,400
they all were shocked that,

1328
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,520
that I wasn't rich.

1329
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,700
They thought they assumed the station's rich.

1330
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,440
They thought, well, he's got a book out.

1331
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,660
He must be rich.

1332
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,960
Actually, we've had six books out.

1333
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,820
And I think I get about a $300 royalty every six months or so

1334
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,960
that I have to split with six other people.

1335
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:11,040
And, and Dave, is, is it not true that I help out with the,

1336
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,300
your phone bill since you have to call in a long distance?

1337
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,240
Yes, you do.

1338
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,140
And, and,

1339
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,560
and four people,

1340
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:23,120
four people were able to go to that much effort.

1341
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,800
I've had it.

1342
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,760
I'm out of here.

1343
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,580
I'm going to do this show at home.

1344
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,420
I'm going to send a copy to Reverend Michael in Fort Worth,

1345
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,000
Reverend Roswell in Roswell, Illinois,

1346
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,580
and Reverend Little and Reverend Mark.

1347
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,640
And that's it.

1348
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,480
That's all I'll just do.

1349
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,380
I can,

1350
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,000
I can,

1351
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1352
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1353
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1354
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1355
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1356
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1357
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1358
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1359
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1360
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:46,120


1361
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,460
I can cuss all we want on those because it won't be on the air.

1362
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,600
Nobody cares anymore.

1363
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,260
No, it's just a bunch of hooey.

1364
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,700
Dave, we have to go now.

1365
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,900
It's the last hour of Slack.

1366
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,780
Goodbye forever.

1367
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,380
Well, I'm sorry.

1368
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,740
We only got four containers or five, whatever.

1369
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,680
I'm going to go answer.

1370
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,180
Probably the minute I get off the air,

1371
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,580
phones are going to light up for Dr. Sinister's show.

1372
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,180
It's just the way it always is, man.

1373
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,720
Just don't eat home.

1374
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,460
No, not the last hour of Slack forever.

1375
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,220
Okay.

1376
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:12,640
Bye.

1377
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,240
Bye.

1378
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,840
We have a special, special form of Slack in store tonight.

1379
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,320
Instead of us giving you Slack for once,

1380
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,560
you're going to finally give some back to us.

1381
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,500
What a gum.

1382
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,200
You have been doing so all along.

1383
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,080
The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

1384
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,560
But for the rest of you,

1385
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,680
oh, this could be the moment of truth.

1386
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,160
The moment at hand.

1387
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,760
You have to love Bob.

1388
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,680
He loves you, but you love Bob.

1389
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,000
You have to.

1390
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,940
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

1391
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,040
He'll kill you.

1392
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,840
He'll bob you out.

1393
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,520
He'll bob you out, folks.

1394
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,600
You heard it here first.

1395
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,940
You don't love Bob.

1396
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,540
You heard it here first.

1397
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:05,340
Bob you out.

1398
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,320
Bob you out, baby.

1399
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,200
It's dear friends.

1400
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:07,940
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1401
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,180
Well, you know, if you don't pledge,

1402
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,380
there's going to be more than one Reverend Stang.

1403
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:15,960
You're going to have to pledge.

1404
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,120
You're going to have to pledge.

1405
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:16,360
You're going to have to pledge.

1406
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:16,800
Listen to it forever.

1407
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,180
Or at least until the money runs out.

1408
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,180
Dear friends.

1409
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:20,960
We need that money.

1410
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:21,760
Oh, my gosh.

1411
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,780
Let's get us some spirit going here.

1412
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,200
Look at those phones light up.

1413
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,480
Oh, yes.

1414
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,440
We like that old gold, friends.

1415
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,160
Shake it off.

1416
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:31,820
Shake it off.

1417
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,060
Can you imagine a world without slack?

1418
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,320
A world without the hour of slack?

1419
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,900
And even almost as bad, a world without this station.

1420
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:45,300
Because if you don't send some money by midnight tonight,

1421
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,120
you're going to be in trouble.

1422
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,240
You're going to be wishing to God you had or Bob.

1423
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,420
Now you can have

1424
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:00,980
this amazing new symphony

1425
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,940
of prosperity.

1426
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:05,420
Generates in the mind of the salesman

1427
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,960
before it does in the prospect.

1428
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,080
You all sell something to sell.

1429
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,200
Everyone selling together.
