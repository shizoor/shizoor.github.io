2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,080
Nice to welcome you along. Good morning.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,180
We have on the live line, live from Dallas, Texas, the Reverend Ivan Stang.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,140
It's alive!

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,500
It's alive!

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,760
From the Church of the Subgenius, good morning, Reverend Stang.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,780
Good morning, Patrick.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,500
Well, I'm going to have to get a slick intro for my radio show like you've got.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,880
Yeah, you really do need to do it. Of course, you do the hour.

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,180
Everything about it is dislocated, dreamy, and agitated.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,780
Hallucinatory, higgledy-piggledy panoramas like some deranged overview of Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,720
A bird's-eye view of the lower depths.

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:03,460
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station.

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,420
And only in the city of...

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,380
Here's your host.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,600
My name is Mike.

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,100
His name is Bob.

18
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,060
Bob is the Slackjord leader of...

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,780
Bob is the Slackjord leader of...

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,780
Bob is the Slackjord leader of this gang of ragamuffin dopers.

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,840
It doesn't take much to be the leader of this pack.

22
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,940
Bob wins out through the sheer...

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,460
Savvy.

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,160
He may be perpetually groggy from the residue of a thousand fixes.

25
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,260
Bob is the Slackjord leader, but when he's pulling off a robbery, he's surprisingly agile and quick-witted.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,300
He also has as many superstitions as a professional gambler.

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,400
Bob and his gang want to get rich and stay high.

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,780
Has the soulful, famished look of the undead.

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,080
Which, in a sense, is what he is.

30
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,200
Yes, in a sense, that's what he is.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,060
Our Slackjord leader.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,800
Well, my dear friends, please join me in welcoming you to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,360
A very special hour of Slack tonight because...

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,680
If you only knew what we've been through in the last 40 minutes.

35
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,260
If you had any idea...

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,460
We have no idea.

37
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,560
If we had any idea what we've been through...

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:33,700
In the last 40 minutes, you would know why, despite what will soon become apparent as a seeming lack of preparation...

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,560
In fact, the last 40 minutes has wonderfully prepared us for what we need to do here tonight because...

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,760
The hate.

41
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,760
I have so much hate in me now.

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,220
I believe everyone here shares that.

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,560
Do we all not feel hate?

44
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,560
Everyone that hates, say, I hate.

45
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,740
But...

46
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,580
Oh, oh, okay.

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,000
Very good.

48
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,540
So, it's going to be an unusual hour because although one of us...

49
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,840
Usually, yeah.

50
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,860
Where's that mic?

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,560
Sorry.

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,160
Mic.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:17,540
Tonight's show will be a little unusual in that although we're missing one of our usual participants, i.e. Reverend Stang, who is not here tonight...

54
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,280
We have a guest.

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,520
We have a special guest.

56
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,340
Yes.

57
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,020
Bernard Herman is here with us tonight.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,080
Ah.

59
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,180
And we'll be getting to that special guest at...

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,380
Soon.

61
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,960
Very soon.

62
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,700
As soon as we all warm up.

63
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,380
And we're not quite warmed up here yet, so...

64
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:39,460
Ah.

65
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,680
Yes.

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:50,460
We've been piddling for the last 40 minutes, but again, everything that has transpired since then has only fueled...

67
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,540
Our enormous swelling...

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,440
Driving...

69
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,160
Hatred.

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,620
So, let's...

71
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,040
Let's...

72
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,540
Let's try this, shall we?

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,640
And please, if you have any questions, just call here at the station.

74
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,820
We'll endeavor to...

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,380
Endeavor, attempt to answer a question or two.

76
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,440
So, stay tuned.

77
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,200
Praise Bob.

78
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,340
Let there be slack.

79
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,740
Thank you.

80
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,420
Thank you.

81
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:42,420


82
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:42,420


83
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:49,340
I metal do Ð±Ñ‹Ð»Ð°...

84
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,420
Friend, at my waltz.

85
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,080
You know that he likes club music.

86
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,500
Ã­

87
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,900
We don't know how to vote out here.

88
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,580
Does he tell us how to vote on national debates, what side to take?

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,480
No, actually, as a matter of fact, the difference between Bob and the conspiracy is he will not tell you what to think.

90
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,980
He forces you to think for yourself.

91
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,920
Bob says pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

92
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,600
I see.

93
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,180
As for the meaning of life...

94
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

95
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,840
Ivan, I've got to stop you here.

96
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,020
How can he be a religious leader and not tell you how to vote?

97
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,460
Isn't that kind of un-American?

98
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,520
Uh-oh.

99
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,340
You have a point there.

100
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,140
Maybe I'm in the wrong church.

101
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,900
Yeah, I mean...

102
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,260
I bet Tilton would pay better than Bob.

103
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,260
Well, that's...

104
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,080
I may switch over to Tilton. He's here in Dallas, too.

105
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,940
I know he is.

106
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
All right, go ahead.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,640
The meaning of life, he has in 25 words or less.

108
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,340
Meaning of life, Reverend Stang.

109
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,520
Well, it's X-rated.

110
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,820
I can't tell you over the radio.

111
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,440
Okay.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,940
There's a word for it.

113
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,960
It's what you're thinking.

114
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,940
All right, thanks for your call.

115
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,900
Okay, well, let's take another call here.

116
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,180
Here is another Jim.

117
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,920
Jim, you're on WNIS with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

118
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,820
Well, I'm the Reverend Jim Foley of the Temple of the Ultimate Orgasm.

119
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,940
Oh, he's got the meaning of life down.

120
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,560
Okay.

121
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,700
I just...

122
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,540
A buddy of mine called me up and insisted I turn you on.

123
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
This is the second time I've listened to your program,

124
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,580
and I've never had so many...

125
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,980
Well, so far you haven't turned me on, Jim.

126
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,880
Well, I had the opportunity to start my own church and be a bishop if I wanted to.

127
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,000
Got it framed in the...

128
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,760
Got it framed, cost me $50, and it sits over my toilet.

129
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,760
Oh, that's wonderful.

130
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,840
All right, so you're truly king of your throne then, aren't you?

131
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,360
Well, I just decided that the Temple of the Ultimate Orgasm was the place to be.

132
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,800
We call that throne the throne of extra meditation.

133
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360
Well, let me ask you something, Reverend Stang.

134
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,020
Do you feel like Jim has found true slack?

135
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,060
Oh, the...

136
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,260
Probably on the throne, I'm sure.

137
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,120
Absolutely.

138
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,840
And I also became a minister in the...

139
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,940
Oh, gosh, what's it called?

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,840
The one in Modesto.

141
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,440
The Universal Life Church.

142
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,780
Yeah, how could I forget?

143
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,120
They're the classic tax write-off.

144
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,220
Well, I think that's terrific.

145
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,420
I've never tried the tax write-off thing,

146
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,020
because I think it requires registering with the state and what have you.

147
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,480
But as I understand it, if I find myself three members of a congregation,

148
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,960
everything I own can go into the church,

149
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,840
Pretty much.

150
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,200
and it would be absolutely untaxable.

151
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,000
I could even go to the grocery store with a tax stamp or a tax card,

152
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,800
and they would not charge me any taxes on my groceries,

153
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,480
but I'm just too chicken to try it.

154
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,360
Well, that's a good idea, because they're really cracking down on that kind of thing.

155
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,880
All right.

156
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,340
They crack down on it as long as I can prove that I've got three congregants.

157
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,420
I mean, you know, it might be a little bit interesting to go to court with it.

158
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,780
Jim, make sure all three of your congregants are lawyers.

159
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,300
Okay?

160
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,100
Well, it would probably help, but I mean, as long as you've got three family members.

161
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,640
I mean, a man with a wife and two children has got it knocked.

162
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,360
All right.

163
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,100
Thanks for your call, Jim.

164
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,500
Okay.

165
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,120
All right.

166
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,680
We'll be right back with the Reverend Ivan Stang, the Church of the Subgenius.

167
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,420
If you have questions, and I'm sure...

168
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,240
Hang up signal.

169
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,460
That's beside the point.

170
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,820
You know, I'm really disappointed that people haven't called in angry.

171
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,640
I mean, what is this country coming to when, you know,

172
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,940
when slackmasters can get on the radio?

173
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,020
And advertise a church like this?

174
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,180
We can't advertise a church like this.

175
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,440
That's...

176
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,620
The meatballs have not been...

177
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes, the footsteps of the Dobbs as he approaches.

178
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,880
The

179
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,560
Here is her kin sanitized.

180
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,920
The man who claims to be...

181
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,580
The man who claims to be a visitor from the future year, 1990.

182
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,720
Good.

183
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,320
Good.

184
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,220
Come in, Herr Sanitize.

185
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,340
Please, make yourself comfortable.

186
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,260
Leave us alone now, Borben.

187
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,620
But, mein Fuhrer...

188
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:46,880
Leave!

189
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,640
Yes, mein Fuhrer.

190
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,780
Well now, Herr Sanitize, I trust you've been treated well?

191
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,340
Oh, yeah, sure.

192
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,880
Oh, just call me Fuhrer.

193
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,940
Oh, thanks, Fuhrer.

194
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,360
I must tell you, Herr Sanitize,

195
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,860
when I first heard of your...

196
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,160
claim to be from the future,

197
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,580
I was sure it was a hoax.

198
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,920
Perhaps even a plot to assassinate me.

199
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,960
But I realized that if in the future

200
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,920
time travel does become possible,

201
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,400
the Germans will be the only race capable of developing it.

202
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,960
And the first person that future historians will want to meet

203
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,900
is the man who forever changed the world.

204
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,600
Me, Adolf Hitler.

205
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,860
Isn't that correct, Herr Sanitize?

206
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,340
Uh, yeah, sure, Fuhrer.

207
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,220
In fact, it's...

208
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,080
Of course it is.

209
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,900
And the very fact that you're here...

210
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,800
is proof that Germany is destined to win the war.

211
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,080
Um, sure.

212
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,560
Of course, Fuhrer.

213
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,740
Every school kid knows that, yeah, Germany won the war.

214
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,580
I knew it was true.

215
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,460
You are from the future.

216
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,960
And this is a testament.

217
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,740
Providence is protecting me in my historic mission

218
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,380
by giving me this glimpse into the future.

219
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,780
Now then, tell me, Herr Sanitize,

220
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,560
what was the turning point in the war?

221
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,560
Um, oh, that's easy, sure.

222
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,920
It was your brilliant leadership during the Normandy invasion.

223
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,840
Normandy!

224
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,280
So that's where they're coming!

225
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,020
Oh, no, no, no.

226
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,980
That's where they wanted you to think it was coming.

227
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,300
But, uh, you were way too smart for that.

228
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,280
I-I was?

229
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,560
Sure, you were the one who guessed that the whole thing was a giant hoax

230
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,680
designed to drain your panzers away from the Russian front,

231
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,620
where the real invasion came from.

232
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,640
Oh, they'll land even a few troops,

233
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,940
try to make it look good,

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,680
and your generals will scream for reinforcements.

235
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,940
But, just like the history books say,

236
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,800
thanks to your iron will, every request will be ignored.

237
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,520
After the big Allied rout on the Eastern Front,

238
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,760
it's down the drain for the big three.

239
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,860
Oh, really, really? Go on, go on!

240
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,300
Well, it's a great blow to their prestige.

241
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,340
Eventually, the pact between Stalin and the West falls apart,

242
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,900
Roosevelt loses the election, and Germany goes on to victory.

243
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,820
I knew it would happen.

244
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,260
Only a drunken idiot like Churchill

245
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,720
could believe in an alliance with the Bolsheviks.

246
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,860
Aside from the fact that I've always regarded Roosevelt

247
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,020
as a madman, guilty of the worst crimes under international law.

248
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,340
Don't worry. He gets his in the end.

249
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,760
After the Americans surrender,

250
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,720
there are big war crimes trials held in, uh, Philadelphia.

251
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,540
Sure, they became known as the, uh, Philadelphia trials.

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,900
Serves him right,

253
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,860
especially with that ridiculous cigarette holder.

254
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,860
Why, when I get my hands on him, I'll...

255
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,220
I'll have him shot, drawn, quartered,

256
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,880
I'll... I'll haul him up to a meat hook on Piarowa.

257
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,140
And then... then I'll have him cremated,

258
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,840
his ass... his ass!

259
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,840
And then his ashes will be strewn on some deserted alley,

260
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,920
so that no one will have even a grave to place flowers on.

261
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,600
Uh... uh... well, I guess even I'm not that cruel.

262
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,600
Although I'm sure that my enemies would be.

263
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,540
You know, as long as I'm here,

264
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,120
I might as well give you some more help.

265
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,760
You know all that research on, like, super weapons,

266
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,980
atomic explosions?

267
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,920
Yes, yes.

268
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,680
Save your money, Fuhrer.

269
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,700
Please call me Adolf.

270
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,320
Thanks. Anyway, A-bombs, they don't work.

271
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,660
It's scientifically impossible.

272
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,260
I knew it!

273
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,400
That Einstein and all that hocus-pocus science,

274
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
they're all a bunch of swindlers.

275
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,440
Why, we've been spending millions of Reichsmarks on this,

276
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,940
and I might add with my serious misgivings.

277
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,840
Don't you think it's much better to work on the V-2 rockets?

278
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,340
Sure, Adolf, baby.

279
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,360
But you know how your generals claim

280
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,580
that the rockets can't reach the U.S. from Europe?

281
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,320
Oh, when I suggested that,

282
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,360
my... my experts said they'd fall harmlessly into the Atlantic.

283
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,240
Wrong.

284
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,740
Once again, your famous intuition saves the day, Adolf.

285
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,580
In fact, it's a V-2 attack which destroys New York

286
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,480
and forces the collapse of the U.S.

287
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,200
Brilliant!

288
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,640
I'm even a greater genius than I thought!

289
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,960
Now, wait a minute.

290
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,460
Let's see.

291
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,180
I want to get this all down on paper.

292
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,220
Uh, uh, start firing V-2s at the U.S.,

293
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,960
drop A-bomb research.

294
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,300
Oh, and yes, all Panzers to the Eastern Front

295
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,560
the moment that phony Normandy business starts.

296
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,240
Oh, well, thank you, Herr Sanatise.

297
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,220
I'm so sure of it.

298
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,040
I'll send out my group and Fuhrer Fegelin

299
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,280
to the Eastern Front this time

300
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,440
with two boxes of iron crosses

301
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,220
for the boys who fight most heroically.

302
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,580
Ah, you better make it three.

303
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,460
Oh, yes, three. Even better.

304
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,080
Well, Fuhrer, it looks like my job here is done.

305
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,740
I can't tell you what an honor it is to be meeting you.

306
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,080
You're just as sharp as the history books say.

307
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,220
Well, thank you, Herr Sanatise.

308
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,720
It's comforting knowing that good will eventually win out over evil.

309
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,200
Uh, say, before you go,

310
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I couldn't help but notice those charming photograph records

311
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,760
you're carrying under your arm there.

312
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,960
I don't suppose you might let me in on the secret.

313
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,180
Do the Nazis have a big effect on music in the future?

314
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,260
Oh, well, as a matter of fact,

315
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,500
every one of these records sort of has, like, maybe a Nazi theme.

316
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,960
Let me play one for you.

317
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,600
Oh, goody. You know how I love good music.

318
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,040
Mm-hmm.

319
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,140
Ah.

320
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,400
Hitler.

321
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,460
Adolf Hitler.

322
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,880
Hitler on ice.

323
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,020
Ah, it's ironic, wouldn't you say?

324
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,920
It certainly is ironic since I had to traverse the ice to get here,

325
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,260
and yet as I was skidding across that highway and byway of the icy icicles,

326
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,280
which some have called a highway, I couldn't help but reminisce

327
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,380
how the icy icicles reminded the subgenie of their duty to their fellow man,

328
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,100
that cold, hateful feeling that we extend to all members of all races,

329
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,220
colors, and creeds, especially ourselves,

330
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,140
during these the most joyous of times, the holidays.

331
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,980
So it's kind of apropos that you play the little Nazis there

332
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,520
because...

333
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,120
you know, like them, we hate too, but we hate more, more than them.

334
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,040
We even hate ourselves, and that is where the joy is.

335
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,760
Because one cannot know what it is to feel hate

336
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,440
unless one actually extends out and beyond his fellow man

337
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,280
and back inward into the depths of his own soul

338
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,760
and truly hates himself.

339
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,620
Only a man can...

340
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,720
Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you have not guessed,

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,980
we do have a guest here with us in the studio this evening.

342
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,320
This guest, Jeans...

343
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,400
Oh.

344
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,700
Oh.

345
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,260
Father Joe Mama is here with us again tonight.

346
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,180
It's been a while, hasn't it?

347
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,960
It's been a little while.

348
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,860
They tried to assassinate me with the highway trickery,

349
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,740
but it didn't work.

350
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,720
I got here nonetheless.

351
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,680
Well, they'll trick you, Father Mama.

352
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,880
They'll do their best.

353
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,960
Now it's my turn to get even.

354
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Even, yes.

355
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,220
Even and then some.

356
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,120
Well, just since you're here,

357
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,500
I assume you have...

358
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:30,740
You have a...

359
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,820
Something you might want to say to our audience.

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,700
Who is a...

361
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,320
Oh, they all love you, by the way.

362
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,760
They are...

363
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,100
I did do a little thinking.

364
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,520
You know, when you're driving, you can't help but let a few ideas...

365
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,200
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

366
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,720
...jog across your mind there,

367
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,480
and there's some evil thoughts,

368
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,040
but I'm not sure if you want to share those little thoughts

369
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,300
with the listeners this early in the show.

370
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,340
It might scare them away.

371
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,180
Yes, well, what better way to test our listeners,

372
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,720
to separate the wheat from, shall we say, the chaff?

373
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,500
Or the sheaf.

374
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:00,760
The chaff.

375
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,400
Well, we can't say that.

376
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,080
It's a bit early.

377
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,840
It is a bit early for that, Father Marlon.

378
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,400
The elevator?

379
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,200
Oh, okay.

380
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,480
Oh, yeah.

381
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,460
Of course.

382
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,380
Going down, so to speak.

383
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,560
So to speak, as it were, yes.

384
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,840
Well, are you saying that...

385
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
Whenever you are ready.

386
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,840
I did jot up a few little notes here,

387
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,620
and this one's entitled a very special,

388
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,500
a very special sermon,

389
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,860
and it's entitled Pumping Bob.

390
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,840
Because, you see, friends,

391
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,940
it all goes back to that quest of the thirsty heathen

392
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,080
who was crawling through the hot, shifting sands

393
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,860
of the Mojave Desert in search for water.

394
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,400
This heathen, he did not know where he was.

395
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
This heathen, he did not know he was in the Mojave Desert,

396
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,280
but he did know he was in a desert.

397
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,320
And more importantly, he knew that if he did not drink something soon,

398
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,760
he would perish and become a dead, dehydrated dinner

399
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
for the same vultures that provided the only shade

400
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,140
whenever their bodies flew between him and the piercing sun.

401
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,680
So you can imagine how relieved our wayward wanderer was

402
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
when he saw an old-fashioned handpump,

403
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
protruding from the distant sand mound.

404
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,600
With his last ounce of energy,

405
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,260
he crawled up the dune to the rusty pump

406
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,580
and fanatically pumped away.

407
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,780
But alas, not a drop,

408
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,660
not even a cough,

409
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,120
to sputter, or a little

410
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,560
choke of hope,

411
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,780
just the shrill, clankety-clank of vapor lock,

412
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,460
all seemed lost.

413
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,540
And yet, even as our hot, helpless heathen

414
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,940
collapsed at the base of the pump,

415
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,900
he used his final calories of life

416
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,540
to roll over on his back and beg the heavens,

417
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,600
Lord God Almighty, grant me a miracle.

418
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,400
And then, out of the clear blue sky,

419
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,020
a drop of moisture fell upon his face,

420
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,900
and then another, and then another.

421
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,020
Yes, with disbelieving eyes,

422
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,520
our desperate desert dweller looked up,

423
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,020
skyward.

424
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,580
He could not cry,

425
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,600
for he had no tears to shed.

426
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,840
It took his shriveled eyeballs

427
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,520
a moment to filter out the blinding sun rays

428
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,200
to see the source of his salvation.

429
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,480
It was the vultures emptying their bowels

430
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,180
in preparation of the upcoming feast.

431
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,500
The traveler was furious.

432
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,660
He grabbed fists of sand

433
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,100
and threw them towards the birds,

434
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,660
but to no avail.

435
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,980
The sand merely fell back in his eyes,

436
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,240
causing him more irritation.

437
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,040
He cursed his God.

438
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,180
He stomped about, kicking the dust,

439
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,160
when, quite unintentionally,

440
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,300
he stomped his toe on something buried in the ground.

441
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,620
The pain gave him new strength.

442
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,680
He yanked the dirty jar from the earth

443
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,320
and aimed to toss at the buzzards.

444
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,920
But during the windup,

445
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,160
he felt a sloshing from within.

446
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,540
With dire anticipation,

447
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,940
he scraped the dirt from the labor,

448
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,740
and it read,

449
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,440
This jar contains water.

450
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,180
Do not drink it.

451
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,820
Use it to prime the pump,

452
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,380
and then refill it when finished.

453
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,820
Thank you, and have a nice day.

454
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,300
Well,

455
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,280
well, well, well, well!

456
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,520
I don't need to tell you what a predicament

457
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,040
this put our poor protagonist in.

458
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,460
If he drank the contents of the jar,

459
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,700
he would have to have his thirst quenched,

460
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,460
only temporarily.

461
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,960
But if he put his faith in the message,

462
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,700
he could have the everlasting liquid of life

463
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,180
in limitless liters.

464
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,940
Now, which would you do, dear listener?

465
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,560
Or to be more precise,

466
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,760
which have you already done?

467
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,420
For every day, dear friends,

468
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,900
you are faced with the same,

469
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:29,820
the same dilemma

470
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,840
as our thirst-quenched,

471
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,620
starving,

472
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,600
dehydrated desert dweller.

473
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,520
You see,

474
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,760
the everlasting liquid of life

475
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:38,980
is slack.

476
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,500
And the message

477
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,740
that you must believe to receive

478
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,400
this most everlasting of life

479
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,640
is the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

480
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,360
Believe in him,

481
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,320
and you will receive his slack

482
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,220
in everlasting quantities.

483
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,520
Not just a taste here,

484
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
or a gulp there,

485
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,880
but an abundance of slack

486
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,980
every which way.

487
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,560
You will drown in life's pleasures

488
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,480
Monday through Friday,

489
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,240
weekends to boot.

490
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,900
But you see,

491
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,940
the conspiracy wants to keep you

492
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,780
on a tight chain.

493
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,820
They don't want to give you

494
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,720
any slack at all.

495
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,120
But they do so grudgingly

496
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,020
since you need it to survive

497
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,760
to serve them.

498
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,440
They give you the weekends

499
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
and some time to set aside

500
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,780
so you can recharge

501
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,940
and have another

502
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,480
life-sustaining drop of slack.

503
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,800
Most folks,

504
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,920
they use this opportunity

505
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,140
to mow their yards

506
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,280
or wash their cars

507
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,000
or attend their conspiracy churches.

508
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,660
Somewhere in between,

509
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,140
they do get a drop or two

510
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,220
of slack or else they die.

511
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,940
Such are the bare necessities

512
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,400
of humans.

513
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,040
But how much they get

514
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,200
is what the conspiracy

515
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,800
tries so hard to control.

516
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,820
Like the dehydrated traveler,

517
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,860
they want to ration it out to you

518
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,000
with an eyedropper,

519
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,620
drop by drop,

520
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,040
so you'll always be

521
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,800
at their mercy,

522
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,540
ready to fulfill

523
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,500
their every whim.

524
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,620
They control you

525
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,480
through your ignorance.

526
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,120
They tell you

527
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
Bob's a joke,

528
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,340
a myth,

529
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,360
some kind of

530
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,040
hocus-pocus circus magic.

531
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,840
The only true religions,

532
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,680
according to them,

533
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,120
are the ones who are not.

534
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,460
They're the ones

535
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,980
their state owns

536
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,820
and operates.

537
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,880
Christianity,

538
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,660
Judaism,

539
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,400
Islam,

540
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,460
fill in the blank,

541
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,300
whatever it is.

542
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,160
There's a thousand

543
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,040
different religions

544
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,760
with a thousand

545
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,640
different rules.

546
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,960
But all their rules

547
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,540
and religions

548
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,500
have one thing

549
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,640
in common, dear friends.

550
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,820
They tell you

551
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,640
that slack is bad.

552
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,840
Slack is evil.

553
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,480
Slack is the work

554
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,280
of the devil.

555
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,460
Oh, it's hard to believe,

556
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,400
isn't it, dear friends?

557
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:26,940
And yet,

558
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,940
most of the world

559
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,000
believes exactly that.

560
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,080
Only J.R. Bob Dobbs

561
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,140
has the gonads

562
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,720
to tell the emperor

563
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,860
the naked truth.

564
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,420
Only Bob

565
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,920
is standing up

566
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,260
and stating the obvious,

567
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,800
the universal truth.

568
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,440
It's good

569
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,840
to feel good.

570
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,640
It's bad

571
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,320
to feel bad.

572
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,040
If man were meant

573
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,760
to feel guilt,

574
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,820
he wouldn't have been

575
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,560
born with a bob.

576
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,000
While the conspiracy

577
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,860
is telling you

578
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,600
you gotta serve somebody,

579
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,220
Bob is saying

580
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,040
serve yourself.

581
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,900
Take as much slack

582
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,520
as you want.

583
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,360
It's not a rare commodity.

584
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,420
This planet is covered with it.

585
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,960
You only need to know

586
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,820
where to look.

587
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,800
And, dear friends,

588
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
that same Bob Dobbs

589
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,820
wants to be your guide.

590
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,680
For as he said so himself

591
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,100
many years ago,

592
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,080
you could give a man a fish

593
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,780
and you'd fed him for a day.

594
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,340
But teach a man

595
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,380
to fish wallets

596
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,280
and you'd fed him forever.

597
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,860
So,

598
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,840
what's it going to be,

599
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,600
dear friends?

600
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,940
A conspiracy-recommended

601
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,160
daily allowance of slack?

602
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,940
Or a complete,

603
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,380
unadulterated,

604
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,360
drown-in-your-own-pleasures

605
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,400
orgy of slack

606
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,280
where you

607
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,540
and only you

608
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,220
say when you've had enough?

609
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,600
The choice

610
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
is yours.

611
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,600
For as Dobbs

612
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,400
so adroitly observed,

613
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,580
you can lead a man to slack,

614
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,100
but you can't

615
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,940
make him drink it.

616
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,560
Here endeth

617
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,660
the word of Bob.

618
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,840
Bob,

619
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,520
praise Bob.

620
00:24:59,740 --> 00:24:59,900
Amen.

621
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,860
Amen, indeed.

622
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,200
Amen, indeed.

623
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,260
Father.

624
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,220
Father, Joe Mama,

625
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,500
my, my word.

626
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,040
Praise Bob, friends.

627
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,520
That was,

628
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,120
that was awe-inspiring.

629
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,680
I'm sitting here in awe.

630
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,240
Awe.

631
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,800
The whole,

632
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,180
well,

633
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,340
Father Mama,

634
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,740
thank you so,

635
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,260
so much.

636
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,660
It was a,

637
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,520
truly an exciting experience.

638
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:36,820
Um,

639
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,560
tell us,

640
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,000
what, what,

641
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,920
what brings you

642
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,920
to our fair Metroplex

643
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,280
this,

644
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,920
this

645
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,040
snowy weekend?

646
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,500
The evil that men do.

647
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,420
Oh, Bob, you mean?

648
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,640
The evil that men do?

649
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,740
Yes, yes.

650
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,760
And we, we,

651
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,400
we all, we know,

652
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,300
we know who's been watching.

653
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,840
That show,

654
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,660
the, the prayer,

655
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,680
this is the prayer of the,

656
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,240
the peaky.

657
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,520
I don't know if you've seen that or not.

658
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:00,960
Visual.

659
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,200
You, you wouldn't understand.

660
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,400
Well, uh, dear friends,

661
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,260
uh, again, uh,

662
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,980
should you have any questions about any of,

663
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,520
any of this,

664
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,280
it should be pretty obvious after that.

665
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,000
Stay tuned.

666
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,640
We'll be back.

667
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,220
will see you tomorrow.

668
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,580
We'll do this.

669
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,040
I think you guys like the,

670
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,820
you, you like the idea of.

671
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,420
Oh yeah,

672
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:45,560


673
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:45,560


674
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:45,560


675
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:45,560


676
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,860
it's more likely we'll see you next week.

677
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,120
I said that because I don't want all of our writers andçš„

678
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,560
references that be,

679
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:52,720
Not.

680
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,420
Yes.

681
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,220
So there you go.

682
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,220


683
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,220


684
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,400
Ah, thank you, Rita.

685
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
We got all the way through it this time.

686
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,800
Again, thanks to Father Joe Mama.

687
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,920
We'll maybe hear a bit more from him later.

688
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,060
But now, I think it's time for those strains,

689
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,420
those musical strains that we all look so forward to

690
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,380
here at the Hour of Slack.

691
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,280
I know I do.

692
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,020
Hello out there in Radioland.

693
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,800
It's time once more for another exciting installment

694
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,000
of the Papa Prell Show.

695
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,480
I am your host,

696
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,340
the Papa Prell,

697
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,560
and tonight, I'm going to present to you

698
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,080
empirical evidence that the media lies.

699
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,380
Yes, I know everyone believes everything they hear,

700
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,480
see, and read in the news.

701
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,840
I also realize that the U.S. media

702
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,080
dominates all the other news agencies internationally,

703
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,820
but that does not give it credibility.

704
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,520
On the contrary,

705
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,260
in order to hold a monopoly on the media manipulation,

706
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,380
the network news conspiracy must control

707
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,580
all arms of the news-gathering octopus.

708
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,780
I know, I know,

709
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,820
you don't believe me,

710
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,320
and that's good, you shouldn't believe me.

711
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,880
But why do you believe them instead?

712
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,880
Are they any more believable than yours truly, Papa Prell?

713
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,760
After all, I just state the obvious.

714
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,580
Have I ever said one thing that you didn't already know

715
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,520
or agree with anyhow?

716
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,760
Jimmy Carter was an idiot, the liberals are wimps,

717
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,620
we should go bomb Iran.

718
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,360
I could go on and on, but you've heard it all the first time

719
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,340
and you knew it was true then.

720
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,960
The media, on the other hand, well,

721
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,800
they fabricate the most unbelievable baloney

722
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,880
and you take it as fact.

723
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,600
Without any proof other than a few doctored photographs

724
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,180
or some old Hollywood reenactments of events

725
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,980
that never took place.

726
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,480
Take the moon landing, for example.

727
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,320
Do you really believe that we sent human beings

728
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,480
all the way up there?

729
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
What evidence is there?

730
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,000
Radio transmissions?

731
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,100
They can be faked.

732
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,480
Photographs?

733
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,520
They can be doctored.

734
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,500
A few moon rocks?

735
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,140
Can you tell the difference?

736
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,560
You took it all on faith, didn't you?

737
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,980
Because the news media told you it was true

738
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,820
and some politician took the credit.

739
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,540
Which do you think is more expensive anyhow?

740
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,520
Bribing the American press?

741
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,160
Or building an honest-to-God space program?

742
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,960
I mean, you saw what happened to the Challenger

743
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,220
when we really did try to launch a satellite, didn't you?

744
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,120
Who knows?

745
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,300
Maybe even that was fake.

746
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,680
Maybe they're trying to collect the insurance.

747
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,500
I don't know.

748
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,260
The media conspiracy can do anything it wants.

749
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,980
It owns all the avenues of communication.

750
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,800
It's a guild, a union.

751
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,740
No one else is allowed to do business

752
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,280
unless they tow the potty line.

753
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,700
Just by saying this, I put myself in grave danger.

754
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,060
My show may be canceled at any time.

755
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,860
My life's work and reputation erased from the public file.

756
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,700
1984 wasn't a science fiction.

757
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,480
It was a blueprint, a proposal on how to control reality.

758
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,240
Goebbels spilled the beans way back in the 30s when he said,

759
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,860
tell the people a lie long enough and they'll believe it.

760
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,720
We fought Hitler in World War II

761
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,520
because his media machine was becoming as powerful as ours.

762
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
And the public consciousness can't be confused

763
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,720
with two different realities at one time.

764
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,700
What?

765
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,680
You thought we fought Hitler because he was a tyrant and killed his own people?

766
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,380
Oh boy.

767
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,780
You probably thought we fought the Civil War to free the slaves too, huh?

768
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,860
Well, I shouldn't expect too much from you.

769
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,340
After all, I was fooled too when I fought in that war.

770
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,760
World War II, that is, not the Civil War.

771
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,080
I'm not that old yet.

772
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,500
But didn't it ever seem a little inconsistent

773
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,400
that we would team up with Russia and China to defeat Germany and Japan

774
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,640
when our own allies killed more of their own citizens in peace?

775
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:50,920
In peace time?

776
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,780
Than our enemies did at war and peace combined?

777
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,660
Who knows how many people Roosevelt killed?

778
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,000
He had the concentration camps and railroad cars to do it.

779
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,500
Why do you think they're paying off the survivors four billion dollars?

780
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,140
So they'll keep their mouths shut, that's why.

781
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,400
Fortunately for you, however, I have not been bought out.

782
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,880
At least not yet, anyway.

783
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,720
And I'm gonna keep telling the truth until everyone knows it.

784
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Here, then, is the proof scientifically presented and irrefutable evidence,

785
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,700
Here, then, is the proof scientifically presented and irrefutable evidence,

786
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,640
The media lies!

787
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,960
The following report was taped off the television just a few nights ago.

788
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,840
A news program that many of you know and trust.

789
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,640
This propaganda is aimed at discrediting me and my family

790
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,820
because we know too much, and they're afraid the public will believe us.

791
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,620
Already my firstborn has been assassinated.

792
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
Who knows when the next knock on the door will sound?

793
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,020
Once we're all killed, they'll go assassinate all of our characters

794
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,780
like they did poor Allen Juniors.

795
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,840
Listen, then, to this report.

796
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,020
Just you listen.

797
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,640
I was so shocked I couldn't even operate my VCR in time to get it all on tape.

798
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,320
And on top of that, I erased over one of my favorite soaps.

799
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,700
But here it is, then, the proof you've all been waiting for.

800
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,120
That everything you know is lies!

801
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,780
The media lies!

802
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,340
...has a way with women.

803
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,340
But not really the normal way.

804
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,260
Though reportedly been married eight times, is the father of many children,

805
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
he's been divorced once.

806
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,820
Our Bill McGowan, the father of many children, has been divorced once.

807
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:19,940
That's right.

808
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,700
Bill McGowan, producer Hilary Palatnik, tell us it's something that makes his other seven wives as mad as you know what.

809
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,700
He was a con man from way back.

810
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,560
He had numerous affairs while he was married to my mother.

811
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:49,420
I heard rumors about him, but they were so bizarre, you know, about him maybe being married or, you know,

812
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:49,800
some of the things he did.

813
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,320
And I said, you know, I'm not going to listen to that effect.

814
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,380
I said, you know, this just doesn't happen.

815
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:03,420
He was my husband, and if it was up to me, you know, I would really go track this man down.

816
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,900
I would have to really spill some blood.

817
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,740
He'd have to swing.

818
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,180
Everyone wants a piece of Alan Prel, Jr.

819
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,000
It's always been that way.

820
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:19,120
His rugged good looks, well-renowned sexual appetite, and smooth radio voice left women falling at his feet.

821
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,780
Now, he's a man of his word.

822
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:25,940
Now it's his body they're after, along with the police and 16 million viewers of America's Most Wanted.

823
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,960
Tonight's Most Wanted has moved around a lot, but wherever he goes, women seem to follow.

824
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,500
So do the police.

825
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:39,800
They say Alan Prel is a con man, a repeat offender, and he's got six wives waiting to prove it.

826
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,620
Every time the show starts, I would really get nervous.

827
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,920
Oh, I would just say, I wonder who's going to be on it, and what did they do, and who did they do it to?

828
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,840
And is this person in our neighborhood?

829
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,540
In your neighborhood would be shocking enough, but what about in your house?

830
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,840
When Lena watched America's Most Wanted on Easter Sunday, the bigamists they were after sounded a lot like Lena's new brother-in-law.

831
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,260
And as the program continued, the family resemblance was unmistakable.

832
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:11,100
And then they started with, you know, this man is from Virginia, and I said, what a coincidence.

833
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,880
And they said, this man work in broadcasting.

834
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,240
I said, well, what do you know?

835
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,680
And he's dealt with horses.

836
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,640
I said, how about that?

837
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,340
I said, you know what?

838
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,080
I said, I have this feeling this is our person here.

839
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,260
I know it made my hair stand on end because I was so shocked.

840
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,700
I mean, they had to give me aspirin and water and try to calm me down because I just couldn't believe it.

841
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,680
Lena called 911 thinking only how her sister would take the news.

842
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,620
For better or for worse, now had a whole new meaning.

843
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,880
I was worried. I was concerned for what she was going to feel.

844
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,640
I said, this is going to be a very big shock to her.

845
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,760
And I didn't want to tell her because I was afraid that she might tell me.

846
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,380
And that she might give him her keys and he would run away.

847
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,260
I believed that she would do that.

848
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,100
You know, when you're in love, you do all kinds of things.

849
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,200
I don't think that he ever loved my sister.

850
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,460
I don't believe he loved anyone.

851
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,260
You know, I think he just loved himself.

852
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,980
I mean, you don't abandon five children and then get three more.

853
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,100
Abandon those and get two, three more and never look over your shoulder.

854
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,660
Lena's information soon reached Lewis P. Axhandle, the detective assigned to track Prell down.

855
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Axhandle had studied Prell for some time and had a good idea how Prell operated.

856
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,140
We felt like he'd be caught because we felt like he would be with a woman somewhere

857
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,920
and possibly have already gotten married again.

858
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,020
And we were right.

859
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,380
He says the things that those people would like to hear and he gains their confidence.

860
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:47,160
And then he takes advantage of those things that he wants, whether it be assets or whatever,

861
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,440
and then he moves on.

862
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:54,100
The courts had been trying to locate Prell since 1974 when he was first charged with bigamy.

863
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,340
Prell had married at least four other women since 1965, including Susan Studd.

864
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,660
I think he used the voice, the radio voice, on people.

865
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,540
He used it on everybody and I was no exception.

866
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,260
Hey, gorgeous.

867
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,720
I just hope you don't mind me mentioning you got just about the best pair I've ever seen.

868
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,400
A pair of blue jeans, that is.

869
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,240
What are they, painted on?

870
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,940
Boy, you really are a little dish, aren't you?

871
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,240
Say, how would you like to fix me dinner, huh?

872
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,660
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

873
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,880
And you fix the dinner and I'll provide the dessert.

874
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,060
Boy, I think you and I could make a little rendezvous.

875
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,100
Oh, no, no, don't worry about this ring.

876
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,060
That's just for decoration.

877
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,900
That's just to scare off the girls in the back.

878
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,580
Susan married Prell nine months after they met in 1967.

879
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,380
By 1972, he was gone.

880
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,780
I was pregnant with my fourth child.

881
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,200
I had three small children.

882
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,460
I had no money.

883
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,560
I mean, zero.

884
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,360
No money, no food, no diapers for the children.

885
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,600
I had to move back in with my parents.

886
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
We can document at least eight cases.

887
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:30,040
And we know of just information I've gathered from other people, probably 12 cases.

888
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,160
And probably one legitimate divorce.

889
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,020
Alan Prell's career as a family man began in 1957 when he married Gladys Ware.

890
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,820
Together, they had two children.

891
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,380
Gladys has the dubious distinction of being the only woman known to be legitimately divorced from Prell.

892
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,780
And according to her daughter,

893
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,600
even that was the result of a trick.

894
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,960
She says Prell told her mother they needed to divorce temporarily

895
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,520
so he could retain ownership of a radio station.

896
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,240
A technicality, he said.

897
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,460
But before the ink was dry on the papers, Prell was gone.

898
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,960
Then a few years later, he thought, well, he'll try to come back to my mother.

899
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,740
And he said, just sweet talked her,

900
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:15,720
Condor, baby, I love you, and I love the kids, and I want to make it up to you.

901
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,740
Please come back to me.

902
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,840
And she fell for it.

903
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,240
Went back with him.

904
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,040
And they moved to Knoxville, Tennessee.

905
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,660
And there, for her to only find out that he was already married,

906
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:34,000
when she got there, he came home wearing the wrong wedding band.

907
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,360
And that tormented my mother.

908
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:46,380
I feel a lot of pain and angry for what he did to my mother.

909
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,360
Gladys would not go on record without her lawyer.

910
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,680
But we did obtain these comments from a deposition she gave police.

911
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,320
Yeah, we got married on the radio.

912
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,000
Of course, that was before we got it in his gut.

913
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,640
I suppose he was a bit of a commodity back then.

914
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,940
But I decided to trade him back in in 78.

915
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,860
You know, divorce.

916
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,820
Yeah, he was a two-time all right.

917
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,320
Time and time again.

918
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,180
Gladys has had to deal with her anger for over 20 years.

919
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,880
Susan wants her children shielded from that pain.

920
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,680
So when they started receiving flattering letters from their so-called father,

921
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,720
Susan wanted them to know the truth.

922
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:30,860
He was using the same lines about, you know, how pretty they were.

923
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,460
He wanted to see pictures of them.

924
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,760
He thought about them constantly.

925
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,800
You know, he was sorry that he did what he did.

926
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,640
And he would like to explain it to them.

927
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,680
He would like to see them.

928
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,980
And that really bothered me a whole lot.

929
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,980
Because they were, my children were believing a lot of the things that he was saying to them.

930
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,900
And was asking me, why did I not like him?

931
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,300
Or why did I not want him?

932
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,340
You know, from the things that he was saying in these letters.

933
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,620
He was turning the whole picture around, the way things had happened.

934
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,980
I'm not going to give him a chance to shoot the bull with me

935
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,220
and twist me around to put me on his side.

936
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,060
That's how he handles people.

937
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,060
He's a manipulator.

938
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,320
Authorities closed in on Prell as a result of the America's Most Wanted broadcast.

939
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,200
But the night he was to be arrested, he was murdered live on the radio.

940
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,540
Alan Prell Show. You're on the air.

941
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,380
Hi, Alan.

942
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,320
Hello.

943
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:30,820
How are you?

944
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,020
I'm doing fine.

945
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,300
I bet you have one nut, just like him.

946
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:34,820
Hello.

947
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,420
There's more than one nut in this room, I want to tell you.

948
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,620
And there's more than one nut out there calling in.

949
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,660
Hey, you can't be in the system.

950
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,460
Wait a minute. Hold on. What?

951
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,820
What's going on in here?

952
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,740
What is it?

953
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,640
Oh!

954
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,540
Oh!

955
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:58,160
By the time police did arrive, a mysterious fire had destroyed most of the evidence.

956
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,060
When the smoke cleared and the ashes were sifted, no body was found.

957
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,480
Authorities are investigating allegations that the remains were stolen by fanatical fans.

958
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,260
But until the body is found, there is still not enough compensation for many of the victims.

959
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,440
You know, I never got a penny.

960
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,820
I never got a penny of the insurance money.

961
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,020
They claim they couldn't find the body.

962
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,800
How convenient.

963
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,460
Do you know how much alimony that rattled me?

964
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,680
You know, sometimes I wonder if he's really dead.

965
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:38,080
I'm a nice person, but I want to smack him real good and relieve a little bit of hurt that I have.

966
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,940
Just a good smack.

967
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,080
I told him that if he ever left me, I'd track him down to the ends of the earth.

968
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,460
And I didn't care how long it would take me until I found him.

969
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,800
Well, the time's here.

970
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,440
And we'll be watching for what happens then. We'll keep you posted.

971
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,700
Now, still ahead tonight, a Carson in court has Johnny on the spot.

972
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,360
Disgusting. Disgusting!

973
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,480
And yet, so typical.

974
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,600
Only a media so secure in its lies could possibly attack such a martyr.

975
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,580
With a spotless reputation as Alan Prell Jr.

976
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,660
And think they can get away with it.

977
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,820
But you know me. And you know what kind of family I raise.

978
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,840
Alan was an honest, outstanding young man.

979
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,560
And it was his dedication to the truth that led him to an early grave.

980
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,000
Now, I too am mocked.

981
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,720
For I too refuse to play along with the media monopoly on manipulation.

982
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,420
Yes, they may assassinate me also.

983
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,600
And they may produce such character assassinations as the one that we just heard.

984
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,020
But you, you dear listener, you've heard the truth.

985
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,920
And no matter how much phony evidence they present, no matter how cleverly it's twisted.

986
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,220
Oh, and it's clever, all right.

987
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,840
They put Satan to shame.

988
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,460
They mix truth and lie so you can't tell the difference.

989
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,560
Alan was in fact married to a woman named Gladys.

990
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,120
But he never had a daughter. At least not by Gladys.

991
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,940
No matter how often they repeat their lies.

992
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,580
No matter how often they say what you want to believe.

993
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,060
No matter how often they repeat their lies.

994
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,780
Don't take it as truth without proof.

995
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,680
I may not live to tell you again.

996
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,540
I've been encountering a lot of fishy accidents lately, so they may be after me now.

997
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:28,920
But there comes a time when even my superior intelligence and advanced training survival techniques cannot hold out against the vast resources and technology of them.

998
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:36,580
If I should disappear or die in the peculiar circumstances, just remember Papa Prell told you so.

999
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,840
Well, I'm about out of time.

1000
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,260
For the show, that is.

1001
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,280
So until this time next week, this is Papa Prell saying so long till next time again, and God bless.

1002
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,240
And don't believe the media.

1003
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,700
They're a pack of liars.

1004
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,460
Don't trust them as far as you can spit, because they'll count on you every single week.

1005
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,080
And of course, that is the last tape we've received from Papa Prell in a while.

1006
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,700
I hate to make any assumptions on that basis.

1007
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:21,420
But it just goes to show you, I mean, if Papa Prell can pierce the veil of the media conspiracy lies, it must be pretty damned obvious.

1008
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,300
And what chance do you or I have, my friends?

1009
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,840
What chance do you and I have?

1010
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:32,740
If they can do that to a man like Prell, then what possible chance do the likes of you and I have?

1011
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,060
And what chance do we have in the future?

1012
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,060


1013
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,140
I mean, the years, days, months, not many years left to come.

1014
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:47,960
But this occurs to me because as here in Dallas, it's about to soon become 1991.

1015
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:55,820
As this show goes to other cities, it will, of course, be later on in the year.

1016
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,420
But let's look back at the year 1990, shall we?

1017
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,720
And see, yes, Joe Mom is still here.

1018
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,340
In spirit.

1019
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,060
In spirit.

1020
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,640
If nothing else.

1021
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:06,820
Yes.

1022
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:07,900
And to find out.

1023
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,540
And my spirit's here.

1024
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,800
Ah ha ha.

1025
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,580
Keeping me warm.

1026
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,680
Ah, spirit is willing.

1027
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,400
Proof.

1028
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,180
100 proof.

1029
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,240
That's, what else do you need?

1030
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,380
Let's see what Bob said would occur in the year 1990.

1031
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,840
Civilized people losing faith in modern medicine.

1032
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:23,640
That happened.

1033
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:23,960
It did.

1034
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,100
Dr. Kevorkian, we saw that.

1035
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,780
Perfect example.

1036
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,060
Synthetic food wars.

1037
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,840
Horse, cat, dog, rat meat sold openly all over U.S.

1038
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,020
I've been buying it.

1039
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,240
Yep.

1040
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,280
Cannibalism practiced in rural areas.

1041
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,660
You know, we read about that in the media.

1042
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,680
The conspiracy keeps that well, well hidden.

1043
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,840
Yeah, it'll beat up our supply if we tell them about that.

1044
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,800
Roach excrement processed and packaged as diet supplement.

1045
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,200
Didn't you have that today, earlier?

1046
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,460
Some of my Twinkies.

1047
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:48,820
Yeah?

1048
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,220
Oh yeah.

1049
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,580
Brazil invades U.S., driven back by citizen armies after government and military forces

1050
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:54,960
fail.

1051
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,020
Oh, I think the Panama thing in disguise.

1052
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,240
Yeah, see, you know, this is not always meant to be taken, you know, a certain amount of.

1053
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,220
You have to, you know, speak in allegory.

1054
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,460
I bet you, but the world is not ready.

1055
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,940
The world is clearly not ready.

1056
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,160
The ales are not as they seem.

1057
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,480
They're not always what they seem.

1058
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,940
Atlantis rises from the middle of Kansas.

1059
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,660
Ancient Dobbs heads found carved into ruins.

1060
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,880
Ah, well, I don't, that one I don't know.

1061
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,940
Well, it probably has to.

1062
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,820
We're not going to learn about it.

1063
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:21,740
Not I.

1064
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,500
We should read the Inquirer.

1065
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,680
Common cold cured by magic spells.

1066
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,860
That's true.

1067
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,320
Oh, well, there's.

1068
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,320
Will be.

1069
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,240
Yeah, there's time.

1070
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:30,660
There's time.

1071
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,200
Foundation scientists, after cracking DNA's in the U.S.

1072
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,220
code within the code, develop instant mutation process.

1073
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,760
Slightly risky method of producing homemade over men, which attracts many teenagers into the church.

1074
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,160
Now that is being done, but it's being kept under wraps.

1075
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:45,460
I see.

1076
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,140
It's by us.

1077
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:46,400
Yes.

1078
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:53,560
The crashed UFO recovered from Bermuda Triangle by anonymous Fort Worth millionaire provides undeniable proof of space conspiracy.

1079
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,280
It was back in the 40s.

1080
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,740
Yeah, well, you know, as always.

1081
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,280
Time lag.

1082
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,200
It happens.

1083
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,200
None of us, none of us are perfect.

1084
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,480
Bob himself.

1085
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,040
Subgenius inspires.

1086
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:04,180


1087
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,840
The required fertility rights commonly performed all over world as if in defiance of harsh realities of overpopulation.

1088
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,480
Well, we all know that's true.

1089
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:12,960
Yes.

1090
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,160
Bob's message has often been that.

1091
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,240
We're turning right here, folks.

1092
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,400
There aren't enough subgeniuses, so you know what that means.

1093
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,260
The trisexuals.

1094
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:20,560
You know it.

1095
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,300
They'll try anything.

1096
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,160
They, it's.

1097
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,180
Yes, we at the Subgenius Foundation, we believe in the honor system.

1098
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,600
And honor.

1099
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,560
Get honor and stay honor.

1100
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:27,960
Is that true?

1101
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,000
No, not at all.

1102
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,840
Anti-family movement, although starting to lose ground to subgenius, is still powerful enough

1103
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,700
to make bestiality a P.E. option in many public school systems.

1104
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,760
They did that at my school.

1105
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,420
Well, see.

1106
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,580
See, this isn't going to happen all over the world at once, you know.

1107
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,860
It's gradual.

1108
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,440
Gradual.

1109
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,260
Of course, my school is a school of fish, but.

1110
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,180
Well, never mind.

1111
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,580
Attempts to make adultery mandatory.

1112
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,600
It's a symbol, folks.

1113
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,640
Fails as bill as blocked by Bob-directed Senate subcommittee.

1114
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,120
That would be darn.

1115
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,820
Bob Dole, I think, is what they're talking about there.

1116
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,340
That don't.

1117
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,440
This may be the.

1118
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,080
According to this, the American dictator, now identified by the church as the anti-Bob,

1119
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,960
gains admiration of world through military triumphs.

1120
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,420
Oddly, Bob throws his entire support behind the anti-Bob.

1121
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,840
Well, you know, the world's supply of oil depends on this.

1122
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,040
And it's not our choosing.

1123
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,940
And Bob controls all major TV networks, plus ITT, Texas Instruments, General Dynamics,

1124
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,340
McDonnell Douglas, Ford, McGraw-Hill, General Motors, and Texaco.

1125
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,220
And Night Flight.

1126
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:31,960
And Night Flight.

1127
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,760
And I think, if nothing else, one of the major networks is obviously controlled by

1128
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,060
Bob.

1129
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,180
It's ABC.

1130
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,120
I guess I might as well go ahead and say it.

1131
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,080
All the Bob references on Twin Peaks are, none of them, none of them are an accident.

1132
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,500
But let's look ahead, shall we?

1133
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:53,500
Let's cast our eyes and our third nostril ahead into the year 1991.

1134
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,360
See what the future holds for you.

1135
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,020
Right here at the top, World War III.

1136
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,360
It's going, January 15th, folks.

1137
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,500
15th, yep.

1138
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,720
And Martin Luther King's birthday.

1139
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,220
Kind of an ironic, ironic note.

1140
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,080
Apropos.

1141
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,860
Ah, yes.

1142
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,720
Our peace march into the Middle East.

1143
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,540
Into the Middle East.

1144
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,000
Ah.

1145
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:13,480
Ah.

1146
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:18,300
Bob forms alliance with the anti-Bob, reveals hard evidence of imminent Exist invasion.

1147
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:19,680
Hmm.

1148
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,420
Yeah.

1149
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,720
Another major UFO flap is coming.

1150
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,920
This time, saucers drop real money and gold all over the Midwest.

1151
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,760
I'm getting my net ready.

1152
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,200
Yes.

1153
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,000
When it rains, money or anything else just falls.

1154
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,000


1155
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,900
Out with your bushel barrels.

1156
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,240
400 million zombies for Bob worldwide.

1157
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,580
Zombies for Bob.

1158
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,920
A subgenius pro-family movement initiates campaign to clean up America morally.

1159
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,280
That doesn't sound like something that we would do, does it?

1160
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,180
Well, sometimes, you know, they'll use your name and kind of come in there with something, you know.

1161
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:50,720
They will.

1162
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,680
They'll trick you.

1163
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,080
Well, now, sometimes Bob, sometimes Bob gets ahead of himself.

1164
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,060
Bulletproof robots run most convenience stores.

1165
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,780
That's already happened, see?

1166
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,820
Look ahead.

1167
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,440
It, it, well, never mind.

1168
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:11,060
Accident with solar gathering satellites which encircle the Earth set off incredible spate of tornadoes across the United States.

1169
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,800
So be looking for that.

1170
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,060
I think you'll know when that happens.

1171
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,860
There'll be little, little doubt about it.

1172
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:16,960
I'll be in my cellar.

1173
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:17,400
Ah.

1174
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,340
Minimum wage reaches $86.50 an hour, but a soft drink will cost $40.

1175
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,280
Now the soft drink part's happening.

1176
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,220
Again.

1177
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,820
Average human lifespan now figured at 40 years.

1178
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:30,620
40 years.

1179
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,700
Three score and, you know, less than that.

1180
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,060
I mean, what?

1181
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,400
It's better to die than to fade away.

1182
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,220
Ah, so they, so they say.

1183
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,800
24 hours of artificial daylight common in large cities.

1184
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,040
Incidents of psychosis increases correspondingly.

1185
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,920
It's a hard year.

1186
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,800
End times are coming.

1187
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,880
The end times are coming.

1188
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,700
They're on their way.

1189
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,860
It's not long now.

1190
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,440
Like, what's a 40 years time limit?

1191
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,420
I mean, what's that gonna matter?

1192
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,680
We're all gonna die anyway.

1193
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,100
And, and, just a few, and that, that's, see, that's next year.

1194
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,580
It's only seven more years anyway.

1195
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,300
Seven more years.

1196
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,080
There's the mystic number.

1197
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,880
It's a, I pity those of you that are like 38 right now.

1198
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,380
It's, it's, sorry.

1199
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,080
Don't blame Bob.

1200
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,540
He doesn't, what is it we say in the, he doesn't make history.

1201
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,320
He just exploits it.

1202
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:12,540


1203
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,520
Church offers experimental transfigurations to willing guinea pigs.

1204
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,140
Crude man-made overmen are created through immediate somatic alteration of physiology.

1205
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:27,220
Bozo cult, now a hated rival of the church, in imitation offers smile face surgery and

1206
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,300
while you wait lobotomies.

1207
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,280
I've seen that.

1208
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,080
I've seen the lobotomy people.

1209
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,200
They're usually driving right now.

1210
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,860
I, we don't have to wait for 1991.

1211
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,340
It's coming, friends.

1212
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,200
20% of US population now considered clinically insane.

1213
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,720
Concentration camps.

1214
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,100
It's gone down.

1215
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,100
A bit, yeah.

1216
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,800
By 1991, it's looking, it's looking to drop a bit.

1217
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,100
Concentration camps for abnormals are opened in some states.

1218
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,220
You, subgeniuses begin waging open war on non-subgeniuses.

1219
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,100
Praise Bob.

1220
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:53,940
Thank heaven.

1221
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,340
Finally.

1222
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,680
Finally.

1223
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,060
Bob.

1224
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:00,260
Millions of homosexuals finally understanding Bob's deal become valiant warriors of the

1225
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:00,260


1226
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:00,660
church.

1227
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,720
Things are looking up, friend.

1228
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,040
Gonna get some aid here at last.

1229
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,700
No, there'll be aid for all.

1230
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,820
There will be aid for all.

1231
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,380
Foreign.

1232
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,220
Domestic.

1233
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:14,520
A fourth double subgenius of five existing at any given time is identified living in

1234
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,200
Peru.

1235
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:16,640
Hmm.

1236
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,320
The eagle's nest.

1237
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,000
Ah.

1238
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,060
Distorted signals of an alien TV show broadcast 10,000 years ago from a now defunct planet

1239
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,460
are received by Earth scientists.

1240
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,240
By this time, intelligent life on other planets is generally unrecognizable.

1241
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,240


1242
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,240


1243
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,780
Generally accepted as fact, although UFO activity on Earth is still a mystery.

1244
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:36,720
1991.

1245
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,580
The owls are not what they seem.

1246
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,100
And, of course, Disneyland converted to open murder park.

1247
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,520
We looking for that.

1248
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,500
Get your tickets now.

1249
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,000
Yes.

1250
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,660
It ain't 1991, friends.

1251
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,840
It ain't long.

1252
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,260
It won't be far.

1253
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,860
Dear friends, we've just about reached the end of this particular hour of Slack.

1254
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,860
What can I say?

1255
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,380
Thank you.

1256
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,740
Thank you, Father, Mama.

1257
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,580
It was an honor.

1258
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,540
A rare treat.

1259
00:52:59,600 --> 00:52:59,740
Thank you.

1260
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,040
It was a terrible way to begin the new year.

1261
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:02,580
I know.

1262
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,320
And, but no worse for you than for our poor listeners.

1263
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,780
That's the beauty of it.

1264
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,100
Yeah.

1265
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,420
Yeah.

1266
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,280
Ah, the harvest.

1267
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:15,360
Friends, if there's any questions left, I think we've pretty much covered everything

1268
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,040
tonight, but there's always those that need a bit more.

1269
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:24,160
So, if you have any more questions about the Church of the Subgenius, Father Joe Mama,

1270
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,080
Book of the...

1271
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,740
You name it.

1272
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,140
Just right away for that free information.

1273
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,240
P.O.

1274
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,020
Box 14.

1275
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,600
40306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1276
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:40,280
Again, that's Bob at 14306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1277
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,640
And that information is free.

1278
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,400
Any last words, Father Mama?

1279
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,120
Nine.

1280
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,520
Ah, nine.

1281
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,100
Yes.

1282
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,740
He has nine more words, but we don't have time for them because our hour is up.

1283
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,560
And so is yours.

1284
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,660
Praise Bob.

1285
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,420
Praise Bob.

1286
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,300
Praise Bob.

1287
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:56,720
Praise Bob.

1288
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,280
Praise Bob.

1289
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:57,280


1290
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,400
Praise Bob.

1291
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,440
Praise Bob.

1292
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,880
Praise Bob.

1293
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,560
Praise Bob.

1294
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,700
Praise Bob.

1295
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:22,980
Because he loves the Lord.

1296
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,140
He wants fence on the top of the hill.

1297
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,300
And then he'll go down and run into that house, and then he'll throw his talk back

1298
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:25,300


1299
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,860
And so the Lord our Father, while we're here at the church, he doesn't have much

1300
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,260
to say, particularly since we're here at the East and West side.
