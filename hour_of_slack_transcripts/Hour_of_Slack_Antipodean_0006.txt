This is an hour that comes to all except in states that don't have daylight saving.
I, sir, was referring to your Antipodeans of Jesus show.
The dead never laugh.

The sounds of summer.
The waves on the beach.
The smack of tennis ball against cricket bat.
Chasing it in the sand.
Swimming in the sea.
Feeling your skin blister and burn under the ultraviolet light.
Radiation.
The smell of meat burning on the barbecue.
The salads.
The beer in the chili bin.
Sand between your toes and in your jandals.
Summer.
Summer in the Antipodeans.
Yes, it's a...
What?
What's going on?
What am I doing in this lift?
Where are we?
What's that...
What's that...
What's that music?
What's going...
Ooh.
That's awfully strange.
What the hell is going on?
Why am I hearing this horrible jangly music?
Why am I in this ancient 1950s style lift with an ancient 1950s style lift attendant?
What's going on here?
Oh no.
Oh no.
Of course it's a jangly music.












I forgot.
Summer in the Antipodeans.
That's the Christmas period.
Oh crap.
Christmas is here again.
It's come around.
That horrible, horrible time has come around.
When they play that ancient Christmas music again and again.
All the old Christmas favorites.
White Christmas.
What a joke.
I mean, what a joke.
The...
The...















What the hell is he getting to?
What is the...
Is he...

Is the vanilla ice cream in your cone?
Or more likely falling on the ground because you didn't know how to lick it like I did when
I was your age.
Anyway, I've got to...
I've got to fight the Christmas.
I've got to fight...
Look here.
I want to register a complaint.
Next please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.






I'm sorry!
The Christmas powers that be.
Damn, what are we going to do?
Oh, I know.
I'll just dive inside.
Wav'em off these ultraviolet radiations and I'll...
I'll...
Yes.
That's what I'll do.
I'll create a show.
In which we spit...
We pit.
The X-mas man.
In the fat, red suit.
Against the ex-day man.
In the suit of dye.
And we'll see who wins!
Wait.
Yes, that's what I'll do. We'll fight it. We'll fight it. Yes, we'll fight it.
Because X-Men cannot... Because Santa Claus cannot stand up to J.R.R. Bob-Dogs.
No, honestly. No, really. Yes. Really. True. Yes.
You'll see. You'll see. You'll see. And you'll be sorry.

What was that all about?
Well, let's see what we had.
Firstly, we had the
French subgenius, Saul Soleil,
explaining to us about
and Joe's apartment, although what those two things have to do with hedgehogs I still don't quite understand.
Then we had some old ESO swamp radio with Professor Chaz Smith, Ivan Stang and Lonesome Cowboy Dave
discussing the fact that we're in the Jesus season, or rather they were, about the 20th of November 2002.
Next we had the Jethro's, there'll be another one of theirs coming up pretty soon, with Holly Golly Christmas.
Immediately followed thereafter, in triplicate actually, cheap reverb you know, were by Just John,
which you can reach at just-john.com, explaining just what does Santa do.
And now, I think we need some advertising. After all, it is the season to advertise, isn't it?
Your husbands will be more cheerful on dark mornings if you polish their Johnsons.
In fact, they're not.
I've heard several women say they were glad of a chance to help polish their husbands big or little.
Like all of us, they're glad to help in any way with self-polishing.
In fact, the regular use of rubbing or buffing will make your husbands last five times longer.
It will sparkle like new. It's a tremendous labor.
But, to get results, may I make a helpful suggestion?
Be sure to keep it protected with coat. Simply apply and let dry.
To know and act is one in the same.
If you know what's right, do it.
Take control of your customer. Get them up.
Let her feel your individuality. Your good taste unique.
There's no reason for her to shop department stores and see the same old.
Get it? We ain't McDonald's.
Muse, we're special. Your customer's special.
Enthuse, any piece can be done anyway. Imagine.
Have yourselves a groovy little solstice.
Mithras won his fight.
Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Come one, come all!
It's He-Bob. Hey kids, you can help the mighty Sub-Teenus Rice overthrow the evil normals with new Bobcops action figure with Rockin' Pie.
What I wouldn't do from Bobcops.
Get new one.
More chocolatey pebbles from you know who?
I'm a chocolate space cadet. Life support system down to zero cocoa.
Feeling space free.
Have some of my new cocoa pebbles. Now so chocolatey.
Mmm, smells coconut.
Space cocoa lipid.
Blue.
Well friends, what do you think? Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?
Or is it...
The horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?
It's so separate. It's so separate.
I'm a winner.
I know my goals.
I am intelligently aggressive.
I sell.
From my total knowledge of merchandise.
Using appropriate adjectives.
I act with an always positive mindset.
The more I sell, the more I'll have.
Try Uncle Bob's Vermilion Fentworm Bittles.
We use the whole worm, fry it up right, and give you the tasty soft parts and the crispy skin.
Yep, that's a mighty fine worm, and it doesn't taste like chicken.
You'll need those 999 sub-nutrients, because the evil alien flying reverse vampire monkeys stole my astral boy blushie during one of my last seven moves,
as I tried to stay one step ahead of the brain-sucking, snake-handling, tri-lateralist zombie Shriner Chuds.
Besides, it was falling apart.
Now if that's not a straight line, give me narwhal wang stew or deer head chili, or a Nigerian ee handjob,
or heavy sedation, or a second chance, or kill me!
The more I sell,
the more I'll have.
The more I sell,
the more I'll have.
The more I sell,
the more I'll have.
The more I sell,
the more I'll have.
I'll have the more I sell, the more I'll have.
Wait, bring up...
You'll wonder where your teeth went when you brush your teeth with Danso Peps.
Danso Peps.
Danso Peps.
It's Candy Frappy.
It's Frappy Candy.
Stop.
Eh?
You're both right.
Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.
Stripes and stripes and stripes of colors, colors, colors, colors and colors.
Colors that go below infrared and way above ultraviolet.
And the taste?
Yeah, Frappy Candy.
Well, I can see these two won't need any words or worms.
For several days now, I should say, I think.
So don't forget, that's new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.
Now with extra dimension Love Hamster 16.
Habitual not included.
Tell Jeff and all your Acer friends, this one's the beans for maximum best fun.
Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

The Gobi Bar People.
The Gobi Bar People.
Ding, ding, ding, ding.
Sleigh bells ringing all around, all around.
I'm worried, goodness knows.
Cause when Santa came to my eyes last year.
He went away and left his club.
I knew he was gonna bring me lots of things.
So happy I could dance.
When I went down to buy my present, I also found Santa Claus' head.
Poor old Santa Claus, poor old Santa Claus, my kids will stay.
When they see him bring their presents, they're sure in his long-tailed underwear.
I asked my daddy who knows everything, how such a thing could be.
His face turned red and he scratched his head, and this is what he said to me.
Well now, my dear, like when Santa Claus made it down the chimney last year to lay the loot on you,
he forthwith crept along on his tippy-toes and quite by accident flipped on the stereo.
And like a rock-and-roll sound which came forth, panicked old Whiskers out of his clothes.
So he split the scene forthwith and made it up the chimney post-haste.
And he said, poor old Santa Claus, poor old Santa Claus, my kids will stay.
When they see him bring their presents, they're sure in his long-tailed underwear.
Oh, good Lord!
Oh, good Lord!
Yuviu, stop fetching me.
He was carrying a compiled notice with Players Christmas Jill tag on the board.
icknett should
Well, I wanted to give a special thanks to Maximum-For-M versa.
We started off with an advertisement for husband Polish.
Then we had the old Bob ads again.
Yeah, those old things.
You heard them in the last Christmas show I believe.
And then, there was Help Hope Huey selling the old vermilionㅋㅋㅋㅋ
�rìnklviren Arkansas until this are very tasty indeed.
called Densopep, which you would need after eating Dr. Bleepo Abernathy's Candy Frappy
Frappy Candy.
What was it?
Frappy Candy Candy Frappy.
I can't remember, but it was off Bob's Media Pollution, I believe.
And then after that was a piece of the 365 Days Project, which was run by Otis F. Fodder
at ubu.com.
That's how it's spelled, U-B-U.
A strange little vanity number called Poor Old Santa Claus, which is obviously even stranger
than it sounds.
In any case, we've only got through about 15 minutes.
We've got longer to go.
But I think it's time we had a bit more Bobbly stuff, because we've had quite a bit of...
Oh, maybe I should explain about the strange, wonky...
version of Jingle Bells that's been playing ever so often, and is still playing now.
This is off, or out of, a modification for the computer game Quake, the old chestnut,
which is still going strong, called Twisted Christmas, which was reasonably fun.
It takes place in a shopping mall overrun by evil Santa and his evil minions and his
evil rocket-toting reindeer.
And you've got to go in with your shotguns and your nail guns and eventually your rocket
launcher, if you find the damn thing, and blow up the evil...
Santa and rescue the good Santa.
All rather silly, obviously, but part of the fun was that in the background there is this
wonky and not-quite-working-like music.
And if you've got the computer game Quake, this is the original Quake.
It's not got a number in front of it.
It's not Quake 4, Quake 3, or Quake 2.
It's just Quake.
You can get it through me at www.planetquake.com slash fatty.
And then you go to files.
And you look down for Twisted Christmas.
And there it is.

Christ was not our Savior, nor born on Christmas Day,

Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.
God love ye weary citizens, for it is such a shame
to think of cruel injustices all done in Jesus' name.
Remember when you go to church, believers are to blame.
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.
God help ye weary citizens, you've all been taken in
by priesthood's waxing rich and fat upon your fear of sin.
Though you may knock at heaven's door, they will not let you in.
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.
God save ye weary citizens, for this will make ye sick.
That Christ was just another Jew they nailed upon a stick.
He couldn't save himself, you know religion is a trick.
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.
Stray! Stray! Stray!
Stray! Stray! Stray!
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Come with the ho-ho-ho's fat boy, we've had enough to share with you.
We want minimum wage, we want postage, we want pensions.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ah, you really suck!
Yeah!
Ugh!
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Back to work.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Hey, who cares?
Yes, all right.
You can't stop the rush.
Hey, who cares?
Hey, who cares?
Yes, all right.
You can't stop the rush.
I am Santa Claus.
Flying through the snow, can you hear him ho, ho, ho?
He's so full of cheer, only has to work one day a year.
Children in their beds, visions of sugar plums fill their heads.
So many kids out there, Santa must be a billionaire.
Red suit, boots are black.
Big set of toys hanging off his back.
How much does he weigh?
How do the reindeer pull his sleigh?
Nobody sees him as he travels the world.
Leaving his presents for the good boys.
Hey, who cares?

Hey, who cares?
Give a hear of the boy's
You can't stop the rush.
Get lost, I can't see what you feel,
I got a growing kiss on my hand.
Get lost, I can't feel who I am.

Leave him a little kiss on my hand.
Get lost, I got a growing kiss on my hand.

You'll be back to your house first next year
I am Santa Claus
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

I knew in a moment
It must be Saint Nick

Oh, hold it, hold it, hold it!
Wait a second!
Perhaps we should talk about what exactly are the
differences and similarities
Yes, let's do a comparison
between Xmas
and Xmas

Day. I think that's very important
for us to understand the differences
After all, they are fairly similar
For one thing
they both involve male
authority figures that are loosely based
on the real ones that existed
before, well
before Christmas was invented, basically
Xmas has
Santa Claus, based on
Saint Nicholas
Xday has Bob
Well, actually, they have a Bob-load
of Bobs, all based
on the original J.R. Bob Dobbs
the salesman of Slack
the channel for
Neegi's pre-scriptures
to come to Earth
you get the idea
Xmas comes but once a year
Xday
The world ends tomorrow
and you may die
Xmas
preceded by three to four months
of irritating high-pressure advertising
rather like being hit
with a fire hose full of crap
Xday
well, this is just one part
of our year-round irritating
low-pressure
sort of Chinese water torture style
advertising
Xmas
Santa awards all the good little boys
and girls
Xday
Bob rewards all those who send in their
$30
Xmas
It's a Z-grade soulless, overproduced, commercialized
parody of a religious festival
Xday
is a Z-grade Edward-produced low-budget parody of a religion
period
Xmas
coincides with the winter solstice
or summer if you're here in the Antipodes
Xday
coincides with the anniversary of the United States founding
Xmas
Santa punishes all the bad boys and girls by putting coal in their stockings
or if you're a certain North European
slavery in Spain
Xmas
is a Z-grade
Xmas
Santa wonders if you've been bad or good
Xday
Bob doesn't care unless you've been real innovative about it
and Bob wants to buy the copyright software so he can market it
Xmas


North Pole Workshop
Xday
Dobbs Town, Malaysia
Xmas
A miniature sleigh with a tiny reindeer
Xday
The much larger X's space fleet
Xmas
Mrs. Claus
Xday
Connie
Xmas
Leaves you in the same horrible world as you are now





Just with new stuff
Xday
Planet X
Xmas
Santa is the closest thing to God walking the Earth
I believe Lonesome Cowboy Dave actually mentioned that
Xday
Well as the song goes
He ain't no man
He ain't no God
Xmas
And finally with Xmas
You grow out of belief in Santa
Xday
As JRB knew it was early in his life, he grew out of belief in Santa
Bob Dobbs said himself,
Believe me out of it.
Well, that didn't take so long, did it?
There's probably more comparisons and so forth that I could have done.
But what the hell?
I basically covered everything right there and then.
I think it's about time to combat all this
focusing on the conspiracy-styled,
pink, over-advertised, over-hyped and over-bearing
religious festival that is currently barreling down on me
with the appearance of a three-ton concrete enema bag.
Oh, that's enough of that.
My backup band for this evening is
Trash, playing White Christmas off their 1992 album Kimikaze.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, you have all worked very hard.
And among the lucky, you are the chosen ones.
You have been sprinkled with lucky stardust.
Yes, you have.
For today, you have been chosen to reside in the court of the Great One.
Gentlemen, I give you
the boy
who has been chosen to be the king of the world.

You actually saw a woman's breasts!
Scott, you made your choice.
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.
And to your eternal soul,
you have found that only could you afford
to give to God that which was his.
But you could not afford to do otherwise.
The Senate's...
still stands.
The promise is no man.
Into outer darkness,
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir!
I don't want to go to hell, sir!
Sir, no!
Thank God I don't want to go to hell!
No!
No!

No!


No!









No!


















Noon!
No!
No!


We only've one right before us,
tonight is Mission ahead.
Never shift!
Get rid of that我觉得
of this loosen grip of valleys!
abytes change too fast.
We downtrodden that's when cleaned out
is an absolute virtue.
The point is that we...

It's an unfathomable project for which we need...
aüm!
aüm...
so Mark lined up and put it on a pole 15 feet in the air.
Miss Fang didn't much care for that either,
but was relieved that she didn't have to see Bob home with a huge festering bee heart
every time she went in the backyard.
Yes, you can keep bees in the family if you'll just think of others a little more often.
Otherwise, you're just two yards of beef.
But let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang
with another reading from the sacred pre-scriptures of the Church of the Subgenius.
And yea, he climbeth down chimneys and delivereth us the gifts of the flesh and of slack.
He commandeth horned demons with cloven hoofs to take to the air and pull him in his chariot in glory.
For he knoweth when thou hast been sleeping, and he knoweth when thou art awake.
He judgeth if thou art damned or worthy, so heedeth this for thine own sake.
For his eyes are everywhere, like unto Big Brother.
He puffeth on his pipe and laugheth at our follies like a bowl full of Vaseline.
But yea, in his mercy he giveth us days off, and he bringeth us goods yet billows.
But yea, in his mercy he giveth us days off, and he bringeth us goods yet billows.
So imagine, friends, somewhere in the snowy north,
the Santa Bob trudges mindlessly on,
driven by strange forces to complete his nameless errands.
And he may show up at your house.
If you've been a good subgenius,
let there be slack.
See the video at subgenius.com
What the hell was all that?
Okay, I better get some credits going then, because we've had about seven items in that last chunk.
What were we listening to?
Well, we started off that particular chunk of show with
Purpose Cecilia and Trickster Shaman.
Track eight of The Hairs and Bob's Ears.
An album that is available, I think.
And recently, as mp3s on oldbinaries.slack.
Singing Tidings of Trembling and Fear.
Trembling and Fear.
Oh, Tidings of Trembling and Fear.
And speaking of Trembling and Fear,
no doubt the elves in that Elf Slave Revolt thing,
posted by New Monet however many moons ago,
were feeling Trembling and Fear.
And they said Tidings.
But they didn't have Tidings, they had blimmin'
Machine Gunnings of Trembling and Fear.
And thereafter, if there was any Trembling to be done,
it was probably Trembling of the Earth at the Footsteps of the Iron Santa,
as sung by the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet.
It is in this mp3 here.
Very strange piece of track.
It makes me think of that terrible Hulk Hogan vehicle.
Vehicle.
I believe it could be called Santa with muscles.
Frankly, the only muscles I want to think about Terry Hogan eating would be
the ones you get in a little punnett at the supermarket.
Thereafter, me!
Yes, me!
Me!
Over trash's white Christmas off their Kemikaze album of 1992.
Going on and on and on.
Ad Nauseam.
Ad Nauseating.
Ad Pontificating.
About the differences and similarities of Xmas and X-Day.
Although I think you know where my sediments lie.
Thereafter, we had a piece out of the B-movie American Astronaut,
which was produced and released recently.
It's on the internet somewhere.
You can Google it, I suppose.
Introducing, in what I thought was a pretty clever segue,
The Judgment Frosty.
I have no idea who produced that.
There's no information in the MP3.
It's just The Judgment Frosty.
But whoever it is, and hears it, will know who it is.
And other people who know who it is, will know who it is.
And no doubt, once they find out that I've released this, will let me know who it is.
And then I can tell other people who it is.
Or they can tell other people who it is.
Or the person in beta can tell everybody else who they are.
And that does not include Help Hope Huey at B.
Beat Factory, that's beat-factory.net, if I remember correctly,
who explained to us the story of The Yard of Beef.
Truly, one of those presents you should only get your enemy for Christmas.
And then finally, the Reverend Ivan Stang explaining in a minute of slack about the Santa Bob.
Well, I've just got one question before I launch into the next item.
It's a repetition of a question that, um, was couched by Professor Chaz Smith of Einstein's Secret Lecture ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB, I think.
Was there ever a Christmas before malls?
That was satisfying, wasn't it?
I was so glad when that pleasure saucer landed, but the pilot was drunk or something.
And I made out pretty good balancing on one knee and all.
But it was kind of awkward to hump while I had to play the cut off my foot with a pleasure saucer blues.
But it was real nice of Bob to grow me a new foot.
But it's a dinosaur thing and has claws.
So now I can't wear a shoe on that foot and people sure stare a lot.
And I tend to walk in circles like this.
Kadunk, kadunk, kadunk.
Crazy damn old Bob. I sure love him, but, well, he's nuts.
It was the night before Christmas and all through the house.
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the tree.
Merry fucking Christmas.
Merry fucking Christmas.
Merry fucking Christmas.
Merry fucking Christmas.
SHOW YOU!
