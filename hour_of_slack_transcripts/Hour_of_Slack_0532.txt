Your nightmares come alive.
Now prepare yourselves for a terrifying hour that won't be easy for you to forget.
You will now hear all of the positive messages contained in the subliminal portion of this tape.
These messages have been carefully designed to help you achieve the success you desire and deserve.
I use rest stops regularly.
You choose to be in control of your life.
You choose to be happy.
You choose to be happy.
You are a happy person.
You are a winner.
I got a 3220 built on a graveyard frame.
Shoots tombstone bullets, balls and chains.
Said I'm tough as cowhide, swift as lead.
I was born in the jungle where they never go to bed.
Wild throw a brick through midnight and break broad daylight.
Cause my eyes is made of bulletproof glass.
I like being in control of my life.
I know I can be who I want to be.
Have a nice trip.
You are such a damn fool.
You lost your grip.
What the hell?
What the hell?


What the hell did it take to get you to awaken?
No matter what you say.
A equals, A equals, A equals, A equals, A.
These messages will now become subliminal.
But your subconscious mind will be hearing and accepting all of the positive messages.
Listen to the tapes as often as you can.
The more you listen, the sooner success will come.
Sad, sad.
Cool.
Cool.
Sad, sad.
That's enough.
Cut off the telecommand.
Are you crazy.
Cut off the telecommand, I say.
You must maneuver freely.
That would be an act of insubordination.
And if they say anything against God or Elvis Presley, they get thrown out on the rest again.
He said, you're insane.
He said, you need to be put away.
He said, you're a sick woman.
And I said, if this is sick, I never want to get better.
I want to stay in critical condition for the rest of my life.
And he filed for divorce on extra.

At last, everything is done for you.
Oh, yes, we're back, friends.
But Jesus was about to leave.
Lord, I understand some of your followers back in Cleveland where you came from,
the Bethlehem of the Rust Belt,
were concerned about your safety since you joined this new cult.
They're worried about me.
They want to know why I left everything, left them and left Cleveland.
Left a $40,000 a year job.
Yeah, they want to make sure that I'm not brainwashed or under any kind of mind control.
Well, tell them.
I'm not under any kind of mind control.
Or everything I'm doing is under my own free will.
That's the voice.
That's enough, Jesus.
Is that good, Reverend Stang?
Yeah, that's fine.
That was the voice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Can I come back to work now?
Yeah, you may go to the library and check on our corporate standing.
Thank you, Reverend Stang.
Thank you, Reverend Stang.
Speaking of Jesus, friends.
Hey, Jesus, when are you going to do something about the Southern Baptists?
What's that?
When are you going to do something?
Take that cookie out of your mouth.
What are you going to do about the Southern Baptists, man?
What are you going to do?
Well, lookie here.
Here.
Southern Baptists vowed Disney boycott.
And this is from a conspiracy newspaper.
I wonder what the real story is.
15 million members, Southern Baptists.
You probably didn't have to deal with Southern Baptists that much up in Cleveland.
I believe that they're the biggest Protestant group in the country.
Yeah, we didn't have to.
They're certainly the run things around here.
They declared Wednesday that they're going to boycott Walt Disney Company
if it continues to give, quote,
the appearance that the promotion of Hollywood

homosexuality is more important than its historic commitment to traditional family values.
Walt Disney understands money and money only, said Reverend Wiley Drake.
Blah, blah, blah.
What's wrong with understanding money and money only?
It's, you know.
Well, Disney Circle of Ten.
Yeah, that's true.
You've got to worry about that.
It's probably some inside thing that we don't know or understand what's going on.
Well, certainly there.
But they claim to be unhappy because Disney allows gays and lesbians
to attend theme days at Disney World in Florida and gives insurance benefits.
They actually hire gays and lesbians at Disney World.
Can you imagine that?
That's a good thing.
It's a good thing.
They probably don't even ask if they're queer.
I mean, what is this world coming to?
Anyway, Disney's not clean enough for the Southern Baptists.
Not only that, but the Jews are not clean enough.
It says here,
those pesky Jews, you know.
It says,
And they decided they're going to target the Jews.
It seems like that's been done before.
And various rabbis are a little bit upset.
But, you know, what they're basically saying is that Christians serve you, Lord,
and Jews only serve...
They don't mean to, but they're serving Satan.
Well, they don't serve Satan, but they don't serve me.
See, that was a big mistake.
You know, I came down for them, and they shunned me.
That's a problem.
You know, what happened to love each other and love thy neighbor?
That's why I'm here.
That didn't work.
I thought you gave up on that.
I gave up on that a long time ago.
It didn't work the first time.
Look what they did to me the first time around.
Yep.
They held me to a few sticks.
This time, friends, the Lord is...
Well, the Son of God.
The Son of God is rebelling against Daddy, and he's going to leave...
X day will come before he's 33, this incarnation.
So he's splitting, man.
That's the plan.
He's splitting with us.
I'm out of here.
Here's some other things about your chosen folks here.
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan launched a nationwide voter registration drive...
And inspired...
Let's see.
He suggested that President Clinton's visit to the burned-out black churches...
And he was politically inspired.
Why did it take him so long to speak out about the bombing of houses of God, Mr. Farrakhan told followers.
If those were synagogues, how long would it have taken?
See, you know...
It's a mess, isn't it?
But I like that guy, Farrakhan.
Oh, you do?
Oh, yeah. I like him.
Well, he does ride in flying saucers and stuff.
He understands numbers, too.
He's a classic B5 crackpot.
Right up there, probably, with Hitler and Francis E. Dex.
Absolutely.
And the legal documents...
He knows more than he lets on.
Well, that's what we're all afraid of.
But, you know, at the same time, as the Southern Baptist Convention is doing all this great work to stomp out Jews and Walt Disney and other desperately dangerous enemies of the state...
Here in Dallas, Texas, former televangelist Robert Tilton is losing his life and soul to his...
His desires for alcohol and money, his estranged second wife said Wednesday.
Bob Tilton, the greatest, greatest prosperity minister of them all at Word of Faith Church here in Dallas...
And he's famous among subgeniuses.
Subgeniuses love Tilton.
He's like the second Bob.
But also like the second Bob.
He's only as...
He's not nearly as lucky as the real Bob.
And apparently, his second wife says that...
He beats her and drinks constantly.
And he's lost.
He's just plain lost.
He says she's lying.
She's trying this thing in the media and so forth.
And, of course, his lawyer, Tilton's lawyer says,
She got a lot of pictures showing black and blue marks, cuts and bruises.
No.
This is all a bunch of hooey.
And she knows that.
The real Bob, says his wife, was caring, loving, giving.
At least I thought so.
The Bob I see now, and that other people see, is a perpetual liar.
So, uh...
You did a lot of work there.
Huh?
You did a lot of work there, finding out about my people.
That was all in one newspaper.
That was in...
All of that stuff was in one newspaper.
That's amazing.
You know, our fellow extremists are just, uh...
I just don't know...
Well, one of the reasons I came back was to...
Now these people know they're laid off.
They're done.
They've been...
They've been for years saying, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm here.
Their job is over.
They can cool it.
They don't need to work anymore.
They can relax.
You heard us Christians.
You heard it from Jesus.
Of course, you guys would lynch this Jesus if you got your hands on him.
I know it.
He looks like a bedraggled hippie.
Looks just like the pictures you've been worshiping all those years.
Although, I think he colors his hair.
I don't know what this world's like.
It's incredible to come to friends.
Tim Leary's dead, Frank Zappa's dead,
Bill Hicks is dead,
Lenny is dead,
Pee-Wee got busted,
John Carradine is dead.
We can't even make a subgenius movie now.
John Carradine dead.
Rick Griffin...
My dogs are dead.
Rick... Rick... Rick Griffin's dead.
Tim McGinnis is dead.
Drelloid Mutant is dead.
Dr. Legume is dead.
We wish.
well okay well enough let's let's go friends here let's make this a properly religious type
of show here we'll just run some background music oh yes because friends we're here to
you me and jesus we're all here together to worship
and i have this lovely little new hymn that was recorded at a church service just
yesterday friends i think you're gonna love you just keep your tape decks running because
we're gonna quit our yabbering and now you'll hear the lovely lilting songs of
civet stang and her broken voice box oh yes
you
okay i was just kidding i just said that to get rid of jesus i didn't want and he's gone now
and uh since he's gone we can play this this tape this is the very tail end of the uh the show i did
with lonesome cowboy dave a couple of weeks ago and we're we were talking about jesus behind his
back i didn't want him in here when i was playing this tape friends jesus was a capricorn
and is just all right with me
but
uh
, except that uh i've noticed that he sheds jesus does now that he lives in my actually
in the subgenius offices he's he worked so hard and he's a really male such a martyr he sleeps on
the couch but he sheds now that it's summertime in texas jesus is shedding all over the church
i can't believe jesus depilated all over the church of the subgenius you mean all of his
bodily hairs is laying around your area there yeah i think yes and there he's a big mangy what a tough day's for you



What do they make? Holy, holy.
It smells sort of doggy.
And I've noticed when we wash Jesus, he has the smell of a wet dog.
I'm the one who has the smell of a wet donkey.
He's a faithful Messiah. He's a faithful and noble Savior.
You can take him out in the backyard and let him do his business.
He's good about not doing it too close to the house.
And you can throw frisbees and he'll run and catch them.
And you can send him out to sell subgenius tablets door to door or company to company.
Actually, I'm not giving Jesus enough credit.
He did oversee the merger, recent merger of the Church of the Subgenius with America Online and Simon & Schuster.
We now, we don't exactly own those entities, corporate entities now.
And friends, that Yeti woman is waiting for you.
Sitting on the steps of the church.
So why don't you, don't you want to be able to walk up those steps into her great big long strong hairy sweaty arms.
And feel that hot Yeti breath steaming and puffing against your face.
And feel that great big long she Yeti tongue lick you right up from your chin to your forehead.
And that big old sloppy wet Yeti kiss.
On your way to, into church, friend.
I was languishing in pain in hell until I met the tick one smell of that Yeti Yeti woman.
That's just on the front steps.
Wait until you get in and see what the service is like.
Ha ha ha.
Yeah, you can be serviced with a subgenius service, if you know what I mean.
We can't say too much more about that on the radio.
I'm sure you can imagine.
But, Connie's Massage Parlor is open.
The Cleveland Natural History Museum is open.
You know what I'm saying.
You can get you some Yeti jawbone there, man.
Oh my God.
They've got, you know that statue of Lucy, the ancient Australian.
They have astrophysicists.
Yeah.
They've got a new statue.
They've got a mate for her now.
Lucy Leakey.
The skeleton of a gray that was excavated in Arkansas.
And it's not very old, maybe 10,000 years.
It's about a 10,000 year old gray.
It's just a little bit of a example for a gray, ain't it?
And they've got him mounted next to Lucy.
Now, they're about the same size.
Ironically, he mounted Lucy and that's why.
That's why.
And that's what you can see by the physical resemblance.
If you think about it, the skeleton of a gray and the skeleton of a little four foot high Australopithecus babe.
With those great big sad lovely eyes.
And that little weak chin and those, that gimpy little spindly body.
Such a romantic description.
You can see who Adam and Eve really were.
Of course you can see who Adam and Eve were.
Never mind.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
John Lennon knew Lucy in the sky with diamonds was just another way of saying Lucy was taken in by the aliens and abducted and used and fertilized and put back on earth.
And now today we see the progeny, Dave, lonesome cowboy Dave and Chaz here in this room.
Proof.
That aliens mated with yetis.
Millions of years ago.
It is true.
In fact, it is true.
I get letters from many, many yeti ancestors written to me in the form of DNA spiral which speaks to me in my dreams and my brain.
And I even know like what certain of my yeti forefathers actually looked like, what they liked to cook.
And when they liked them, what they liked to do.
And that's all the time we got, boys and girls.
We gotta get out of here.
But we learned it all from their droppings.
How can we, how can we drop out now?
My guests have been Reverend Ivan Stang, Lisa Lisa, lonesome cowboy Dave, Michelle, Einstein Secret Orchestra, the whole group.
We'll be back next week, Thursday nights, 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock in the morning.
We'll see you all then.
I gotta get the heck out of here.
There's folks here who do some kind of show.
So I'm outta here.
My name is Chaz.
ESO Radio.
Thursday nights.
Till next week.
Keep your hat on tight.
Your back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.
And I'm hurry.
��로
As he lost his mind
As he lost his mind
Oh, man.
Boy, this must be a real night for Black Sabbath, I suppose.
But, friends, I did indeed still want to play you.
I wasn't kidding about this.
We do have a new Subgenius Church hymn, a lovely tune here,
which I think some of you may...
We did borrow the music a little bit, but this was recorded just yesterday.
Friends, I hope it brings tears to your eyes
and teaches you the lesson which you must learn.
Save it as staying.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
is bothering me forever and forever.
But until I spend my thirty bucks,
I'm just running to myself and not to love.
And although I know that I am screwed,
still I say there's a day I'll pay.
I love Bob, but when the rupture's over,
he'll be gone, the earth will be in ruins.
Without him, the world around me changes.
The conspiracy is everywhere, the malls are full of pink boys.
I love Bob, but every day I don't spend the thirty bucks.
I'm only just pretending.
Without me, Bob's world will go on burning.
Our next day Bob will have his life.
It's a lie.
I'll never know.
I love Bob.
I love Bob.
I love Bob.
But only on my own.
Oh man, that sounded good.
My piano playing could have been better.
My piano playing could have been better.
It could have been a little better.
It could have been a little better.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, there is, there are many corroborated accounts of this person that looks like a normal human being,
except their face is too long.
And the more you look at them, the less human they look.
Since it's thoughtGeorgi's face is just aslace.
And how you ride less
to how you feel or is.
It's not a young person either.

So my guess is, I do not live, although I may have the able frick tone Hunger Feet.
In between, space between
There's something that you've never seen
I'm not awake and I'm not asleep
It's in between, space between
Never really quite the same
Sometimes I think they're all the same
Angels, demons, who's to say
Can't scare me with their silly games
In between, space between
The special ones who wait for me
I'm not awake and I'm not asleep
It's space between, in between
Now I know your skin is green
Fly me away on a shiny wing
Show me things I've never seen
Show me what you've tried for me
So I'll dance
Those space things
Laugh at counting sheep
I just want sweet dreams
Let me go to sleep

of money. Don't let me measure my life in terms of money. Oh, don't. No, please. Don't let me
measure my life in terms of money. Friends, that's Copernicus from New York. He actually
performed at our New York revival. I believe he may be the corniest man alive. However,
he did, when he does that routine about don't let me measure my life in terms of money,
he throws 50 bucks worth of dollar bills out into the audience, which may explain his popularity
among the bar crowd there in New York City, where we also heard Pope David N. Meyer, that
lovely rant. Now, where are we? What do we do? Whenever you're in doubt, friends, on
the Subgenius Hour Slack show, you run the Joe tape. Let us see what are the
wise man of Cleveland has to say to us today from his great tape, soon to be on sale from
the Subgenius Foundation for credit cards, Mockery and Perversion. Joe?
I don't want a looker, a doggy stalker. This one guy I knew, he asked me to sing the
kindergarten orgasm dance song for him when we were talking on the phone, and I went,
I had orgasms back in the kinder, I had orgasms. Kinder-y in the kinder-y, back in the kinder,
I had orgasms. He said, well, I gotta go now, Joe. I'll see you later, kinder. No, he didn't
say Joe, he said, I gotta go now, see you later, kinder. Horny up the gander, I had
orgasms, So I'ma show chain big chunk when we come back and percept, and I won't hurt
you, Joe! Hold on, Bill, hold on. The gypsy tried the ho beautiful, American
còny close up against a giant g sparker's mom. And with nothing in it, I put it out
for

Okay, c'mon, favorable, perfectly befitting. Orion in the snow! Hang on,all of you c'mon,
Now, what does the Joe Offrecht tape have to do with the Church of the Subgenius?
All I can say, friends, is that it's somehow liberating.
Perhaps Joe is perhaps the one free man out there.
And have we got to...
I haven't gotten to it yet.
We haven't even made it to side two of the Joe tape,
but I've got a special punchline for all of that.
So you'll have to just stay tuned to this show for weeks, years to come.
In the meantime, let's see what other great Cleveland crackpots have to say.
Yeah, I'm the guy with my legal notice in the newspaper in advance.
And I have another story.
I've got a problem with a guy named Flacos with a state hasp.
I've got my center missing.
I'm supposed to be sugar safe.
And I've got a story, a couple stories,
and, hey, the guy's supposed to this and that and this and that needle
and hook me on another needle full with my metabolism.
Now, I don't have my center.
I need to talk to someone serious.
And, of course, declare a center and a plate and schedule recovery
and preservation of moments of and to make sure for sugar safe.
And then I'm entitled to hair.
Of course, I'm aware of the suddenness of difference in people.
And I registered these hen chickens, registered to see the Euclid police in the 60s.
I'm entitled to hair.
I said hair makes them strange or already strange enough.
Eternally jealous police.
So I have my story.
I've got a center missing to make sure because metabolism changes.
And I have a nurse in the newspaper in advance.
And you're allowed to serve me.
I have a group of legal notices.
I have a nurse in the newspaper, an abracadabra,
and a girl named Maria on a second registry number.
And then she's shifting abracadabra over to another girl.
And a girlfriend named Therapy.
That works out.
And a restaurant.
They said, oh, is this obvious?
You people are filthy.
To write down to the sport enthusiast to who's declaring preservation of moments on my property
underneath my time of day.
And they don't want any of that around my property and a problem on my property.
In the meantime, I registered sugar safe.
And a cop that says, hey, this guy is a man.
And this man, the needle, ride the needle,
trying to destroy my sugar balance.
And my center's missing to see if I'm sugar safe because metabolism changes.
And, well, you never know.
You could be sugar safe at one time and not need to schedule to recover the sugar.
And you may, there are changes.
And I'm supposed to talk to somebody that knows.
Well, dear friends, that is, once again, the legal documents guy, as we call him,
from somewhere out there.
That was a series of, there's hundreds of them, I guess,
or at least a hundred of them, messages that were left on an answer machine at the,
I hate even to call it a machine, but I guess it was a machine.











I don't even, I don't even say where.
But this guy had to wait through up like a five-minute outgoing message every time
before he could leave one of those.
And, friends, if you can help clue us in as to how we, too,
can get rights to permission for the hair and our X-Day.
I've got a legal document in the paper for X-Day and July 5th.
And my sugar level.
Hello, friends.
Friends and welcome.
Tonight I'm here to talk to you about a very serious public problem.
I call it a fascination with the familiar.
Now, what exactly do I mean by a fascination with the familiar?
I'm referring to a tendency of the people to fear any change whatsoever.
Rather.
Rather than experience something new or different,
they would rather relive the past over and over again.
You heard there was a recycling craze going on out there.
Well, friends, I'm here to tell you it's a happening.
You can see this habit manifested in everyday behavior.
Take, for instance, the radio.
Almost all adults listen to the same type of music.
I don't mean rock and roll or country music or any particular genre.
I mean the same type of music.
Old music.
Whatever they heard growing up is what they like to hear all their lives.
The cold and oldie business keeps making gold by recycling hits from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and
now even the 80s.
Wake up!
It's the 90s!
The 60s are dead!
Yet when the Beatles release an anthology of greatest hits, the public goes crazy and
buys it in record numbers.
Now, me, I've got a problem with that.
There is only one new song on either of these tracks.








And yet they both break new sales records.
Just how stupid can stupid be?
Well, let's turn on the TV and find out.
Why, surprise, surprise!
It's the same old, same old.
Zinefeld, Roseanne, Home Improvement.
How many years will this same stuff be recycled?
Answer, forever and ever.
Because when it's all over, it's still not over.
It goes on and on and on.
Like Lucy.
Bewitched.
Griffith.
Gilligan's Island.
You want hell?
You ain't gonna die, my friends.
It's right here on Earth in front of that tube.
And don't even get me started on elections.
They say the public wants new blood.
A new change.
But just look at them.
Who do they nominate?
A president who's never had a job outside of government or a senator who's been a senator
longer than most of our grandfathers have been grandfathers.
Oh, that sounds like New Br-
Blood to me.
But enough of the big picture.
Let's look at the little picture.
How this vicious cycle affects us in our daily little lives.
I know a man who's married to a wicked witch.
And they just so happen to live in the West.
It's true.
He can't stand her.
And yet, he stays married to her.
You probably know someone just like him.
Only he's a she or she's a he.
Or whatever.
Whatever the combination.
The point is, they should get divorced.
But they never do.
There's no reason to stop either of them from starting over again with someone else.
That's why they invented divorce.
There's no family to break up.
There's no estate to divide.
There's no justification for any sane person to endure that kind of psychological torture.
Yet people do it.
Routinely.
Rather than explore new options.
They probably think a bad relationship is better than no relationship at all.
Yet there's two billion members of the opposite sex running around out there you would think
someone better could come along.
Of course, the worst relationship to stay involved in isn't with another person that
you don't like, my friends.
It's a bad relationship with God.
It's a bad relationship with God.

This planet has hundreds of different religions.
And yet, most people stick with the same religions of their ancestors.
The same one that their parents had, regardless of whether or not they even like it.
And how did their parents select this religion?
Why it was the religion of their parents too.
It goes on and on and on all the way back to the centuries.
They only learned about one religion and never dared to learn about another.
And yet, they're still the same.



They're not satisfied where they are.
But it never occurs to them to go somewhere else.
Perhaps they feel it's better to stick with the devil they know rather than the one they
don't.
If I told you, hey, you can't choose who you're going to marry, you should let your parents
decide that, you'd get all self-righteous and tell me where to shove it.
And yet, most people let their parents choose their religion without any resistance at all.
I say a religion is like your nose.
No.
It's okay to pick your own, but don't go picking someone else's.
No one should pick your religion except you.
Not your parents, not your church, and not your government.
Only you.
If you're old enough to pick your lifelong companion, then you're old enough to pick
your afterlife companion too.
Yes, it means you'll have to strike out on your own and do a little exploring.
You might even sample a few different ones before you find the right one.
You'll meet new people, you'll see new sights, and what's so bad about that?
It's a big world out there, my friends.
A whole lot of experiences to experience and not a whole lot of time to do it.
Why waste your life doing the same thing over and over again if you're not happy doing it
the first time?
Now I'm not going to stand here and try to push you into the subgenius religion by saying
things like, we're the fastest people in the world.
We're the fastest growing industrial church in the last hundred years.
Or claim that more people choose Bob than any other short, durational, personal savior.
That kind of hype would just be an unfair advertisement, especially coming from me.
But I will state Bob's address.
Because everyone should know their options before making that kind of decision.
Find out your options by writing Bob for information at P.O.
Box 14-0-1.

0306 Dallas, Texas.
Tell him Papa Joe sent you and you'll get an extra 10% off your already low membership
fee.
And if you think that's a good deal, you should ask him about eternal salvation or triple
your money back.
Because the solution to your problem is simple, my friends.
If you're satisfied with your religion, fine.
But if you're unsatisfied with your religion, if you hear a voice in the back of your mind,

saying, this God isn't right for me, then a better one is just one postage stamp away.
Write that letter, get your slack, and praise Bob.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen, dear friends.
That's Father Joe Mama, needless to say.
Well, I probably do need to say it.
Every now and then somebody new might be listening to this show.
A fascination with the Father Joe Mama.





A future, a lovely new sermon by Father Joe Mama.
And what should we do now?
You know, we could go peek into the other...
What?
Yeah, we could peek into the other Bob shows, the other subgenius radio shows around the
country.
We've got Sister Susie the Fallousia show here.
We've got some KPFA.
Well, let's just flip.
But, but, before I do that, friends, I've come to think of it.
There's a, I've got this rather disturbing little bit of news.
This is, this was sent to us from a local newspaper by Reverend Joffrey in Pomona, I
believe.
Now, get this.
The headline says, Conspiracy Steps Up Attack on J.R. Bob Dobbs.
From Texas Information Network, London, April 7, 1995.
The conspiracy authorities in Texas have launched a major...
I'm sorry.









A major campaign attacking J.R. Bob Dobbs in person and accusing him of blasphemy, forgery,
and distorting the Church of the Subgenius.
The campaign, last tried on this scale 20 years ago, has already sparked off a number
of rural protests, including four by subgenii from a major subgenius sect which had previously
avoided political confrontation.
Under, using virtually unprecedented language, official government documents are describing
the exiled subgenius leader and his officials as the, quote, head of a serpent which must
be chopped off.
The new campaign seeks to discredit Bob as a religious figure, unlike previous attacks
which only criticized his political activities.
Quote, how much trace of a spiritual religious leader is still left in him?
Texas TV viewers were asked by a TV news reader earlier this week.
The TV attack on Bob was broadcast on the main evening news.
On 30th of March, in an item described as a TV forum, entitled, Is Bob Still the Spiritual
Leader of a Religion?
The broadcast, an unattributed speech implicitly issued by the authorities, indicated that
the anti-Bob campaign is now to be aimed at ordinary people and that the campaign will
be carried out throughout the Texas autonomous region.
Until now, the campaign has been targeted at officials and conspiracy members who were
asked to speak out against the campaign.
The same question was asked in a lengthy article published in the TV broadcast this week, which
gave official conspiracy endorsement to the newspaper article, which had been signed by
an unknown conspirator named Ryan Joseph Ryan, in order to suggest that it did not at that
time represent official policy.
Both the TV statement and the newspaper article say that, quote, Bob has forged subgenius
texts, altered the teachings, and violated the principles of the Church of the Subgenius.
The Church, the articles insist, advocates detachment from worldly affairs, whereas Bob
has allegedly told his followers to support Texas independence as part of their religious
practice.
The Oil Daily describes this as, quote, wildly attempting to use godly strength to poison
and bewitch the masses.
It accused the so-called spiritual leader and separatist chieftain of incorporating
Texas independence into his sermons.
Such flagrant deception.
Such deceptiveness and demagoguery constitute a blasphemy to the Church of the Subgenius,
says the paper.
The subgenius clench pontiffs are accused of demanding that Texans hang Bob's portraits
in clenches.
Foreign tourists who have visited Texas say they are constantly asked by Texans for J.R.
Bob Dobbs photographs.
Individual attacks by the conspiracy on the leader of the subgenii have been extremely
rare, especially since September 1987.
The subgenius has been a hot topic for the media since the early 1980s.
When the conspiracy last criticised him personally after he addressed a group of congressmen
in the United States.
The brief propaganda drive sparked off a series of street demonstrations in Dallas which are
still continuing.
And I can tell you that's true.
Since then, conspiracy propagandists have been careful to criticise the quote Bob clique
rather than J.R.
Bob Dobbs himself.
A TV broadcast on 11th of February referred to the splittest elements headed by Bob, a
derogatory term for the subgenius.
A
Whoo!
More songs.
Above Board?
Now go out and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have.
Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
Ah, yes, friends, and this divine pronouncement is much beloved amongst us pro-life subgenius believers.
For the Amalekites were the criminal race of aboblical times.
The abortionists, loathsome in the sight of Bob, and slow, violent death is too good, too good, my friends, for their ilk.
But what about the children? What about the children, bleats the bleeding-heart liberal?
Well, what about them? Idiotic questions are to be expected from liberal elite sodomites that spit in the eye of Bob.
They just don't.
Get it.
Let's just run through the reasoning.
Did Bob say shower welfare handouts upon these criminal children?
Give them government, free government cheese so they might grow strong in their abominable criminality?
These apprentice abortionists, nurtured in the ways of Satan, did they say that?
He did not. And no, he was not speaking it metaphorically, as the modernist perverters of truth would have it.
Kill them! The Lord has no mercy upon the children of abortionists. Kill them!
The Lord has no mercy upon the animals of abortionists. Kill them, too!
All true Americans know that animals take on the attributes of their masters, and so the livestock of criminals are not to mingle with Bob's people.
They cannot be trusted. A sensible matter of national security, dear friends.
And so, and so we come to the truth, the final truth, the end of this great session, friends.
And if you want to know more about how to kill the abortionists, you can go to the website at www.thebob.com.
And, uh, then please write to the Subgenius Foundation. Papa Joe Mama gave that number just a little while earlier.
Go ahead, friends, write to Bob at, got that pencil ready?
PostOfficeBox140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.
I'm gonna give that number again!
That's Bob at PostOfficeBox140306.
In lovely Dallas.
Texas 75214.
It is peace and love.
And let us listen to the church of the new faith instead of anybody else.
Now, right now.
Because of the sins of evil, Jesus will destroy the world's spent evil days.
Buried.
There is a new sin called justice and a rule before a thousand years.
And many people are judged and executed.
God works in mysterious ways.
God has covered many years' days to kill the most wretched.
And he kills the homosexuals and drug users.
He has new diseases.
Who should I know of it?
These diseases will kill pot smokers.
Their lungs will turn inside out.
Like the paracrine experience.
These diseases will kill people who have sex.
And who drink and smoke.
Marks will appear on their skin.
And who die.
What about the murder?
The government will have most executions.
Like the chairs in any town.
People live to die.
And they're lined up to die.
Jail will be a one-way ticket for the non-violent crimes.
Yes, violence is the tool of government.
We'll be tolerated.
Government is not the tool of Satan.
Of God.
Of Satan.
Of God.
Of Satan.
Of God.
Of Satan.
Of God.
Of Satan.
Of God.
Bob.
Satan.
Bob.
Satan.
Yes, dear friends.
And let's go back to the peace of the church of the subgenius here with Susie.
Oh, speaking of agony.
What?
I got a letter from Mom yesterday.
Really?
How can you tell?
The usual ten-page letter.
Totally blank.
I'm glad to hear she's doing well.
Oh, speak for yourself.
You didn't have to endure the torments of a damn.
Being dragged around like toilet paper.
Stuck to that monster.
Oh, yeah.
Like I had it easy.
Oh, I'm sorry, folks.
I'm sorry.
Apparently, our other, our fellow subgenius ministers are having some sort of an altercation
over here on screen five.
Oh, my God.
Susie just grabbed Dr. Nolan Boyd's member and is yanking his members out of his clench.
And he's.
He's grabbed her bosom of love.
And he's yanking on it.
And they're yanking.
They're wanking.
Oh, what?
Oh, it's over.
I hope.
Oh, I ain't a man in these parts can take my atomic round.
I'm sucker punch.
You sure keep me on my toes.
Like you're ever in an upright position.
I told you, it's just a slack in me.
Oh.
Oh, brother Boyd.
I'm just so glad to have you back.
Oh, it was so hard being alone.
Growing up in one blighted mobile home park after another.
I always wondered about you.
Like where you were.
If things are better for you.
Like, you know, if they let you sleep and eat and stuff like that.
And I hated you for it.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.






Oh.

I hated your guts real bad too.
Even though I didn't know you existed until last year.
It was damn hard to track you down.
The adoption agency being in a Chevy El Camino and all.
But I'm so glad I did.
I like that cut of your gibberish.
Well, it's one hell of a mixed blessing.
I mean, it was tough enough to have been raised by loathsome predatory birds.
But then to find out that all the time,
I was really half of a set of twin inbreds.
Yes.

you did manage to find me a �unch lab,
bloodshot swine,



Well, I could probably get embo numer optic room


Yeah, because I got fucking mushrooms and twe fizer a school.
Knew you'd beIT
Can you at least teach me some manners afterwards?
Give them to me at 15 to get on my planet.
Sure.
You came at me at 16.
You wanna give me three months?
Take me six months and I'll application either.
Ah let me just hug you or you either.
