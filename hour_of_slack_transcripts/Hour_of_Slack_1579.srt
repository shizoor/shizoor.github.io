Some Hour On Slack

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,180
selective

11
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,260
Imagine there's no Starbucks.

13
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,760
I wonder what you'd do.

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,920
Can't get an ATM card.

15
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,340
And no computers too.

16
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,640
Imagine all sub-DNAs.

17
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
Living life in slack.

18
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,620
Imagine there's no modems.

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,960
And sitcoms on TV.

20
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,320
We'd hunker down in the middle of the night.

21
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,320


22
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,320


23
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,980
And take some LSP.

24
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,300
You.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,100
Hoo hoo hoo.

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,940
You may say I'm sub-genius.

27
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,800
But I'm not the only one.

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,600
Gotta wonder.

29
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:58,960
What's your name?

30
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:58,960


31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:58,960


32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:58,960


33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:58,960


34
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,400
If I'm really one.

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,880
What I'm losing out on?

36
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,180
Imagine no McDonalds.

37
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,100
And no Big Mac with cheese.

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,480
No email and no voicemail.

39
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,700
And no more songs like these.

40
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,300
Imagine the sub-genius.

41
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,760
Life without the con.

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,760
You.

43
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,620
Hoo hoo hoo.

44
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,960
Gotta wonder.

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,880
If I'm really one.

46
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,820
What I'm losing out on?

47
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,740
Imagine the sub-DNAs.

48
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:20,920
And no computers too.

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:20,960
Imagine there's no McDonalds.

50
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:23,860


51
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:23,860


52
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:23,860


53
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:23,860


54
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:23,860


55
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:23,860


56
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,860
And no McDonalds.

57
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,500
And no one to call.

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,840
Imagine that I'm not the only one.

59
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,420
Gotta wonder.

60
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,700
What's your name?

61
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,080
Imagine there's no McDonalds.

62
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,860
And no Big Mac with cheese.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,760
And no Big Mac with cheese.

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,020
And no McDonalds.

65
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,860
Imagine the sub-DNAs.

66
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,080
And no McDonalds.

67
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,240
Imagine the sub-DNAs.

68
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,860
And no McDonalds.

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,240
And no McDonalds.

70
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:12,600
And ketones.

71
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,680
And no mosquitoes.

72
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,040
And no toxic beforehand.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,960
And no

74
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,400
And no cancer.

75
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,100
He's God

76
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,380
God will never change

77
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,160
He's God

78
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,860
Always will be

79
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,500
God

80
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,800
He's God

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,260
He's the one with the devil

82
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,160
That brings on the most like fire

83
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,660
He's wicked

84
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,180
He's the one with the bottle

85
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,960
He's ready for the fight

86
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,640
God

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,300
He's God

88
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,620
God will never change

89
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,420
He's God

90
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,000
Always will be

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,540
God

92
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,980
He's God

93
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,280
He's the one that will bring the day to

94
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,360
Just the name of a shot

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,420
He's

96
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,620
He's

97
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,900
The one

98
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,040
The biggest

99
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,460
He's

100
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:20,620
He's

101
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:20,620


102
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Not

103
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
Love

104
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,380
He's

105
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:25,660
God

106
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,540
God

107
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
He's

108
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,480
God

109
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
God

110
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,760
God

111
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,540
God

112
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:36,860
God

113
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,080
God

114
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,280
God

115
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,840
God

116
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,140
God

117
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,240
God

118
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,360
God

119
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,800
God

120
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,200
Bye.

121
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,200
Yeah.

122
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,840
Yeah.

123
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,200
Yeah.

125
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,080
Yes, dear friends.

126
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,920
We are back from X day and Starwood.

127
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,440
And we've been hearing from the beginning of this show,

128
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,560
the title,

129
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,980
were by the El Queso all-stars.

130
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,180
That song,

131
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,000
imagine subgenius was by Reverend Phineas Narco.

132
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,900
He's Bob.

133
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,980
The remix of Dr.

134
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,640
Hal's song was remixed by Wilhelm Stahlhelm.

135
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,640
And that last instrumental sounding thing was a slack.

136
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,600
Dica by da Benci.

137
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,420
But for this show,

138
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,060
we go back to Thursday,

139
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,620
June 3rd,

140
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,960
the 30th and our first hour of slack on location at Wisteria campground for

141
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,500
19 X day with yours truly Reverend Ivan staying Dr.

142
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:28,880
Hal,

143
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,140
princess.

144
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,020
We and Reverend Susie,

145
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,460
the floozy praise Bob.

146
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,080
Let's see.

147
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,460
You should be hearing.

148
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,680
Yes.

149
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,520
The subgenius,

150
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,900
whatever it is,

151
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:49,640
right from subgenius headquarters at X day amid the surging heaving subgenius

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,560
crowd.

153
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,080
Masses crowding into our humble broadcast area.

154
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,120
They're eager faces turning the swaying mass of crowded in subs,

155
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,160
hoping against hope for something to relieve them of this burden.

156
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,360
The destruction of earth.

157
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,640
That sounds like fun.

158
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:18,700
Well,

159
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:18,920
yes,

160
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,420
that's our attitude.

161
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:19,920
People.

162
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,260
One might as well enjoy what is inevitable,

163
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,520
what will happen.

164
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,200
So why not be resolved to do it?

165
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,500
Disposed to it as yet another event in cosmic history.

166
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,160
Unfortunately,

167
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,160
we have some,

168
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:39,940
um,

169
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,320
plain,

170
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,880
ordinary,

171
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,180
immediate history that I'm hearing funny crackling noises.

172
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,820
Oh,

173
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:45,980
no,

174
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,020
maybe just that it's the crackling.

175
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,380
I sound okay.

176
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,140
It seems like you,

177
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,200
you seem kind of ending in snakey twine.

178
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,940
Okay.

179
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,180
Okay.

180
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,520
Okay.

181
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Yes.

182
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,460
The gods are fleeing before the oncoming catastrophe.

183
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,480
I don't like the way your voice.

184
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,480
Oh,

185
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,620
sorry to hear that.

186
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,280
Yes,

187
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,360
we've had a professional association for many years,

188
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,380
but there's no guarantee that one will actually like sustained and familiar sound.

189
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,620
When monsters prowl,

190
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,240
where creatures roam.

191
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:48,120
Monsters like unto men will be around the all about unthinkable.

192
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,160
The two.

193
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,580
Through the doorway to doom.

194
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,660
Stalking abroad by daylight in defiance of all logic and sanity.

195
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,180
Yeah.

196
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,180
Usually you stalk abroad at nighttime.

197
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,240
Well,

198
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,900
wherever they're going to stalk abroad,

199
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,820
you don't want to be able to turn around and just see it.

200
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,320
The following and sniffing around after slap.

201
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,380
Yes,

202
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,700
it could happen and it has happened.

203
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,960
Keep telling yourself it could happen.

204
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,860
It could happen.

205
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,060
It could happen.

206
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,700
No,

207
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,220
don't let it happen.

208
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,700
Bob,

209
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,280
Bob,

210
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,920
you're not going to let it happen.

211
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,100
It can't happen here or can it?

212
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,560
What?

213
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,540
You want me to shut up?

214
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:36,980
No,

215
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,100
no,

216
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,340
no,

217
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:37,800
no,

218
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,520
not at all.

219
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,200
It was a car.

220
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,420
We're getting many products in cans.

221
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,480
The filmic pile being shown at the grindhouse by staying Corbin Industries.

222
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,840
Oh,

223
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:49,840


224
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,480
about that grindhouse,

225
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:51,760
Dr.

226
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,340
Howe.

227
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,020
Yes,

228
00:12:53,020 --> 00:13:00,020
I forgot to bring my remote control and I can't grind anything with my special bootleg.

229
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,620
You can't control it remotely.

230
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,900
I can.

231
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,140
I can play a DVDs,

232
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:14,000
but I can't play my illegally downloaded bootlegs because that requires a special DVD player and I left the controller at home.

233
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,880
But the good Reverend Senate will bring it to us by Saturday.

234
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,800
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.

235
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:33,140
But what about I'm a pretty poor workman isn't made it isn't yet Reverend Argus Cinemax coming with a brand new spanking monster projector today.

236
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,160
Yes,

237
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,620
Argus Fox should be here and Reverend baby bear delivering him and his projector,

238
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,740
but that's different.

239
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,660
That's that projector is not for the likes of us then.

240
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,400
Oh,

241
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:44,780
actually,

242
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,240
I forgot I can play those bootleg movies on this thing.

243
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,780
If I can just get the sound out.

244
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,040
Of it.

245
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,600
Well,

246
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,020
now you have another technical problem,

247
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,380
right?

248
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,060
Potentially soluble.

249
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,760
That's us.

250
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,720
The giant behemoth water soluble.

251
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,180
Whoa,

252
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,620
look at the size of that thing.

253
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,460
It's enormous behemoth.

254
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,680
Unstoppable invulnerable.

255
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,620
Yes,

256
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,820
the giant beam.

257
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,520
The fire spitting monster predicted in the Bible.

258
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,820
It's core a seizing math.

259
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,380
I mean a seizing a seething mass.

260
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,820
Of lethal radiation.

261
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,340
Oop,

262
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,260
gulp,

263
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,120
gag,

264
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,080
choke,

265
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
rich,

266
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,760
rich,

267
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,460
Oop,

268
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,100
the giant behemoth animated by Willis O'Brien,

269
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,100
as opposed to the medium-sized or the rather small behemoth.

270
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,520
They were animated by David Allen and shim Danforth respectively.

271
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,760
I don't know.

272
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,880
There's something about the behemoth that seems to last in its own way.

273
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,180
More successful than Gorgo in my opinion.

274
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:14,820
Both the giant behemoth and the beast from 20,000 fathoms carried diseases and which later that was reflected in the Cloverfield monster whose lice were the size of coyotes.

275
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,760
Those horrible parasites would drop off and they would get you.

276
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,880
The yes,

277
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,420
apparently the Rita Soros did have some sort of disease,

278
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,860
but the behemoth itself was radioactive.

279
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,860
Dying.

280
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,100
Yeah,

281
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,120
made all the fishermen look puffy.

282
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,740
Yes,

283
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:48,640
and swollen and it could freeze you with its super halitosis and black and blister and burn you into a charge mummy as you looked incredibly up.

284
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:48,740
incredibly up.

285
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:48,740


286
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:48,740


287
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:48,740


288
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,840
from the streets.

289
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,440
And wow,

290
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,680
in just a few days,

291
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,880
we can have the excess to help us bring those creatures to life.

292
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,640
We can set them loose in different cities than the ones they destroyed in the movies.

293
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,580
It seems to be a sort of standard Camarasaurid or Brachiosaurid sauropod.

294
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,900
Higher at the shoulder than at the hips.

295
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,440
That is an unusual kind of structure.

296
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,820
Of course,

297
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,420
it's when a four-footed monster is easier to bolt down.

298
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,240
Step by step to your animation.

299
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:30,000
For Pete Peterson really did so well with that was the sensation of shifting of great weight from the legs.

300
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,760
And this is which one did he do the giant behemoth?

301
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:33,980
Ah,

302
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,280
you know,

303
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,600
he had multiple sclerosis.

304
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:44,160
He could not really he had to have the whole animation table lowered so he could work on it,

305
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,240
but he did a lot of good work in the behemoth and the black scorpion.

306
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,720
And the what was a when dinosaurs ruled the Earth that big female,

307
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,680
but not again another one of those weird four-legged invented creatures.

308
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,320
Yes,

309
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:12,500
the one that has has the eggs that had a really wonderful sensation of white in the stop-motion.

310
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:12,880
Yes,

311
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,380
it did.

312
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,280
That was Danforth.

313
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,820
And that was the first time I ever noticed.

314
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,340
One of those.

315
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,100
Things breathing.

316
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,340
I thought oh my God,

317
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,780
how did they do that?

318
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,800
How they make it breathe?

319
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,580
Actually,

320
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,160
they breathed in the Lost World.

321
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,600
They breathed in 1 million years BC.

322
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,160
Yeah,

323
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,160
I just had not really noticed it though.

324
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,720
I know what it was in the when dinosaurs ruled the Earth the wattle under the dinosaurs neck.

325
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,580
That was something I'd never seen.

326
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
You never saw anything wiggle.

327
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,420
You never saw a flesh.

328
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:47,300
Except in 1 million years BC when Harryhausen did it with the he had a loose flap of skin under the Allosaurus's neck,

329
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,740
which

330
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,920
he manipulated to so there are several times it it wobbles and wiggles.

331
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:12,500
And now they can have computer simulate the muscle mass and fatty tissue on like in the King Kong the Peter Jackson's King Kong when those the brontosaurus is and they really are brontosaurus is have a stampede and then go piling up at the bottom of a hill.

332
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,580
You're all blubbery and shaking so realistically.

333
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,880
It's just fabulous.

334
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,180
They almost appear to be inflated balloon or sores.

335
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,740
Princess.

336
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,700
We I need to give you some headphones.

337
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,280
Don't I and there's a little microphone.

338
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,900
So you like grow for but I didn't see any headphones.

339
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,520
So right I'm going to I will get you.

340
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,000
I also heard you broadcasting on about stalking abroad and I wanted to come over and dress that.

341
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,340
Oh,

342
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,780
I'm in trouble.

343
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,260
Yeah.

344
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,980
So do you do much broad stalking dear?

345
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,380
Are you asking I've been asking Ivan?

346
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,820
No, no, no.

347
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,940
I'm looking for your head.

348
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,140
I see.

349
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,800
Oh, I see.

350
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,940
So you don't go stalking strange broads.

351
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,440
We have three account of three special pairs of headphones.

352
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,100
To.

353
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,680
Dispense on this historic occasion.

354
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,220
One of them shall be yours.

355
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,480
It is decreed.

356
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:35,940
And here it comes now out of the bounteous bottomless box of Electronical doodads widgets and do hickeys.

357
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,060
Yes, this is truly a proud moment of decanting.

358
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,240
Just station.

359
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,020
Of technical.

360
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,340
Supremacy.

361
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:59,340
For are these things these insensate plastic and metal objects are servants or our masters.

362
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:06,340
It is up to us and us alone on occasion similar to this and on this one as well.

363
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,940
To determine once and for all the answer to this question.

364
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,100
Oh,

365
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,520
ha ha ha.

366
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:14,960
Why?

367
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,140
Why?

368
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,400
Why?

369
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:15,540
Why?

370
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:15,760
Why?

371
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:15,920
Why?

372
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,120
Why?

373
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,520
Why?

374
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:16,820
Why?

375
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:16,860
Why?

376
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:16,860


377
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:16,860


378
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:16,860


379
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:16,860


380
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,320
Why?

381
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,940
Why?

382
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,580
Why?

383
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:22,580


384
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:22,580


385
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,900
Why?

386
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,440
Why?

387
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,620
Why?

388
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,080
Why?

389
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,780
Why?

390
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,740
Why?

391
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,100
Why?

392
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,100


393
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,100


394
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,100


395
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,100


396
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,100


397
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,100


398
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,100


399
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,320
Yeah.

400
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,140
Oh,

401
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,320
by the way by the way.

402
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


403
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


404
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


405
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


406
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


407
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


408
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


409
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


410
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


411
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


412
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,320


413
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,740
Thank you

414
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:37,740


415
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,160
Yes, I hear.

416
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,160
And soon I will hear both of you.

417
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,900
And then we'll all be connected with all the little pieces of plastic and metal.

418
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,460
Even without the headphones, you ought to be able to hear on the PA system.

419
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,820
Why, yes, I can hear in the PA.

420
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,800
You'll hear the echoes coming out.

421
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,260
It's true.

422
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,820
I can hear the echoes everywhere.

423
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,300
Echoes roll from soul to soul.

424
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,460
It's not like when you guys are listening, it's like you're on a radio show or something.

425
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,980
Then you have the music in the background.

426
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,300
Yes, and the intimate sensation of something happening between your ears.

427
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,200
Mm-hmm.

428
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,480
Ah, what an X-Day this is.

429
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,440
Yes, ah, what an X-Day this is.

430
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,260
Well, it's surprisingly temperate.

431
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,360
Again, this is the third X-Day we've had that wasn't blistering, terrible, punishing.

432
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,200
No incrimination.

433
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,840
Heat or thunderstorms.

434
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,380
The terrible lightning flash, the all-dreaded thunderstorm.

435
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,220
Yes, but I am still so grateful to the fans.

436
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,480
Princess Wee, you need to hold that a little closer to your mouth.

437
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
Your fans.

438
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,560
Very, very grateful to the fans.

439
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,980
Yes, that's it, Princess Wee.

440
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,600
Your fans will keep you cool, even in weather like this.

441
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,280
Princess Wee has a lot of fans.

442
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,140
I'm her biggest fan.

443
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,440
Dr. Howell, did you know that there is a Princess Wee fan club?

444
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,780
And you can buy t-shirts.

445
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,160
No kidding.

446
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,980
With pictures of drawings and even a photograph on the front of Princess Wee flying through space.

447
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,220
Now, is any of that swag here and available?

448
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,980
No, that's on our Cafe Press store.

449
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,020
I see.

450
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,200
And it's kind of tucked away.

451
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,820
But it is possible to join the Princess Wee fan club.

452
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,080
But you have to work at it.

453
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,700
You have to look for the special fan club t-shirt.

454
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,440
I suppose once you've done that, you're ready to go.

455
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,440


456
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:45,440
Well, if you Google anything, including Princess Wee, well, you might get such a contact.

457
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:55,760
Actually, when you Google Princess Wee, you see, you do find Princess Wee, but you also find a whole lot of Chinese ladies named Wei.

458
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,820
That is so true.

459
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,760
Spelled the same way.

460
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,460
And there's even Princess Weis.

461
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,460
But when you add Queen of all the UFOs, that misidentification curve drops off sharply.

462
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,480
Yes.

463
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,860
Quite sharply.

464
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,760
None of the Chinese Princess Weis are in any way related to Princess Wee Ar Do.

465
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:14,920
Yes.

466
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,120
Not in any way.

467
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:24,500
Were you there recently when Hillary Clinton said, well, they're not UFOs anymore.

468
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,520
We don't call them that at Area 51.

469
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,700
And then what did she say they were called?

470
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,020
Oh, I didn't hear that.

471
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,600
I knew that she was saying, oh, yeah, we're going to bring all that.

472
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,940
We're going to release all that information.

473
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,700
Vote for me.

474
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,180
Well, I think she said they're now called IFOs or something.

475
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,040
Oh, they've identified them.

476
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,500
No, I don't think that's right.

477
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:53,540
But she said they're called something else, like maybe it's UAPs or something, unidentified aerial phenomenon.

478
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,520
The current jargon.

479
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,820
Oh, UFO is just too old school.

480
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,780
Apparently, you know.

481
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,500
Well, I did read that.

482
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,920
I did read that.

483
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:04,920


484
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:04,920


485
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,700
I think she's a killer, as she's called, by her enemies.

486
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,440
Her many enemies.

487
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,420
For her habit of eating babies and sacrificing penitential virgins.

488
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,780
Oh, that's what keeps her so young looking.

489
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,560
To me, she does look pretty good for an old gal like that.

490
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,280
Sure, but what was it you were saying about the self-same?

491
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:34,380
Well, she did, and she was going on and on about how, well, we're going to release all that information.

492
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,360
I want to know about it, too.

493
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,600
It sounds good.

494
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,200
I wonder what Trump would say about the UFOs.

495
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,220
Oh, I'm going to make, I'm going to copy their technology.

496
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,320
We'll have our own flying saucers.

497
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,600
Believe me, I'll have the smartest people working on that.

498
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,160
It'll be huge.

499
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,320
It'll be huge.

500
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,920
We'll have bigger flying saucers.

501
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,080
Our flying saucers will be much, much faster than theirs.

502
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,920
And we've got to build a wall around the planet to keep out this alien threat.

503
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,060
That's going to be expensive.

504
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
But my company can handle it.

505
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,360
We can build a wall in space.

506
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,460
Yes, the Dyson Sphere Company is going to get into business with Mr. Trump.

507
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,060
All these details are available online.

508
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:25,680
I went to the Creationist Museum in Texas, and they said that there used to be a giant ice shield all around the Earth.

509
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,160
That's why people live to be 199,000 years old in the Bible.

510
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,040
But then God opened up the fountains of the earth.

511
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,500
And the deep and also the greater part of the heavens gave forth its moisture.

512
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,680
And ever since then, we haven't had that handy shield.

513
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,760
Why, we don't even have a large part of the ozone layer at the bottom of the Earth.

514
00:25:52,760 --> 00:26:01,780
Or you can go to the Creationist Museum, and they have a special chamber that duplicates the atmosphere back when the Bible was written.

515
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,100
When the dinosaurs walked the Earth, and Adam and Eve rode around on them and named all of them.

516
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,720
And yeah, they got the atmosphere just like that.

517
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,080
So you can live forever if you live inside this chamber, like a dinosaur.

518
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,260
But you have to pay by the hour.

519
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,420
That was my best idea.

520
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,260
Of course, Adam lived 900 years.

521
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,780
Also, I think.

522
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,860
Noah certainly lived into his ninth century.

523
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,100
There were giants on the Earth in those days.

524
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,260
Well, there were Hemi giants.

525
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,060
There were the Nephilim, who were of greater stature than the humans.

526
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,460
But I don't know if we should give credence to the reports of the sons of Anak.

527
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,160
Oh, I can prove they existed.

528
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,000
We've got an incomplete skeleton of one of those on our Texas blog.

529
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,220
The thing is.

530
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,080
I always thought that was a false report given by the Israeli spies,

531
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,180
that we dare not go there because we saw the sons of Anak,

532
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,080
who were so large we were as grasshoppers in their sight.

533
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,780
Well, that was just to scare off the rubes.

534
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,740
Yeah, that's what I always figured.

535
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,960
But the Nephilim, on the other hand, populated the Earth

536
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:29,800
and are a strange echo of the subgenius belief about the Yeti admixture in the human.

537
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,540
And quasi-human strain.

538
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,840
These early beings were outlying groups of the fallen angels

539
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,280
who came to Earth and married into the daughters of men,

540
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:49,200
but were the sources of wildness and destructive activity.

541
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,320
It was partly because of them that Jehovah-1 decided to send the deluge

542
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,800
and scour the land clean of their uncleanliness.

543
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,640
And they were about half as big again as a normal human.

544
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,800
Well, are those the skeletons that we found?

545
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,380
We thought they were...

546
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,760
We identified them as Homo connectus.

547
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,780
I don't know. I haven't seen these.

548
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,100
Cave subgeniuses.

549
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,520
I'll have to show you the photographs later, Dr. Halbert.

550
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,620
Princess, we and I both unearthed the male and female cave subgenius skeletons.

551
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,780
Perhaps were these the Adam and Eve of the world?

552
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,840
The subgenius race?

553
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,280
Tossed off Noah's Ark as it sailed down the Paluxy?

554
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,100
You know, if you saw that...

555
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,300
To quote Wee Ma Ma?

556
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:45,360
That recent movie where Russell Crowe played Noah and...

557
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,940
I saw that.

558
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,740
Oh, you did? Yes. The long-suffering Jennifer Connelly was Mrs. Noah.

559
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,280
I don't know how she makes her casting decisions.

560
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,240
But who would have suspected that the bad guy

561
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,720
stowed away on the Ark and all these complications ensued?

562
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,400
In that movie, the Nephilim were strangely portrayed as giant bag of rocks monsters.

563
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,820
They were rocks held together by some strange energy.

564
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,820
Those were leftover props from Galaxy Quest.

565
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,020
Yes, it did seem like the Galaxy Quest monster.

566
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,860
Only these were supposed to be...

567
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,620
I don't know. It was odd. It was strange.

568
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,100
I saw the movie of Exodus, the remake of Exodus with Christian...

569
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,020
Batman plays Moses.

570
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,580
The Bat-Moses.

571
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,480
Yes. The Bat-Moses.

572
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:46,600
And they have the parting of the Red Sea or the Sea of Reeds, depending on who you...

573
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,100
Oh, it's a miraculous parting of waters.

574
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,100
Although it may...

575
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,260
You know, I think they threw in an eclipse or maybe...

576
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,600
Weird tidal changes.

577
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,960
They didn't want to make the audience think that they, the directors, were religious nuts or anything.

578
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,620
Although there are lots of miracles and...

579
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:18,080
They treat the reign of frogs and diseases and stuff like a Fortean event.

580
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,340
You know, you could halfway come away from the movie going,

581
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,880
Well, they didn't say God did it.

582
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,340
That could have been a kind of a weird natural phenomenon, you know.

583
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,120
And then by the primitive peoples, they thought that was God doing it.

584
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,300
By definition, God does everything.

585
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,320
God has his finger in every slice of the pie.

586
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,820
Right. But people don't want, you know, sophisticated people don't want others to think they believe that stuff.

587
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,100
No. And we've got to remember Moses' history as a court magician.

588
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,040
He has a lot of magic on his record.

589
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,200
And his final...

590
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,080
That would have called some miracles into question, wouldn't it?

591
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,840
His final act was an act of magic unsanctioned by God,

592
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,000
which is why God would not let Moses into the Promised Land

593
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,380
after 40 years of wandering around in the desert with the quarrelsome, contentious Israelites,

594
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:21,760
being bombarded by delicious manna from heaven and other miracles which were difficult to achieve.

595
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,780
But if you remember your scripture,

596
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:33,520
Moses struck the rock with his staff and provided a string of water for the thirsty complainers,

597
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,080
but did not do this as a godly miracle, but as one of his own.

598
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,860
Showing off.

599
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,760
Well, God was mad at this one.

600
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,820
Remember back in Egypt...

601
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,460
Glorifying yourself, eh, Moses?

602
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,820
He threw down his staff and it became a serpent.

603
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,840
And the Pharaoh said, oh, that's nothing.

604
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,020
My magicians can do that too.

605
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,920
All magicians can do that.

606
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:04,980
And sure enough, the Pharaoh's own staff of magicians threw down their rods and they became serpents.

607
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:12,120
But according to scripture, Moses' huge serpent devoured the other serpents.

608
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:18,720
Just as God swallows up, chews, and digests all other previous gods.

609
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,640
I guess I need to watch that Bible movie again, because I don't remember a lot of that stuff.

610
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:32,300
The sequel was both pathetic and wondrous, where though Moses was not allowed to enter the Promised Land,

611
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,980
he was given a special reward.

612
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,300
And you may have heard me mention this before, Reverend Stang,

613
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,600
the nature of this reward, maybe even at one of these shows.

614
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,980
Probably the one last week, we wouldn't know.

615
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,860
Go ahead.

616
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,240
Was it last week?

617
00:32:52,240 --> 00:33:06,140
Well, the deal was that Moses asked when he was told he could get some wondrous reward for his long years of service and so forth,

618
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,660
even though the ban against entering the Promised Land still stood,

619
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:18,640
he asked to be able to see God, because he'd always talked to him in the form of allegorical burning bushes

620
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,400
or just heard a voice in the wilderness and so forth.

621
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:21,700
Right.

622
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,160
And of course the response was,

623
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,220
Oh, oh, no no no no no no, no no no no,

624
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:33,940
you can't see my glory or you, a mere human, will be blasted by the radiant effulgence,

625
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,500
as in the pagan religions, flaming Jupiter destroyed hapless Semele.

626
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,900
Yes, yes, but I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, said God.

627
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,560
You may view my buttocks and back parts as I pass.

628
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,600
And so this was Moses' reward.

629
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,360
As he passed what?

630
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,820
As he passed Moses.

631
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,240
Oh, well, he passed by Moses.

632
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,660
He can't see the front of him, but the back.

633
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,440
I thought maybe he passed some wind or he had to pass some gas.

634
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,240
No, no, the back of him was not sufficiently glorious to blast Moses into molecular irrelevancy.

635
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,340
So we know that the Lord God in the heavens has a fundament.

636
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,940
You always knew that, because he made man in his own image.

637
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,080
Oh, that's right.

638
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,660
In his own image made he him.

639
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,240
So he has a weenie, too.

640
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,040
Yes, only that adjective would not be appropriate.

641
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,780
In his case.

642
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,140
Well, what would you call God's member?

643
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,940
Probably Maximal.

644
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,900
Boss, that's what you'd call it.

645
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,520
Yeah, boss, okay, whatever you say.

646
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,920
Just don't hit me.

647
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,760
Picking up over here, boss.

648
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:45,640
Well, you know more than I about the progress of the subgenius War on God,

649
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,960
which is mentioned in some of the enclosed pages

650
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,840
tipped into the schedule over there.

651
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,480
Yeah, there's a picture of God in that.

652
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,900
Just go ahead and pick up a copy for yourself out of that khaki-colored box.

653
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,140
Did you give our huge audience their brochure?

654
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,860
Oh, yes, I made sure that every person that I registered got one of those.

655
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,180
They're jostling for possession of these rare documents,

656
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,940
and it's fairly certain that some of them are.

657
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,760
Some in this huge crowd will not be successful

658
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,160
in taking away a complete collectible set.

659
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,020
Right, there are actually six of those inserts,

660
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,540
but each subgenius only gets four inserts with each brochure.

661
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,860
Collect them, trade them, swap paint.

662
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,580
Or fight over them.

663
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,540
Yes, or fight picturesquely over them.

664
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,680
Because there's not enough for everybody to have a complete set.

665
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,940
Somebody has to give up or be beaten

666
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,260
for someone else to have the complete set.

667
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,220
The complete set, right.

668
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,700
Insanely collectible art.

669
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,240
That was my way of making X Day a little more exciting, if I could.

670
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,380
Introduce a little conflict, a little challenge.

671
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,080
Hey, I didn't get the one with the picture of Baby Bear on it.

672
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,080
I wanted the one with the picture of Baby Bear.

673
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,400
Hey, there's somebody left his brochure and inserts.

674
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,100
It might have one of those in it.

675
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,140
I'll steal it.

676
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,660
Hey, buddy, I saw you stealing my Baby Bear picture.

677
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,780
Oh, this could be very messy.

678
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,860
I challenge you to a duel.

679
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,140
Guy duel.

680
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,800
On the field of honor.

681
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,640
I pink your cheeks.

682
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,720
Slap, slap, slap.

683
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,840
Oh!

684
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,700
We did do that one last week.

685
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,520
Yes, that's right.

686
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,260
We're lucky to be able to remember just in time

687
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,040
and not repeat ourselves every time.

688
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,200
Not always.

689
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,200
Yes, very lucky.

690
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,520
Not entirely.

691
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,940
I caught myself doing that on a show with Dave.

692
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:54,500
He once again brought up the lettuce, bacon, and tomato sandwich bathroom problem.

693
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,860
The BLT bathroom controversy.

694
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:58,940
Yes.

695
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,740
Yeah, two shows in a row.

696
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,940
And it took me a while to remember where I had heard this.

697
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,200
Oh, that was last week.

698
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,860
That's right.

699
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,340
We're doing the same things over and over.

700
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,960
It's just like my dad telling the same jokes every day.

701
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,340
Right.

702
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:12,340


703
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,300
And yet, they were always funny to me

704
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,220
because I forgot them every day.

705
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,980
Yes, yes, yes.

706
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,620
It's just like the memory unit that my singers group sings to.

707
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,480
Just, uh...

708
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,280
You know, Princess We is in a singing group

709
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,900
that's mostly women over, what, eight, 90 years old?

710
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,240
80.

711
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,720
Over 80.

712
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,080
Over 80.

713
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,940
Definitely over 80.

714
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,020
Yeah, 80-somethings we call them.

715
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,320
Yeah.

716
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,860
And she takes her mom with this group that sings to nursing home patients.

717
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,880
And what is their repertoire?

718
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,440
Oh, we sing show songs from the 20s and 30s.

719
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,680
See, I found some lyric sheets, and one of them was

720
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,800
Mersey dotes and dosey dotes and little amsey divey.

721
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,520
Was that one of them?

722
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,400
That's one of my mother and my songs.

723
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,180
That's not one that we sing with the group.

724
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:08,840
Oh, okay.

725
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,020
I didn't know there was a special category.

726
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:16,200
Also, I saw a Hutzit Rolston on the willow and a brawler brawler suet.

727
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,780
If only my father was here.

728
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,440
Hutzit Rolston on the willow and a brawler suet.

729
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,060
Um, so I was wondering why you had to...

730
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,260
If we didn't Wee Ma Ma and Pappy's Ghost,

731
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,740
and you guys, you'd be a barbershop quartet.

732
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,060
Warbling from the Phantom Zone.

733
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:33,680
Right.

734
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,620
Yeah, my dad sang both of those songs.

735
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,600
He just suddenly starts spouting them out.

736
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,140
Now, what are some of the songs you guys do?

737
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,280
It's the most horrible sounding band or choir.

738
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:43,920
Really?

739
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,340
Yeah, because they're so thin and reedy.

740
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,580
Their voices are nightmarishly bad, actually.

741
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,760
Like, the nursing homes are delighted with you.

742
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,260
A group of Martians trying to sing in Earth's atmosphere.

743
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Right, yeah.

744
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,680
But the songs are so familiar, and of course,

745
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,160
you know, these are people who aren't that picky.

746
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,780
I had to learn songs afresh

747
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,880
that are very old, like,

748
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,600
It's a grand night for singing

749
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,000
The moon is flying high

750
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,540
And I don't know the rest of the words.

751
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,800
But the way they sing is,

752
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,080
It's a grand night for singing

753
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,200
And we're so high

754
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,700
They're sweet.

755
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,260
They're so sweet.

756
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,300
We sing Everything's Coming Up Roses.

757
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:43,700
We sing, let's see, songs from Cabaret, we sing.

758
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,680
How about World War II songs?

759
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,260
Are those too painful to sing?

760
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,540
Well, you can name one,

761
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,720
and it's all very personalized to the director of the choir.

762
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,020
We sing the songs that she likes.

763
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,700
Like We'll Meet Again, for example?

764
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,880
No, that's not in our repertoire, unfortunately.

765
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,720
How about Stalin wasn't Stalin

766
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,280
when he told the Beast of Berlin,

767
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,120
that he would not be contented

768
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,660
till he had driven him from the land?

769
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,900
Unfortunately, we're not doing that either.

770
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,300
Well, how about We'll Tie Hirohito

771
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,780
to the Inboard Magneto of an RAF Mosquito?

772
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,260
No, but you know, my mother may know these

773
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,460
and could maybe sing them with you.

774
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,820
Yeah, well.

775
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,700
Hitler only had one ball.

776
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,160
We did that one last time.

777
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,580
Himmler has two but very,

778
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,380
no, Goering has two but very small.

779
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,060
Himmler is somewhat similar.

780
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,680
And Dr. Goebbels has no balls at all.

781
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,760
Well, I found the second verse of that

782
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,460
and lost it again.

783
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,540
Oh, well, it goes down through the Nazi hierarchy

784
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,520
with more genital-based insults.

785
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:54,800
Yeah, it does.

786
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,720
It does.

787
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,400
Actually, those lyrics may be in here,

788
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,940
but I'm not going to hold us up looking for them

789
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,220
because we did that last year.

790
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,280
Well, some of it, but not all of it.

791
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,140
Hey, wait a minute.

792
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,680
If we were modern-day kids,

793
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,200
we'd just look it up on the phone.

794
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,320
That's right.

795
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,060
You just type in Hitler has only got one ball.

796
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,420
That's right.

797
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,660
And there it will be.

798
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,280
Second verse.

799
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,440
Or perhaps even,

800
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,500
here, I'll do it in such a way,

801
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,500
I'll use Google so that the audience

802
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,620
can hear me look it up.

803
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,300
This is the apres iPhone.

804
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,920
Hold on.

805
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,660
I am not going all the way back to Berlin,

806
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,300
so a one-testicle madman can pee.

807
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,460
I'm going to pee in the middle on me

808
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,780
when I can be helping my comrades here at the front.

809
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,720
Look, this is voice activated.

810
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,200
Oh, sorry.

811
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,500
And it keeps saying Hulk Hogan.

812
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,720
This is voice activated.

813
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,200
It keeps saying Hulk Hogan.

814
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,820
Okay, wait.

815
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,500
Stop.

816
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,900
Let me try that again.

817
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,280
No, we don't want Hulk Hogan.

818
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:54,840
That's a mistake.

819
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,220
No, no, no.

820
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:55,820
You can't.

821
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,320
Look, be quiet for a second.

822
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,760
Hitler has only got one ball.

823
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,080
Oh, I didn't.

824
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,800
Hitler has only got one ball.

825
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,960
And here it is, Wikipedia.

826
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,400
Hitler has only got one ball.

827
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,860
Origin of the song.

828
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,560
Song lyrics.

829
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,680
Wow, we got a little recording here.

830
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,380
All right.

831
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,260
But let me see if the...

832
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,480
Can you patch it into the...

833
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,260
Oh, here's one I haven't heard.

834
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,900
Maybe you should sing that one.

835
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,500
Which, this one?

836
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
This one, yeah.

837
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,360
Hitler has only got one ball.

838
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,480
The other is in the Albert Hall.

839
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,660
His mother, the dirty bugger.

840
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,620
Cut it off, cut it off when he was small.

841
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,080
That's not the one I was thinking of.

842
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,640
That one's new to me.

843
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,660
No, I never heard that one before.

844
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,080
Yeah.

845
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,780
Well, let's see what this...

846
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,480
It seems that there are several variations there.

847
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,020
Isn't that true of all good drinking songs?

848
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,200
That there are different verses and variations?

849
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,120
There are many different versions.

850
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,360
Yeah.

851
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:06,360


852
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,660
And that's because people have enjoyed them so much that they just kept writing more and more stanzas.

853
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,960
That's evolution.

854
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,960
Oh, is that what the kids call it nowadays?

855
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,600
In other media?

856
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,000
The ever-branching tree of de-well-up-ment.

857
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,720
Be-well-up-ment?

858
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:28,780
Yes.

859
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,700
Well, apparently the song has been in several movies.

860
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,840
That's kind of strange.

861
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,540
Or some reference to it.

862
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,780
Well, of course, the tune commonly given to that bit of doggerel is the famous Colonel Bogey March.

863
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,240
Bridge on the River Kwai.

864
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:46,780
Yes.

865
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,120
One hears it there.

866
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,060
Thomas Pynchon.

867
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,580
DC Comics.

868
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,440
Yes, indeed.

869
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,720
The sequel to Terms of Endearment.

870
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,400
Terms of Estrangement, I believe that one was called.

871
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:00,900
Let's see.

872
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,660
Oh, here's a YouTube of Hitler.

873
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,600
He's only got one.

874
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,080
YouTube of Hitler.

875
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,360
YouTube of Hitler.

876
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:06,520
Really?

877
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:07,940
Uncyclopedia.

878
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,620
Let me see what that says.

879
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,400
Oh, the YouTube has images illustrating this?

880
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,580
Well, let's find out.

881
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,160
Let's see.

882
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,300
And I can tell.

883
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,160
Those listening can follow at home by going to YouTube and...

884
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,720
The Yogscast are the people doing this.

885
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,540
Yogs?

886
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,980
Yogs?

887
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,600
Oh, look.

888
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,640
Hitler has only got one.

889
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:34,820
He's only got one.

890
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:34,820


891
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:34,820


892
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:34,820


893
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:34,820


894
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,860
Well, I'll see you there to see who's out there.

895
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:36,860


896
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:36,860


897
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:36,860


898
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:36,860


899
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:36,860


900
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:36,860


901
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:36,960
The other...

902
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:47,360
is in Hi Blessed Mother the Dirty Bugger, cut it when he was small.

903
00:44:48,460 --> 00:45:00,000
She threw it over West Germany, it landed in the Deep Blue Sea, the fishes got out their

904
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,780
dishes, and had scallops and bollocks teased.

905
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:04,800
He was aware of an end, the founder said dandy not from the heart.

906
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:04,800


907
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:04,800


908
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,640
Which World War relic is housed in the Albert Hall?

909
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,980
Is it anything to do with that, maybe?

910
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,700
It was a more innocent time

911
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,860
where we sang songs about Hitler's bollocks in church.

912
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,120
Yay!

913
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,980
He passed with flying colours.

914
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,700
Hitler has only got one bowl

915
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,840
The other is in the Albert Hall

916
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,700
His mother, the dirty bugger

917
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,740
Cut it off when he was small

918
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,540
She threw it over West Germany

919
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,400
It landed in the deep blue sea

920
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,940
The fishes got out their dishes

921
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,040
And had scallops and bollocks changed

922
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,740
That was really...

923
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:01,620
Strange.

924
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,320
Well, that was quite educational.

925
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:03,920
Yes!

926
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,120
I have to do a thing.

927
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,260
Oh, he has to do a thing.

928
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,180
Hold on, everybody.

929
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,300
He's going to go do a thing.

930
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,940
We'll be right back in just a moment.

931
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,140
Reverend Stang is going to do a thing right here.

932
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,440
Then we'll resume transmission.

933
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,840
He's so good at doing a thing.

934
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,840
Well, you know, when there's a thing to do,

935
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,900
the easiest way to deal with that particular problem

936
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,340
is just to go ahead and do the thing.

937
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,380
That's true.

938
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,920
So very true.

939
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:31,340
So true.

940
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:31,580
So true.

941
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


942
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


943
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


944
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


945
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


946
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


947
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


948
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


949
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


950
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


951
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


952
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


953
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:31,600


954
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,000
The shortest way is straight through.

955
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,760
You see?

956
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,400
No wandering around Robin Hood's barn

957
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,500
or other unlikely locations.

958
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,820
Just shoot straight through

959
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,680
as swiftly as an arrow,

960
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,280
as gently as a sparrow.

961
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,780
You know, that's the way my father-in-law

962
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,740
described death.

963
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,760
He said that he shot through.

964
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,780
No, he didn't describe it after the fact.

965
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,040
No, before.

966
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,220
Before the fact.

967
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:01,600


968
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:02,820
Before the fact.

969
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:02,820


970
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:02,820


971
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:02,820


972
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:02,820


973
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:02,820


974
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:02,820


975
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:02,820


976
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:02,820


977
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:02,820


978
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,020
That was the day that he would shoot through.

979
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,200
Well, let's hope it's not wishful thinking

980
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,780
and the process of discorporation

981
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,320
not lingering and agonizing.

982
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,440
Yes.

983
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,040
Even felt by the corpse

984
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,160
as a sort of lingering morphogenetic field of agony.

985
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,880
No, that's a worst-case scenario there.

986
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,600
Yes.

987
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,000
Yes.

988
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,240
Oh, yeah.

989
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,280
Oh, yeah.

990
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,340
Oh, yeah.

991
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,920
Where would we be without oh, yeah.

992
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:36,780
That's it.

993
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,720
And terminate.

994
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,000
That's the second time that I've whipped out my phone

995
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,520
to play a song that we were talking about on the show.

996
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,000
And the previous one was Hitler too.

997
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,960
It was in their fear's face.

998
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:50,540
Yes.

999
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,500
By Spike Jones.

1000
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:51,940
Yes.

1001
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,160
I started talking about it.

1002
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:53,960
And then I thought, well,

1003
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,320
if I was like a normal modern day person,

1004
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,560
I would just pull it up on the phone

1005
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,780
and hold it against the mic.

1006
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,580
I learned that from five years ago.

1007
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,220
I learned that from Milo, actually.

1008
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,360
That was later turned into a popular Donald Duck cartoon

1009
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,800
by Walt Disney.

1010
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,640
Where Donald is somehow a German

1011
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,820
working in a Nazi munitions factory.

1012
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,620
Lots of those were made, evidently.

1013
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,040
Oh, they made some good propaganda cartoons

1014
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,260
in Technicolor that Disney people did.

1015
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,680
Education for Death.

1016
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,280
That's another good one.

1017
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:27,620
Yikes.

1018
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,780
But Reason and Imagination.

1019
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,080
That's quite memorable.

1020
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,260
Because in that one it shows that inside our heads

1021
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:41,800
we have these little guys operating the controls.

1022
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,400
Up inside the skull.

1023
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,140
Reason and emotion, actually.

1024
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,380
But sometimes emotion takes control.

1025
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,860
Who's kind of like a miniaturized caveman.

1026
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,280
And in your average German citizen

1027
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,000
or fellow traveling Nazi,

1028
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,480
that emotion has become huge

1029
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,300
and wadded up reason into a little ball.

1030
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,960
There was a modern movie just made about...

1031
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,020
It was very similar to that.

1032
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,240
That scared Reverend Stang and I

1033
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,040
and we thought that if any child watched it

1034
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,580
it would be pretty scary.

1035
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,800
What was that animated film that we watched

1036
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,420
about emotions and...

1037
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,660
About a kid.

1038
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,620
Little girl.

1039
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,580
Inside Out.

1040
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,420
Inside Out.

1041
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,840
That was actually a very good movie.

1042
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,260
Yes, but you seemed to think it would warp a child who viewed it?

1043
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,980
Oh, Princess Weed didn't raise any children.

1044
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,980
She didn't abuse kids the way I...

1045
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,700
Come on, kids.

1046
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:43,520
Free movie.

1047
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,600
Get on in here.

1048
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,460
Hey, I got this movie.

1049
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,680
Kids, you're going to love this movie.

1050
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,420
Blue Velvet.

1051
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,620
Come on in.

1052
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,860
You like to...

1053
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,640
Strap these here kids in.

1054
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,220
All right.

1055
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,360
Twin Peaks was a family experience for us.

1056
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,620
We would sit around.

1057
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,900
We'd watch each weekly episode

1058
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,820
and then we'd dive in.

1059
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:00,820


1060
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:00,820


1061
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,040
Dissect it and try to figure out what was going on.

1062
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,120
Have some popcorn, kids.

1063
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,140
My daughter, who was only about 11,

1064
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,360
saw that scene where Audrey

1065
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,300
puts a cherry with a stem in her mouth

1066
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,800
and when she brings it out

1067
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,980
she's tied the stem into a knot with her tongue.

1068
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:19,780
Into a bow.

1069
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,320
Yes.

1070
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,740
I tricked my daughter into thinking

1071
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,440
that I could do that.

1072
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,120
I had a tied one already in my mouth.

1073
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,180
I just did this and out it came.

1074
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,820
Then she...

1075
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,040
She tried it.

1076
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,500
She lay on the floor to keep her hands

1077
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,840
so she wouldn't be tempted to use her hands

1078
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,940
and God almighty, she did it.

1079
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,320
She did that.

1080
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,000
She tied a cherry stem into a knot

1081
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,540
using only her mouth.

1082
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,520
I guess if anyone on planet Earth could do that

1083
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,320
it would be Civet.

1084
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,240
Well, you heard it here, folks.

1085
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,540
Dr. Howell, it's just a gift for you.

1086
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,660
I found in my...

1087
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,680
As I was going through...

1088
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,060
I've got a little bit of a memory.

1089
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,060


1090
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,060


1091
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,060


1092
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,060


1093
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,080
Well, that's mighty kindly of you, Stang.

1094
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,240
I'll treasure this always.

1095
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,540
Well, it has Timmy.

1096
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,480
Yes, it does.

1097
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,740
And I knew that you were fond of Timmy.

1098
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,720
He always gets...

1099
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,020
Has Tim...

1100
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,040
Timmy, Billy, those two had

1101
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,060
a succession of adventures.

1102
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:23,840
Timmy.

1103
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,780
The way you tell them,

1104
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,280
they always end up dying.

1105
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,340
Terrible things happen to them

1106
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,820
and Aunt Bertha just finishes them.

1107
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,300
She ends up with her same old spiel.

1108
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:36,060
They were intended to be admonitory,

1109
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,940
but often they're not harmed,

1110
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,360
only deeply shamed and embarrassed.

1111
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,500
Aunt Bertha was a radio thing,

1112
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,880
but sort of like Davy and Goliath.

1113
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,460
It was done on such an amateur level

1114
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,720
that it's amazing how many records

1115
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,260
that she pressed with her adenoidal choir

1116
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,280
of young sycophants.

1117
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,500
Do you have any of those records?

1118
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,660
Wellman Collections.

1119
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,100
It's the...

1120
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,440
He's lost and broken more Aunt Bertha records

1121
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,580
than I've ever seen.

1122
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,500
He goes to swap meets or used to

1123
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,220
when all this stuff comes out into the sunshine.

1124
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,020
Aunt Bertha's happy family,

1125
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,800
whichever one it is where she rails

1126
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,740
against rocketry and space.

1127
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,260
She's against rocketry and space?

1128
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,200
It's not the moon we should try to hit,

1129
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,540
but the God who put it there, and so forth.

1130
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,960
Yeah, that's what we say.

1131
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,580
Hit God.

1132
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:30,880
Hit God.

1133
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,500
Give us a rocket.

1134
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,800
A poor old buck naked had the laser project

1135
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,380
that was supposed to either drive off

1136
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,700
or attract Jehovah One.

1137
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,880
I forget what the basic idea was.

1138
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,220
It was a money-raising thing for him.

1139
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,960
I think we should set our sights

1140
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,060
above the moon and space

1141
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,460
and focus on eternity

1142
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,040
while we have time and grace.

1143
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,360
Heaven is located somewhere

1144
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,320
past the asteroid belt.

1145
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,840
But closer than Mars.

1146
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,940
It's very cloudy, but beautiful.

1147
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,500
And such beautiful music.

1148
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,720
To hear them talk, it won't be long

1149
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,400
before we hit the moon.

1150
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,100
What about that country-western song,

1151
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,220
One by One,

1152
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,840
which has the persistent, irritating refrain of

1153
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:26,040
As sure as there's a heaven behind the sun.

1154
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,560
Whoa, I never heard that one.

1155
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,540
I thought Planet X was...

1156
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,060
We're broken one by one.

1157
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,920
We'll continue this episode next week.

1158
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,100
But for now, a little tune I call

1159
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,240
Spaz Blaster.

1160
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,960
For more information, see subgenius.com.

1161
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,520
Right out, that's the way he's looking.

1162
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,080
Apparently, Bob came and did something with all of us.

1163
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,720
Praise God, Bob.

1164
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,760
Quiet, numbskulls.

1165
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,280
He's on broadcasting.

1166
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,060
Lay your hands on the radio.

1167
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,580
Lay your hands on the radio.

1168
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,320
They're in the home.

1169
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,700
And we're gonna look to God.

1170
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,980
It's not a nightmare that's gonna end.

1171
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,840
It's just beginning because it's inside me.

1172
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,220
You, you have to love Bob.

1173
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,640
He loves you, Bob.

1174
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,980
You love Bob.

1175
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,240
You have to.

1176
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,560
You have to.

1177
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:30,560


1178
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:30,560


1179
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:30,560


1180
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,960
What happens if you don't love Bob?

1181
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,780
He'll kill you.

1182
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,700
He'll bob you out.

1183
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,880
Right now, I will give you all my money.

1184
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,160
Bob.

1185
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,640
Bob.

1186
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,660
Bob.

1187
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,380
Bob.

1188
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,100
Bob.

1189
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,900
Bob.

1190
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,480
Bob.

1191
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,120
Bob.

1192
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,340
Bob.

1193
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:53,680


1194
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:54,800
Bob.

1195
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,060
Bob.

1196
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,460
Bob.

1197
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,060
Bob.

1198
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,180
Bob.

1199
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:57,560


1200
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:57,560


1201
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:57,760
Bob.

1202
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,260
Bob.

1203
00:54:59,260 --> 00:54:59,260


1204
00:54:59,300 --> 00:54:59,520
Bob.

1205
00:54:59,620 --> 00:54:59,900
Bob.

1206
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:00,040
Bob.

1207
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,040


1208
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,000
Bob.

1209
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:01,880
Bob.

1210
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:02,940
Bob.

1211
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,040
Bob.

1212
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:06,920
Bob.

1213
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:24,960
Bob.

1214
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,480
Bob.

1215
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,080
Bob.

1216
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:26,560
Bob.

1217
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,980
Bob.

1218
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,100
Bob.

1219
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:27,420
Bob.

1220
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:27,540
Bob.

1221
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:27,640
Bob.

1222
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,400
Why don't you just leave me alone?

1223
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,420
Bob.

1224
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,580
I never saw anything.

1225
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,840
I don't know what Mars is and I was never there.

1226
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,320
Hey, Sam!

1227
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,340
Ah!

1228
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,480
Shut up!

1229
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,460
You shut up!

1230
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,460
eben keep shooting

1231
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,700
я

1232
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,160
Funny!

1233
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:07,720
Attention

1234
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,660
Attention

1235
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,940
Attention!

1236
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,120
Attention!

1237
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,060
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

1238
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:43,980
Attention!

1239
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,040
Attention!

1240
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,060
Attention!

1241
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,060
Attention!

1242
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:21,320
Attention!

1243
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,120
Attention!

1244
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:35,980
No. Look, he starts this thing, he won't be able to stop it.

1245
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:43,300
It's immortality, for the price more costly than death.

1246
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,980
The world stops spinning and the clock stops moving,

1247
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:55,420
but something's still ticking and wearing on the inside.

1248
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:00,380
And every time you let it go like I'm doing right now,

1249
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,760
you can feel the wear.

1250
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:13,800
I know from 342 years of experience that time control can only go awry.

1251
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,300
The Third World War might begin any minute and we'll all be killed.

1252
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,380
Why should we bother about giant turtles?

1253
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,120
Yes, maybe you're right.

1254
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,400
I know how much you love your turtles,

1255
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,400
but there are other things that you can do.

1256
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,280
Other things in life just as important, like having friends.

1257
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,620
Our ancient legends did mention fire-eating turtles.
