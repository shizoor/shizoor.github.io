1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
Listen to yourself, Bob. You follow her to work, you open her mail, you eavesdrop on her

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,680
SELF-GENIUS POWER OF SWATCH!

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:17,780
Yesterday, I introduced into my body the largest dose I have yet dared,

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,900
wondering what this amazing experiment would do to me.

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,460
My transformation was complete within 25 minutes.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,160
The fastest period to date.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,760
Reconversion to normalcy was the slowest.

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,460
Almost an hour.

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,180
I was temporarily obsessed with the frightening thought I might never return.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,680
Forever to be clutched in the savage grasp of a million lost years.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,100
With all the future I exceed, I'll continue thinking grown-up again.

12
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,980
Over the thin, toilet in the street one next to the guys and

13
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,040
Sorry about that.

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,360
Oh!

15
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,640
Oh!!

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,220
I'm supposed to be baooping in my pants.

17
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,220


18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,220


19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,200
And you say you're just a little workout?

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,360
Didn't you say cool it?

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,920
After the tee wonder shirt!

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,440
No nothing!

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,440


24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,440


25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:29,460


26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,700
Welcome to the Royal!

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,260
Now I'm opening this up again.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,500
Real ninja wielder of the sacred, the spatula guy.

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,360
Okay spatula guy, head on up.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,880
Friends, I've seen all kinds of artists, yo-yo artists, a couple of them here tonight.

31
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:06,620
Oh god, what have I been, squid artists, poo artists, you can make art with just about

32
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,020
anything.

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,680
The last night I met my very first spatula artist.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,100
So how's it going everybody?

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm new, they call me grill ninja wielder of the sacred spatula.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,400
I learned this shit by listening to Digital Underground.

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,440
I'm sorry what was that?

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,180
I like it that way, it's alright.

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,740
It's all the vinegar that does it for me.

40
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,780
I once met a marine that was a member of the conspiracy, Mackinac, a friend of mine

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,800
who's a fan of Doctor Who.

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,560
And he was like, I'm full of piss and vinegar.

43
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,060
And I was like, sir you are more full of vinegar and water than you are full of piss and vinegar.

44
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,640
And I just wanted to say that to him in my heart right now in front of you.

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,500
See because like watch, watch this.

46
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay alright, you know what's bigger than Scientology?

47
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,960
We are.

48
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,340
Like the subgenius is the way to go.

49
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,340


50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,560
Bob Staten's fucking cock block Tom Cruise's any day of the week and it makes my heart

51
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,500
smile to say so.

52
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,760
Now, in terms of mysticism, which is one of the places where my heart lives, I have walked,

53
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,840
I don't know.

54
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,380
I've walked paths, I've seen death.

55
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,800
I've literally seen death.

56
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,240
It freaks me out.

57
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,160
But it's cool.

58
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,700
He's got a horse named Binky.

59
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,940
You know he helps Rince win the wizard.

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,700
I don't know how many of you follow Discworld but whatever.

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,020
As far as the situation goes though, I want to let you all know I'm glad to be here this

62
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,780
evening as well as this week because look, in my heart I've been a subgenius a long time

63
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,780
and Bob creeps me straight the fuck out.

64
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,060
But that's cool though.

65
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,240
Because he's supposed to.

66
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,820
He's supposed to be like, hey everybody, I'm going to sell you insurance but I'm going

67
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,420
to give you, I'm going to slip you the mickeys while you're doing it.

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,660
And you're like, whoa, this is the best insurance I ever bought.

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,940
He's like, yes it is.

70
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,620
Slack.

71
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,680
And I'm like, I have my heart smiling but I'm defecating myself at the same time and

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,180
I don't know why.

73
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,440
That's the beauty and majesty of this situation right now.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,920
It's like a blues song, except not.

75
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,900
I'm too upbeat.

76
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,040


77
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,320
I was going to read some stuff from my books but maybe I won't.

78
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,880
I don't know yet.

79
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,680
We'll roll with this.

80
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,640
As far as the situation goes, mysticism and shenanigans, the binding of ourselves to our

81
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,880
reality and how we flow into it, through the glory of his pipe, isn't there like a saying

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,040
like say less, blah, blah, blah, something French that says this is not a pipe.

83
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,900
And it was Dadaism and shenanigans.

84
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,960
But see that ties into the kind of beliefs that we have.

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,320
What's that?

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,960
The Greek.

87
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,320
Okay.

88
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,120
See, I don't know.

89
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,500
I don't know.

90
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,780
I only know things.

91
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,940
I know random trivia.

92
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,460
Yeah.

93
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,240
Thank you.

94
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,940
And so the illusion of a pipe is what we deal in.

95
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,760
Dealing with illusions is one of the things I'm best at.

96
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,360
You give the illusion of depth.

97
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,060
I sit there on a two dimensional plane.

98
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
I give you eyes.

99
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,280
I give you truths.

100
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,920
I give you things you were never meant to see, but have brought home to your own lands,

101
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,720
blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera.

102
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,040
Because I'm an artist and that's what we do, baby.

103
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,320
I will be glad to tell you all I know because I want to teach you guys a secret.

104
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,820
And I'm going to see if I can come up with a secret, if I can piece it together right

105
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,640
now at this moment.

106
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,140
Because I can feel your eyes on me.

107
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,960
I feel your vibes.

108
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,720
I can see the connections of you all.

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,800
The secret of art, a lot of people say it's communication.

110
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,300
It's creating that depth where it previously didn't exist.

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,420
It's taking something out of nothing and giving it to somebody else and then showing them

112
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,640
the value of its depth.

113
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,180
It's showing them the resonance that lives within our hearts.

114
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,800
It's giving it to somebody else and then showing them the value of its depth.

115
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,000
And it shows us who we are as humans, as people, as transcendents, as yetis even.

116
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,800
Yetis.

117
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,660
What's that now?

118
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:14,940
The balance of the spatula on the finger is a meditative process that helps when you haven't

119
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,380
been drinking.

120
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,100
But when you have been, you learn how it's done.

121
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,820
And you sit there and you're like, ooh, watch me twirl it.

122
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,800
Oh, I'm so skilled.

123
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,280
The beauty of the spatula, by the way, for me, is taking something that's a common household

124
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,480
utensil and making it something exceptional.

125
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,160
So you learn how to wield it and make it something great that goes beyond itself.

126
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,080
When you take something so common that the conspiracy is like, oh, it's just a spatula.

127
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,780
I don't even know.

128
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,680
Oh, I'm a Republican.

129
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,260
And you want to set them on fire and jizz on their tits or whatever you do with Republicans,

130
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,880
I don't know.

131
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,020
For the ladies, by the way, there's a secret.

132
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,520
You can totally jizz on someone's tits if you try hard enough, ladies.

133
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,260
You just got to want it.

134
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,260
You do a thing.

135
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:00,900
I don't know.

136
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,340
I don't.

137
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,780
They never told me how it's done.

138
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,180
I met a lady once anyway.

139
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,580
So I think she was a transvestite.

140
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,200
I don't know.

141
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,320
So no.

142
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:16,060
Secretly, though, the beauty and majesty of the spatula is taking something mundane and

143
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,600
making it something exceptional.

144
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,160
Okay.

145
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,700
And when you do this, it's a meditative process.

146
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,440
Connecting yourself to the great reality of life, what it means to connect and be a part

147
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,000
of transcend the conspiracy is doing stuff like that all day, every day.

148
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,560
One of us.

149
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,260
You were saying earlier that we were like part of the conspiracy and we're stuck in

150
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,080
it and blah, blah, blah.

151
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,420
Yeah, you're right.

152
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,060
It's true.

153
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,140
But when you sit there and you move with it and you use its own ends to your ends, you

154
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,180
become something transcendent of it.

155
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,840
And you grow beyond the scope of the conspiracy.

156
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:59,900
That is why in my heart, Anubis lives and he says that's not cricket and that's what's

157
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,200
important.

158
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,320
So in the name of the subgenius, I grant you all a blessing.

159
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,980
I am blessing you with this spatula that makes me 10% better at everything.

160
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,640
And the first thing people want to do is spankings apparently.

161
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,000
They go, let me see your spatula.

162
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,940
Ah, spanking.

163
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,180
Spankings.

164
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,640
They do this every time.

165
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,240
So okay, it's going to be especially beneficial if you're going to spank somebody tonight.

166
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,160
But I'm blessing all of you.

167
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,520
In the name of Bob, in the name of myself, in the name of do what thou wilt and that

168
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,400
is the whole law even though Crowley was a douchebag.

169
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,220
Just let it go.

170
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,380
Just go with it.

171
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,780
Enjoy yourselves.

172
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,240
Make merry and carry on.

173
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,680
In the name of the subgenius.

174
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,940
You can't take me.

175
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,260
Don't tell me what to do.

176
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,800
I'm not going to do it.

177
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:48,920
I'm going to do it.

178
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:48,920


179
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:48,920


180
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,480
Now watch.

181
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,060
In spite of yourselves, it's going to happen anyway because I got the blues on my side

182
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,420
and I've taken the sadness away.

183
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,600
It is true.

184
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,120
I have.

185
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,700
Blessings upon you.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,480
No.

187
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,380
You're dead.

188
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,920
But I will join you.

189
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:18,920


190
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:18,920


191
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,660
I will draw them for you.

192
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,680
Thank you guys so much.

193
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,400
That was a fucking harmonica.

194
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,980
That was great.

195
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,000
I just was like wow.

196
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,760
How many people punctuate a rant with a harmonica?

197
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,760
That's, you know, staying with staying there's a lot of firsts.

198
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,740
That's definitely a first.

199
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,020
A rant punctuated with a harmonica.

200
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,100
And a spatula.

201
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:48,940


202
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm going to have to ret vị How are you doing.

203
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,420
Fucking droplets dog here.

204
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,340
Intro Dr.

205
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:11,800
As simple as this.

206
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,420
Just specific

207
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,340
Swimsuit.

208
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,160
Then we get a Dobbs doctor.

209
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,800
Dobbs doctor.

210
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,020
Dobbs doctor.

211
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,020
Who's Dobbs doctor?

212
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,240
Buds stretcher.

213
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,620
Doctor.

214
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,920
Doctor Buds stretcher.

215
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,040
Dr. Bob.

216
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,100
Dr. Bob.

217
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,280
Doctor.

218
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,060
Paging Dr. Dobbs.

219
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,620
Dr. Dobbs.

220
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,480
Paging Dr. Dobbs.

221
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,240
Dr. Dobbs.

222
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,480
We're looking for Dr. Dobbs.

223
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,100
Have you seen him?

224
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,340
I think he took that little nurse in in the back room.

225
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,040
Don't bother him.

226
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,860
Then he'll be in the bathroom

227
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,120
for at least three hours on a ship, right?

228
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,740
Because that's how Bob does things.

229
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,640
When Bob goes to work,

230
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,500
no work is occurred.

231
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,320
The only things that happen are what he wants.

232
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,840
Slack it.

233
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,400
For Bob.

234
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,060
All our dance are belongs to Bob.

235
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,020
All our funk are belongs to Bob.

236
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,000
All your knuckle babies are belongs to Bob.

237
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,580
All your juices,

238
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
your warm and tasty juices,

239
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,460
are belongs to Bob.

240
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,480
All our dance belong to Bob.

241
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,480


242
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,480


243
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Even that ringworm you picked up on the shower floor tonight on your foot.

244
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,120
That belongs to Bob too.

245
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,360
All our dance belongs to Bob.

246
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,280
All our dance belongs to Bob.

247
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,940
Bob owns the copyright on this song.

248
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,060
You know how much we get after royalties?

249
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,460
We get...

250
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,200
what's left in the bottom of a beer can of fucking backwash.

251
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,260
That's what we get.

252
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,140
Thanks, Bob.

253
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,740
Dr. Dr.

254
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,700
Bob!

255
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,740
Dr. Dr.

256
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,760
Bob.

257
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,720
Dr. Dr.

258
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,060
Oh, Bob.

259
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,720
Dr. Dr.

260
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,040
Bob.

261
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,880
Dr. Dr.

262
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,880
B.O.B.1.

263
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,120
Dr. Dr.

264
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,700
Dr. Dr. Bad.

265
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,400
Dr. Dr. Dr.

266
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:49,720
Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr.

267
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,220
Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr.

268
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,420
Dr. Dr.

269
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,120
Dr. Dr. Dr.它 V.

270
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,100
...

271
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,100


272
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,380
Doctor.

273
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,560
Give a big round of applause for Radio Mike, who was on drums.

274
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,600
Seth Bichon is taking over drums.

275
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,040
Reverend 80 is on bass.

276
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,800
Stick has been on and off bass.

277
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,960
Biker Man is on...

278
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,940
Is that seriously a mandolin?

279
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,340
That's so awesome.

280
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,920
Biker Man is on mandolin.

281
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,060
Berg is on bass.

282
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,720
Dr. Flonase is on guitar.

283
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,200
Rock God is on guitar.

284
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,860
I'm just off kilter.

285
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Philodrum is on whatever instrument he puts in front of him.

286
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,000
Which certainly is piano at the moment.

287
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,800
Gravity is on the hippie drum.

288
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,900
And Reverend Fox is on some weird electronic drum.

289
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,440
So, Rice...

290
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,500
Angry Larry was playing again whatever instrument he could get himself in front of.

291
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,900
Alright, so this is a fun one.

292
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,800
We're listening to a cooperate from you.

293
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,880
Thank you.

294
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,800
I was dreaming that.

295
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,180
I lost the scales from my eyes.

296
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,820
Oh, I lost the scales from my eyes.

297
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,180
What is that?

298
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,100
What is that thing?

299
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,460
Now they're open, I can clearly see

300
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,600
A whole world for me

301
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,020
Try to tone it all down

302
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,880
Oh

303
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,900
Just to keep around me

304
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:12,900


305
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:12,900


306
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:12,900


307
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:12,900


308
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,180
Just to keep her around

309
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,460
Oh

310
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,300
In the end it was still too much

311
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,340
She couldn't handle the rush

312
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,260
And it's all new

313
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,560
Amazing too

314
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,740
I can't begin to tell you

315
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,400
Ooh

316
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,760
Ooh

317
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:41,920
Ooh

318
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,140
Ooh

319
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,300
Ooh

320
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,880
Ooh

321
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,060
I still wrapped up to see

322
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,580
Oh, what's good or not for me

323
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,600
Oh, I let my candle hide a cabinet door

324
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,420
I can't hide it no more

325
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,460
I lost the scales from my eyes

326
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,160
Oh, I lost the scales from my eyes

327
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,040
Oh, oh, oh

328
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,800
Thank you. I wrote that last Friday.

329
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,760
All right.

330
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,880
That was a new song by St. Andrew the Impaled of Pittsburgh,

331
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,780
recorded live by Reverend Suds or myself

332
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,600
at the 18X Day Drill of last July.

333
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,720
And yet, he wrote that song last Friday.

334
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,800
Whatevs.

335
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,060
Praise Andrew and all the other musicians and anti-musicians

336
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,840
who made it to the Wisteria Campground

337
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,400
and saw the show.

338
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,160
I'm in Southern Ohio to celebrate the end of the world together.

339
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,320
And hey, it still might end any minute.

340
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,340
So yeah, this is the third of the X Day cross-section shows

341
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,380

342
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,340

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,400
the Giant Germs, featuring Reverend Angry Larry on guitar,

344
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,640
and the Brigadoon-like X Day jam band

00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,400
neutrally ahead of this time,

348
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,300
as well as fervor

349
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,480
welcomed and

350
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,480


351
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,480


352
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,500
show of the week.

353
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,500


354
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,200
you drag the weight off

355
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,200


356
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,200


357
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,120

360
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:09,320
And you put listened to something really interesting while we're live right now

361
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,180
You had your choice

362
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,160
The knowledge was before you

363
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,700
I heard your voice

364
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,720
You denied all that they told you

365
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,300
I cannot help you see

366
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,980
The mistakes you've made

367
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,500
I cannot save your soul

368
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,500
From the coming of existence

369
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,920
There is no cure for stupidity

370
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:33,000
There is no cure for stupidity

371
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,920
There is no cure for stupidity

372
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,480
You could have paid your learnings back

373
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,100
You could have paid your learnings back

374
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,680
But now it's all gone

375
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:04,680


376
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,500
But now it's all gone

377
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,960
It's time to die

378
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,320
And to the angels and devils

379
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,420
Do you cry?

380
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,980
But never ask me why

381
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,980
There is no cure for stupidity

382
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,560
Do you cry?

383
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,540
Now you see what you've done

384
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,660
Do you cry?

385
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,980
Now you see what you've done

386
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,420
Do you cry?

387
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,400
Now you see what you've done

388
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,640
So don't play

389
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,460
So don't play

390
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,060
There is no cure for stupidity

391
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,540
So don't play

392
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,380
You'd be free or dead

393
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,300
If you listened to me

394
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,800
If you listened to me

395
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,360
If you listened to me

396
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,840
If you listened to me

397
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,520
If you listened to me

398
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
If you listened to me

399
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:01,440
In an old house, there is always listening, and more is heard than is spoken, and what

400
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:10,120
is spoken remains in the room, waiting for the future to hear it. And whatever happens started

401
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:19,120
in the past and presses hard on the future. The agony in the curtained bedroom, whether of birth

402
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:27,240
or of dying, gathers into itself all the voices of the past and projects them into the future.

403
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,420
The treble voices on the lawn, the mowing of hay,

404
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:39,200
in summer, the dogs and the old pony, the stumble and the wail of little pain, the chopping

405
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,260
of wood in autumn, the singing in the kitchen and the footsteps at night in the corridor,

406
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,840
the moment of sudden loathing and the season of stifled sorrow, the whisper, the transparent

407
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:01,400
deception, the keeping up of appearances, the making the best of a bad job, all twirl

408
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:10,640
and the twine and tangled together, all are recorded. There is no avoiding these things,

409
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:21,460
and we know nothing of exorcism, and whether in Argos or Wisteria, there are certain inflexible

410
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:31,380
laws unalterable in the nature of music. There is nothing to do about it. There is nothing

411
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:31,380


412
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:40,720
to be done about anything. And now it is nearly time for the news. We must listen for the weather

413
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:50,740
report and the international catastrophes. Those two samples were by T.S. Eliot.

414
00:24:51,500 --> 00:25:01,360
And that was Dr. Howell of the Ask Dr. Howell Show, reciting T.S. Eliot from memory. Howell is like the people in Fairmont,

415
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,020
New York, and he is the first person to write a book about the world. He is a great artist.

416
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:13,680
He is an incredible artist. Google Hal Robbins with one B and you'll see. In a little while,

417
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:20,340
we'll be going back to 18X Day for a little of the Doctors for Wotan reunion concert featuring

418
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:26,960
the Stang and Drummond families, a somewhat revised version of the classic bowl song Louie

419
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,640
Louie. But first, we're going back in time to the

420
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,340
year of the first.

421
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,340
The year of 1980 and the original Doctors for Wotan version from the first Doctors for Wotan album.

422
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,160
Philo and I both had different wives then. We weren't in the band.

423
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,480
Now we are

424
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,480


425
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,660
Hey! That's my Louie Louie!

426
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,740
Guys Göran Unless when the virus out there so

427
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,120
Louie, Louie, you want to?

428
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,320
Women Sounds Like MAR nunus

429
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:30,300
Louie, Louie! Louie, Louie, you make me run

430
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,000
Louie, Louie, you make me run

431
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,340
And I suck at music and I'll never trust myself to play that one tune again

432
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:40,880
Lily, Lily, are you a girl or a goat woman?

433
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:51,000
Lily, Lily, oh baby, you have some kind of weird mush in your glands.

434
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,300
Everything has a logical explanation in science. I refuse to believe the supernatural.

435
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,500
There must be some logical cause and effect to this, this unholy adventure.

436
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,800
Reckon there must. Any ideas?

437
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,100
Well, no.

438
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,700
I was just thinking something is missing.

439
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,120
I was going, oh yeah, my audio recorder.

440
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,340
And that's a big part of any Wotan band is the audio recorder.

441
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,960
Because it should be closest to the speaker I'm on.

442
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,140
I think it's on the sound booth.

443
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,540
It may be better there. It may be safer. It will certainly be cleaner.

444
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,900
The recorders will be much cleaner the farther they are from the doctors.

445
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,920
Because, you know, it's surgery. There's blood.

446
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,940
Stitches pop open. Gross black stuff comes out.

447
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,600
Did you cut your belly open again?

448
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,740
Are we going to do a best song again?

449
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,760
Did you cut your belly open again and show you the black stuff?

450
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:25,100
Well, I was just saying you don't want to get your tape recorder too close to where the doctors are operating.

451
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,440
Because you can actually destroy the sensitive blood cells.

452
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,960
You can get the black stuff on it. The ink core.

453
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,900
The ink core from the patient.

454
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,440
The ink core.

455
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,600
The spittle of the doctors.

456
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,320
Dr. Howe has a name for that ink core.

457
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,620
The black stuff.

458
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,360
The black stuff. Yeah, that black stuff you got in there.

459
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,560
Okay, so I'm going to go tune up my instrument a little more.

460
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,500
Keep talking.

461
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:50,580
I can?

462
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,760
Let's keep the audience vamping for a little more.

463
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Why did you get up and tell me that?

464
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,540
See, he's bossy. Isn't he bossy?

465
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,320
You're not the boss of me, Dr. Dobson.

466
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:01,440
You're not the boss of me, gentlemen.

467
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,400
He's not the boss.

468
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,320
Well, he actually sort of is.

469
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,760
He's the great.

470
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,760
He has on the best.

471
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,680
Loud!

472
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,960
He is black.

473
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,880
His body.

474
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,200
I'm going to go ahead and just rip this.

475
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,120
There's my bobcat.

476
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,480
I'm breaking my eardrum on that last one.

477
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Get these packages!

478
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,840
You don't need that eardrum. You didn't need that eardrum anyway, Dr. Drummond.

479
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,160
I've been doing fine with only half of one.

480
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,460
I think this is what happens.

481
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,740
Now, did you bring our playlist?

482
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,100
Yeah, yeah, here's the playlist.

483
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,260
Here's the playlist that we can play.

484
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,000
We need to play it.

485
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,960
Into the Word of God.

486
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,720
You mean that's where that song actually came from?

487
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,260
Yeah.

488
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,380
Well, I'll be.

489
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,040
I want to know if my face is on fire.

490
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,980
That's a question people ask themselves sometimes.

491
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Well, not everybody. Some people don't even bother to ask themselves, say,

492
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,260
is my face on fire by any chance?

493
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,920
And their friends have to tell them.

494
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,160
Yeah.

495
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,900
Your face is on fire!

496
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,060
A friend would tell.

497
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,500
Oh my God, thank you for telling me.

498
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,200
A good friend would blow it out.

499
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,660
Would blow on your face so hard that it would extinguish the fire.

500
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,240
Would you tell me if my face was on fire?

501
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,500
Would you tell me if my face was on fire?

502
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,100
Dude, your face is on fire!

503
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,160
You slam it in the paint and quit putting it out or you'll hurt yourself.

504
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,240
Oh man, thanks for telling me.

505
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,720
I didn't realize my face was on fire until you mentioned that.

506
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,600
God, if I could have burned half my face off you, you're a real friend.

507
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,840
You told me my face was on fire!

508
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,600
Yeah.

509
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,900
I can't wait until we get to this.

510
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,640
Louie Louie.

511
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,900
Louie Louie, Louie Louie.

512
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,960
Louie Louie.

513
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,200
Yeah, okay. Let's do that.

514
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,800
You know the big tails in the background?

515
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,100
Louie Louie.

516
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,540
Louie Louie.

517
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,540


518
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,540


519
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,140
That sounds like Louie Louie to me.

520
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,460
That sounds exactly like Louie Louie.

521
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,360
Louie Louie.

522
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,760
Listen to that.

523
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,060
Louie Louie.

524
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,060


525
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:50,580
Louie Louie.

526
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,100
Louie Louie.

527
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,620
Are you a girl or a girl?

528
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:53,760
I'm a girl.

529
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,280
Louie Louie.

530
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,820
Louie Louie.

531
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,000
Are you a girl or a girl?

532
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,940
I'm a girl.

533
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,140
Louie Louie.

534
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,800
Louie Louie.

535
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,480
Louie Louie.

536
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,720
Are you a girl or a girl?

537
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,340
I'm a girl.

538
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,720
Louie Louie.

539
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,700
I didn't know.

540
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,260
I didn't know.

541
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,740
I wanted to say better.

542
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,520
But the sign said,

543
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,920
I see the goat woman.

544
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,140
And I did it.

545
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,400
I paid my 50 cents and I saw her there she was.

546
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,520
Louie Louie.

547
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,720
Dancing across the stage.

548
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,740
With the other girls.

549
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,460
And she looked so beautiful.

550
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,080
And she looked so beautiful.

551
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,580
And she looked so beautiful.

552
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,980
And her beard smelled.

553
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,820
And her beard smelled.

554
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,660
And her beard smelled.

555
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,120
And her udders.

556
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,400
Those distended udders.

557
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,800
Her udders.

558
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,060
Louie Louie.

559
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,000
Louie Louie.

560
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,340
She left her pellets.

561
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,780
Those little pellets.

562
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,320
All over the rug.

563
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,460
And the most beautiful of all.

564
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,120
She left behind on the stage.

565
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
As she danced.

566
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,060
Tiny pellets.

567
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,620
And I knew she was the girl for me.

568
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,460
Louie Louie.

569
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,580
Louie Louie.

570
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,840
Are you a girl or a girl?

571
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,960
Louie Louie.

572
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,640
Louie Louie.

573
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,260
Louie Louie.

574
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,840
Are you a girl or a girl?

575
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,380
Are you a girl?

576
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,240
I love you so much.

577
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,320
Louie Louie.

578
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,200
Oh come back to me Louie Louie.

579
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:35,700
Oh come back to me Louie Louie.

580
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,440
She ran away back to the fairgrounds.

581
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,160
She said she wanted to travel

582
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,740
to the fellow beach and the she was part of it.

583
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,260
But I just

584
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,440
love her and I miss her.

585
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,020
Oh come back to me Louie Louie.

586
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,300
Oh come back to me Louie Louie.

587
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,300


588
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,880
I want a ghost, why not ghost?

589
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,500
I am the ghost woman!

590
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,020
What the hell is this? Why not ghost?

591
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,480
Why not ghost?

592
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,640
Are you one of our girlfriends? Why not ghost?

593
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,540
Louie Louie, you are a girl and a ghost woman.

594
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,780
Yeah!

595
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,020
Louie Louie, you are a girl and a ghost woman.

596
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:20,760
No!

597
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,540
The song is almost over. The song is almost over now.

598
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,220
Okay, we have to change songs now.

599
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,900
That was Louie Louie, Are You A Girl And A Ghost Woman.

600
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,140
Did you ever sing that in any of those Louie Louie marathons where they play every other song?

601
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,760
Louie Louie, oh baby.

602
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,640
You know, the big bands take a break every so often.

603
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,340
We gotta go.

604
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,180
We gotta go.

605
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,840
Where did my recorder end up?

606
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,620
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

607
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,600
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

608
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:13,320
All my basic animal instincts were enlarged and inflamed.

609
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,200
Power felt as if it were bursting from every pore.

610
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,480
I gloried in my strength and ferocity.

611
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,740
Modern man was completely subjugated,

612
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,120
leaving only the irresistible instinct of survival

613
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,860
and the hungry urge to kill.

614
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,140
I was finally skinned,

615
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,840
I was goin' to jail,

616
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,440
Just so they would kick my ass.

617
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,600
IHyner.co..

618
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,780
I say pret reception.

619
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,700
That's as deep as ideals can be.

620
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,500
Merございます.

621
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,740
guitar solo

622
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,860
guitar solo

623
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,060
guitar solo

624
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,620
guitar solo

625
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,680
guitar solo

626
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,320
guitar solo

627
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,100
guitar solo

628
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,480
guitar solo

629
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,580
guitar solo

630
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:11,580


631
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:11,920
guitar solo

632
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,340
guitar solo

633
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:12,480
guitar solo

634
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,380
guitar solo

635
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:13,480
guitar solo

636
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,860
guitar solo

637
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,760
A fine instrumental by Six Fisted Tales of Connie, especially Reverend Angry Larry.

638
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,480
A tune I decided to call Drive-In Love.

639
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:29,360
The monster movie clips in this show, by the way, are from the 1953 movie The Neanderthal Man.

640
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,040
Between those clips and the music, what do you think you were hearing in a new Amino Acids album?

641
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:42,720
And speaking of new albums, there is another collection of Subgenius music out on Bandcamp.com.

642
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,700
Bob's songs number 8, Orally Transmitted Diseases.

643
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,240
You can find the link on Subgenius.com very easily.

644
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,480
It's the result of 10 songs.

645
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,520
10 years of stored up music by dozens of different Subgenius bands.

646
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:04,520
Most of it does not sound like the completely improvised and off-the-cuff spontaneous performances like you get with Six Fisted Tales.

647
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,240
Such as this unexpected version of Blitzkrieg Bob.

648
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,520
Blitzkrieg Bob

649
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,860
Blitzkrieg Bob

650
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,500
Blitzkrieg Bob

651
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:19,800
Blitzkrieg Bob

652
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,180
Blitzkrieg Bob

653
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,440
Blitzkrieg Bob

654
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:22,820
Blitzkrieg Bob

655
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
Blitzkrieg Bob

656
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,200
Blitzkrieg Bob

657
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,220
Blitzkrieg Bob

658
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,600
Blitzkrieg Bob

659
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,960
Blitzkrieg Bob

660
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,720
Blitzkrieg Bob

661
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,220
Blitzkrieg Bob

662
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,220


663
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,220


664
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,260
Blitzkrieg

665
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,240
Blitzkrieg Bob

666
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,300
Blitzkrieg Bob

667
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,300


668
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,680
Blitzkrieg Bob

669
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:45,680


670
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:45,680


671
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:45,680


672
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,080
Blitzkrieg

673
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,140
Blitzkrieg

674
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,540
Blitzkrieg

675
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:49,860
Blitzkrieg

676
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,440
Blitzkrieg

677
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,780
Oh, self-centered lummox.

678
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,280
Everything you do interests me.

679
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,440
Everything you'll ever do interests me for the rest of our lives.

680
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,260
If you can't trust me, who can you trust?

681
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,360
I won't be laughed at anymore.

682
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,220
I would never laugh at you, darling.

683
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,200
Who would ever laugh?

684
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,340
They laughed.

685
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,820
They?

686
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,180
Me, that pack of thick-headed, egotistical stuffed shirts at the Naturist Club.

687
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,280
Lunacy, eh?

688
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,700
Long-exploded theories, eh?

689
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,460
A lot they know in their stupid obstinacy,

690
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,860
in their peevishness of mind and soul.

691
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,600
It's here, I tell you. All here.

692
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,880
After all this work, I've done it.

693
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,140
I know I have.

694
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,980
What? Done what?

695
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,380
What? Cliff, what is it?

696
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,640
The embodiment of my theories of memory stimulation.

697
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,900
The reactivation of the dormant cells of the mind of man.

698
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,440
Dormant cells?

699
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,120
Man is not of himself.

700
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,460
He's made of everything that has gone before.

701
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,800
He's part of every ancestor he ever had back to the beginnings of his human intelligence.

702
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,740
They derided me, those gentlemen at the club.

703
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,720
They scoffed.

704
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,820
I felt, why? At least couldn't they have admitted the possibility I was right?

705
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,580
Let's just take care of tomorrow.

706
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:25,700
Let's do it.

707
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,300
No tomorrow.

708
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,100
No tomorrow.

709
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,700
Let's take care of tomorrow, baby.

710
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,300
Let's do it tomorrow.

711
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,680
No tomorrow.

712
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,700
No tomorrow.

713
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,000
There is no tomorrow

714
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,160
There is no tomorrow

715
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,440
For you, for you, for you, for you

716
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,260
Cause baby

717
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,200
There is no tomorrow

718
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,100
There is no tomorrow

719
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:20,300
For you, for you, for you, for you

720
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,400
For you, for you, for you, for you

721
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,100
Man has lost nothing of his emotions from the dawn of his history.

722
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,200
He's lost nothing of his greed, his fury, his savagery, his jungle rapacity.

723
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,620
Why not his physical personality?

724
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,560
All right.

725
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,660
You deny me too.

726
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,620
I can see it in your eyes.

727
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,440
They put it into words, but you're thinking it.

728
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,460
Cliff, please.

729
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,080
There's no way.

730
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,080


731
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,860
You need to get some.

732
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,160
I didn't ask you to come here.

733
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:16,860
I know, but...

734
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,900
Please do me the favor by leaving.

735
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:18,440
Cliff, please.

736
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,180
Get out, I say.

737
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,620
You're no better than the rest of them.

738
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,020
You're nothing but a vacuum of ego.

739
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,920
Swelling, ready to burst.

740
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,460
Thinking your own empty desires to be all that there is in life.

741
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,740
But there are more important things than your puny adoration of self.

742
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,120
Ah!

743
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:37,520
Ah!

744
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:38,860
Ah!

745
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,220
Ah!

746
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:41,400


747
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:41,620


748
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:42,620
Ah!

749
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:42,760


750
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:42,880
Ah!

751
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:42,940
Ah!

752
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,040
Ah!

753
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,420
Ah!

754
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420


755
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,440
Ah!

756
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:43,740
Ah!

757
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:43,760
Ah!

758
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:43,800
Ah!

759
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,000
Ah!

760
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,000


761
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,080
Ah!

762
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,080


763
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,080


764
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,080


765
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,080


766
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,080


767
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,080


768
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,080


769
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,520
Ah!

770
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,000
Ah!

771
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,640
Ah!

772
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:55,640


773
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,260
Hey, hi.

774
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,440
Hey, hi.

775
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:57,800
Hi, hi.

776
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,040
Woo!

777
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,460
Ah!

778
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,140
Ah!

779
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:05,840
Ah!

780
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,560
Ah!

781
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,560
Ah!

782
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,200
Ah!

783
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:09,600
Ah!

784
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:09,980
Ah!

785
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,200
Ah!

786
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,580
Ah!

787
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:10,860
Ah!

788
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:10,980


789
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:10,980


790
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,160
Ah!

791
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:11,400
Ah!

792
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,000
Ah!

793
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,060


794
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,060


795
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,060


796
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,060


797
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,060


798
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,060


799
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:26,900
Thank you.

800
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:53,560
Thank you.

801
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,140
Thank you.

802
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,460
Thank you.

803
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,140
Thank you.

804
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,660
Thank you.

805
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,820
Thank you.

806
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,520
Thank you.

807
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,320
Thank you.

808
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:44,580
Thank you.

809
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,880
Thank you.

810
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,640
Thank you.

811
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,160
Thank you.

812
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,240
Thank you.

813
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,780
I don't know.

814
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,560
Like a couple of months now,

815
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,160
I've had David Bowie stuck in my head

816
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,900
and it's like infinite loop,

817
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,620
which I initially want to blame

818
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,240
on the Guardians of the Galaxy movie

819
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,560
and Daydream.

820
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,100
But like,

821
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,000
I had to keep listening to Bowie.

822
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,640
And so I mentioned to Stang in passing

823
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,900
that I was considering doing a particular Bowie tune.

824
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,540
And Stang says to me,

825
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,100
you know, Princess Wee

826
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,380
is the world's biggest Bowie fan.

827
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,420
Well, then it turns out

828
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,020
that Robin is also

829
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,400
the world's biggest Bowie fan.

830
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,620
So, there is a song by Bowie

831
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,040
that many of you have probably heard

832
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,480
that when you really listen to the lyrics,

833
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,580
it's clear.

834
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,500
There's only one person

835
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,480
this song could possibly ever be about.

836
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,280
And that's Bob.

837
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,020
So, without further ado,

838
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,200
Man Who Sold the World.

839
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,820
Man Who Sold the World

840
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,860
I spoke into his eyes

841
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,480
I thought you'd die alone

842
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,060
A long, long time ago

843
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,900
Oh no, not me

844
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,640
We never lost control

845
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,540
Your face to face

846
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,100
With a man who sold the world

847
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,000
I laughed and shook his hand

848
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,640
I made my way back home

849
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,900
I searched for a foreign land

850
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,440
For years and years I roamed

851
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,400
I gazed and gazed instead

852
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,480
At all the millions there

853
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,320
We must have had a love

854
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,380
A love that was so strong

855
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,120
A love that no one heard

856
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,460
It's what it seems

857
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,000
A love that had shown

858
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,000


859
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,200
It's a trертure

860
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:47,660
It's not the way

861
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,860
It's a love that last People recently say

862
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:52,860


863
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,320
Who's killed these short-lived guys

864
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:53,320


865
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,560
That hope

866
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:54,640
Chosen to repeat

867
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,840
To honor

868
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,360
Another life

869
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:09,360


870
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:27,200
Who knows, not me, we never lost control Your face took space with a man who sold the world

871
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,140
La la la la ...

872
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,220
All right.

873
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,280
Praise Bob.

874
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:31,180

877
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,180
He took my frog!

878
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,140
That bastard took my frog!

879
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:51,760
Bob!

880
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,960
He took it!

881
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,060
He took it!

882
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,420
He took my frog!

883
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:11,220
So I cried, I cried, I cried.

884
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,160
Bob!

885
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,820
He took my frog!

886
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,840
Bob!

887
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,940
He took it!

888
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,900
He took it!

889
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,540
He took my frog!

890
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:39,780
Bob took my frog!

891
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,500
What can I do man, what can I do?

892
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,100
You see, it's Bob, and Bob took my frog!

893
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,060
Bob!

894
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,060
He took my frog!

895

Bob!

896
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,540
He took it!
