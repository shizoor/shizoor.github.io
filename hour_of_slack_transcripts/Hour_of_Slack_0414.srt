1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
And welcome to the show with the squeaky chair.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,840
Ah, yes.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,680
But we don't need that spooky music yet.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,860
No.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,620
Because it's a light-hearted show tonight.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,140
We're going to be talking about hell and death and rebirth and so forth.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,400
Because, well, number one, friends, I should say,

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,320
welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,880
Our of Slack.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,960
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,880
Praise that man, Bob.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,320
And we didn't really have time to edit tapes tonight.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,980
I could just play music, but anything I picked you'd think was too normal and old-timey.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,100
And to play a lot of subgenius tapes, I have to pre-screen them first, you know.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,740
And that usually takes up about half of my Sunday.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,580
It's my preacher's job.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,740
And that's fine. I love doing it.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,560
And it's a good break from the pressures of working on this book.

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,760
More book, young lady?

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,600
Yeah, this book we're trying to finish a year late.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,940
Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon.

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,100
But last week, last week, friends.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,200
No, I've got to put the scary music back on.

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,300
Last week, Simon and Schuster called.

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,220
The publisher's my editor.

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,660
And she said that I have to have the text totally finished,

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,980
chopped down and proofread in 30 days.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,720
30 days, my friends.

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,860
30 days, my friends.

30
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,400
And sentenced me to heavy begging for 30 days.

31
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,440
30 days.

32
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,740
There was a time when I did believe that I could recall every day I'd lived.

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,500
But then that joyride became a landslide and I got buried alive in here.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,240
I used to walk.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,280


36
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,960
I used to wake up.

37
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,620
Angels each morning.

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,580
Time it was nothing.

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,160
I'd ever want to kill.

40
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:13,000
But now the first day of every month's just another paycheck and a bunch of bills.

41
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,920
For 30 days, I am a prisoner.

42
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,860
In 30 days, I'm an escapee.

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,760
For I shall tunnel out of all this trouble.

44
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,400
I shall be free in 30 days.

45
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,560
For of a better, better life.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,360
Well, it's been a bad month, my friend unfortunately.

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,140
Last month was not so hot either.

48
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,860
The wind got knocked out of my life.

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,820
It wont go in my face.

50
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,580
I just want to breathe!

51
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,380
yeah, yeah, kinda crazy hot...

52
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,380
Yeah!

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,280
I gotbin' some cigarettes.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,280


55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,280


56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,520
God created the earth and heaven

57
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,240
In only seven days they say

58
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,400
And on that seventh day he rested

59
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,900
Oh, but I heard it another way

60
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,000
I heard that he got drunk and lonely

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,580
Created trouble left out alone

62
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,960
In thirty days he shoots out the full moon

63
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,560
Just to remind us we're on our own

64
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,340
For thirty days past September

65
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,020
And I believe

66
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,220
That he's got the power

67
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,220


68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,100
A day or two

69
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,300
For lots of mystery

70
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,980
I shall remember

71
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,860
Without a clue

72
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,940
Thirty days

73
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,140
Lots of mystery

74
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,080
I shall remember

75
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,780
For thirty days

76
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,860
Thirty days

77
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,900
Thirty days

78
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,720
Thirty days

79
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,460
Thirty days

80
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,520
Thirty days

82
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,620
Thirty days

83
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,680
Thirty days

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,400
Thirty days

85
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Now all I think about at all

86
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,260
Is thirty days

87
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,120
Thirty days

88
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,900
30 days, 30 days, 30 days

89
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,020
I'm gonna think about it all for 30 days

90
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,720
30 days, 30 days, 30 days

91
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:49,040
Oh yes, The Harvest, dear friends.

92
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,180
And that, well that was The Rainmakers.

93
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,080
Love that band, The Rainmakers.

94
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,620
And that's how I felt all week.

95
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,300
So, starting yesterday, I went to hell

96
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,940
and decided to finish the hell chapter by Tuesday night.

97
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,360
This Tuesday night, so that I can whack the UFOs chapter

98
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,920
together by Thursday and then the epistles and appendix

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,060
and then I'll have three weeks to finish the rewrites and touch-ups

100
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,960
of the other 400 pages that will take them back down to 200 pages.

101
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,820
Ah yes, and actually,

102
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,760
I got my...

103
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,740
most of that hell chapter done since yesterday.

104
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,600
So, guess what you're stuck with, friends?

105
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,060
I'm not gonna read the whole night.

106
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,220
I did manage to find some remarkably apropos bits of tape without even looking too hard.

107
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,840
Thanks, Will, for helping.

108
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,260
But let us read here.

109
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,080
This is, shall be, this perfect time to read this particular material

110
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,800
because a lot of it was originally written for the spoken word, preacher material.

111
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,900
Oh, and has not yet...

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,700
been aloftyized, shall we say.

113
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:06,460
It has not been turned into the written subgenius form whereby you use a thesaurus and add big words and remove apostrophes.

114
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,380
But it is chapter nine,

115
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,380
heaven and hell, the realms of death and the before life,

116
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,380
and hints on living like there's no tomorrow.

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,560
This, by the way, folks, is based on extrapolations and direct revelations from the incomplete,

118
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,940
a Dobbs Inferno manuscript translated from the original tongue of the dead,

119
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:43,460
dictated by the tormented earthbound lower half of the spirit of J. R. Bob Dobbs through trance medium X.

120
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:55,660
The music, by the way, in the background right now is the great Reverend Dr. Jay Condom on his Zombo Frothland album.

121
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,100
on his Zombo Frothland album.

122
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,100


123
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,000
And, uh, the music to pee by, I can't remember what the exact title of it is,

124
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,060
is in your catalog, okay?

125
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,540
And, of course, every chapter we start off with quotes,

126
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,900
alofty type quotes and apropos things that, that, uh,

127
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,260
and there's always too many of them. I have to cut most of these.

128
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,100
In fact, most of what you'll be, a lot of what you'll be hearing will be changed by the time it comes out in fall 94.

129
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,460
Yes, the fall 94 catalog.

130
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,700
That's right, Virgil, said Dobbs,

131
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,120
loosening his collar.

132
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,060
It is getting rather hot in here.

133
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,560
And as Dr. Kataydin Lagume, the evil Dr. Lagume, said,

134
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,680
the best way to buy your way into heaven using,

135
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,240
the best, no, let me take two.

136
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,520
The best thing to do is buy your way into heaven using somebody else's soul,

137
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,060
and buy your way out using somebody else's soul,

138
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,400
and keep your own in your pocket at all times.

139
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,880
Uh, and as the great Reverend Sheldon DeWare said,

140
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,760
the difference between heaven and hell is which end of the pitchfork you're on.

141
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,740
Yeah, yep, yep.

142
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,600
And, uh, as Bob said in his diary at age 15,

143
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:24,040
I choose to believe in an afterlife only because it is too horrible to believe that such a cool stud as myself could be allowed to disappear from the universe.

144
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,600
And he also said,

145
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,920
and this line was printing out just when my daughter's guest was looking at the computer.

146
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,560
Bob said,

147
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,780
I walked into hell the minute I stepped out of my ma's, uh, ma, we'll just say ma, I guess.

148
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,760
To hell and back, death, rebirth, and the before life.

149
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,320
It could happen any time, friend, any time.

150
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,580
Just walking in the garden, you could suddenly die.

151
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,400
A branch might crack overhead and fall straight down, tip first,

152
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,440
spear in the top of your head exactly, all the way down into your ribcage,

153
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,100
and destroyin' so much of your brain so suddenly that you'd never know what hit ya.

154
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,900
And you'd think you were still walking down that trail,

155
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,560
and you'd hear a noise and turn and see your friend cryin' over your own impaled body.

156
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,900
And that's when you'd realize that you were a, a ghost.

157
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,260
Or, a meteor could, uh, plunge from space and crush you.

158
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,660
Now! Right now! Right now! Would you be ready?

159
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,380
Would you be ready?

160
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,420
Be ready, my friend, if it happened the instant you finish hearing this sentence.

161
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,320
Oh, but don't worry about the death of the body.

162
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,120
Leaving the meat shell is roughly the equivalent of taking off your shoes.

163
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,800
But you're not supposed to really know that.

164
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,700
Uh, from the grand evolutionary point of view, it would greatly impede the survival of the species

165
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,580
if we all knew we could just jump off a bridge

166
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,800
and suddenly be beautiful, immortal souls free of debt

167
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,500
in a wonderful heaven of telepathy and love and infinite joy.

168
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,180
And yet we've all heard stories from people who were clinically dead

169
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,960
and had these, uh, near-death, out-of-the-body experiences

170
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,000
just before they were resuscitated on a hospital table.

171
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,660
And in most cases, they entered a tunnel of light,

172
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,560
leading to the shades of their deceased loved ones.

173
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,980
And a great light of love at the center of the universe.

174
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,800
A few felt the flames of hell licking at them.

175
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,080
Now, both of these lovely afterlives glimpsed during temporary death are real,

176
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,140
but are designed only for those who are already fated to return to life and report back.

177
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,780
Oh, by the way, this footnote here says that another misleading phenomenon used to prove an afterlife

178
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,880
are the so-called phone calls from the dead and spirit voices at seances.

179
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,900
And the deal is that the dead are allowed to make one telephone call,

180
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,400
and only one, after they've passed through the gates of the hereafter.

181
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,700
But anyway, these, uh, those particular kinds of afterlives

182
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,080
that people come back from the dead having glimpsed,

183
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,700
those are merely a ruse, a red herring, a hallucination,

184
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,660
programmed into our genetic structure to throw us off the scent.

185
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,760
Oh, whoa, don't you know?

186
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,760
A full-tan implanted mental movie projector is triggered at the time of death

187
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,180
to show this racial acid trip,

188
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
so that the human race will always be hearing fairly plausible stories

189
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,580
suggesting some sort of god and devil.

190
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,680
But it's strictly for propaganda purposes.

191
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,720
It's not even put there as a kindness.

192
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,680
It's as a rollercoaster ride, as a reward,

193
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,260
after all the tedious rigamarole of living and the usual pain

194
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,880
of dying.

195
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,760
What you find out too late, just as you're nearing that white light,

196
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,440
is that it is really the headlights of an etheric Mack truck

197
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,860
bearing down on you at 90 miles an hour.

198
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,820
And it's the last second before the ultra-dimensional truck hits you

199
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,520
that makes the gods laugh the hardest,

200
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,220
the minute you suddenly realize that you've been tricked

201
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,160
and are about to be killed again.

202
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,660
And that's what happens if you aren't resurrected pretty quick.

203
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,620
Each time that truck smashes you,

204
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,220
you're reborn with amnesia,

205
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,860
again floating towards that bright oncoming light.

206
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,800
And every time you end up remembering what that light really is,

207
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,820
an instant too late.

208
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,960
Why this cruel, elaborate trick on poor, pathetic dead folks?

209
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,040
It's because God isn't trying to create something.

210
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,140
He's trying to recreate nothing.

211
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,140
Even God doesn't know where everything came from,

212
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,680
or how to get rid of it.

213
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Ah, just kidding.

214
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,600
Friends, Bob wouldn't let God do that to you.

215
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,600
In reality, every time you fully die,

216
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,380
you get to go from one universe to another.

217
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,800
Let me find some lovely reincarnation-type music.

218
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,720
There.

219
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,380
Yes, you go from one universe to another.

220
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,380
They start you off, however, in the before life,

221
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,660
which is like eternal life.

222
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:18,960
You go from one universe to another,

223
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,200
and you're born into a new, original paradise,

224
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,680
to kind of get you off on the right foot.

225
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,560
And then all of a sudden,

226
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,320
you lose your memory and are born of woman

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,600
onto this earthly plane.

228
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,400
Then, when you get old and die here,

229
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,940
you pass on to one of the etheric universes next door.

230
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,260
Bob once spoke of driving past the slag heaps

231
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,840
of Midlothian, Texas,

232
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,340
where the conspiracy melts down the fossilized metal skeletons

233
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,500
of old cars to make into new ones,

234
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,920
thence themselves to die and be smelted down again.

235
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,840
He said that this is exactly how we experience,

236
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,340
endlessly experience,

237
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,400
the eternal conveyor belt of karma,

238
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,660
the great wheelbarrow of humiliation

239
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,220
that we call existence.

240
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,560
As Bob said in,

241
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,380
Transmission 47,

242
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,780
in my father's midway are many bumper car rides.

243
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,200
And the before life for subgeniuses

244
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,480
is like a huge carnival.

245
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,640
You'll end up on many rides for fleeting eternities.

246
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,780
One may be the roller coaster of alternating fear and joy.

247
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,940
The next might be the tunnel of love.

248
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,200
Hell is the ultimate spook house.

249
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,220
Indeed,

250
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,420
there are so many multiple death realities

251
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,700
that there's even one where you're really dead

252
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,720
and nothing happens and you don't exist.

253
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,480
But most people think of life and death

254
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,360
as only two states of being.

255
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,640
The only two states of being.

256
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,040
Actually,

257
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,520
they are very small straws in a very large haystack.

258
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,040
This haystack of death lives isn't an infinite one, though.

259
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,200
There is a judgment day or splice in time.

260
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,940
That serves as both the beginning and end

261
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,900
of a big repeating loop of all cause and effect.

262
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,700
And beyond all these lives and alternate universes,

263
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,180
the whole of creation is actually a vast pipe

264
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,740
balanced on the back of a huge cosmic horned toad.

265
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,940
And beneath that,

266
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,280
an all-encompassing fiddler crab.

267
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,620
Nothing itself does not exist after that.

268
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,200
But there's enough afterlives, however,

269
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,640
that you'll get the afterlife that you really want.

270
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,140
And that's why so many preachers

271
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,640
can't quit talking about hell.

272
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,320
They try to get you all mixed up between heaven and hell.

273
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,060
The record reveals that many times

274
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,660
the enemy of your soul has sorely tempted you, my child,

275
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,420
given you every opportunity to quit,

276
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,520
had you desired to do so.

277
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,200
But because you have been faithful in prayer,

278
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,400
faithful in the reading of the word,

279
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,720
and because you have not forsaken the house of God,

280
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,780
you have overcome the tempter

281
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,060
and gained the crown of eternal life.

282
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,620
For this I say,

283
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,320
well done, thou good and faithful servant.

284
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,160
Enter thou into the joys of thy Lord.

285
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,300
Praise God. I made it. I finally made it.

286
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,700
Did you hear? I finally made it. Glory to God.

287
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,940
Oh, I thank you, Lord, for thy mercy.

288
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,940
I thank you, Lord. Blessed be thy name.

289
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,100
Oh, I love you, Jesus. I thank you, Lord.

290
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,020
Hallelujah. Glory to God.

291
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,280
I made it. I made it.

292
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,200
Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you, Lord.

293
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,620
Hallelujah.

294
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,020
The backslider will be there in that judgment.

295
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,640
Though Christianity for centuries has operated on the thought

296
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,620
that men could walk in and out with God,

297
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,180
that they could turn back to the world and back to their sins,

298
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,760
then come back to God without any loss,

299
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,700
has led many to speculate in the most frightening way,

300
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,200
but the Bible said,

301
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,560
if the righteous man turn from his righteousness,

302
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,020
then all of his righteousness shall be forgotten.

303
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,880
Yes, sir. The backslider will be there in the judgment.

304
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,440
Call the next defendant.

305
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,600
Dana Dean to the bar.

306
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,460
Dana Dean, the record shows that in the year of your Lord, 1959,

307
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,300
you received the glorious experience of salvation.

308
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,720
Almighty God, King of kings and Lord of lords,

309
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,760
indeed, it was a glorious experience.

310
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,220
The record goes on to reveal that for many years,

311
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,160
you were a faithful servant, performing your duties well.

312
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,100
Because of your faithfulness in witnessing,

313
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,120
many were brought into the glorious light of the gospel,

314
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,460
and many souls were added to the kingdom.

315
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,500
Because of your giving,

316
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,720
my preachers were able to circle the globe

317
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
with the message of salvation.

318
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,380
Sir, I gave back only part of that which was given unto me.

319
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,180
Were the records to stop here, my son,

320
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,480
it would indeed be a wonderful story.

321
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,280
But these faithful records are very careful to point out

322
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,140
the darkest day in your life.

323
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,880
It is stated here that in the year of your Lord, 1973,

324
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,020
you turned your back upon your God

325
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,960
and once more began to walk in your own way.

326
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,520
But, sir, I've come back.

327
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,320
I've come back, sir.

328
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,540
I'm closer now than I've ever been before.

329
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,920
I've come back, sir. My God, I've come back.

330
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,220
Yes, the record shows that in the fourth watch of your life,

331
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,060
you returned to the fold.

332
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,560
What an awful price you must pay for your foolishness.

333
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,920
Because you turned back, you have lost your reward.

334
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,280
You shall enter heaven as a servant

335
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,400
without a single soul to your credit.

336
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,860
It's unfair. It's so unfair.

337
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,180
I've worked so hard for the kingdom all these years.

338
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,380
It's unfair that I should lose all my credits now.

339
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,760
You knew all of this before you backslid.

340
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,340
Show him his record.

341
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,180
January 3, 1973.

342
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,700
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness

343
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
and commiteth iniquity

344
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,080
and doeth according to all the abominations

345
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,280
that the wicked man doeth, shall he live?

346
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,160
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned.

347
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,140
In his trespass that he hath trespassed

348
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,560
and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.

349
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,700
This simply means that if you backslide

350
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,440
and turn away from God,

351
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,720
all the rewards that you've accumulated shall be lost.

352
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,380
I just don't understand how this could happen to me.

353
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,080
August 21, 1973.

354
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,940
You mean you aren't going to church again today?

355
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,820
Babe, you don't bother me.

356
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,660
You know this is my only day off.

357
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,860
I don't have to live in church to be saved.

358
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Dana, if you aren't careful, you're going to miss out

359
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,220
with the Lord's

360
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,600
is an awful price to pay.

361
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:56,900
Oh.

362
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,940
Oh, my, what a fool.

363
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:02,900
Oh.

364
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,200
To think that I could turn my back on God

365
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,340
and make it on my own.

366
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,040
My God, what a fool I've been.

367
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,640
How foolish can a person be?

368
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,860
Sir, I hope you haven't been the fool I've been.

369
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,140
Good question.

370
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,460
My God, what a fool.

371
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,500
What a fool.

372
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,020
Yes, friends, the subgenius shall be at the judgment.

373
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,040
Yes, yes, yes.

374
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,840
You know, it's sad.

375
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,940
You know, by the way, so far we've just been talking about

376
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,640
the Christian hell and heaven.

377
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,160
We're going to be on that for a while.

378
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,520
But you graduate to the subgenius hell

379
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,340
and then to the subgenius heaven.

380
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,880
We ain't written that part yet.

381
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,480
But, you know, we're told by people that are sometimes in tears.

382
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,240
This happens when I'm talking about Bob on somebody else's talk show.

383
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,680
Their voices will be cracking with emotion

384
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,200
and they'll be saying,

385
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,620
you're going to go to hell if you keep up this subgenius church business.

386
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,500
And it's because they've been shaken up pretty bad,

387
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,560
possibly for the first time,

388
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,500
by we who dare to laugh at the great, bearded, all judging,

389
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,640
all non-forgiving, unlaughable.

390
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,800
The great unlaughable, my friends.

391
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,620
And the Christian hell,

392
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,920
does exist.

393
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,940
And it is the lowest rung of the ladder of the four lives.

394
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,380
They aren't lying about that.

395
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,440
What they don't tell you is that only Christians go there.

396
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,660
It's a rare subgenius that ends up in the Christian hell.

397
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,800
The hell law, the hell law, my friends,

398
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,420
states that hell is reserved for those who believe in it.

399
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,700
And the lowest level is for those who think that if they don't believe in it,

400
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,920
they'll go there.

401
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:59,360
Hell is God's revenge on those who insulted his intelligence.

402
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:07,100
Those vain and stupid enough to think God is as simple-minded and vengeful as they are.

403
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,620
God built hell only for Christians, Muslims, and others who believe in a devil.

404
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,000
The devil's only job, actually, is to pester them,

405
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,680
to milk out everything.

406
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,380
To make them believe in every drop of human faith and credence.

407
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,400
Satan, or Ahriman, or whatever,

408
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,980
is a very minor deity compared to Jehovah One,

409
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,240
and has been bested in sexual prowess,

410
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,160
if not in supernatural powers or demonic dominion,

411
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,240
by none less than Bob himself.

412
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,060
To any subgenius dumb enough to take him seriously,

413
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,260
the devil is at worst a figure of negative slack.

414
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:54,160
Satan does run hell, and it's a very busy place these days.

415
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,380
But as far as affecting earthly life,

416
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,860
Satan's responsibilities cover only Middle Eastern-based religions.

417
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,780
Jehovah One assigned the devil to create something that would really be hell on earth.

418
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,380
So he came up with the idea of Christianity,

419
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,500
which he then followed up with Islam.

420
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,480
Jehovah One said to Satan,

421
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,080
we'll just let your hell on earth run randomly

422
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,500
so the dupes will suffer and generate more pain for each other.

423
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,120
In the end, it won't matter whether they were good or bad in life,

424
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,440
we'll just divvy up the souls 50-50.

425
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,120
How's that?

426
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,140
Friends, you might say that Christians are to blame for Satanism.

427
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,860
If it weren't for Christians telling each other there's a devil,

428
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,320
nobody would believe in him.

429
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,540
And besides, for every satanic ritualistic killing,

430
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,460
a hundred babies are killed spur of the month.

431
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,220
And there's a moment by fanatic Christian nut parents

432
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,120
who thought the kid was crying because it was possessed by Satan.

433
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,440
The only reason anybody serves Satan is because some Christian told them

434
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,000
there was a Satan there to serve.

435
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,420
How about that?

436
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,080
However, there are eight circles in the Christian hell.

437
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,620
Dante's Inferno, however, is a hopelessly outdated work.

438
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,520
Hell is constantly being upgraded in pain configurations

439
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,380
to compensate for the ever-degenerating quality of life here on earth.

440
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,440
The types of sins required to damn a Christian to these varying levels of torment

441
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,480
are, however, surprisingly minor.

442
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,300
Here are some examples in ascending order of guiltiness and punishment.

443
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,200
The first level, the easiest level of hell, is for instance,

444
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,980
for people who said damn or ga.

445
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,340
The second level is for those who might have felt lust

446
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,700
in their hearts at one time.

447
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,820
The third level is for people who, for instance, forgot to say sir or ma'am.

448
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,240
Level four is for people who can't quote me John 6, 14

449
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,260
and don't know what brand Jesus Christ smoked.

450
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,040
Level number five is for people who opened their eyes during prayers in church.

451
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,680
And level six is for that guy that ripped you off.

452
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,200
Level seven is for murderers and rapists.

453
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,260
And level eight is reserved for members of, well, not members,

454
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:23,120
for subgeniuses who neglected to spend that $30 membership.

455
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,700
If you are still going down and not liberated,

456
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,860
I think I am.

457
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,120
meditate as follows.

458
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,580
Okay.

459
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,660
The sexual activities,

460
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,480
I like that.

461
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,940
the manipulation of machinery,

462
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,800
the mocking laughter, dashing sounds, and terrifying apparitions.

463
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,720
Indeed, all phenomena are in their nature illusions.

464
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,220
They look real to me.

465
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,640
However they may appear.

466
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,780
You mean like a dream?

467
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,120
In truth, they are unreal and fake.

468
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,380
They won't stay?

469
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,140
They are like dreams and apparitions, non-permanent, non-fixed.

470
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,040
They'll go away?

471
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,380
What advantage is there in being attached to them?

472
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,360
Well, I'm scared.

473
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,820
Or being afraid of them?

474
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,580
I don't know.

475
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,120
All these hallucinations of the mind.

476
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,420
I like hallucinations.

477
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,960
The mind itself does not exist.

478
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,600
Oh, no.

479
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,680
Therefore, why should they?

480
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,740
Well, they look real.

481
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,740
Only through taking these illusions for real will you wander around in this confused existence.

482
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,720
What are they?

483
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,420
All these are like dreams.

484
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,120
Yeah?

485
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,140
Like echoes.

486
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:25,920
Echoes, echoes, echoes.

487
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,100
Like cities of clouds.

488
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,040
Wow.

489
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,120
Like mirages.

490
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:29,800
Hmm.

491
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,440
Like mirrored forms.

492
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,160
What the?

493
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,240
Like phantasmagoria.

494
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,820
Is that what that is?

495
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,460
The moon seen in water.

496
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,720
What should I do?

497
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,800
Not real even for a moment.

498
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,340
Yeah?

499
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,640
By holding one pointedly to that train of thought.

500
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,180
Okay.

501
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,540
The belief that they are real are dissipated.

502
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,140
All right.

503
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,420
And liberation is attained.

504
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,380
What?

505
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,040
What?

506
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,800
What?

507
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:54,480
What?

508
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:54,980
What?

509
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,260
Fourth method.

510
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,860
Meditation on the void.

511
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,760
All substances are part of my own consciousness.

512
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,500
What?

513
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,680
This consciousness is vacuous, unborn, and unceasing.

514
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,220
What was that?

515
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,340
All substances are part of my own consciousness.

516
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,220
This consciousness is vacuous, unborn, and unceasing.

517
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,400
Hey, I think I heard this.

518
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,140
All substances are part of my own consciousness.

519
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,720
This consciousness is vacuous, unborn, and unceasing.

520
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,560
Hey, I did hear this.

521
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,440
Thus meditating, allow the mind to rest in the uncreated state.

522
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,380
Like the pouring of water into water.

523
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,340
Oh, I got a tingle.

524
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,420
The mind should be allowed its own easy mental posture.

525
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:40,960
Well?

526
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,980
In its natural unmodified condition.

527
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:44,660
Yeah?

528
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,160
Clear and vibrant.

529
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,460
Well, what should I do?

530
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,340
By maintaining this relaxed, uncreated state of mind.

531
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:51,760
Yeah?

532
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,420
Rebirth into routine game reality is sure to be prevented.

533
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:56,900
Okay.

534
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,120
Meditate on this until you are certainly free.

535
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,680
I want to be free.

536
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,340
I got it.

537
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,760
Oh, I should be governor after all.

538
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,140
Please mówi

539
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:18,000
Uh, my name is

540
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,020
crítico car Death upon death.

541
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,020


542
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,020


543
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,340
Three-channel TV

544
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,420
Life will never blink

545
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,360
Oh, I got a tingle

546
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,360


547
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,400
A różnych,ố

548
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:34,360
This consciousness is the faki

549
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,320
tape-flipping moment, if you know what I mean.

550
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:59,740
Yes, my friends, there is a particularly insidious section of hell called West Heck.

551
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,300
Philodrummond is an expert on West Heck.

552
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,660
Many lost souls are in Heck without knowing it.

553
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,320
It's a polite hell, a genteel hell.

554
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,060
They don't even tell you you're in Heck.

555
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,080
You could easily be living in Heck on Earth and think it was perfectly normal.

556
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,460
You still have to work a horrible day job,

557
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,400
to spend your whole eternity working a dull, pointless job

558
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,980
that doesn't mean a damn thing except money to pay for slightly less pain.

559
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,280
There's a special section.

560
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,360
There's a section of hell for each earthly profession in which one might fail,

561
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,100
including yours.

562
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,340
The only difference is that this time it's eternal torment.

563
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,520
Then you're not trying to satisfy paying customers, but paid demons.

564
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,720
Only after toiling for a week that lasts 1,000 years

565
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,920
do you earn the right to relax and go out on a date.

566
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,720
But then you're faced with sex in hell.

567
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,260
But then you're faced with sex in hell.

568
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:03,260


569
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,320
Which is a living nightmare.

570
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,460
Because in hell, you're judged by your looks.

571
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,000
If your looks don't conform to Miss Hell foldout of 1996,

572
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,120
well, you're going to have trouble getting dates.

573
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,660
And in hell, you get old, you age, your skin sags as the years go by,

574
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,100
and you're compelled to wear elaborate hairdos and makeup.

575
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,060
On top of that, the demons make such a big deal out of sex, both pro and con.

576
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,760
Half the time, you're so uptight about doing everything correctly,

577
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,300
you can't get your rocks off.

578
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,760
You go to all that trouble for kind of a halfway climax.

579
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,620
Wouldn't you hate to live in a world like that?

580
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,260
Wouldn't you do anything to get to heaven?

581
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,200
Even kill yourself?

582
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,940
But see, that's the difference.

583
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,480
In hell, you don't know if there's an afterlife, so you don't dare kill yourself.

584
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,560
In heaven, you know for sure that you're already in it, so you don't have to kill yourself.

585
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,120
There is a hell you can retire from,

586
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,020
but there's also one where they tell you you'll retire at age 50,

587
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,740
but you always get killed there, just by the sound of it.

588
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:02,740


589
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,880
You're gonna die before your 50th birthday,

590
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,920
and end up wading even deeper into the lake of fire.

591
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,420
Oh, you'll find out. You gonna find out, friend.

592
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,140
There ain't no water down there.

593
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,120
Ain't no water down there.

594
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,880
You can't get a drink, and you can't put out that fire.

595
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,100
There's never quite enough church air to breathe.

596
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,360
Oh, you take that church air for granted now.

597
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,120
You may not even know about it, but wait till it's gone, little Bobby.

598
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,900
You can never win. It's like playing against a computer.

599
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,620
It can't lose. It can't lose.

600
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,800
In fact, in one hell, in the tick hell,

601
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,320
you're like a little character in a video game,

602
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,100
forced to eternally machine gun the endless stream of ticks

603
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,460
crawling out at you from behind cactuses in a blistering desert.

604
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,180
And when the ticks die, they excrete a cactus and another tick.

605
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,280
You can kill lots of ticks. Yeah, you can score real high.

606
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,920
You can keep earning lifetimes.

607
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,960
But sooner or later, they're gonna get you.

608
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,080
They creep up on you. They creep up on you, boy.

609
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,080
It's just like here on Earth.

610
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,820
And to top it off, there is reincarnation.

611
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,640
There is reincarnation, friends.

612
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:19,600
Once you're in hell, oh yeah, you'll have plenty of lives in hell.

613
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,340
Facts about the before of life.

614
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,600
Some genius rebirth. You were, will be there.

615
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,980
It tends to end the scrutiny of the new Gnarni.

616
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,100
It tends to end the scrutiny of the new Gnarni.

617
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,320
The next to last book I'm gonna read to you is

618
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,320


619
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,320


620
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,320


621
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,320


622
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,860
Or, The Subgenius Book of the Living Dead.

623
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,220
Has been underway for the past 12 years.

624
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,800
Church doctors in the Dobstown vaults

625
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,660
have nearly completed their translation of this most holy book

626
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,060
in the Yeti Vita Trilogy.

627
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,420
These self-same doctors

628
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,620
inform us that many passages of this work

629
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,640
are directly attributable to the brave and enlightened Atlanteans.

630
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:00,400
long time subscribers to the stark fist will recall our last report on this uber sacred

631
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:09,360
tomb tone about six years ago number 22 volume 17 we published partying after death by dr. Siddhartha

632
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:19,840
me catharsis as you knew will know subgenius souls or mental essences are volatile brightly

633
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:26,160
colored and usually very fast when they care to be they go where they want and are hard for others

634
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:33,620
to control souls of normals however are bland looking pill like beans although in life subs

635
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:40,940
and norms are almost indistinguishable after death this is a hard mistake to make when a subgenius

636
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:48,460
dies the Nantes ins firsts from its meat prison its mass the sea careens in a pan galactic journey

637
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,820
lasting but a moment of time until the end of the world's last breath and the last breath of the

638
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:55,540
moment of our time it usually returns once to make sure it's really dead before moving on to the

639
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:03,960
before life due to a 10,000 year disinformation campaign by the calm a jaded stereotype of heaven

640
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:11,880
and hell is being pushed by the false churches in fact there's little difference between the two so

641
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,520
genie often commute between heaven and hell interestingly heaven is hotter than hell the

642
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,680
seven sons which he'd have

643
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,920
and make it many times harder than the molten gaseous temperature thresholds of brimstone

644
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:33,180
when a subgenius decides to live again he she is not alone each subgenius has a mental life twin

645
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:43,360
on the media plane this is a revelation of the power of the subgenius subgenius spiritual mastery

646
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:49,420
is not maintained without struggle the subgenius must be vigilant and must hold his abnormality

00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,560
gerontology animal

648
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,740

Los Angeles

655
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,880
Although they may be bland versions of other colors, the pink soul drifts aimlessly.

656
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,820
Although pinkster souls, also known as plugs, do tend to cluster.

657
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:41,940
The plugs are gathered up by cosmic agents, usually representing Jehovah One, who has the largest franchise in this area.

658
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,520
The plugs are sprinkled into vats.

659
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,740
The vats have an energy source which melts the plug shells, making them bond together.

660
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:56,780
As new plugs continue to collect above, the norm souls' shapes and colors blend until they resemble a lumpy stew.

661
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,060
Ultimately, the plugs form a clear slurry which drains from the vat.

662
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,040
This plasma can be used to form new souls.

663
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,200
Souls who have a chance to become new segeni.

664
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,240
However, the plasma is also formed during sex.

665
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,500
And the slur plus is often sold as a new segeni.

666
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:14,500


667
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,900
This slur plus is a spaceship fuel additive.

668
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:23,780
These hedgemen are known to have been styled as such a vat by agents for their master.

669
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:30,540
The vats themselves are said to be relics left by the elder gods, forged for unguessed motives.

670
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,620
Thus, normals cannot be said to have led past lives.

671
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,860
It was just normal.

672
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,480
I'm Pastor Buckley.

You can write at $1,400,000, Dallas, TX 75214.

675
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,620
Give me a dollar and I'll give you a packet of wild stuff.

676

And my County Law.

677
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,380
Thank you.

678
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,820
Thank you.

679
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,400
Thank you.

680
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,280
Thank you.

681
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,580
Thank you.

682
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,200
Thank you.

683
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,260
Thank you.

684
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,500
Thank you.

685
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,560
Thank you.

686
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,500
Thank you.

687
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,440
Thank you.

688
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,080
Thank you.

689
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,020
Thank you.

690
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,800
Hey, once they reach heaven,

691
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,480
then God's suddenly going to allow

692
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,540
his little herd of sheep to run wild?

693
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,400
You get all the joy

694
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,860
of the fundamentalist lifestyle.

695
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:55,860
Uh-huh.

696
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,420
With no hope of escape,

697
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,880
not even death.

698
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,420
Some heaven.

699
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,140
Little wonder Lucifer

700
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,500
got the hell out of there.

701
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,800
Bob believes in everyone's

702
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,140
God-forbidden right

703
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,960
to choose for themselves

704
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,020
the fate of their almighty soul.

705
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,400
Dobbs is recruiting lost souls

706
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:21,840
of every creed, the billions that fell between the cracks of good and evil, the neutrals

707
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,880
who just want for once to be left alone in the afterlife.

708
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:34,100
And friends, there's plenty of quality souls frying in hell just because they didn't want

709
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:42,680
to follow the goose-stepping guidelines of G-G-God, lashed and tortured forever for no

710
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,780
other reason than that they wanted to be free.

711
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:51,180
And if freedom's a sin, pray that we're all sinners.

712
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:58,840
I was praying last night when an angel broke the light, he said, I'm gonna have to put

713
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,180
you on hold for a time.

714
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:08,440
I said, hold like hell, let me talk to the boss, he said, sorry, super sinner, it's the

715
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,980
boss's day off.

716
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,120
And I realized then.

717
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:18,360
That the wages of sin was two bucks an hour and a working weekend.

718
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:26,600
I was ignoring the fee, he was lashed to the cross and cried, help me get this son of a

719
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,360
bitch off.

720
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:35,040
I said I would if I could, I can't so I won't, well I wouldn't want you messing your hair

721
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,440
up so don't.

722
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,600
And I realized then.

723
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,720
That the wages of sin.

724
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,000
Was all the lumber.

725
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,120
You can carry.

726
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,160
All the nails you can bend.

727
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,340
The wages of sin.

728
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,640
The reward of fear.

729
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,080
It's worry and a threat every second of the year.

730
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,220
And heaven is guilt.

731
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,320
No sex and no show.

732
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,760
That I'm not sure if I really wanna go.

733
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,800
You're gonna get what you deserve.

734
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,380
The wages of sin.

735
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,360
The price that you pay.

736
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,060
Is worry and a threat every second of the day.

737
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,240
The church and the state.

738
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,400
You're God.

739
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,520
and country kind

740
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,720
One gets your body

741
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,020
The other gets your mind

742
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,640
Mary, Mary Magdalene

743
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,280
How about a date?

744
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,420
You've been wasting your time

745
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,640
Staying up so late

746
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,600
Your boyfriend's dead

747
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,220
The word is you're a whore

748
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,260
Just about then

749
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,580
I heard a knock on the door

750
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,700
And I realized then

751
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,800
That the wages of sin

752
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Was a bad reputation

753
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,300
And too many friends

754
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,540
The wages of sin

755
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:19,940
The wages of sin

756
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,320
The wages of sin

757
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,780
The wages of sin

758
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,140
The wages of sin

759
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:37,520
The wages of sin

760
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:37,620
The wages of sin

761
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,920
The wages of sin

762
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,780
The wages of sin

763
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:40,780


764
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,480
uh

765
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,780
,

766
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,720
yes friends.

767
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:11,940
the Rainmakers once again performed that little piece of music.

768
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,480
And now we must unfortunately discuss,

769
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,600
well, it's one might say the scarier part of all this.

770
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:27,100
You know, the soul is the one part of us that the conspiracy hungers for the most.

771
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,760
And when you enter Wotan's bloodstream,

772
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,500
you have to deal with his antibodies.

773
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,060
Go into the spirit and you must deal with spirits.

774
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,740
And with the cannibalism of souls.

775
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:52,860
Some spirits, called theocrats, vampirize off other spirits

776
00:50:52,860 --> 00:51:00,040
and so live, quote unquote, live forever at the expense of their victims.

777
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,480
They obtain these victims by posing as the spirits.

778
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,040
They are then seen as gods and persuading the religious believers

779
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,040
to come to them voluntarily after death,

780
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:16,040
thinking that they are entering eternal bliss in heaven.

781
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:25,140
And by the way, this is all from a book called War in Heaven by Kyle Griffith.

782
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,240
And he continues to say, quote,

783
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,360
Many notorious tyrants, conquerors, evil religious leaders,

784
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,720
black magicians and criminals have become theocrats after death,

785
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,160
but so have some saints or benign geniuses.

786
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:45,880
Power corrupts, and the prospect of achieving immortality corrupts even more.

787
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,940
Many people with highly developed souls whose earthly lives were lived quite ethically

788
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,000
chose to become theocrats after death.

789
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:59,220
This has been especially true for people who were religiously devout,

790
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:04,620
then found out the horrible truth about their gods after death.

791
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,660
The theocrats enslave other spirits and provide psychic energy,

792
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,580
just as slaves or employees on earth provide physical labor.

793
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,700
The daily activities of a fundamentalist theocratic band organized in heaven

794
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,480
are similar to a church service as such sects hold them on earth,

795
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,480
except that they go on perpetually.

796
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,000
The theocrat in charge poses as the Lord God Jehovah,

797
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:37,560
the subordinate theocrats pose as Christ, various angels and apostles and so forth.

798
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,980
God quotes the same biblical passages and preaches the same sermons

799
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,920
as preachers in the same sect do on earth,

800
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,380
and the congregation joins in singing the same hymns.

801
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,960
The theocratic leaders then channel this collective psychic energy.

802
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,040
For instance, there are dead Christians who think they're in heaven,

803
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,800
sitting around the throne of Jehovah eternally singing his praises,

804
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:11,020
when they're really just his slaves, and possibly his dinner as well.

805
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:16,260
Now you understand the real significance of Holy Communion.

806
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,240
Ah, yeah.

807
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,300
The you.

808
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:37,280
A perfect sean it's N your Savior certainly.

809
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,820
I meant also forgive.

810
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,520
An idol.

811
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,940
How wonderful.

812
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:44,940


813
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,180
Jimmy and Shirmius.

814
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:49,180


815
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:49,340
the history of yourявor taking,

816
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,260
and that you're going to exact your life for a chance to vow anyway,

817
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,000
how beautiful is that?

818
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,560
now? No, child. It is too late. But you wouldn't send a person to hell who never had a chance,

819
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:15,180
would you? But you had an opportunity when you were seven years old. June 2nd, 1968.

820
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:24,880
June 2nd, 1968. Willie, you're too young. Willie, you're older. You have plenty of time.

821
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:36,240
But you saw how my parents wouldn't let me go. It's their fault that I'm lost. It's their fault.

822
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:42,560
Why wouldn't you let me go? There were other times that I have dealt with you,

823
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,460
but you would have none of it.

824
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,600
When was it that you dealt with me?

825
00:54:54,060 --> 00:55:01,460
December 18th, 1974. Betty, for as long as I've known Christ, I've tried to make him real to you.

826
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:07,440
When are you going to accept him and be saved? I don't know, Cindy. I don't want to hurt your

827
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,820
feelings, but religion just isn't my thing. There's plenty of time. I'm just not interested

828
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,420
right now.

829
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,600
Betty, one of these days you're going to stand before God, and you'll wish a thousand times you'd

830
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,740
taken the chance to accept him. But it'll be too late.

831
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:30,400
No, child. You are lost and there is no place found for you except the lake of fire,

832
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,720
prepared for the devil and his angels. Take her away.

833
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:43,880
No. No. No, I'm too young. I don't want to go. Mama! Daddy!

834
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:45,880
He hung me.

835
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,280
Evil.

836
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,640
The beat. The beat. The beat.

837
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,100
The evil.

838
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,480
The beat. The beat. The beat.

839
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,000
The beat. The beat. The evil.

840
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,440
The beat. The beat. The beat.

841
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,180
Why I believe that is because I know...

842
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:11,880
Subgenius hell. It's a cold, cold kind of hell.

843
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,060
Oh, cold.

844
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:21,220
Oh, I wish I could light this here pipe. They gave me all the frappy in the world.

845
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:30,900
And it's too cold to light this pipe. Oh, Bob, where are you now? Why did you leave me in the hands of me?

846
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:40,600
However, Bob will offer you eternal salvation or triple your money back.

847
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,140
Subgenius hell.

848
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:43,760
Subgenius hell.

849
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,160
Subgenius hell.

850
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,960
Tell me and let me see that post

851
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,020
quiet chicken.

852
00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:00,840
You, a dog from cold cool is Timville.

853
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,500
There's nothing to see here, baby.

854
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,920
I'll just come up.

855
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:07,920


856
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:07,920


857
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:07,920


858
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:07,920


859
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:07,920


860
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:11,620


861
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:13,560


862
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,060
Cold.

863
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,140
Easy.

864
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:15,840
Hello, yours.

865
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,180
Well, you're looking at a pretty damn long eternity.

866
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,760
Oh, by the way, here's that triple your money back.

867
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,020
It's, what, $60?

868
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,320
One for you, Smith, one for you, Jones.

869
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:39,120
And don't let this deter you from doing business with us again.

870
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:39,540
Yeah.

871
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,040
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

872
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,180
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

873
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,780
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

874
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:03,020
Bob, Post Office 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

875
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,520
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

876
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:09,520


877
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,040
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

878
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,780
Well, then, Dennis locked me in this little box.

879
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,040
I can't feel anything. I can't see anything.

880
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,920
It's totally black. I have no sensation in my hands.

881
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,720
I don't know if I'm moving or what.

882
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,260
I'm just in this little box.

883
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:39,520
I'm just in this little box.

884
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,800
He said I could talk to you.

885
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,720
He said you'd know what to do if you wanted to help me.

886
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,780
Oh, good, happy being, Wellman.

887
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:52,140
I promise I'll pay you all the royalties that I didn't tell you about.

888
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,660
And whatever you want. I mean, anything.

889
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,620
Tevas, you can have Tevas.

890
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,580
Just get me out of this box, Wellman.

891
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,200
Please, no, no.

892
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,240
Don't believe what Paul told you.

893
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,960
It's all a lie. It's all a lie.

894
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,400
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

895
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,420
I'm sorry I let you out of the box, Wellman.

896
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:12,600
I can't see. This is a bad show, Wellman.

897
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,960
This is a real bad show.

898
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,780
She says she'd almost rather see me in Tevas than in nothing at all.

899
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,220
Bright, perky, almost psychedelic.

900
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,820
The Tevas line of fine men's undergarments.

901
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,620
Underwear you'll never change.

902
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:33,900
Sweet talk me all you want, but you'll never get me out of my Tevas.

903
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,320
I'm sorry, Wellman.

904
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,080
Come on back,

905
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,000
and all of you will suffer your fate for that matter.

906
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,000


907

910
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,360
Young man said this was before he died,

911
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,480
that he was scared to talk business with you,

912
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:04,700
and take care of you.

913
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:09,440
precio attempt.

914
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:09,520
Suicide Titan,

915
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,760
If you talk to the every teenager of today

916
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,840
If you talk to the every teenager of today and you ask them what it is

917
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,820
If you talk to the every teenager of today and you ask them what it is

918
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:32,100
If you talk to the every teenager of today and you ask them what it is

919
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,100
about rock n roll music that they like

920
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:47,240
If you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it is about rock and

921
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,380
roll music that they like, the first thing they'll say is the beat, the beat, the beat.

922
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,460
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels when you sing it.

923
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,340
I know what it does to you.

924
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:08,060
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

925
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,700
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels.

926
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,560
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

927
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:24,320
I know the loss that you can get from the beat.

928
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,700
Well, if you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it is about

929
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:36,000
rock and roll music that they like, the evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

930
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,100
If you talk to the average teenager of today.

931
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,480
If you talk to the average teenager of today.

932
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,960
The beat, the beat.
