1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
But let's leave things of this world behind

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,540
and walk now down the path of Bob

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,600
for this brief minute of slack

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,340
from the Church of the Subgenius.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,280
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,420
and I'm afraid that our time has already run out.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Because, friends, a minute of slack

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,980
is all the slack the conspiracy is going to give you.

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,860
That's right.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,100
In this world, you'll get a minute of slack

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,800
and almost 24 hours of false slack.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,280
And how do you know the difference?

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,060
Because, friends, the real slack is free

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,300
even if it isn't always legal.

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,220
So it's sad that we only have one minute,

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,400
but it balances out in one great religious urge,

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,740
one great religious evacuation of the senses.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,560
And I would recommend reading Prescription 1714 and 3691.

19
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,680
And, friends, we need blankets and contraceptives

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,680
for those boys and girls in the home for slackless children.

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,360
Your contributions also keep those we hate starving to death.

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,000
I command!

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
I command you to spill your gift seed pledge

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,940
of 100 pounds of dollar bills on my lap

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,100
as this will buy so much for those poor children.

26
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,660
Bob Dobbs will bless you for planting this seed faith

27
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,320
and now our announcer won't give you the mailing address

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,800
of the Church of the Subgenius.

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,780
Thank you and let there be slack.

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,020
Now we're heading into the sexual or gonadial area

31
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,660
of the Doug Smith brain.

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,340
As you can see, it has some similarity

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,700
to the previous portions of the brain and the typewriter area.

34
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,680
But the enormous stamina of this human.

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,480
There's someone else saying, hey, hey.

36
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,740
Yes, that's all the trigger the Smith brain needs

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,180
to get an enormous rise.

38
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,940
Hey, hey, hey.

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,580
Hey, hey, hey.

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:58,720
Hey, hey, hey.

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,000
Hey, hey, hey.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,060
Hey, hey, hey.

43
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,260
Hey, hey, hey.

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,580
Hey, hey, hey.

45
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,580


46
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,580


47
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,580


48
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,580


49
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,580


50
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,580


51
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,580


52
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,300
All the voices of all the girls that he's put pleasure into.

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,760
They're yelling, staying, staying,

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,520
which is Doug Smith's alter ego.

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,580
The climax.

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,920
Can I say something?

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,080
Can I say something?

58
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,260
Can I say something?

59
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,520
Can I say something?

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,000
This show is our only method of communicating with you Earth people.

61
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,200
In hopes that in the storm of Babel,

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
you will understand the basic reality of our method

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,400
and apprehend that we are not simply a comedy group

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,620
or a humorous exercise,

65
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,200
but actually the emissaries of a distant civilization

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,480
which only wishes to confer its own understanding

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,540
upon the citizens of your rather backward planet.

68
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,940
We thank you for listening.

69
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,240
How do they do?

70
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,920
Well, like this.

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,900
And like this.

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,540
Oh, no, not like that.

73
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,120
And like this.

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,940
Ouch, that hurts.

75
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,700
No, cut it out.

76
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,060
Quit it.

77
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,400
And like this.

78
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,480
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

79
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,780
Yes, you'll see us enthroned in glory,

80
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,560
trailing clouds of glory and emitting the sacrosanct

81
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,800
echo of heavenly flame.

82
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,500
Like the gods we are.

83
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,960
Yes, that's our aura.

84
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,440
What, radio gods?

85
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,840
Yes, I think so.

86
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,140
You remember last time Carl Morgan wrested his own gun

87
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,500
from Julia Fairholme after duping her into thinking

88
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,200
there was a bluebird on her shoulder

89
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,340
when, in reality, it was an owl.

90
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,600
Today, it is the lovely Julia's turn

91
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,820
to attempt to dissuade the vengeful,

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,240
and the evil, and the evil, and the evil, and the evil, and the evil, and the evil.

93
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,240


94
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,760
And treacherous Carl from taking her life.

95
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,260
Let's listen.

96
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,620
Carl, what are you going to do?

97
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,780
That remains to be seen, Julia.

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,360
Now, I've got the gun, and the shoe is on the other foot.

99
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,000
What do you mean, Carl?

100
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,760
It's just an expression, Julia.

101
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,040
It means, uh, it means, well, you know,

102
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,580
like, uh, the tables are turned.

103
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,300
Tables?

104
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,020
What tables, Carl?

105
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,100
I don't see any tables.

106
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,420
Oh, no, no, no, Julia.

107
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,360
You don't seem to understand.

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,220
What I mean is, I've got the gun,

109
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,580
and you haven't.

110
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,260
See?

111
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,240
Before, you had, and I didn't.

112
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,120
So, now that I've got the gun, and you don't,

113
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,780
why, the shoe is on the other foot.

114
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,220
Or, the tables are turned, so to speak.

115
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,380
I love you, Carl.

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,440
Well, what's going to happen next time?

117
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,600
Don't fail to miss our next exciting episode,

118
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,720
when we'll hear Carl say...

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,760
No, no, no, Julia.

120
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,680
Not the tables are on the other foot.

121
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,760
It's the tables.

122
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,340
The tables are turned.

123
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,940
You remember last time,

124
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,600
Julia Fairholme was unable to understand

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,900
what Carl Morgan meant

126
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,220
when he told her the shoe was on the other foot.

127
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,100
Stop right there.

128
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,180
Intensifying our prospect's desires,

129
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,400
that's when the wheels of action begin to move.

130
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,380
Sorry for jumping in, doctors.

131
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,060
Go on.

132
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,080
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide

133
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,460
as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values,

134
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,900
so plan to attend this rare personal appearance

135
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,340
of Dr. Dobbs.

136
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,620
Even if you never intend to write your name again,

137
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,360
one sure way to impress folks

138
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,600
is to stay a little bit over their heads,

139
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,660
because it was better than looking stupid.

140
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,820
It's not true that we followed the circle

141
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,240
around and around and around,

142
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,460
helping to create a nice round world

143
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,440
of confusion and misunderstanding.

144
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,180
Well, we take our initiates

145
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,960
and we string a little tendon between their heels

146
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,560
and drag them three times around the radio station

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,340
before beginning.

148
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,140
Then we dip them in the sacred waters of the sludge.

149
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,280
And what exactly does this do for them?

150
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,660
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned

151
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,120
and it prepares their mind

152
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,680
for the slate-like impression,

153
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,680
the imprinting of the true subgenius.

154
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,800
Welcome, dear friends,

155
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,220
to the subgenius.

156
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,220
Genius hour of Slark.

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,200
Slark, Slark, Slark.

158
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,080
Yeah.

159
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,120
Slark, Slark, Slark.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,920
Slark, Slark, Slark.

161
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,280
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

162
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,400
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

163
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,720
Wow.

164
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,720
The message is now part of

165
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,660
and registered in your subconscious mind.

166
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,580
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

167
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,680
That's your key phrase.

168
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,240
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

169
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,560
Repent. Quit your job.

170
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,220
Slack off.

171
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:28,820
Driven to the brink of false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality?

172
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,440
And the pressure of a crumbling world?

173
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,820
Then this may be for you.

174
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,040
Eternal Salvation.

175
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,660
Or triple your money back.

176
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,200
The Church of the Subgenius.

177
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,880
Bring you another 33.

178
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,240
Three minutes of condensed, eraglic functioning.

179
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,340
Over the quality audio-visual techniques.

180
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,700
Exacerbated and complicated.

181
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,880

Copyright 1985-86.

183
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,700
Oh, Dr. Sprint.

184
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,520
She said.

185
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,000
Cutting her own legs off.

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,360
And what was to be the foment of a startlingly trend among the so-called punk de-tele-hensia.

187
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:38,160
Where they became not only skinheads, but took it to the next level and became boneheads.

188
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:49,340
Actually shaving off their hair scalp, cranial viscera, and the top three molecular layers of their...

192
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,960
Right now...

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,920
to the hairline zone of the brain,

you're in

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,360
you are

212
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:08,540
Uh, yes, dear friends, this is your good shepherd and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang, accompanied

213
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:22,340
tonight by, uh, let's give him a mic, accompanied tonight by, out with it, Buck.

214
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,060
I can't even tell if you're on mic.

215
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:36,620
Uh, he, Buck naked and, uh, and also the great Reverend Buddy West is here, friends, and

216
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,240
in the back.

217
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
Let's go give him a mic.

218
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,240
You know what, Buck, that, that microphone is not working.

219
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,300
You might look and see if you can find an on button.

220
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,660
Friends, this is, uh, this is, uh, Reverend Onan Canobite singing in the background.

221
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,600
And now, we had a question someone dared call the Subgenius Foundation, uh, with our secret

222
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,280
phone number.

223
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Today on Easter Sunday, I can't believe people don't hold religious holidays sacred, but

224
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,720
I called up and wanted to know, um, whether...

225
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,980
You could get some of the music that we play on records, like for instance, this, this

226
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,660
B.O.B.

227
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,100
song by Dr. Onan Canobite, or the, uh, intro music we play by Mark Mothersbaugh and Buck's

228
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,040
songs and so forth.

229
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,840
And, well, friends, you can buy these things on tape, not on records, yet.

230
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,820
But, uh, see, here's the thing.

231
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,980
This is, this is a public radio station.

232
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,980
We can't get on the air and tell you about all the things that we sell.

233
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,520
Many of you did not know that the Church of the Subgeniuses is a public radio station.

234
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:38,520


235
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:46,360
This is not just airwaves, but printed matter, audio cassettes, videotapes, and live B-vibles.

236
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,160
But, uh...

237
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
You shouldn't tell them about it.

238
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,760
Shouldn't tell them about it?

239
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,680
It may be a conflict of interest, because maybe we're advertising our own selves.

240
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,280
Like, I don't want to tell anybody about my band, More Drunk Cowboy.

241
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,980
We're going to do a benefit concert there.

242
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,720
We're going to do a benefit for Aidstown.

243
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,080
We're going to send all the victims of the epidemic.

244
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,300
Aidstown?

245
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:04,620
Yeah.

246
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,300
And it's going to be at, at the Wyandale Tavern.

247
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,500
Uh, at the Wynedale Tavern.

248
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:08,500


249
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,840
At the first Saturday of this month and next month.

250
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,280
So that's April 5th and so on.

251
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,800
And May 3rd, I guess.

252
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,000
And then we're going to be at, uh, doing more benefits for Aidstown.

253
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
We're at the Stepladder.

254
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,720
Coming up next month.

255
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,820
And, uh, at the Profit Bar.

256
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,280
So we're going to be doing a lot of these benefits.

257
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,260
Alright.

258
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:25,980
Yeah.

259
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,100
Right.

260
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,260
Well, as long as you're not getting paid for it, then you can...

261
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,420
A little charity work.

262
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,120
A little charity work.

263
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,560
We're doing it everywhere in town.

264
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,820
And, you know, you get a dime, you can bet.

265
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,520
Oh, yes.

266
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,500
But we're, we're getting all the, uh, we're getting Aidstown benefits.

267
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:38,500


268
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:38,500


269
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,700
Built.

270
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,120
That's the main thing.

271
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,120
You're just going to put them all together in one...

272
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,220
That's sick, man.

273
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,860
Well, hey, you know.

274
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,680
What can I tell you?

275
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,660
I mean, that's not funny.

276
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,900
There's people shriveling up with the subgenius virus all the time.

277
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,820
And, you know...

278
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,880
Well, then we shouldn't have released the virus if we didn't want to, you know.

279
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,140
I know.

280
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,240
It was the balloons, man.

281
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,060
If we hadn't been messing with those damn balloons at Doc's Dock, it would have been...

282
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,200
Well, anyway, friends...

283
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,280
It's not the balloons.

284
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,720
It's the suppositories, Stang.

285
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,440
That's what did it.

286
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,540
Don't talk about all of it.

287
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,500
Anyway, the, uh, uh, you know, uh...

288
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,740
Yes, you can get these tapes.

289
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,840
And that's why we read the box number, P.O.

290
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:19,000
Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214 at the end of every broadcast, friends, is so that you will

291
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,760
write for information and find out that you can get those tapes.

292
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,320
Now, this...

293
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,420
The music...

294
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,640
A lot of the songs that we're playing now, the newer subgenius songs are...

295
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,380
Sorry, Dr. Onan.

296
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,380
The newer subgenius songs are oftentimes...

297
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,960
Most of those are on the Ear of Bob tape.

298
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,920
The Ear of Bob tape, which was mentioned in your last pamphlet.

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,220
Those of you who are subscribing members got that one.

300
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
And, uh, let's see.

301
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,300
Well, here's a...

302
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,620
Here's a cut off the...

303
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,440
Well, Buck, what else?

304
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,840
Did you have something else to...

305
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,080
I'm stuffed with Easter dinner.

306
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,620
I've been...

307
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,040
I've had...

308
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,900
I've been on two Easter egg hunts.

309
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,180
I haven't ate all day today.

310
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,720
I've been fasting and whipping myself.

311
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,560
Oh, right.

312
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,340
And that's...

313
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,500
Yeah.

314
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,120
See, that's religion for you, friend.

315
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,540
You hurt yourself for God.

316
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,360
You know, I...

317
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,540
I've heard of this Prince of Peace stuff.

318
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,860
What a bunch of lies.

319
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,460
You know, look up Matthew 1032.

320
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,760
We'll read it to you some other night.

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,100
But just look up Matthew 1032.

322
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,640
Is that the bit about bringing the...

323
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,680
Not to bring the...

324
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,760
Yeah, bringing the sword and...

325
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,160
Yeah, not...

326
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,660
Well, I bring not a peace sign, but a nuke, a nuclear weapon.

327
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:25,960
Yeah.

328
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,180
Eat the Easter eggs.

329
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,600
Eat them.

330
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,380
Yeah, eat them Easter eggs.

331
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,380
Yeah, eat them Easter eggs.

332
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Take the salt with you.

333
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,740
Well, friends, the Ear of Bob tape is a...

334
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,160
Is a beautiful tape crammed with...

335
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,880
I do have one thing I did want to bring out to our listeners.

336
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,660
We'd like a call in on this subject tonight.

337
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:45,780
Okay.

338
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,980
Anybody who had a religious experience at the Twilight Room last night, we'd like to

339
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,040
hear from you, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.

340
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,420
Uh-oh.

341
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Give us a call at the station and we'll discuss that a little more as we get on with

342
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,780
the evening.

343
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,260
God, I'm so out of it.

344
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,360
I never got...

345
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,380
I don't know what these guys are talking about.

346
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,660
It was probably great.

347
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,420
And I missed it.

348
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,140
Why?

349
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,460
Why?

350
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,640
The work...

351
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:10,920
Give us the phone numbers.

352
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,180
Phone numbers.

353
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,780
Oh, the phone number of the station here is 823-7490, dear friends.

354
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,320
That's 8...

355
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,520
Or...

356
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,740
823-8801.

357
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,380
Or 823-8883.

358
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,560
Our expert phone interceptor, Reverend Bloody Vest, will get your call.

359
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,740
Ah, yes, dear friends.

360
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,720
And this is Reverend Jim Erickson of Glass Madness doing that great old interception.

361
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:36,720


362
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:36,720


363
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,560
And this is rather an old subgenius hymn, Hello, Bob.

364
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,100
Hello, Bob.

365
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,880
I need someone to talk to.

366
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,020
Hello, Bob.

367
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,060
Seems there's nothing I can do.

368
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,200
Hello, Bob.

369
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,160
I need someone to listen to me.

370
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,720
I'm hitting all the maiden's subs Mitt.

371
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,920
locked doors and I need some help and I was hoping you'd have the key.

372
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,840
Hello, Bob.

373
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,440
Have you been listening to my thoughts?

374
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,800
Hello, Bob.

375
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,660
And I'll tell you all the thoughts I've got.

376
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
Hello, Bob.

377
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,400
Hello, Bob.

378
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,680
I can't seem to find the truth.

379
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:49,700
I read the books, I took the drugs, and I drank a whole bottle of Relu.

380
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,640
Yeah.

381
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,420
Hello, Bob.

382
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,320
I seem to have misplaced my slack.

383
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,300
Hello, Bob.

384
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,960
Well, I just can't seem to get it back.

385
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,180
Hello, Bob.

386
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,480
Can you point out what it is I lack?

387
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:27,420
I've climbed to highest heights, hit the lowest lows, but now I'm on my back.

388
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440
Hello, Bob.

389
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,700
Hello, Bob.

390
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:36,700


391
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:36,700


392
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,820
Are you still hearing me?

393
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,900
Hello, Bob.

394
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,080
Give me a sign that I can see.

395
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,780
Hello, Bob.

396
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,920
It's not that I've lost all my hope.

397
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:05,120
But I'm really tired and I'm really broke and I smoked up the last of my dope.

398
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:23,440
Now that I'm heat shit, I've just got to look hard.

399
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
Hello, Bob.

400
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,780
Robbery's a mission to you and it's your fault.

401
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:28,780


402
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:28,780


403
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:28,780


404
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:28,780


405
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:28,780


406
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:28,820
Dig me a pink!

407
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:28,820


408
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:28,820


409
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:28,820


410
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:28,820


411
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,880
Am I comin...

412
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,080
through to you??

413
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,740
Hello Bob.

414
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,860
audio brush Pi Poop ebook sometimes Mais crime several times...

415
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,700
Crushing CPU

416
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,260
I thought I already paid all my dues.

417
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,780
Hello, Bob.

418
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,700
I know that you can see me through.

419
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,940
But it's damp and dim and I can't swim.

420
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,600
What am I supposed to do?

421
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,080
Well, hello, Bob.

422
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,180
I'm feeling better.

423
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,980
Now you listen to me.

424
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,160
Hello, Bob.

425
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,860
Well, the sun's out now.

426
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,880
Now I can see.

427
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,100
Hello, Bob.

428
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,860
A great change has come over me.

429
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,900
My eyes are wise.

430
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,860
My thoughts are clear.

431
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,720
And I'm as happy as I could be.

432
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,940
Yes, my eyes.

433
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,460
My thoughts are clear.

434
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,240
And I'm as happy as I could be.

435
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,640
Oh, yes, friends.

436
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,320
That was Glass Madness.

437
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,960
By the way, Glass Madness will be in town doing a glass show

438
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,980
at the Glass Convention here in Dallas in April.

439
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,760
But I don't think he'll be singing about Bob then

440
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,300
because they put you in jail for doing that out on the street corners.

441
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,180
It happened to me once.

442
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,880
So anyway, here's this in continuation of the old,

443
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,760
old-timey Hinton Buck, unless you've had something you wanted to infect their minds with.

444
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,260
Come on, let's talk about what happened at the toilet room last night.

445
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,980
Anybody been there?

446
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
823-7490.

447
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
Help me, somebody.

448
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,140
This is Doctors for Bob with one of their unusually quieter tunes,

449
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,300
Legs of Fire.

450
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,980
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

451
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,240
this song introduces a new genre in country and western music.

452
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,000
We call it gospel.

453
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,680
It's gospel music for people who know they're going to hell anyway.

454
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,780
It's a little thing called Legs of Fire.

455
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,020
OK.

456
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:59,600
Well, I thought I could get away with saunter on our wedding day.

457
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,500
Preacher Man said, boy, better put away your song.

458
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,860
But I said, I don't cotton to no God's county law.

459
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,320
But that song was stolen.

460
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
At least that's what they said.

461
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,040
So I wrapped up in asbestos from my waist up to my head.

462
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,940
I wrapped up in asbestos that I got from Greg's.

463
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,220
I only wish I had enough to cover up my legs.

464
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,460
So I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

465
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,640
But I ain't no liar.

466
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,800
I'm burning, burning, burning.

467
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,420
Got Legs.

468
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:34,820
Got Legs.

469
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,120
Got Legs of Fire.

470
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,560
Oh, my head's dry and cool.

471
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,800
So's my arms and tool.

472
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,340
My torso, even more so.

473
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,080
But I ain't no liar.

474
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,280
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

475
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,040
Got Legs.

476
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,500
Got Legs.

477
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,600
Got Legs of Fire.

478
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,060
Well, I was selling heroin at the elementary school.

479
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,420
Preacher Man said, boy, you know that isn't cool.

480
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,960
The good Lord.

481
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,100
Come to me.

482
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,980
Said my time was up.

483
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,580
When I asked why I got, he said, because that horse was cut.

484
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,940
They were shooting up in the bathroom.

485
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,980
Yes, you know it's true.

486
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,700
But they were not getting off.

487
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,500
And that's why my soul is through.

488
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,820
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

489
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
But I ain't no liar.

490
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,140
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

491
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,840
Got Legs.

492
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,380
Got Legs.

493
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,460
Got Legs of Fire.

494
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,860
Oh, my brain ain't in no flame.

495
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,940
And my shoulders are burning.

496
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:33,940


497
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:33,940


498
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:33,940


499
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:33,940


500
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:33,940


501
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:33,940


502
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:33,940


503
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:33,940


504
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:33,940


505
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,540
Fear in my mind is neither

506
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,820
nor one's heat, or rain.

507
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,440
I was breaking all the Inflammas.

508
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,440


509
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,620
She's calling me all this.

510
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,980
Cesare Asimov talked , like a absolutely disposable addiction sp complaining about the

511
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,940
same-sex relationships – Justin Durkheim.

512
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:55,940


513
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:03,380
CJте, I wanted to destroy my program Cause, Concentration, Medicine .

514
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,900
The door was dented in

515
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,280
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning

516
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,340
But I ain't no liar

517
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,600
Now I'm burning, burning, burning

518
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,960
Got legs, got legs, got legs afire

519
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,260
Oh, my head ain't on the line

520
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,420
And my arm is doing fine

521
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,640
But my knees are trying, please

522
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,400
But I ain't no liar

523
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,620
Now I'm burning, burning, burning

524
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,180
Got legs, got legs, got legs afire

525
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,000
Well, I was bashing Grandma's head

526
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,740
With a railroad tie

527
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,200
The good Lord come to me

528
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
And said, why did you lie?

529
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,460
When I said, why lie?

530
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
He said, you must confess

531
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,540
That ain't your Grandma's head at all

532
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,200
It's just a bloody mess

533
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,640
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning

534
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,800
But I ain't no liar

535
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,160
Now I'm burning, burning, burning

536
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,760
Got legs, got legs, got legs afire

537
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:28,620
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning

538
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,580
What happened?

539
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,040
What happened?

540
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,040
You got the line up?

541
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,100
Hello, dear caller

542
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,600
Dear caller

543
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,500
No, Miss Lane is gone

544
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,080
Here, head on

545
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,960
Oh, yeah

546
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,720
Dear friend

547
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,380
Hello?

548
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,300
Hello, caller

549
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,220
He's gone

550
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,500
He's lost him

551
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,380
Oh, but his soul has ascended to caller heaven

552
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,020
Listener heaven

553
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,740
Where the Lord is

554
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,840
Poor, poor listeners who never make it through to this show.

555
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,260
They've been instructed to call back.

556
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,040
Yes.

557
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,460
I'd like to hear from somebody about that darned toilet room bust last night.

558
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,540
And friends, in the meantime, well, later on, we're going to be reading.

559
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:13,900
We're going to try it again.

560
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,400
We got them back.

561
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,100
Oh, shall we?

562
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,700
Okay.

563
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,820
Let's go ahead and do it here.

564
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,440
Let's show up.

565
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,060
Hello, dear caller.

566
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,520
Hello.

567
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,200
Dear caller.

568
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Dear caller.

569
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,700
Hello.

570
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:26,860
Hello.

571
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,800
You are on the air.

572
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,720
Dear caller.

573
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,300
He can hear us, but we can't hear him.

574
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,500
Why?

575
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,140
I can hear him breathing on the other end.

576
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,640
Listen to that.

577
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,580
The breather call?

578
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,460
Yeah.

579
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,140
See that?

580
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:41,900
Chicken!

581
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,320
They're afraid to mess with the wrath of Bob, and that's probably wise.

582
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,480
We've got positive proof now that Bob is not dead, so we can stop worrying about that.

583
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,160
That's right.

584
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,680
Finally cleared up this nonstop dogmatic...

585
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,120
dogmatic battle that the Docs have been beating each other over the head with the last three

586
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,420
years.

587
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,080
Well, well, there's...

588
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,340
You don't have any hard proof exactly that Bob is resurrected from the dead.

589
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,840
Oh, yeah.

590
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:06,940
Re-erected.

591
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,940
Re-erected stag.

592
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,560
Yeah, that's a little different from a straight... your straight old-time resurrection.

593
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,100
These new re-erections, kind of more 80s, kind of more permissive kind of deal.

594
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,280
The 80s.

595
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,640
Yeah.

596
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,200
Well, friends, it's just a matter of faith, really.

597
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,800
We don't...

598
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:24,960
We...

599
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,480
Every subgenius.

600
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,040
Has a...

601
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,980
Has had cause to feel that...

602
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:37,800
That great man with the pipe, the great salesman who will buy our planet back from the conspiracy...

603
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,960
Well, we've been getting mail from Bob.

604
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,280
He's back alive.

605
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,280
I've been getting mail personally.

606
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,060
I'm on Bob's mailing list again.

607
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,300
Bob's mailing list, not the church's.

608
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,180
But I want to tell you all something.

609
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,300
If there wasn't a Bob, wouldn't we have to invent him?

610
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,040
So, it doesn't matter.

611
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,160
Whether Bob is here or not.

612
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,420
Because, see, he's Bob.

613
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,400
He's got to be here.

614
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,780
So, therefore, there's got to be a Bob.

615
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,860
And there is a Bob.

616
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,300
And...

617
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,260
And...

618
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,400
This is the logic, friends.

619
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,160
This is the ultimate logic of JR.

620
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,120
The crystalline, clear logic of Slack.

621
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,120
Well, they're too lazy.

622
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:17,580
Well, look.

623
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,460
Enemies of the subgenius that you...

624
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,580
Just the pinks.

625
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,440
The normals.

626
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,440
The conspiracy.

627
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,840
The mediocrities.

628
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,660
Well, what...

629
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,400
What is the conspiracy?

630
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,680
What is the conspiracy?

631
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,880
It's 20th century traditions.

632
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,740
It's the old traditions.

633
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,020
It's all the things that got us where we are now.

634
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,540
It's Christ without a penis.

635
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,560
He's part of the conspiracy.

636
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,720
It's presidents that don't look like they're capable of getting erections anymore.

637
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
That's the conspiracy.

638
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,600
That's just the way it is.

639
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,120
It just didn't happen.

640
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,760
It would appear that the government at the moment is...

641
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,300
is practicing a lot of this religion in absentia for many folks.

642
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,540
It was a trendy thing.

643
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,220
Well, we're actually the conspiracy...

644
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,400
You've always heard of the conspiracy, right?

645
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:14,800
Yeah.

646
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,620
Well, we're the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

647
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
And we've decided to come out in the open.

648
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,240
You're the unnamed source.

649
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,400
That's us.

650
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,340
One of them.

651
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,020
Well, you've certainly heard of the Public Cretanization Society.

652
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:34,220
The conspiracy has been trying to squelch abnormality since time began, practically.

653
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:42,200
It goes so far back and is so ingrained in our culture that it's gotten to where the conspiracy leaders don't have to do anything

654
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,340
because it's an endless cycle of normalcy.

655
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:54,920
Kids are, even kids with latent subgenius genes are born, but they're raised by the conspiracy,

656
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:02,120
making them want to be popular, raising them to be happy with mediocrity, with everything being the same.

657
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,600
I am now learning to apply creative and corrective procedures and to bring back to normalcy and a state of perfection

658
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:16,580
any abnormality or imperfection found within any given manifestation of matter, any given plane, any given depth.

659
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:23,360
I can easily do anything that I want to do. I can. I can.

660
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,900
I'm okay.

661
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,360
I'm a winner.

662
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,720
Pursuant to Section 28A, Article 4B, Paragraph 2 of the Internal Security Regulations,

663
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,460
I now hand over to you rejected applicate number 578293BO21.

664
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,580
I fell right on his face.

665
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,640
Yeah, life sucks.

666
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,720
Yeah, life sucks.

667
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,540
I've had it up to here.

668
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,140
Shut up.

669
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,980
I hate myself.

670
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,400
I hate everyone else.

671
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,760
I'm not done.

672
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,560
Can you hear me? What the heck is going on out here anyway?

673
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,740
I need to talk to Bob.

674
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,280
Bob.

675
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,380
Bob.

676
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,100
Bob.

677
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:56,960
Bob.

678
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,120
Bob.

679
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,340
Bob.

680
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:57,480
Bob.

681
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,520
Friends, it seems like somebody here does indeed need to talk to Bob.

682
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,800
Let's go ahead and try to get him in here.

683
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,400
See what happens.

684
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,100
Hit that.

685
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,580
Ah, yes, dear friend.

686
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,520
This is the app.

687
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,360
It's blinking again.

688
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,620
Start it.

689
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:16,880
Hello?

690
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,480
Hello?

691
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,940
Hello?

692
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,760
Yes.

693
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,060
Oh, yes.

694
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,900
I mean, would like to order on large pizza.

695
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,800
What?

696
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:24,900


697
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:24,900


698
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,020
Wait a minute.

699
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,120
You want to order a pizza?

700
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,220
This must be the wrong call.

701
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,700
Oh, wait a minute.

702
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:27,900
No.

703
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,280
No.

704
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,200
There's too many of everything.

705
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,740
Um, okay.

706
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,780
And what is your...

707
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,380
Don't put the little feces on it.

708
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,300
The little feces?

709
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,860
No feces?

710
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,440
No, no, uh, anchovies, I think.

711
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,360
No, I think you said feces.

712
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,300
Well, I know, but...

713
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:40,620
Okay.

714
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,800
Uh, what's your address?

715
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,900
And we'll, we'll deliver that.

716
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,480
We'll deliver it through the mail.

717
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,320
Okay.

718
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,200
It's to go.

719
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,280
Uh-huh.

720
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,340
Twenty minutes?

721
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Oh, probably.

722
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,080
Give us half an hour.

723
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,080
Oh, okay.

724
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:54,880
No, no, no.

725
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:54,880


726
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:54,880


727
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,040
The mail takes two weeks.

728
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,120
Okay.

729
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,240
Well, thank you very much.

730
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,720
Well, wait a minute.

731
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,680
You didn't give us your address.

732
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:01,820
Oh.

733
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,420
Because we'll, we'll be down there in just a little while, as soon as this pizza show

734
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,620
is finished cooking.

735
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,480
Do you mind if your, uh, pizza, the little kind we got is one that's in the shape of

736
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,260
Bob's head, Bob's face?

737
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,300
Bob?

738
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,080
You want a little Bob face pie?

739
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,800
A Bob face pie?

740
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,180
Is that...

741
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,680
Yeah, man, a Bob face pie.

742
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,960
This is a real pizza.

743
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,960
Is that a new thing that, that you have?

744
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,380
Yeah.

745
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,820
That's the, the Bob pizza.

746
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,200
Uh-huh.

747
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,080
And there's a Ger, Gerbrogfran pizza also, which is much more expensive.

748
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,760
It's a $15 for the large.

749
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,100
The Gerbrogfran, the Bob is only $10.

750
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,640
And it's our most popular pizza.

751
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,700
Oh, okay.

752
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,960
So, what is your address?

753
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,320
At our cheap, cheapest pizza, if, if you eat that, your face becomes the next pizza.

754
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,620
Do you want a large or a medium or a small or how many?

755
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,260
Oh, uh, let's see.

756
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,860
I'll take two small ones.

757
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,300
Two small Bob pizzas.

758
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,120
Yeah.

759
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,940
And what is your address?

760
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,720
2111 Commerce.

761
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,600
2111 Commerce.

762
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,140
Oh, he lives at the Twilight Room.

763
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,500
Oh.

764
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,400
Yeah, he got busted last night.

765
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,920
This guy still has to stay there.

766
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,480
This guy lives in the parking lot.

767
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,600
This is the man from the parking lot.

768
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,360
No, I don't live in the building.

769
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,180
I live in the parking lot.

770
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,800
Don't you have to keep your hands on the car all the time?

771
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,920
Oh, never mind.

772
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,980
We'll get to the next caller.

773
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,560
Thanks a lot.

774
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,260
Okay, bye-bye.

775
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,120
.

776
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,800

809
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,020


810
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,020


811
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,020

00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,040


816
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,120
.

817
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,120


818
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,120


819
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,380
Friends, we're going to try one more time here.

820
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,260
One more little phone call.

821
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,020
Uh, yes.

822
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,240
Hello, dear friend.

823
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:10,900
Hello.

824
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,100
You're...

825
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,480
Oh, they're not on the air.

826
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,360
I hate it.

827
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,500
Oh, you know who it is?

828
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,380
They're using it on the other line there.

829
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,920
Well, only one thing to do.

830
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,460
There are weapons that are simply thoughts.

831
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,480
Attitudes, prejudices.

832
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,280
To be found only in the minds of men.

833
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,160
There is no typical subgenius.

834
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,020
There's no profile subgenius.

835
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,900
The subgenius is the person who is an outsider,

836
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,440
who has been different some way or another since birth.

837
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,440
A person who is born with slack.

838
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,340
And we're all born with slack.

839
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,100
Original slack.

840
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,080
Original slack.

841
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:50,240
But the conspiracy, the conspiracy of normalcy, really, is what it is.

842
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,480
It takes it away from the minute you...

843
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,580
are born.

844
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,640
They give you that first whack on your behind to make you cry.

845
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,920
From that moment on, they're taking away your slack.

846
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,180
He was alive one minute, then he was dead.

847
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,280
Can't be.

848
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,700
Why not?

849
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,840
There must have been a reason.

850
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,600
They can't...

851
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,560
They couldn't just barge in here and drag him away.

852
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,800
No reason.

853
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,160
What right do they have?

854
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,460
Catch you twenty-five.

855
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:22,840
Catch you twenty-two.

856
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,960
Catch you twenty-two, friends.

857
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,540
That's always the reason.

858
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,100
And it's pretty demonic, alright.

859
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,620
We're gonna try to get this caller in.

860
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,080
Hello, caller.

861
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,000
Hello?

862
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,940
God, it's on hold.

863
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,540
Remember?

864
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,720
Why can't I get this guy on?

865
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,960
He was talking to him out there.

866
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,520
Oh, okay.

867
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,160
He doesn't want to be on the air.

868
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,340
He doesn't want to be on the air.

869
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,360
Well, friends...

870
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:52,020
Apparently, we've got someone who has called in and is praying for friends of...

871
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,280
of those associated with this show because they think it's a demonic, satanic show.

872
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,120
Friends, I think it's preaching time, as a matter of fact.

873
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,160
It's time for preaching!

874
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,620
This is time.

875
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,800
Let me put on some decent preaching music here.

876
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,080
And, friends, I'll tell you what.

877
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,900
Those out there in Dallas, Texas who happen to believe that this subgenius show is somehow

878
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,540
satanic, I'll tell you what, my friend.

879
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,900
Has it ever occurred to you that there might be more than one Jesus, for instance, a right

880
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,020
Jesus, that wants you to be a happy person?

881
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:35,560
And a false, satanic, devil, poltergeist Jesus that likes to get into people's heads

882
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,320
and make them make themselves miserable because, friends, that's what makes the Lord miserable.

883
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,740
Yeah, I guess that never occurred to some people out there, but let's go ahead and...

884
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,720
Shall we try to...

885
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,180
I think we got you there.

886
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,520
Yeah.

887
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:49,780
I think we got you there.

888
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:49,980


889
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,000
You got the last rant, Steve.

890
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,640
Huh?

891
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,480
We got the last rant.

892
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,240
We got that last rant.

893
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,620
Let's see what happens here.

894
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,640
We've got somebody on line one here.

895
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,400
They're going...

896
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,580
Hello, line one.

897
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,140
Hello, line one.

898
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,920
Hello?

899
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
Hang up line one, anybody out there.

900
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,360
Hello?

901
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,320
You're on the air.

902
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,200
Hello?

903
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:13,960
Yes.

904
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,740
This is John, isn't it?

905
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,200
Yes.

906
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,700
This is John.

907
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,540
Welcome to K-N-O-N, John.

908
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,520
Well, I'm John.

909
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,520


910
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,520


911
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,520


912
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,520


913
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,520


914
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,520


915
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,480
Am I really on the air?

916
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,060
Yes.

917
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,840
This is not a trick.

918
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,080
It's not a falsehood.

919
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,020
It's the truth, huh?

920
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,020
You bet.

921
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,400
Oh, okay.

922
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,540
Squirt it out, guy.

923
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,020
We've got a big show here.

924
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,800
Well, I just got in on the show.

925
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,900
I don't really know what's going on for sure.

926
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,900
Who does?

927
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,320
What'd you say?

928
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,100
Who does?

929
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,520
Well, I just called up to talk.

930
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,980
I want to talk to whoever's on the radio.

931
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

932
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,480
Well, you're on the radio now.

933
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,100
Okay, I'm on the radio.

934
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,060
Who's the reverend whatever?

935
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,560
That's me, Buck.

936
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,220
That's you?

937
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:56,820
Yeah.

938
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,740
Are you an ordained minister?

939
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,600
Yes, sir.

940
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,200
Legal marriages and all that.

941
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,260
Oh, do you really?

942
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,160
Yes, sir.

943
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,340
You got a sweetie?

944
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,300
A what?

945
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,180
You got a sweetie?

946
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,080
Yeah, I got one.

947
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,320
A girlfriend?

948
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,600
Or is it a wife?

949
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,900
It's my wife.

950
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,340
Well, then if you want to get remarried, then I'll handle it for you.

951
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:15,640
What?

952
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,580
That's just a little joke.

953
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,340
That's a little joke there, you know.

954
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:19,980
Okay.

955
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,740
Well, listen here.

956
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,220
I just called up to find out where you got this religion at, you guys.

957
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,380
Well, this...

958
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,900
We picked it up in bits and pieces all around the world.

959
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,300
You know, Bob, ever since he was a little boy in his parents' home, just with his parents' books,

960
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,180
he spent all his time looking for the good parts.

961
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,600
He went through the Bible.

962
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,360
He went through the vision.

963
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,600
He went through the Dead Sea Scrolls.

964
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
He went through the...

965
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,720
He went through Marvel Comics, Doctor Strange.

966
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,220
That's right.

967
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,520
He went through...

968
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,320
The Book of Mormon.

969
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,940
He went through the ancient Atlantean scrawlings and all that.

970
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,680
And he took the good parts, friends.

971
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,680
It's like this religion is like a monster patched together out of the pieces of dead religions

972
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,000
and brought to shambling unholy life of its own.

973
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,820
So, do you have a comment on this, sir?

974
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,820
Well, that's pretty shocking to me.

975
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,700
Why?

976
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,340
Huh?

977
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
Well, he's into it.

978
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,160
He's into it.

979
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:24,100
How is that any different from most of the other religions in this country?

980
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:24,400
It's different from all of them.

981
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,000
It's different from all of them.

982
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,580
Well, yeah, I know.

983
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,560
But at the same time, they're all composed of...

984
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,140
I mean, the word of God may have been broadcast at one point,

985
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,720
but it's been filtered through an awful lot of greedy human minds, my friend.

986
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,040
He knows that.

987
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,340
This man is awake.

988
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
This man is awake.

989
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,260
What do you say?

990
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,020
I say, you are awake.

991
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,580
You are listening to us.

992
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,580
You are listening to us with both glands.

993
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,800
Well, listen, the reason I called is...

994
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,220
Yes, John.

995
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:54,700
Huh?

996
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,520
Yes, John.

997
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Well, the reason I called is because I just kind of wanted to know what acts you had to grind

998
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,940
with what religious group burned your brain or what.

999
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,480
Which one offended you or did all of them?

1000
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,940
No, not that.

1001
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,940
As a matter of fact, for me, this is Reverend Ivan Stangis.

1002
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,080
Speaking personally, I'm into all the other religions.

1003
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,460
In fact, we wouldn't be working so hard on this.

1004
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:18,580
We wouldn't be working so hard on this one.

1005
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:18,580


1006
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,620
If we didn't think there was, you know, a certain amount of slack to be had from...

1007
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,700
I've praised the other religions.

1008
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,800
You know, Marlon Maddox is a regular listener of our slack.

1009
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,220
Oh, really?

1010
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,040
Yeah, Marlon Maddox himself is at home right now curled up with a wife and a cocktail.

1011
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,260
Listen to a little good old Back to the Pamphlet, Hour of Slack.

1012
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,080
Praise Bob.

1013
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,760
Oh, really?

1014
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,500
Yes, sir.

1015
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,200
Well, that's too bad.

1016
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,020
No, it's not too bad.

1017
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,900
Do you not like slack?

1018
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,520
Or is it that you don't know what slack is?

1019
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,040
Well, I just...

1020
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,060
All I know is what Jesus said.

1021
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,640
That's all you know?

1022
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,180
Yeah.

1023
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,820
That's often the problem, see?

1024
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,020
Well, yeah, the thing about it is Jesus said this.

1025
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,260
You want to hear one thing he said?

1026
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:01,640
Please.

1027
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,920
Well, yeah, although I bet we've heard it before.

1028
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
But then I'll tell you what Walter...

1029
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,600
Hey, wait.

1030
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,860
Let me tell you what Walter Chrysler said.

1031
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,640
Not Jesus Christ, but Walter Chrysler.

1032
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,680
This is no baloney.

1033
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,520
Will you take this word off...

1034
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,380
He said, check all three.

1035
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,260
Thank you very much, and thanks for sharing that with us.

1036
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,160
Buck, you censored that...

1037
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,580
That fact.

1038
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:18,580


1039
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:18,580


1040
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:18,580


1041
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:18,580


1042
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:18,580


1043
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:18,580


1044
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:18,580


1045
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:18,580


1046
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,400
You're a faithful listener.

1047
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:19,820
Oh, I didn't censor.

1048
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,420
We've heard...

1049
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:20,800
I know.

1050
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,520
They always use the same quotes on us, and those quotes were...

1051
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:24,920
I don't know.

1052
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,360
Friends, it's true.

1053
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,760
This is the work of the devil.

1054
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,420
If you're listening to this show, you are damned to hell for eternity.

1055
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,460
It's too late.

1056
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,000
It's too late to turn it off.

1057
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,220
Don't say that.

1058
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,300
Bob Larson's listening.

1059
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,280
It's too late to...

1060
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,560
I know.

1061
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,200
It's...

1062
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:42,440
Though the little sparrow in the tree, if it's listening to this show, is damned to

1063
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:42,600
hell.

1064
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,100
And, friends, I know it's not the fault of the listeners.

1065
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,160
They didn't know...

1066
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,180
Or the sparrow in the tree.

1067
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,740
It's like the little kid...

1068
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:49,820
Or the lightning bug.

1069
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,720
It's like the little kid who's not baptized.

1070
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,380
You know, he's gonna burn in hell, but...

1071
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,780
And it's not his fault, but that's just the way it is, because that's what the word of...

1072
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,420
Not Bob, but somebody else said, right?

1073
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:01,760
I don't...

1074
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,320
We don't think...

1075
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,960
Things aren't really that bleak, folks.

1076
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,840
Just remember, the normals will get blended into the plugs in the vats of the elder gods,

1077
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,420
while the subgenie will careen off in new directions on death.

1078
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:14,820
Oh, yes.

1079
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,080
Praise Bob.

1080
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,560
We don't need to hang around the bodies.

1081
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,780
We squander in life.

1082
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,060
We know what we do to them.

1083
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,000
It's pretty awful when we think about all the extra food we dump in ourselves and all

1084
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,060
the chemicals and...

1085
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,180
But hey, no problem, because you've got new weirdness in Bob.

1086
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,280
It's a...

1087
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,800
Before death.

1088
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,820
Before death.

1089
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,260
It's a beautiful, beautiful thought.

1090
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,400
Ah, yes.

1091
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,620
Let me give one more caller a chance to get on with it.

1092
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,480
Okay, but I really want to get back to some tapes.

1093
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,340
I'm tired of these amateur speakers.

1094
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:43,900
Hello.

1095
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,040
Hello.

1096
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,580
They didn't go to Columbia Broadcasting School like me.

1097
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:46,900
Ha!

1098
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,400
I know how to pronounce everything really cool on the radio with the low voice, you

1099
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,540
know.

1100
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,600
Oh, yes, dear friend.

1101
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,680
Yeah, this is Reverend.

1102
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,440
Uh-huh.

1103
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,660
This is one of many.

1104
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,780
Yeah, listen.

1105
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,380
I just got the book, you know, and I was reading it.

1106
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,060
Yes.

1107
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,340
And tell me about the Yeti.

1108
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,740
Well, you need to read that in the book.

1109
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,600
Well, the true subgenie have ancestors who are Yetis.

1110
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:13,780
Yeah.

1111
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,540
That is the abominable snowman of the Himalayas.

1112
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:17,540


1113
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:17,540


1114
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,980
I'd like to say something to our listener.

1115
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,380
Please do.

1116
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,540
I'm looking at the voice meter right now, and I can tell you've got a strong streak

1117
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,660
of Northern Tibetan in your heritage.

1118
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,840
Yeah, well, that's right, you know, and I really want to know about the Yeti, and I

1119
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,140
need...

1120
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:29,500
Right.

1121
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:29,920
Well, you...

1122
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,880
Have you got that rectangular gland in your foot?

1123
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,740
That's a main thing.

1124
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,600
Well, that sounds pretty good, because I really need some rectangular...

1125
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,860
Well, I'd say, why don't you...

1126
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,740
You can get your answers by massaging your foot gland.

1127
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,860
It's a rectangular gland in your foot.

1128
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,300
Look in both feet and massage the soles until you find the...

1129
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:47,520
Listen.

1130
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:47,520


1131
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:47,520


1132
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:47,520


1133
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:47,520


1134
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:47,520


1135
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:47,520


1136
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,480
...contangular gland in your foot, and call us back.

1137
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:50,900
Yeah.

1138
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,660
Where's Doug Smith?

1139
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,020
Doug Smith is a guy who used to work with the Subgenius Foundation.

1140
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,640
He died in Bob a long time ago.

1141
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,000
He died?

1142
00:43:59,180 --> 00:43:59,540
Yeah.

1143
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,460
And they did burn out.

1144
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,280
They did burn out.

1145
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:07,320
But, but, that doesn't mean his usefulness is at an end, because we're able to reanimate

1146
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:13,040
the fleshly vessels of these sacred scribes after we burn them out, and he pushes a broom

1147
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,880
around the laboratories even as we speak.

1148
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,640
You serious?

1149
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:17,580
Yeah.

1150
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,060
All right.

1151
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,420
So, he's...

1152
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,920
We let him take care of all the soles we have in storage down there.

1153
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,880
Like, for instance, that last caller.

1154
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,360
His sole is in a blue canister in my basement, believe it or not, and you think we're kidding.

1155
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,240
No, you suck him into a soul tank?

1156
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,820
Yeah, and we turn him in.

1157
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,820
See, that's how we managed to pay for Bob's re-erection, see?

1158
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,000
We had to cash in the soles of those who were dumb enough to call this show, and friend,

1159
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,580
you're next.

1160
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,460
Don't be funny.

1161
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,000
Pull the lever.

1162
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,620
Down you go.

1163
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,380
All right, you're all fired.

1164
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,900
We're the ones.

1165
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,680
You can throw yourself off for nothing.

1166
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,200
Don't make no difference.

1167
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,660
It's good.

1168
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,880
There's nothing you can do about it.

1169
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,780
Oh, faceless surgeons, are you racers?

1170
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:14,220
Cut out, are you mad today?

1171
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,920
No, I'm not.

1172
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,040
No, I'm not.

1173
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,040


1174
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,080
I'm not.

1175
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1176
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1177
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1178
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1179
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1180
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1181
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1182
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1183
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1184
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1185
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1186
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1187
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1188
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,140


1189
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:16,200


1190
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:16,260


1191
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:16,260


1192
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:43,800
I don't understand anything.

1193
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,240
Now here's the problem.

1194
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,240


1195
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,240


1196
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,240


1197
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,020
So much easier to get than real slack, my friend.

1198
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
So much easier.

1199
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,320
All you have to do is work a 9-to-5 job.

1200
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,720
Or, you know, the equivalent.

1201
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,220
Whatever you do, it doesn't have to be a 9.

1202
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,980
You can be your own boss, entrepreneur, help.

1203
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:04,700
Whatever.

1204
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,440
It doesn't matter how you get the money.

1205
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:14,600
But the money can buy, can, can, false slack can only be had for money.

1206
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,180
Uh, true slack can be had for money.

1207
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,560
But you've got to have, you've got to have a slack, a slack awareness, my friend.

1208
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,880
More than you need money.

1209
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,740
You don't need money.

1210
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,120
You don't have to have money to have true slack.

1211
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,120
And that is the God's truth.

1212
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,340
Oh, no.

1213
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,340
I'm dreaming.

1214
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,880
None of this is true.

1215
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,720
If you cannot see it, you think it's not there.

1216
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,660
It doesn't work that way.

1217
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,780
They don't know that this is a conspiracy.

1218
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,060
This is for real.

1219
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,660
They're agnostic.

1220
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,120
They don't know.

1221
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,740
They have to see it in front of them before they know.

1222
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,400
And even then they deny it.

1223
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,240
The thing is, is that these people are real.

1224
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,880
And, uh, the pinks are the ones who actually do not exist.

1225
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,960
Because they're not awake enough to actually have consciousness.

1226
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,980
They haven't tuned into the dobs yet.

1227
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,440
Yeah, they're just, they're shit.

1228
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,920
They're tubes filled with video images.

1229
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:16,700
They're shadows.

1230
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,780
They're spirits.

1231
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,000
But they're not, they're not real.

1232
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:20,580
Yeah.

1233
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,260
By recreating body and mind out of remembered fragments,

1234
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,840
I was to program my own inferno.

1235
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,560
This is Kano and 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

1236
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:31,900
God.

1237
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,520
Well, he certainly lost his mind.

1238
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:34,940
Listen.

1239
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:40,380
In effect, my soul was a monstrous cancer,

1240
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,960
continually creating within itself the means of my destruction.

1241
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,360
A lost soul is one that no longer controls its own circuitry.

1242
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,080
But us has been taken over by the enemy,

1243
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,680
which uses it to destroy me, to destroy you.

1244
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,140
The sensation is like spontaneous combustion.

1245
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,900
I should have taken it off the hook.

1246
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,520
Oh, let it ring.

1247
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,820
And you take a message, would you?

1248
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,260
And leave it off the hook?

1249
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,940
Yeah, okay, okay, I'll get it.

1250
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:13,600
Go on, Linda.

1251
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,280
Go on.

1252
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,960
It is this control of the circuitry,

1253
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,180
this ability to send phantom signals to real bodies

1254
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,620
through their remembered images,

1255
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,420
like pins stuck in a doll,

1256
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,740
that gives hell its power on earth.

1257
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,100
Hell is not a place,

1258
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,360
but a system for disrupting the plans of God.

1259
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,740
She thinks you can cure the world by kindness and rules,

1260
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,580
but it's too small.

1261
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,500
The Lord's Prayer on a Pinhead.

1262
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,820
Some make rules, some obey,

1263
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,780
but the rules are for the fools is what I say.

1264
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,740
The pistol makes me sick.

1265
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,400
I wear the wrong clothes.

1266
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,960
I see the wrong things.

1267
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,860
You know I can't dance, my feet are much too wide.

1268
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,080
I'm a little down, too.

1269
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,540
Who think you set the trends?

1270
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,100
You wear your head just right.

1271
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,600
Your girls are out of sight.

1272
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
Your house is modern, really kitschy.

1273
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,780
You got it so macho in your way, you bitch.

1274
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,700
I see them going to work.

1275
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,220
I see them doing this work.

1276
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,720
I see them on TV.

1277
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,600
I see them laughing fly.

1278
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,020
I'm on the outside.

1279
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,660
I'm on the outside.

1280
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,380
I'm on the outside.

1281
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,440
It happens. Look around you.

1282
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,340
Look all around you.

1283
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,460
The rude clerks in stores that hate their job and take it out on you.

1284
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:42,640
The thing about the normals is that they conceptualize themselves to be hot sinus effluvia on silver platters,

1285
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,140
but in reality reveal themselves to be cold mucus.

1286
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,120
A cold mucus incrustation on a paper plate.

1287
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,520
Oh, that's right, friends.

1288
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,480
Cold mucus incrustation on a paper plate.

1289
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,640
And let's see what this lovely caller has to say.

1290
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,680
Hello, sister.

1291
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:01,520
Hi.

1292
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,380
Oh, praise Bob.

1293
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,460
Ah, yes.

1294
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,040
This is Bob's long lost wife, Mona.

1295
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,960
Do you want to say your name over the radio?

1296
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:10,600
Mona.

1297
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,380
Mona.

1298
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,100
Now, Bob has literally...

1299
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,720
I mean, this is a polygamous kingdom.

1300
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:21,420
Bob has a wife and family in every state of the Union that we know of.

1301
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,280
There may be other states that we don't even know of.

1302
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,760
Yeah, um...

1303
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,800
I mean, are you sure you aren't just trying to get in on his will?

1304
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,380
No, no, no.

1305
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:39,100
See, about, oh, many moons ago, Bob, well, he sort of came in late one night and he...

1306
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,480
Emergency from Bob for 9554?

1307
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,160
We don't need it. We don't need it.

1308
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:43,600
No.

1309
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,100
No.

1310
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,820
No.

1311
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,020
No.

1312
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,280
See, he keeps trying to walk back into my life.

1313
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,600
And he came into my room.

1314
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:57,020
It was late and he stole all my lingerie and he put on my...

1315
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,960
Now, that does sound like Bob.

1316
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,320
Yeah.

1317
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,380
He put on my panties and my nightgown and he said...

1318
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,800
That old damn Bob.

1319
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,660
Are you looking for him?

1320
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,600
Do you want to see him again or you got a message for him?

1321
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,260
Well, I can...

1322
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,680
We can send it to the post office box.

1323
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,500
I'll give you the PO box and just send it in.

1324
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,340
I want my lingerie back.

1325
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,080
Well, you'll have to work that out.

1326
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,080


1327
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,080


1328
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,080


1329
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,080


1330
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,080


1331
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,780
That's between you and Bob.

1332
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,920
If you see Bob, can you tell him his wife, his long-lost wife, wants her lingerie back?

1333
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,520
And that's the Marna wife, right?

1334
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:23,900
Yeah.

1335
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:24,600
Write to Bob.

1336
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:31,320
Write to Bob at PO Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1337
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,980
Ask for info on the lingerie.

1338
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,220
I'll read that address one more time.

1339
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:41,360
Also, I want anybody to send personal messages for the Hour of Slack radio ministry to me,

1340
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,980
Pastor Bucknaked, or any tags.

1341
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,060
I'll send you a message.

1342
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,060


1343
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,320
I'll get you the tapes or whatever, especially tapes.

1344
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:53,440
Mark them Hour of Slack, Bucknaked, PO Box 140306, Dallas, 75214.

1345
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,100
How come they're marking them for you?

1346
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,620
Well, these are the ones that I'll hand.

1347
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,340
Oh, okay.

1348
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,040
That's right.

1349
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:01,300
Buck's gonna...

1350
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,760
If you want them for Stang, then put Stang on there, see?

1351
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,740
All right.

1352
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,880
Well, sister, Bob's been...

00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,760

00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,060

1387
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,940
guitar solo

1388
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,160
Oh, thanks, Buck and Buddy.

1389
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:34,940
That was a beautiful, beautiful rendition of that lovely church.

1390
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,740
We haven't been real heavy on the rock and roll tonight.

1391
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,460
It's been mostly the relaxing subgenius church.

1392
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:45,640
And that upsets some of our listeners, as we know, from that one call.

1393
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,280
He thinks we're doing the work of the devil.

1394
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,140
That guy's truly enlightened. You just didn't see it his way.

1395
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:52,980
Killer karma.

1396
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,260
You didn't see it his way. Now, I do see it his way.

1397
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,540
And that fellow is truly enlightened. He's awake on both glands.

1398
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,440
But that's the way religion is. It's been a constant battle since the very beginning.

1399
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,600
The first man to try to guess why he climbed out of the slime

1400
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,900
was the first man to pick up a stick and hit his brother.

1401
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,240
We've been programmed.

1402
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,860
Offer void where prohibited.

1403
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,160
This is the very beginning.

1404
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:22,340
Our slack was taken away the moment we entered this world where he's treadmill.

1405
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,980
And we've been running like little rats through a maze.

1406
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,880
And the only way you can get away from that is to deprogram.

1407
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,120
Edit your own memory. Take those bad memories.

1408
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,480
Take those horrible training regimens that you were subjected to as a youth.

1409
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,360
Flush them down the toilet as you excremeditate.

1410
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,080
Let me ask you. Let me ask you.

1411
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,560
Yes, sister.

1412
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,100
Did you ever own a guinea pig?

1413
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,540
I ate my guinea pigs. I grew them and I ate them.

1414
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,580
That's dick crazy, Bob.

1415
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,740
They were food. I'm a carnivore.

1416
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,900
I can't help myself.

1417
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,560
So what are some of the other enemies of the church?

1418
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:05,540
The box dwellers, the Barbies and Kins, the slackless ones.

1419
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:11,120
Yeah, the walking some nebulax, the great incurables.

1420
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,660
Those who can never know slack.

1421
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,300
The others from the third dimension, the green energy ghouls,

1422
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:22,800
the ghost.

1423
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:28,240
The devils, the supersonic Nazi hell creatures from the hollow earth,

1424
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,880
controlled by Hitler's brain.

1425
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,120
Maybe you can give us a little information as to the origin of the pinks and the normals.

1426
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,120
Well, the origin of the pinks and the normals, I mean, look around you.

1427
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:38,860
I'm looking.

1428
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,220
Well, perhaps not in your immediate company.

1429
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:41,780
Oh, okay.

1430
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,960
But look around you further.

1431
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,300
Extend your third nostril out into the world.

1432
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,660
Look at those people out there.

1433
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,960
Look at them lining up in front of those elevators.

1434
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:53,480
Yeah.

1435
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,440
At the Heimlich building.

1436
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:54,900
I'm looking.

1437
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,460
I'm looking at them.

1438
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,700
Look at them driving those cars.

1439
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,140
Look at those insurance salesmen.

1440
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,880
Look at those tyrannical elementary school principals.

1441
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:03,440
Uh huh.

1442
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,120
I'm seeing them.

1443
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,420
Yes.

1444
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,500
Well, look at them oppress.

1445
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,740
Oppress.

1446
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,180
Look at them drive you into the arms of the conspiracy.

1447
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,440
Look at them make you want to be popular.

1448
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,900
Look at them want to make you consume those goods.

1449
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Well, they're just taking away your will.

1450
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,400
I'm beginning to feel something.

1451
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:17,780
Exactly.

1452
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,960
Something's leaving.

1453
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,280
The trilateral commission.

1454
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:20,940
Uh huh.

1455
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,620
Commission of 40.

1456
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,340
Right.

1457
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:23,440
They're trying to put conspiracy.

1458
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,520
Well, these conspiracies are but specks of dust, sparkles of sand on the beach.

1459
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,120
Ah, yes.

1460
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:36,200
Sparkles of sand on the beach compared to the vast conspiracy of normalcy that's trying

1461
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,740
to get you, my friends.

1462
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,020
We're going to go through the phones one last time before we play the end credits.

1463
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,200
I lost him again.

1464
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,020
Darn it.

1465
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,860
Oh, we hold another soul in perdition.

1466
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,080
Yeah.

1467
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,740
I guess it's incompetence.

1468
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,800
Well, you know what, Buck?

1469
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,000
I really, I...

1470
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,740
Call back.

1471
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,080
Line three, please call back.

1472
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:57,560
Yeah.

1473
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,200
I've done it again.

1474
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,380
But I am going to play the long credits of the hour slack.

1475
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,200
See, we play so many different people's little bits and cuts.

1476
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,240
There's subgeniuses all...

1477
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:07,280
He's back.

1478
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:07,660
Oh, he's back?

1479
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:07,860
He's back.

1480
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,160
Okay, let's just put him straight on.

1481
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,000
And, uh, dear friend.

1482
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,440
Hello?

1483
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,600
Uh, dear friend.

1484
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:16,920
Hello?

1485
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,200
No, it's just interference.

1486
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,360
Hello?

1487
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,820
Get off line three.

1488
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:22,780
He's off line three.

1489
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:22,780


1490
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:22,780


1491
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:22,780


1492
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:22,780


1493
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,280
Say hi.

1494
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,300
What's wrong?

1495
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,820
I don't know what's wrong.

1496
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,040
Am I doing it?

1497
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,080
Yeah, we...

1498
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,020
So, I think somebody's talking to him on the other line.

1499
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:32,300
Hello?

1500
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,220
Because he's not on hold, is he?

1501
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:34,300
Oh.

1502
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,500
Well...

1503
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,200
Was it Adolf?

1504
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:36,940
Friends?

1505
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,500
What I was about to say was...

1506
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,180
Hey, hey, hey.

1507
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:40,720
Oh, there we are.

1508
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,180
Hello.

1509
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:41,960
I am, hey.

1510
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,360
You're on.

1511
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,480
We finally...

1512
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,360
Okay, now make it quick.

1513
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:44,880
What is it?

1514
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:45,320
Okay, Doug.

1515
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:45,900
Okay.

1516
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,240
There's no Doug here.

1517
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:47,760
Why the subgenius church...

1518
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,000
The subgenius church is not a satanic church, right?

1519
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:51,680
Sure.

1520
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,860
That's what the devil gives you, right?

1521
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:54,700
Right.

1522
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,260
Okay.

1523
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,980
Now, the devil promises you lots of money for your lifetime, right?

1524
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,680
Cool.

1525
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:05,200
Then he admits you've got an immortal life after that, right?

1526
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:05,860
Right.

1527
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,240
And how nasty, nasty...

1528
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,060
That's stupid.

1529
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,240
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

1530
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,800
Now, who would fight for such a crummy deal like that?

1531
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,580
One of those...

1532
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:14,840
Right?

1533
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,580
Bob gives you slack now and slack ever after.

1534
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:19,440
Yes.

1535
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1536
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,920
The tricky part is figuring out which is the slack and which is the false slack.

1537
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,220
And the one...

1538
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,180
The devil is the...

1539
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,680
The devil, my friends.

1540
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:32,320
So what?

1541
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,340
The devil's got...

1542
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:33,880
The devil's in the supermarket.

1543
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,740
The devil is in the post office, my friends.

1544
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,840
The devil is in the IRS and he's waiting to sell you a vacuum cleaner.

1545
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,780
Look, the devil has souls, right?

1546
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,960
But the devil doesn't have any money.

1547
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,000
The devil doesn't ask you for money, right?

1548
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,380
Oh, come on.

1549
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,160
Oh, hey, look.

1550
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,600
We've got to play the credits.

1551
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:52,780
Thank you.

1552
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1553
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1554
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1555
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1556
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1557
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1558
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1559
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1560
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1561
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,780


1562
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,680
Thanks for sharing that with us.

1563
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:09,360
The voices you've been listening to come from Leepo Abernathy, Buck Naked and the Jaybirds,

1564
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:22,760
Dr. Odin Canobite, G. Gordon Gordon, Killer for Bob, Dr. Spock, and Dr. Spock.

1565
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:22,760


1566
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:22,760


1567
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:40,040
Dr. Philo Drummond, Overman First Degree, Reverend Cleve Donut Duncan, Dr. Snavely Eklund.

1568
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,100
Hey, what are you getting to?

1569
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,360
This is the D-Word and Apple.

1570
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,080
Or the Angkor.

1571
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,760
Now that you have paradigm perspective, let's move on to the shift in your mind.

1572
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:52,760


1573
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,560
This is Dr. Ahmed Fishman.

1574
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,620
This is Glass Madness.

1575
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:06,980
This is Herr Dr. Chris Gross.

1576
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,600
This is Hell's Mommy Satellite Rebirth.

1577
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:17,300
And this is Negative Land.

1578
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,740
These are the fantastic two-person castles.

1579
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:22,740


1580
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:22,740


1581
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,240
Cameras are swinging love corpses as we venture to the fifth planet.

1582
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:24,280
So that you may immediately know, go ahead andуйте a little bit more and you should know

1583
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1584
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1585
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1586
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1587
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1588
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1589
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1590
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1591
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1592
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1593
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1594
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,280


1595
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:24,260
