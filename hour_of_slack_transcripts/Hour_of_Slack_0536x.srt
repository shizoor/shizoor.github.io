1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:09,840
Yes dear friends, we're back and I apologize for this terrible microphone that I'm using right now.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,000
It'd be five minutes into the X-Day drill.

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:23,960
My old microphone I've been using for an hour of slack for the last seven or eight years was busted by a drunk.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,340
But that's okay dear friends because it forced us to use a better microphone.

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,720
At least there and you'll hear that later.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,140
But not now.

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,080
Now I'm on the cheap one.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,460
And now I'm reminded that, you know, we love the stations that play this show.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,300
And we haven't given them enough individual credit.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,600
So for the next few shows I'm going to say howdy to specific stations.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,440
In this case, howdy to listeners at WMSE.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,600
Man.

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,320
Y'all are up early, early in the morning I believe there.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,280
That's in, wait a minute.

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,020
Where is that?

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,320
It's a place I've been.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,660
It's, it's, Milwaukee that's right.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,080
We did a GWAR show there.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:27,120
And a special thanks there to Reverend Yukon Jack and Eris Pagana.

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,280
Hi old Reverend Yukon.

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,060
Yukon Jack is on some of the old media broads or Bob songs type.

22
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,080
You know my memory, my memory is fried friends.

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,680
Because we're back from the X Day drill in New York.

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,580
We're burnt.

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,760
We're toasted.

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,900
We're crisped.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,720
But not from fropping, unfortunately.

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,020
But from recording and logging and dubbing and crucifying and baptizing.

29
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,760
And the drill was...

30
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,720
Well from our standpoint it was a huge success dear friends.

31
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,760
We made a little money.

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,520
We learned what not to do on the real X Day.

33
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,700
We captured tons of good music and preaching coming up.

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,000
And we gave the bobbies their 25 bucks worth that's for sure.

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:23,260
In the form of slack, violence, pills, naked male and female flesh, the scourging of Jesus

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,800
and the crucifixion of dogs.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
And friends you are now listening to...

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,180
Uh...

39
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,940
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

40
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,480
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

41
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,360
Well maybe it's more like an hour.

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:55,460
But friends that X Day drill at the Brushwood Folklore Center campground in Sherman, New York.

43
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,120
Far western, very rural New York.

44
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:05,880
Was in fact such an intense weekend that only about a dozen people were able to drag themselves

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,620
out of their hangovers for the 7 a.m. Sunday church services and simulated rupture.

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,800
And so we know who takes this stuff seriously now friends.

47
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,540
And it ain't many.

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,560
But we are currently in the strenuous process of culling down the 10 hours of tape into

49
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,980
one two hour video.

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,160
And we are in the process of cutting down the 10 hours of tape into one two hour video.

51
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,940
And maybe the next three hours of slack.

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,880
Starting now with this one.

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,220
Number 536.

54
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:44,860
And there will be color pictures aplenty upon our website of such wonders as the all nude

55
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,760
baptism in the swimming pool conducted by Jesus and Dr. Legue.

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,840
And Sister Susie the floozy having her way with a prairie squid.

57
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,880
Dr. Legue mutilating his own face.

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:10,780
The Dobbs effigy burning upon a cross in the presence yet of Neegie, JFK, the Greys and

59
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,760
the whole crowd.

60
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,560
Friends we have pictures and videos of the execution of one of my illegitimate wives

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,860
following my kidnapping.

62
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,580
And power packed preaching and music by Bill T. Miller.

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,100
The swinging love corpses as heard in the background.

64
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,860
Dr. Legue mutilating his own face.

65
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,760
Papa Joe Mama, Susie the floozy, Andrew the impaled, Saint Andrew the non impaled, Jehovah

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,020
hates Fred, Reverend Nicky, Dr. Dinosaur, Steve, Slack, Taller Star, P. Kitty and many

67
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,780
many more.

68
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,960
Friends there were free pills, there really were UFO sightings, there was suspense, nudity,

69
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:57,160
weird altars, sacrifices, dead people and tons of sacred Dobbs goods sold and in short

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,200
it was a blast.

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,740
And I'm now going to start wending my way down through these tapes.

72
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,820
I've got 24 pages just of the log of these tapes.

73
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:14,800
So we'll get into that but in the meantime let's just lean back and listen to this incredible

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,960
swinging love corpses warm up jam from the ex-Daytree alum.

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,400
.

76
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,460
.

77
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,460

120
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,480
But for some geniuses!

121
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,140
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more!

122
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,220
That is the message.

123
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,920
Double cock, a potion of work!

124
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,140
Now as Jesus and Stang were saying, that is the real message.

125
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,080
Double cock, a potion of work!

126
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,920
Money, right here, give to Bob, slap it out, go straight into Stang's pocket and he will funnel it to Bob.

127
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:36,200
On the way up here, the son of God here, and El Diablo here, running the take-back,

128
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,360
he's here for Satan, his son.

129
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,720
The son of God, Jesus' big brother, and they stop at the Rainbow Gathering,

130
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,760
which was on the way, it was in the Ozarks this year.

131
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,120
Hey man, they love you.

132
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,620
They're your brothers.

133
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,820
Welcome home, man.

134
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,420
Welcome home.

135
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:08,880
And it was all, it seemed all fun, you know, sort of lovey and mindless,

136
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,200
and all that.

137
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,120
You know, good vibes and so forth.

138
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:19,480
Except there was one really perverted, sick, sick, sick thing.

139
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,720
They didn't take money.

140
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:30,720
Yeah, they thought, oh, we're gonna defeat the man, we're gonna defeat the conspiracy, Babylon's gonna fall, baby.

141
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,120
We'll just withdraw from their system, and like, what they're really saying is,

142
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,200
if we pray hard enough, God will take money.

143
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
And if we pray hard enough, God will take care of everything.

144
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,820
Well, Jehovah's blood may have something in mind, starting with Fred, and building up to the pigs,

145
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,420
and then probably the rest of us.

146
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:57,060
The only thing standing in between us and Jehovah's blood squashing us with the pigs and the humans

147
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,440
is that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

148
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:06,740
And the only thing that's keeping J.R. Bob Dobbs motivated is your faith, your trust in that man, Bob, and your money.

149
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,180
How does he know you trust him and love him and hate him, and have faith in him?

150
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,660
And even give a shit?

151
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:18,160
You could work for Bob all day long, all night long, for years and years.

152
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,780
He'll still chastise you.

153
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,780
Ask Will of Dogs.

154
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,960
You can, you know, ask me.

155
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:32,120
You can do the greatest painting, the beautiful painting for the book cover for, you know, the third Bible.

156
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,200
You could do, you could get a radio show going for Bob, and so forth and so forth.

157
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,880
But you can give your children.

158
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:48,140
Bob knows when it comes down to it, you don't care about your fucking radio show, your kids, your car, or your talent, or any of that.

159
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,820
The only thing that really, really counts, and that's what those rainbow people wouldn't admit, is your money.

160
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,680
The only way to defeat the conspiracy at this point, I mean, let's face it.

161
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:07,420
They won 2,000 years ago, as soon as they offed Jesus, or whatever, I don't know how that happened, and Pete took over the PR.

162
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,640
Which, of course, probably happened to the church at Subgenius after X day, two years from now.

163
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,060
But, I don't know what I was about to say, but God damn it, we hate them, because they don't have Bob, and we do.

164
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,980
That's good enough reason not to.

165
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,420
And the money is, that's how Bob knows you love him.

166
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,120
That's how Bob knows you trust him, is that green money.

167
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,700
You kid, those rainbow people, I don't know, man, it's just, to me, we want to, we are here to fight the conspiracy.

168
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:46,560
But how do you do something about a thing that big, so insidious that it's even inside every Subgenius?

169
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:53,260
Every Subgenius except Bob is tainted with the conspiracy, because every Subgenius except Bob still thinks false.

170
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,640
That is wrong! You do not use your mind to think about your religion!

171
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,440
You don't use your mind!

172
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,220
But, you have to use your mind to fake out the conspiracy. You don't need much.

173
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,180
You don't need much, praise Bob, or we'd be fucked.

174
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,900
But, we can, we can, we can, and we, you know, we can say, well, how are we going to bring down the conspiracy?

175
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,420
I know, let's form a secret anti-government group and blow up the federal building.

176
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,080
Well, I can see where people are coming from with that, but that is so half-assed!

177
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,020
They are thinking too small!

178
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,840
All that does is it turns them into walking targets, you know?

179
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,840
And they might as well be wearing a big bullseye on their chest.

180
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,680
I'm so macho, I'm against the government, and I'm carrying a bomb to North Carolina.

181
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,480
I'm going to do something about it.

182
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,460
Oh, that's smart, man! Real macho, maybe.

183
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,460
Dumb fucking shit.

184
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,480
So, Brad, you know, if you're going to fuck with that shit, use a goddamn nuclear weapon!

185
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,540
Nuclear weapons cost money!

186
00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:00,640
You can get a Ukrainian bomb for about $25,000 like a black market now.

187
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,060
Now, we were given, I don't want to name numbers or anything,

188
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,360
but we do have some material in that department.

189
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,860
But we need more!

190
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,320
The conspiracy has, as I've said a million times, the conspiracy has got 100,000 nuclear weapons between their different factions.

191
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,400
We've only got three, well, well, four.

192
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,760
But we need at least six!

193
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,680
How many Disney lands are there?

194
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah!

195
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,180
There's like four or five of them, right?

196
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,480
Two!

197
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,160
Okay, well, we've got a few other places.

198
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,180
And, you know, we could, sure, we can wait two years for the X's to come, obviously.

199
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,340
But is Bob going to be impressed if we sit on our butts watching the X-Files until X-Day?

200
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Well, actually, in some cases, if that's within your slack, then that's the thing to do.

201
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,960
However, some of us are rather agitated.

202
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,740
And we, you know, just to impress Bob, just for no other reason than to impress Bob,

203
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,280
we'd like to make enough money to buy the conspiracy!

204
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,180
You cannot destroy it from inside.

205
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,320
Because they pay you too well, and you end up going, well, this isn't so bad.

206
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,080
And you can't burn it down by dropping bombs and stuff on him.

207
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,780
Because, you know, then you end up like Koresh, and he didn't even do it.

208
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,520
You know, not hardly.

209
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,800
And so, the only way, the only weapon they understand is money!

210
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,760
Big goddamn bucks!

211
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,120
And as St. Jane of Iconclete once said,

212
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,920
to destroy utterly and forever the concept of money,

213
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,860
friends, it's going to take money.

214
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,400
It's going to take a hell of a lot of money.

215
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,580
And I know that most of you probably don't have that much, except for you over there!

216
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,880
Yes, sir, I see you, I know!

217
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,680
I'm in the service, I know you, sir, have got that cushy job, and you've been feeling guilty.

218
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,180
I know it. You've been feeling it.

219
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,020
It's like, well, if I start buying this shit...

220
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,020
Would you like your attention, please?

221
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,320
It's come to security's attention that there are some people who are on the grounds

222
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,260
who are not affiliated with the Church of the Subgenius or the Drum Fest.

223
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,000
These people are from the local Baptist act-up style organization.

224
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:14,700
What?

225
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,280
So you will be able to see them. They are in the woods tonight.

226
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,400
Oh, man!

227
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,180
If you ever come across one of these people,

228
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,520
subdue him and bring him to security at once.

229
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,000
Also, the mother of one of Reverend Stane's children,

230
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,520
one of his illegitimate children, is here.

231
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,840
She's really pissed off. She's got her period.

232
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,280
So we've gone well beyond PMS.

233
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,240
So we're going to be keeping real close eye on the situation here.

234
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,920
If anything comes up, we'll keep you informed of it. Thank you.

235
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,800
I do approve. Chief Security.

236
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,920
And your friend, believe it or not.

237
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,160
Silence!

238
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,700
All the way left!

239
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:13,020
Friends, we cannot let this day go by without uttering a few words about Independence Day.

240
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,500
Bad movie.

241
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,120
In less than 20 minutes, it will no longer be July 5th.

242
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,580
And from two years hence, another Independence Day will come.

243
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,000
Now, I know a lot of you have conspiracy notions about what Independence Day is.

244
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,320
We've all heard that 200 years plus ago,

245
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,200
our founding fathers planted the seeds of freedom in the sacred soil

246
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,640
that sprouted forth the democracy in which we all live,

247
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,840
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

248
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,960
And somewhere along that line, the conspiracy got ahold of it.

249
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,780
But we don't hear about it, we just see it, and they kind of turn it around on us.

250
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,680
And, you know, the next thing you know, we're all paying taxes,

251
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,900
and we're all kind of bowing down to the almighty dollar,

252
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,180
and, you know, what we have is what we get.

253
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,560
Like they say, democracy is the lack of people they deserve.

254
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,440
But,

255
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,980
there's something else that happened a few decades ago.

256
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
1984, actually.

257
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,680
A man gave his life

258
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,400
so that we could be free.

259
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,360
Now, he didn't have to give his life.

260
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,080
He could have just walked across that stage and taken his vows.

261
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,600
He didn't have to sit there and stick his head right in front of that bullet for puzzling evidence.

262
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
No, he chose to do that.

263
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,840
In fact, he allowed that bullet to zigzag through his body.

264
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,300
Several times.

265
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,860
Simply so that he could die repeatedly for our freedom.

266
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,960
Do we know that man's name?

267
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,260
BOO!

268
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,220
We have it burned into our hearts.

269
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,700
He died for our independence.

270
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,260
Now, two years from now, we are going to celebrate that independence.

271
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,020
And not on July 4th, but on July 5th.

272
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,160
Because it's not independence so much from the con, which it is,

273
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,920
but it's also independence from the people who formed the con.

274
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,300
The pinks and normals who infest our world.

275
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,300
Now, what is our duty in the next two years?

276
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,180
We have a sacred duty.

277
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,500
It's more than just to stockpile weapons.

278
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,620
It's more than to grit our teeth.

279
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,420
It's more than to sharpen our knives.

280
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,220
It is to bear witness, dear friends,

281
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,140
to witness

282
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,980
the conspiracy in action.

283
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,780
Our job is to watch and see the sins ooze forth

284
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,420
of the conspiracy each and every day.

285
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,920
Because, hundreds of years hence,

286
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,420
as we live immortal lives on Planet X,

287
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,620
our children and great-great-great-great-grandchildren

288
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,780
will grow up in a society free of pinks.

289
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,180
They will not know what normals are.

290
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,360
They'll only have books and comic books to tell them what it was all about.

291
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,520
And they're going to ask you sometime or another,

292
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,660
great-great-great-great-grandpa,

293
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,660
why did you do it?

294
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,240
Why did you kill them all?

295
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,820
Was it really necessary?

296
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,900
You must say yes,

297
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,620
and you'll have to sit them down and explain to them why.

298
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,540
And you must have that look of truth in your eye.

299
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,440
You must be able to ooze forth from your soul

300
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,740
total dedication, truth, honor, and say,

301
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,060
yes, oh God, if you only knew!

302
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,440
If only you knew!

303
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,560
So, that's what we have in the next two years.

304
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,320
To see it, to feel it, to suffer it,

305
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,160
not just for us, but for them.

306
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,020
Now, on a parting note,

307
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,520
I would also like to address this famous movie,

308
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,580
which I'm sure all of you are going to see, about Independence Day.

309
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,820
I know a lot of you out there think,

310
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,700
ah, it's a conspiracy movie, it's shitty,

311
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,500
don't want to go see it, blah blah blah.

312
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,560
Friends, the conspiracy did not make this movie.

313
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,680
We made this movie.

314
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,200
And you're probably thinking,

315
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,660
wait a minute, wait a minute, Papa Joe,

316
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,160
I'm having some difficulty here.

317
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,380
I thought the premise in Independence Day, the movie,

318
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,920
was that they somehow repelled the ex-Essentially invasion.

319
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,580
How can this be?

320
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,540
Ah, Bob works in mysterious ways, my friends.

321
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,440
You see, we,

322
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,350
we want them to think that they are going to rebel the next time.

323
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:29,650
Woohoo!

324
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,330
Ah, fucking Bob!

325
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,730
Surprise is our greatest weapon.

326
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,450
When you walk forth from here and they ask you,

327
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,070
what was this docks talk about?

328
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,410
What was this burning cross?

329
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,710
What was this, these screaming Nazis,

330
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,850
these people in paramilitary outfits,

331
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,490
what was this about?

332
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,130
You say, ah, it's a joke.

333
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,410
It's a satire.

334
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,410
Oh, have you seen the movie Independence Day?

335
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,350
You have nothing to worry about.

336
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,910
When you see the movie Independence Day,

337
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,910
you may just watch the credits.

338
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,630
And when that special effects supervisor comes up,

339
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,430
top of the credits,

340
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,270
and it says, Doug Smith,

341
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,610
we're not going to go into any significance that that name has.

342
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,470
For those who know Independence Day,

343
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,270
and those who say don't know or shouldn't know,

344
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,830
but you will know what that movie is really all about.

345
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,910
Praise be Doug Smith.

346
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,230
So let us again join hands in remembrance

347
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,770
of what Independence Day really is.

348
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,490
Freedom from them.

349
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,890
Praise Bob!

350
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,470
Oh, amen.

351
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,270
Amen, Papa Joe.

352
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,010
He's absolutely right, brothers and sisters.

353
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,410
He's absolutely right.

354
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,730
They're going to think they can just be able to repel the aliens.

355
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,130
But it's not true.

356
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,350
We all know it's not true.

357
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,990
We know they have no chance of it.

358
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,650
But hey, if they don't have a little spark of hope,

359
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,870
what is there for us to crush?

360
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,110
Can I get an amen?

361
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,190
Amen!

362
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,430
Can I get an hallelujah?

363
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,690
Hallelujah!

364
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,690
Whoo! Yeah, brothers and sisters.

365
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,850
Yeah, they think they're going to repel them.

366
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,590
And when they go rallying around the American flags,

367
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,350
we'll be able to get a whole shitload of them with just one shot.

368
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,370
Whoo!

369
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,570
Yeah, brothers.

370
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,950
Oh, yeah, people have died for that flag.

371
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,630
And more will.

372
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,690
Amen!

373
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,310
Whoo!

374
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,130
Yeah!

375
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,670
Yeah!

376
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,090
Yeah!

377
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:32,650
Yeah!

378
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,890
And now, Dr. Dinosaur.

379
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:52,390
I'm going to tell you a story.

380
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,390


381
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,070
My father was a salesman, a pretty lucky guy.

382
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,830
He could sell you anything.

383
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,590
You'd never know why.

384
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:08,470
While working on his TV one dark and stormy night,

385
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,430
Jehovah changed his channel and filled his head with light.

386
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,330
He got immaculation.

387
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,110
He learned about the score.

388
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,350
He quit the conspiracy.

389
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,970
So they declared war.

390
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,690
Bob went to bed for the yetting sin to try to get the slack.

391
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,730
The conspiracy had stolen.

392
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,450
Bob's boy had given it back.

393
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,490
Bob Dobbs, the mystic salesman.

394
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,170
Bob Dobbs, the mystic salesman.

395
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,990
His comrades fought beside him.

396
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:57,430
Stang and the rest of all the great slack masters.

397
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,310
Bob was the best.

398
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:05,950
The conspiracy decided to fill in Bob's last page.

399
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,030
So they shot him in San Francisco.

400
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,790
They shot him on the stage.

401
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,150
Bob Dobbs, the short duration savior.

402
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,150
Bob Dobbs, the mystic salesman.

403
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,150


404
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,110
Bob Dobbs, the short duration savior.

405
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,070
Bob Dobbs, the short duration savior.

406
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,130
Bob Dobbs, the short duration savior.

407
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,730
Master of magic sales hype.

408
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,070
It's still easy to see his head floating.

409
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,710
Made out of little dots.

410
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,130
And the only thing that's changed is the way he talks.

411
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:47,130


412
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:51,090
In the eternal glow of Bob's magic pipe

413
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:56,930
In the eternal glow of Bob's magic pipe

414
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,270
Bob searched the universe for the gods who'd done him in

415
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:10,530
He found Jehovah in his corporate galaxy of sin

416
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:16,310
Bob called down the axis and gave his famous grin

417
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:22,310
The saucers tried the normals but they saved his Yeti chin

418
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,870
Bob Dobbs, the short-duration savior

419
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,610
Bob Dobbs, the short-duration savior

420
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:39,590
The short-duration savior still leads the way to slack

421
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:45,270
The Yeti rode the saucers, they're not coming back

422
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,290
Bob Dobbs, the short-duration savior

423
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:46,290


424
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:51,030
The conspiracy has no one to steal from but themselves

425
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,930
Bob will sell them ice in hell

426
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,250
And if I know those con gooks, they'll buy it

427
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:00,590
Yeah!

428
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,470
Yeah!

429
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:02,650
Yeah!

430
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,910
Yeah!

431
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:04,670


432
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:04,690
Yeah!

433
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,190
Yeah!

434
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:05,410


435
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:05,730


436
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:05,770


437
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,210
Yeah!

438
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,250
Yeah!

439
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,570
Yeah!

440
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:10,650
Yeah!

441
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,090
Yeah!

442
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,150
Yeah!

443
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,570
Yeah!

444
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:15,750
Now what?

445
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,270
I'm just making it up.

446
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,290
I am the king of slack.

447
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,570
Hey, you kings of feedback!

448
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,890
Turn on, tune in, and go to LA.

449
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,450
Oh!

450
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:27,690
Go!

451
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:27,950
Go!

452
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,610
Go!

453
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:28,930
Go!

454
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,250
Go!

455
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:29,330
Go!

456
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:29,610
Go!

457
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:29,650
Go!

458
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:29,730
Go!

459
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,270
Go!

460
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:31,470
Go!

461
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:31,470


462
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:31,470


463
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:31,470


464
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:31,790
Go!

465
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,870
Wait, what? Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no.

466
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,730
A little dance number for you kids.

467
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,550
X-Days are coming!

468
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,590
And the Pigs are bumming!

469
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,810
Ah!

470
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:15,750
Ah!

471
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,350
Ah!

472
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:43,290
Seems like all we ever do is eat, get stoned, and watch the tube, man.

473
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,530
As you know, there's supposedly 10,000 doctor bands here ready to play.

474
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,950
And the lineup is endless.

475
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,770
There's a lot of people.

476
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:01,770


477
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,750
Steve's slacking.

478
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,190
The thrills just keep coming, dear friend.

479
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,210
You ragged for me?

480
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,770
You ragged for me?

481
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:31,770


482
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,410
You'd better be ready to face the consequences dear friends!

483
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,210
I've come for your soul!

484
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,030
You'd better be ready for me from beyond!

485
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,370
For little boys and girls!

486
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,830
I'm here for your soul!

487
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,110
Heavy metal!

488
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:07,870
I used to be a nice guy just like you!

489
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,830
And then I found that taking our soul is what Bob really needs!

490
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,010
You will never escape the eyes!

491
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,330
The eyes of Bob!

492
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,150
They'll follow you wherever you go!

493
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,210
You came for me!

494
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,390
You'd better be prepared to face the consequences little boys and girls!

495
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,110
We're here for your souls!

496
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,890
One last chance!

497
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,130
That's all you have!

498
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,070
You can never escape the eyes!

499
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,230
You ran for me from beyond!

500
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:14,630
You thought you'd have a little fun with that Bob thing didn't you?

501
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,830
Oh I'll just get some extra slack!

502
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,750
Oh why hell it's just a joke!

503
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,690
Just a funny joke boys and girls!

504
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,150
More!

505
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:28,250
More!

506
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:28,830
More!

507
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:31,890
More!

508
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,170
More!

509
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,310
I will never escape the eyes!

510
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:50,170
And then so there is an agent here, we know it, we don't know which federal agency,

511
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:56,670
might even be bigger than federal, might be a circle of ten, could be...

512
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,230
I flew a black helicopter once, does that make me an eligible?

513
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:58,810
What?

514
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,110
I flew a black helicopter once, does that make me an eligible?

515
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,170
No, hell no!

516
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:21,710
Oh sorry, he could be the one, just trying to act like he's joking about it, which would be, that would be a good way to be a spy, you know, so there's, we just, well we don't want to panic people or you know get everybody worried or anything like that, but just keep your eyes open.

517
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:28,350
If you see anything that somebody doing something that you think is suspicious, tell me or Dr. Legume or the Lord or...

518
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,450
The schedule!

519
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,170
Oh, the schedule!

520
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,310
There is a schedule.

521
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:31,630
What?

522
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,830
There is a schedule.

523
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:33,310
Damn!

524
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,290
There it is!

525
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,030
7 a.m. Sunday morning church services.

526
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:46,230
You should show up before like quarter of, so as to get your pill, we'll be handing out one pill to each person.

527
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,170
Quarter of.

528
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:54,170
And as we explained, don't take the pill until we give the signal at exactly 7 a.m.

529
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:59,030
Speaking of which, if anybody has a watch that is actually very good, then...

530
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,470
And that one will, has the true time?

531
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,910
Okay, then you shall be the timekeeper.

532
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,410
The official timekeeper of X-Day 96.

533
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,890
The official timekeeper of a plentiful of thoughts.

534
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:14,550
And if you happen to be a virgin, we have a other thing we'd like to talk to you about.

535
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,290
Don't talk to Bob.

536
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,010
If you see him, do not talk to Bob.

537
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,370
If Bob gets hold of her...

538
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,130
It's been arranged.

539
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,330
It's been arranged.

540
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:22,510
Oh, well, okay.

541
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,970
It was one of the...

542
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,230
It's all good.

543
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:24,790
It's been arranged.

544
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,450
It's been arranged.

545
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,150
It's been arranged.

546
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,710
And you know that at some point during the weekend, ten people in here are going to die.

547
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,490
Cool.

548
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,210
Pray...

549
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,010
Me, me, me, me, me.

550
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:34,890
...that you are one of them.

551
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,810
Me, me, me.

552
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,610
Please, Lagoon.

553
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,070
Plus, I mean, this is the X-Day drill.

554
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,810
This isn't a subgenius defival.

555
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,210
And there's the stage.

556
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,850
And if anybody doesn't like what's going on up there, if you can kick the band's ass,

557
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,330
then maybe you can get them off.

558
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:55,490
If you decide you have to testify, you're suddenly moved to the spirit, or if you have

559
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:01,230
any doubt, you have even sat around for days preparing some long, intricate rant and slideshow

560
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,430
and so forth, just do it.

561
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:02,490


562
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:02,970
What the hell?

563
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,610
You know, you don't need to ask anybody.

564
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,750
You might wait until whoever's up there is done.

565
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,310
You know, there may be a line form.

566
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,130
It may be...

567
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,550
Just get on that stage and groove with the best.

568
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,130
That's all we ask.

569
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:14,370
Yeah.

570
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,610
Also, generally the best show is not anywhere near the stage.

571
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,430
That's certainly true at the defival.

572
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:20,990
That's true.

573
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,470
And so, you know, I've never been in a situation where I've been invited to a show.

574
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,470


575
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,470


576
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,470


577
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,470


578
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,470


579
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,610
I've been to an X Day drill before.

580
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,830
I've seen some pretty scary stuff going on in the woods.

581
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:37,270
Well, I know we promised free prairie squid to everybody, and as it turned out, we can't

582
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,890
offer it free, but it's only 50 cents.

583
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,930
There will be a prairie squid tent.

584
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,990
We'll set it up tomorrow.

585
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:47,430
I didn't want to set it up today because they get kind of rank after, you know, a second

586
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:47,710
day.

587
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,930
So, there's somewhere right in an inappropriate place in the middle of the field, there'll

588
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,750
be a tent.

589
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,750
There'll be a sign up.

590
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,010
The squid will be in there.

591
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:55,310
We'll have a little bit of fun.

592
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:55,310


593
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,750
There'll probably be a long line.

594
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,610
You know, there's a de-beaking tool.

595
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,450
There is a slight charge rental for the de-beaking tool.

596
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:03,890
That's $100.

597
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,930
No, no, it's nothing like that.

598
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:06,630
It's $900.

599
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,270
If you're brave.

600
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,550
Two-hour minimum on the tool.

601
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,330
Keep things.

602
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:15,150
The squid, put the squid back in the cooler when you're finished with your business.

603
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,830
Have any cases of AIDS come from prairie squid?

604
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,790
Prairie squid, well, that's, you take your risk, you know.

605
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,450
Keep in mind that it's a little bit of a risk.

606
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:25,450


607
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:25,450


608
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:25,450


609
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:25,450


610
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:25,450


611
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:25,450


612
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:25,650
It's a little bit of a risk.

613
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:25,650


614
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:25,650


615
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:30,330
But it probably, oh, okay, there's a safe sex, if you all saw that thing.

616
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,450
That's a sign of hope, isn't it?

617
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:37,610
When you drive up to a place and there's a little booth up there, safe sex and something

618
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,030
else.

619
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,330
Ice.

620
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,610
It's condoms, dental bands, gloves.

621
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:40,790
That's ice.

622
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:40,790


623
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,790
You know, big red straps.

624
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,890
And with naked people behind the bus.

625
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,490
Ooh.

626
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,430
Yeah.

627
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,090
Yeah.

628
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,430
For those of you who have never seen the movie, the movie is on the screen.

629
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,430


630
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,430


631
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,430


632
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,430


633
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,430


634
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,430


635
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,550
If you've never seen these before, these are called breasts.

636
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:00,430
What?

637
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:01,710
Stop.

638
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:08,230
Any of you subgenius members out there have never seen breasts before today, except in,

639
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,070
of course, pictures and on cable TV.

640
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,390
But these are not polyponential.

641
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,290
These are genuine, real breasts.

642
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:22,210
Most of you will never see these again after tomorrow.

643
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,990
In your dreams.

644
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,410
In your dreams.

645
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:25,410


646
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:25,410


647
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:25,410


648
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,450
So, don't feel shy about staring.

649
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,070
They're only what, $25 an hour?

650
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,750
Yeah, don't feel so bad about staring at them.

651
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,350
Oh, I love to be naked.

652
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:49,330
Now, one thing that I can say about this woman that would set her apart from most subgeniuses

653
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:54,390
is that there's a real good chance that she's going to get to bed down a woman tonight.

654
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,410
I'm not saying that she's going to get to bed tonight.

655
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:55,410


656
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,010
Your mother is my lawyer.

657
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,010


658
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,750
Ah, very good.

659
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,650
Which pretty much makes her?

660
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,010
Better than the rest of you.

661
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:14,710
Do not get a praise from her.

662
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,650
Praise him.

663
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,930
False remain un wavelengths.

664
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:21,770
Praise him.

665
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:21,990
Thank you.

666
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,590
I don't have that!

667
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,210
Brothers and sisters,

668
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,170
have you seen Herod's name aborted by A.T.M.?

669
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,830
I think I'm rather interested in the full-blown tragedy that I've missed.

670
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,810
I've been saying to the sacred scribes and the church in the sub-genus

671
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:58,090
that's just been pulled off by some leather-clad A.T.F.

672
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:58,970
What's going on?

673
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,590
What's going on?

674
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,290
It looks like we just had a man kidnapped.

675
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:04,490
What?

676
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:09,490
We may have to instigate some sort of manhunt.

677
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:13,570
Ivan's stay just got pulled off by some leather-clad woman with A.T.F. tags.

678
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,490
Oh, my God!

679
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,190
It went that way.

680
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:17,550
Let's go!

681
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,390
Follow us! Go, go, go!

682
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,290
Please!

683
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,470
Remember, no violence! Remain calm!

684
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,650
Bring Stang back alive! The others, their heads will do!

685
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,850
There's a tool in it!

686
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,610
It's a pagan!

687
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:40,490
No!

688
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,870
A fucking swamp!

689
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:42,830
No!

690
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,770
Grab the club!

691
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,990
Grab the club! We'll have to shoot her!

692
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,170
Take her out, Colonel!

693
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,990
Take her out!

694
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,070
He's out of bullets, damn it!

695
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,510
We hit her!

696
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,330
You missed again!

697
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,330
Oh, no!

698
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,030
Where's Stang?

699
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,190
Oh, Jesus Christ!

700
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,110
What's she do to it?

701
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,530
Stang!

702
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:00,630
Really?

703
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,970
You'll get your stark fist!

704
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,230
Someone jump on top of her!

705
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,110
We're working on it!

706
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,410
No, no, no!

707
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,470
No, no, no!

708
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:06,470


709
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,410
She's stuck around here!

710
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:07,870
No!

711
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,710
Oh, Jesus!

712
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,250
Who said I'd stay here?

713
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,170
No!

714
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:11,770
No!

715
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,230
No!

716
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:13,170
No!

717
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,190
No!

718
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,750
Look, it's all right.

719
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,450
She's just disturbed.

720
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,650
It's all right.

721
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,590
It's all right.

722
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,190
She's giving her pills.

723
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,510
She's giving her pills.

724
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,070
Give her her pills.

725
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,230
Hey, hey!

726
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,490
Come on, don't let her go!

727
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,610
If it's your call, Reverend Stang, I'll...

728
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,450
Is she living or is she dead?

729
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:30,450


730
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,170
Or did she die?

731
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:31,910
Jesus!

732
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,990
Are you kidding?

733
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:33,890
I'm touching that one.

734
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,270
Is she living or is she dead, Reverend Stang?

735
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:36,990
It's that cow truck!

736
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,570
It's that chicken!

737
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:37,830
You hear that?

738
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:39,870
Hey, Devil!

739
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,470
Uh-oh.

740
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,590
You're locked up!

741
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,230
Smile!

742
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,110
Hey, I thought...

743
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,550
Gross.

744
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,250
Jesus fucking Christ, man!

745
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:50,850
What's he doing?

746
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,050
I was just killing her!

747
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,050


748
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,050


749
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,050


750
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,050


751
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,430
I just wanted to scare her!

752
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,950
You scared her?

753
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,270
Are you fucking nuts?

754
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:57,570
You scared?

755
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,510
I'm not saying.

756
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,410
You're not a military man.

757
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:01,830
You don't understand.

758
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:02,810
I'm not saying.

759
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:03,210
I'm serious.

760
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,310
You just got two dozen gay guys really dead!

761
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,250
Shut up!

762
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,530
Okay, let's get the hostage out of here.

763
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,710
I think this situation's over with.

764
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:11,490
Okay.

765
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,150
All right.

766
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,170
If she's...

767
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,610
We gotta stop all this!

768
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,250
It's all right.

769
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,050
It was only a...

770
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,790
It was the mild disturbance.

771
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:22,050
I'm sorry.

772
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,050


773
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,050


774
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,050


775
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,050


776
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,050


777
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,670
It was just nothing.

778
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,870
It was all over the place.

779
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,010
It was a performance art.

780
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,670
That's all.

781
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:35,530
And you don't need to discuss the poor, disturbed crazy woman on the internet or...

782
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,810
Oh, I love Disney.

783
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,790
...those fanzines or anything.

784
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,850
No, it's just...

785
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:45,190
I mean, it would be unfair to bring this up and drag the poor, crazy woman's name through

786
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,250
the media.

787
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,410
It's all just a prank and an unfortunate little gag.

788
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,030
And I'm sorry.

789
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


790
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


791
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


792
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


793
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


794
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


795
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


796
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


797
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


798
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


799
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


800
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


801
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


802
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


803
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


804
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,030


805
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,130
She's dead.

806
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:52,130


807
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:52,130


808
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:52,130


809
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,490
And a reminder, those bullets weren't real.

810
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,890
And even if they had been, they...

811
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,270
She wouldn't be dead because they weren't silver bullets.

812
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,910
And it's all right.

813
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:02,390
Thank you.

814
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,630
And you may...

815
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,550
Now, just a moment.

816
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,070
How do we know you're the real life...

817
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:37,290
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man.

818
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,830
Brothers and sisters, we have Reverend Staines alleged assailant in custody.

819
00:43:51,770 --> 00:44:04,050
And as an example to all of you, we are going to deal with her as we deal with all who dare cross the church of the subgenius.

820
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,270
No, don't do it!

821
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,190
Spanky!

822
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,130
No!

823
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,070
No!

824
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,230
Oh, boy!

825
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,610
Oh, Bob!

826
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,770
Oh, Bob!

827
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:21,730
And that makes it okay.

828
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:22,370
Oh, yeah!

829
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,730
Oh, my God!

830
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:24,530
Oh!

831
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,510
I won't do it again!

832
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,350
We're just having a little fun with you tonight, brothers and sisters.

833
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,070
Easy play.

834
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,270
We're just...

835
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,270
We're just having a little fun with you.

836
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,690
We're just all just thrilled.

837
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:41,650
Good morning.

838
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:51,170
If anyone were going to abduct Reverend Staines from this place, the odds are it would be the Baptists or the ATF or the FBI.

839
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,610
We expect them to come looking for us more public faces in the church.

840
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,970
Reverend Staines, myself, Jesus.

841
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,130
Praise Jesus.

842
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,730
Praise Jesus!

843
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:03,930
Praise Jesus, everybody.

844
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:04,810
Go get the praise Jesus.

845
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,190
Praise Jesus.

846
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:14,610
Praise אַם Yesterday, today, the day we're going to.

847
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,070
The

848
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:19,470
Good morning.

849
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:34,790
Good morning to all of you.

850
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:34,790


851
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:40,930
Many of you out there will be burning your subgenius membership cards when you see Reverend

852
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,910
Stang or myself or Jesus hanging on the cross.

853
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:44,850
Hell no!

854
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:45,690
Never!

855
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:46,430
Never!

856
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,090
Hell no!

857
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:48,270
Will you be finding your God?

858
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:48,890
No!

859
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:49,830
Not me!

860
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,170
Will you be taking up your shotguns to avenge us?

861
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,730
Yes!

862
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,290
I think so.

863
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:57,610
And what do you think?

864
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,990
Or will you merely commit suicide and join us in subgenius hell?

865
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:03,970
You see what I mean?

866
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,150
Yes, brothers and sisters!

867
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:16,610
Mankind does not know it yet, but time is a horny cellmate waiting for it to fall asleep.

868
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:26,430
Oh yes, and brothers and sisters, your subgenius membership card is like a homemade knife to

869
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,970
smuggle out from under your mattress.

870
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:34,770
Oh yes, oh yes, and when time comes around, looking for the...

871
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,970
You'll get a load at your expense.

872
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,770
You will be able to defend yourself against it.

873
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:47,110
You will be able to wield your subgenius membership card like a flaming sword, like a smuggled

874
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:50,250
knife, like a gun made of soap at the very least.

875
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,110
Oh yes, brothers and sisters, time...

876
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,850
They say that time flies by.

877
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,930
Boy, the weekend flew by.

878
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:02,310
Time just flies by.

879
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,510
Shoot it out of the air!

880
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,770
Time does not fly.

881
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:05,730
Time does not fly by.

882
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,310
Time flies away.

883
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,210
Yes, brothers and sisters, and time is running out for them.

884
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:21,090
Today, we meet on this campground, and we'll have a little fun.

885
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,510
A little bit.

886
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:28,790
But two years from now, you better have the stomach for the sight of blood.

887
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:29,750
What is it?

888
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:34,750
Because, brothers and sisters, this isn't no candy-ass rap jam.

889
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,450
It's a little bit like the Christians had where you get raptured up and you just go

890
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,990
away and leave us behind.

891
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,130
No!

892
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:43,930
No, it is not.

893
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,230
This is going to be the fightin' rapture.

894
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,170
Yeah.

895
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,190
It'll be rapture for us.

896
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:55,850
I know I will feel nothing but rapture as my fingers crawl around the throat of the

897
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:59,510
conspiracy to choke that last spark of life from it.

898
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,130
Oh yes.

899
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,370
Now there's not much time.

900
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:06,530
Time is ticking.

901
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,790
Yeah, but soon it will be.

902
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:24,470
That's what we pick you here as the hammer gets ready to fall.

903
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:25,250
Morning.

904
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:28,470
The hammer will be falling upon the Christians.

905
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,110
The streets shall run red with their blood.

906
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,110
The streets shall run red with their blood.

907
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:32,110


908
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:32,110


909
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,730
The streets shall run red with their blood.

910
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:38,550
We will defame their most holy tabernacles,

911
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:44,490
and all that they find sacred will be nothing more than sex toys for us.

912
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:53,890
They say that humanity is just two hot meals away from anarchy.

913
00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:01,730
We're here to make sure that those two hot meals are just the cooling remains of their neighbors.

914
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,670
Can I get an amen?

915
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:05,450
Amen!

916
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,530
Can I get a hallelujah?

917
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:08,390
Hallelujah!

918
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,370
Can I get a praise bomb?

919
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:11,490
Praise bomb!

920
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:14,350
Brothers and sisters, let's hear some noise!

921
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,590
That's the fucking way!

922
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:27,950
We gotta make some noise to let the heck out of this smell!

923
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,150
You better let the fuck out of here before the circus!

924
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,130
Second, knock it down!

925
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:42,410
Hey, men! Hey, black brothers and sisters!

926
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,990
You got better than you got anything else when you leave!

927
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:51,470
All you gotta know is that you're saved, brothers and sisters.

928
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,290
And sure.

929
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,490
Sure, you're saved.

930
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,510
But you got two years to work up your hate for the normals.

931
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,910
This place here, you can feel the love in it.

932
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:07,290
We will cleanse this place of that love.

933
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,390
Oh, sure.

934
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:16,810
Oh, sure, the normals, the pigs, they have their petty hatreds.

935
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:20,670
I don't like the man next door because he's Jewish.

936
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:28,430
I don't like the people that just moved in because they're black and they'll run the property values down.

937
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,970
I don't like those people. They just look funny.

938
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,210
I don't like those people because they park in my space.

939
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:36,850
I hate them. I hate them.

940
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,010
Oh, I'd like to kill that guy coming into my neighborhood.

941
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,970
Oh, yeah, the conspiracy will try to hide it.

942
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:50,070
I'm sure pretty soon Walt Disney with their incredible knack for changing history will be making that movie soon.

943
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:53,170
You know, the one about the black people in Africa.

944
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:56,970
The fact they achieved their lifelong dream of coming on over to America, they got.

945
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:02,570
Yeah, and Disney will be selling the action figures. You can get them at Burger King, all that stuff.

946
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:05,310
They'll be out there singing and dancing. Yeah, sure.

947
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,330
And somebody, of course, you know, in real life, somebody's gonna hate them.

948
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,510
Somebody's gonna hate them. Somebody's gonna hate you.

949
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,070
Somebody's gonna hate you because you're weird.

950
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,730
Somebody's gonna hate you because you're ugly.

951
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,690
Somebody's gonna hate you because you got a funny haircut.

952
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:18,650
Damn.

953
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:19,410
Oh, yeah.

954
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:23,630
Somebody's gonna hate you. There's always gonna be that kind of hate.

955
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,730
Praise hate.

956
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,250
Oh, yeah.

957
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,450
But that's just pure piss-ass hate.

958
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,270
Sure.

959
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:33,710
They can hate each other if they want to and they don't piss any hate.

960
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:39,030
I mean, they can. This is America. You can hate anybody you want for whatever reason you want.

961
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:39,450
Amen.

962
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:44,370
I stand up for the common man's right to hate for any reason whatsoever.

963
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:49,750
Who shall be the man who signs the paper that legislates hate?

964
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:54,630
Who will be the man who signs that paper to legislate hate?

965
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,950
President Obama!

966
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:58,410
Piss-ass. Piss-ass little hates.

967
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,110
But what can we expect from them, brothers and sisters?

968
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:02,270
Hate!

969
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:04,570
They're only huge.

970
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:06,830
Amen!

971
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:07,650
Amen!

972
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:08,550
Amen!

973
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:08,850


974
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:09,170
Amen!

975
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:09,250
Amen!

976
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:09,390
Amen!

977
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:09,650
Amen!

978
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:09,970
Amen!

979
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:10,010
Amen!

980
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:10,170
Amen!

981
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:12,690
Amen!

982
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:21,890
My один Overall Green Pipes Grand5

983
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,350
Yes!

984
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:25,350
Home

985
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,710
Good

986
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,730
La

987
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,610
Ground Control to Major Bob.

988
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,530
Are you over?

989
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,330
Take your pills and smoke your bra all day long.

990
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,690
Smoking like you need it, maybe. Over.

991
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,290
Ground Control to Major Bob.

992
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,390
Major Bob, are you over?

993
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,130
The Contra-da-sans-ou-van.

994
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,390
Uh, Dan, the conspiracy. Over.

995
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:06,050
Chase, come back and give us some more of that swag.

996
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:12,190
Uh, now, now, Tim, knock it in.

997
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,430
X-A-6-5-4-3-2-1.

998
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:15,750
And a five star!

999
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,170
This is Ground Control to Major Bob.

1000
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,370
He's handing bombs away.

1001
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,370
And a dollar's all he's got.

1002
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,570
And a dime of iron's getting paid.

1003
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:38,110
Now it's time to pour the sauce to his weak leg.

1004
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,470
Uh, hey, I love her.

1005
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:44,710
This is Major Bob to Ground Control.

1006
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,250
I don't think it's over.

1007
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:54,890
It's time for two heavens empty, naughty, honey.

1008
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:56,910
And a seven to eight.

1009
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:57,950
And a seven to eight.

1010
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:01,690
And it makes me so mad I wanna take.

1011
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,330
And a poop dog. Over.

1012
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:09,650
But you, you're like Dallas, Texas.

1013
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,850
And a beer's just burnt.

1014
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:15,070
Start the song.

1015
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,590
And a beer bomb. Over.

1016
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,170
And it's turning blue.

1017
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,710
Cause there's nothing I can do.

1018
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:26,490
No.

1019
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,410
Except praise Bob.

1020
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,630
Except praise Bob.

1021
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,130
Yes, we must all praise Bob, my brothers and sisters.

1022
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,410
Yes, praise Bob like you mean it, sir.

1023
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,090
You don't have no need.

1024
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,910
Shout out back for me.

1025
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,470
Praise on that bomb.

1026
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,310
How sluggish, how assiduous.

1027
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,410
And don't like those green facts.

1028
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:52,350
Don't like those green, dead presidents.

1029
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,350
La la la la.

1030
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,470
Don't like those green, dead presidents.

1031
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,030
Thank you.

1032
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:06,210
And a beer bomb.

1033
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:07,970
And a beer bomb.

1034
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:08,710
No!

1035
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:10,110


1036
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,710
Dear zag, like dirty as a beard.

1037
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,370
And a beer bomb.

1038
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,990
Internet to see your present.

1039
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:16,150
We may be jerks.

1040
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:16,350
Small mites fall to your face.

1041
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,290
A qui introduction to the bomb.

1042
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,890
It's gonna lead ожид.

1043
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:21,890


1044
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:21,890


1045
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:21,890


1046
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:21,890


1047
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:21,890


1048
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:21,890


1049
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:22,330
All the only I was doing.

1050
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:22,330


1051
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:22,330


1052
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:22,330


1053
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:22,330


1054
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:22,330


1055
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,430
What we will do now

1056
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:27,670
The exit's been detailed

1057
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,170
We must get in like the cow

1058
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:37,370
And he'll bring us all the senses

1059
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,830
All of the stuff

1060
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:47,790
The world is turning blue

1061
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:51,250
Cause there's nothing we can do

1062
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,970
All together now

1063
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,630
Except kill Bob!

1064
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,730
Except kill Bob!

1065
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,330
At last, over two thousand years

1066
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,510
The XB-37's space-truck will take off

1067
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,510
Hey Bob, where are you?

1068
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,950
Never said that, okay

1069
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,570
The ship's been moved!

1070
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:14,550
We can't hear you

1071
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,750
There's no more job here left on Earth

1072
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,990
And the exits can't be found

1073
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:18,590
Where are you?

1074
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,450
Make a bomb, come over

1075
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,270
Make a bomb, come in

1076
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,050
Go to mission, Major Bob

1077
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,690
Abort, abort, abort, abort

1078
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:30,010
Abort, abort, abort, abort

1079
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,630
Abort, abort

1080
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,650
But, but, but

1081
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,050
I'm against abortion

1082
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,770
There is some law on the line of the rainbow

1083
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,190
Damn!

1084
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:42,650
That boy, I would still be

1085
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:43,310
Stupid!

1086
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,790
And you wanna talk about stupid, my friends?

1087
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,010
Let's talk about stupid!

1088
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,090
Stupid!

1089
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:49,970
Call them out!

1090
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,110
Let me get Bob, my friend!

1091
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:51,970
Stupid!

1092
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,150
Let me get Bob!

1093
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:53,630
Stupid!

1094
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,110
Let me get Bob!

1095
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:54,810
Let me get Bob!

1096
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,190
Let me get Bob!

1097
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:02,030
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1098
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:06,150
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1099
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,810
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1100
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:09,770
Got your pencil ready?

1101
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,830
Bob, Post Office Box 140303.

1102
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:16,230
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1103
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:23,370
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1104
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,290
Stay tuned and praise Bob!

1105
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:31,430
Ah!

1106
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,430


1107
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,430


1108
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:38,070
I will read from the minutes of the last meeting.

1109
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:45,490
And these are very soggy minutes, so stick with me.

1110
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:50,310
Because I'm here in the name of sin to tell you to get right with Bob!

1111
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,190
Now some of you may be thinking,

1112
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,590
Who is this Bob guy anyway?

1113
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:03,910
I'm here to tell you that he is the super salesman of your Slack.

1114
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:10,250
The conspiracy has bought and sold you and distributed you in little styrofoam cartons,

1115
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,850
and Bob is here to help you break through that latch.

1116
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,150
And get the hell out.

1117
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:19,710
Thank you, Thighmaster.

1118
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,530
All you need to know about the grinning man with the pipe,

1119
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:28,110
he is the foe of mediocrity and the champion of excess.

1120
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:38,010
He is here to justify your sins and get you back the slack that the soulless heartless conspiracy of the normals

1121
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:40,910
has ripped away from your desperately clutching fingers,

1122
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:47,250
stuffing their already full-to-bursting coffers with the pleasant excesses of slack that you need to survive.

1123
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:52,430
Oh, and yet they're not going to do anything with it.

1124
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:53,690
That's the damnedest thing.

1125
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,790
It's enough to them that you don't have it anymore.

1126
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:00,550
They hook you like a damned bass.

1127
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,390
You're the fish you smell.

1128
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:12,190
Let's see what you've done.

1129
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,430
Ooh, it's just such a squid in there.

1130
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:19,790
Oh, we're gonna be getting to that squid.

1131
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:23,690
And let me tell you, I've seen it.

1132
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,510
I've known men that didn't have that many tentacles.

1133
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,370
And then little sucker cubs.

1134
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:37,910
Oh, we'll try to grease the line so it moves.

1135
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:38,970
through smoothly.

1136
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:43,190
Oh, but where was I?

1137
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,150
Oh, yes, Bob!

1138
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:49,130
How could I forget I was talking about Bob?

1139
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:53,410
Oh, yes, when this mighty Yeti overman came along

1140
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:57,290
with eyes and pipe ablaze to kick ass across the cosmos

1141
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,450
on the supersonic Nazi hell creatures.

1142
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,410
He came for us.

1143
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:06,170
And he came again and again and again

1144
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,030
and again and again.

1145
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:10,790
Oh, Bob.

1146
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:14,590
And I kind of lost count at that point because I blacked out.

1147
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,670
Oh, I'm sure you remember that night.

1148
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,930
Woke up in a puddle of slack,

1149
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:24,450
and you knew that Bob had been there.

1150
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:25,890
Oh.

1151
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:28,610
Oh.

1152
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:29,050
Oh.

1153
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:31,770
Oh.

1154
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:31,850
Oh.

1155
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,090
Oh.

1156
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:36,510
Oh.

1157
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,910
You know, you've got a choice here.

1158
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,830
You can either accept Bob as the savior of your slack

1159
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:44,910
or don't come crying to me when the saucers are so close

1160
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:48,590
that the heat rays are welding your damn butt cheeks shut.

1161
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:53,210
Because that's not my damn problem.

1162
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:56,110
It's nothing to me if you have slack.

1163
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,730
Or you.

1164
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,130
You make your own slack.

1165
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:05,330
But we are all here to give you something to slack off to.

1166
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,110
But we are all here to give you something to slack off to.

1167
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:13,410
We're here to provide that divine inspiration for perspiration, for your desperation.

1168
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:21,150
Bob is there. He's got a nice warm leg to hump.

1169
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:28,530
Make good friends with Bob today.

1170
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:38,910
At this point, I think I need to go take a tonic.

1171
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:41,450
Brace Bob!

1172
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,530
Suzie the boozy!
