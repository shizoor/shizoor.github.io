1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
I am L-V-I-A-P-O-R-I-M-L-H-U-T

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:12,520
The ideal of being S-E-S-L-E-P-I-O-S-O-N-E-H-U-T

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,220
The maddening, maddening sounds will be of Reverend Ivan Stang.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,240
So sit tight, I'm losing my mind.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,420
I'm losing my mind tonight.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,680
I'm losing my mind tonight.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,220
Of Reverend Ivan Stang.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,980
With some good advice.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,500
Don't talk, listen.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,800
We just take it all off.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,640
Relax your nerve tonight.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:59,260
We just take it all off.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,820
Rerun time because we're getting ready for the big subgenius revival in Baltimore on November 15th.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:15,080
And we're recuperating from spending ten days out of town bouncing my new grandson, the Stang Model Mark III, on our knees.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:23,380
So we're slacking off and listening to our younger selves, our baby selves, in this unusually good oldie.

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,580
Featuring classic puzzling evidence with Glass Madness and the Broke Friend.

17
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,440
Michael Pepe's rant.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,180
I'll add.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,140
A big old mess of Brother Cleave and Iron Liver.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,860
And our first lady radio preacher, Sister Chris from WFMU in New Jersey.

21
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,080
And much more, including some of the unfinished soundtrack for the subgenius video, Arise,

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,980
before we had added D.K. Jones' original music to Dr. Howe's narration.

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,760
Yes.

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:59,320
And we must remark on the passing of the great proto-subgenius, Rudy Ray Moore.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,080
The king of party records and godfather of rap.

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,500
To whose character, Dolomite, we owe the cojones behind the brag of the subgenius.

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,900
Praise Rudy Ray Moore.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,860
May he rest in slack.

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,040
But now let us return to the 21-year-old hour of slack from 1987 in Dallas, Texas.

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,660
And you're about to hear the hour of slack.

31
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,040
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,920
That was some pretty music and creative work played on that previous show.

33
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,840
And people who value that sort of thing, well, sorry to see it go.

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,760
The subgenius hour of slack.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Watch.

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:29,980
The subgenius hour of slack.

37
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,920
Watch.

38
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:33,920


39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,360
Watch.

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,540
Watch.

41
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,420
Watch.

42
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,000
Watch.

43
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,260
Watch.

44
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,260


45
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:45,320
I send the angel of the Lord, I send right now power, the very glory of God into that

46
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,620
home.

47
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,700
I move back the foul spirits of opposition, the lying spirits, the binding spirits.

48
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,260
I speak authority to you in the name of Jesus Christ.

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,980
Don't ask any questions.

50
00:03:59,980 --> 00:03:59,980


51
00:03:59,980 --> 00:03:59,980


52
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:07,040
questions just do as I say, all right? We're pretty sure he's a psychopath. Now, how do we spot him?

53
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,900
Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy. Otherwise, they come in all sizes and shapes.

54
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:22,700
11-year-old girls, 80-year-old men. Yeah, they all look perfectly normal. I keep telling you all,

55
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,700
well, this is a sick and perverted nation, all type. Nobody wants to listen to me.

56
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,500
Nobody wants to hear about Bob. I try to tell everybody what's going on,

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:45,260
they won't listen to me. Well, to tell you the truth, I can't stand it anymore, Bob.

58
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,940
Just do away with them all. I don't want them anymore. They're the only problem and illusion

59
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,280
in my mind after all.

60
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,880
They don't love you, Bob. They don't love you like I do.

61
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,880
Little realize, even by leading a scientist, there are really two races,

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:14,240
actually two distinct species of so-called human beings. If you gaze upon any given street,

63
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,700
normally you might never suspect that only some of these people are true humans.

64
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,680
Outside appearances offer no clue that they are.

65
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,000
But among this ordinary-looking crowd, on an ordinary day, a certain number of these people

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,540
are actually sub-geniuses. We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person

67
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:45,660
or that carries the rare sub-genius gene. But once inside, we will discover a vast new universe,

68
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,560
a new dimension, coexisting, not always apart, the alongside the mundane workday world.

69
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,660
Another world that until now has been forced into hiding. Now at this very moment, the veils

70
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:07,500
of secrecy can be torn aside. We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare,

71
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,580
behold us, for we are the sub-geniuses.

72
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,800
Come on, Hal, say something really funny.

73
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,820
Down there. We dare you.

74
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,240
Hey, come on.

75
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,620
And puzzling, can you tell us exactly who is responsible for Ricky Nelson?

76
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

77
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,060
You mean who did he buy the gram from that he was doing up there?

78
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,300
I can't believe it.

79
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,580
Come on, who did he buy it from?

80
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,100
Those guys.

81
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,440
We know everybody, right?

82
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,740
Lighting up in the back of an old DC-3.

83
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,780
Yeah, you just know you don't do that.

84
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,900
I mean, we're talking smart.

85
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,820
Too much of that show starter.

86
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,780
Aluminum, magnesium, air fuel. What else do you want?

87
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,480
Oh, here, light that bowl.

88
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,320
Foof!

89
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,480
Another one by the dust.

90
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,380
I really can't believe it myself. Well, I've got to go out and light some dust here.

91
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,380
Another one by the dust.

92
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,300
Don't light up in the back of a DC-3.

93
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,560
Don't light up in the back of a DC-3.

94
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,420
Don't light up at all.

95
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,360
Oh, there, we cleared that out.

96
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,460
Nope, it's back.

97
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,640
Now, wasn't that easy and wasn't that fun?

99
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,260
But listen to what's the fun, don't leave it done.

100
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,940
Whatever you do, be full of peace and happiness, man.

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,660
Be happy with the complicity of nature and the class.

102
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,460
Time against humanity.

103
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,880
Be part of, you know, it, them, us.

104
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,140
Yeah.

105
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
Hey, who's got another candle, man?

106
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,440
I do, man. Be peaceful.

107
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,840
Pass the tarot cards, I'm getting sleepy.

108
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,760
Us.

109
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,820
What you gonna do?

110
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,920
Where you gonna go?

111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,260
Who are we?

112
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,580
We're the money people.

113
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,740
The people who take your money.

114
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,660
The people who take your money.

115
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:52,660


116
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,800
No more money, Hasling.

117
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,780
But what about little Dicky, you say?

118
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:05,200
What's little Dicky gonna do when you're working late and Wilma's minding the fort and Sis is in and out?

119
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,580
Put away those straps and buckles.

120
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,880
Dicky's safe with us.

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,200
He's even learning to speak again, our way.

122
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,160
Best of all, he's safe with the people who know what it is you want from a world.

123
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,960
Simplicity.

124
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,480
Relax.

125
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:22,980
Liability.

126
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,480
A world you can go to without worrying about whether your money is safe.

127
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,880
You know, when we first got into this business, we didn't know much more than you.

128
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Like you, we thought there was a world out there.

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,440
A world of value.

130
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,820
A world that needed meaning.

131
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,500
Beauty.

132
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,380
Love.

133
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,100
A world that needed a better product.

134
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,640
A world that needed a better product.

135
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,980
And, you know, there's a world out there.

136
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,880
And you want to know something.

137
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,800
You want to know just exactly what it is you're supposed to do.

138
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,440
You don't really care why.

139
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,940
Just so long as it's the right thing.

140
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,020
It's natural.

141
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,540
Everyone wants to do the right thing.

142
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,640
Then, why not?

143
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:22,640


144
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:22,640


145
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:22,640


146
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:22,640


147
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:22,640


148
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,980
But sometimes it's hard to know just what the right thing is.

149
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560
Let's say you're black,

150
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,280
and you've just lost both your arms and legs defending U.S. interests in El Salvador.

151
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,500
You come home and get thrown in jail for life for beating up four white cops.

152
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,120
You want to know just exactly what is it I'm supposed to feel.

153
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,600
We can't give you all the answers,

154
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,000
but we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.

155
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,800
At our labs, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.

156
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,580
Love.

157
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,520
Children.

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,600
God.

159
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,280
And the purest blend of money your needs can buy,

160
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,520
grown right here by our special process.

161
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,500
A process in use since our first mom-and-pop operation.

162
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,620
Who are we?

163
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,460
We're the normal people.

164
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,160
The most normal people in the world.

165
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,420
But not quite as normal as you.

166
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,120
Why?

167
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,560
You're unique.

168
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,280
It's natural.

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,860
Everyone's unique.

170
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,240
But you stand apart from the crowd.

171
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,360
You're normal.

172
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,180
Oh, morning, dear.

173
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,580
That was Michael Pepe.

174
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,280
I had a wonderful last night.

175
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,460
This is...

176
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,980
The Swinging Aeriodice.

177
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,460
Get out of bed, crunch numbers, and do launches.

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,900
Where are the keys to my 450 SL?

179
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,540
I've no idea, but if I don't get my suits from the maid this morning,

180
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,460
I'm going to be positively late for this meeting.

181
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,320
Mash love.

182
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,080
Here comes a singing voice.

183
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,520
He drove white Porsches.

184
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,780
Mercedes Town Sedan.

185
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,640
All custom upholstered.

186
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:19,580
All custom upholstered.

187
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,880
To match his new tan.

188
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,100
Oh, what a yuppie man he was.

189
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,540
Oh, what a yuppie man he was.

190
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,540
His discs, they were compact.

191
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,560
Hisα Sherbet.

192
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,560


193
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,560


194
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,660
Because he heard the rage

195
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,540
Bought the Beatles back collection

196
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,280
But his taste was new age

197
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,340
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

198
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,780
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

199
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,080
He bopped into wilderness

200
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,140
Where the sheep shot the chow

201
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,640
Buying duck liver pate

202
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,440
At twelve bucks a pound

203
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,360
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

204
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,740
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

205
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,600
In his polo, he would network

206
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,200
To satisfy a primal urge

207
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,240
Interfacing young yuppies

208
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,900
With which he would merge

209
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,840
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

210
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,360
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

211
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,980
Promotions did elude him

212
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,840
He produced unperturbed

213
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,300
But croaked by coronary

214
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,240
Before his eye lay matured

215
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,100
Oh, what a yuppie man he was

216
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,800
Oh

217
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:43,800


218
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,180
Oh

219
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,620
What a yuppie man he was

220
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,260
Oh

221
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,820
What a yuppie man he was

222
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,400
Oh

223
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,280
What a yuppie man he was

224
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,000
But croaked by coronary

225
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,040
Oh

226
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
What a yuppie man he was

227
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,180
What a yuppie man he was

228
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,560
Oh, yes, dear friends.

229
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,320
What a beautiful song there.

230
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,240
Oh, what a yuppie man he was by the Swinging Aeriodites.

231
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,940
Thanks to Brother Cleve Duncan up in Boston once again.

232
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,220
The Swinging Aeriodites are beginning to make a name for themselves now that Cleve's left the band.

233
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,160
Once again, friends, that's your surest ticket to start him is to have Cleve in your band for a while

234
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,440
and then get rid of him or have him leave or whatever.

235
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,820
Public service announcement number one.

236
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:18,120
Everyone, if you're thinking about saying yes to sex or if you're thinking about saying yes to drugs, just remember,

237
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,460
say no to Nancy Reagan.

238
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,140
That was fun, wasn't it?

239
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,660
Okay, coming up in just a moment, we'll have the Reverend Ivan Stang,

240
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,780
the president of the Church of the Subgenius, joining us here this morning.

241
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,300
A story in fiction.

242
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:40,200
And another story that somebody showed me in a national magazine said that we were going to open a healing shrine

243
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,500
in Arkansas.

244
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,300
Well, you know, I have nothing to do.

245
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,140
I've never met those people.

246
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:52,300
And it's amazing what is being written today as fact when in truth it's fiction.

247
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,260
In truth, none of it is.

248
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,760
It's just a figment of someone's imagination.

249
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,160
And, you know, at the beginning of this, we read headlines in California that, you know,

250
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,180
$92 million missing.

251
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,680
Is that all, Jim?

252
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,300
And the sad part was...

253
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,220
This is Jim and Tal.

254
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,060
...some people.

255
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Found the money, I guess.

256
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,700
But that was never written.

257
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,780
They found it in your backyard.

258
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,560
And so there's so many things...

259
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,620
But the sad part was it was never missing.

260
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,360
Did you say that?

261
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,280
The money was never missing.

262
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,960
It was a figment of the imagination.

263
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:21,940
A figment.

264
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,280
And it was never missing.

265
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,540
And so it didn't have to be found because it was always there.

266
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:31,080
Not only has the PTL books been opened, but our own personal books have been opened.

267
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,720
We have been audited personally as well as a company.

268
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,920
We know what's been opened.

269
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,900
The cells have been with us.

270
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,940
Oh, no!

271
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,200
No!

272
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,500
No!

273
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:40,740
No!

274
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,980
Back in their load, back in their load.

275
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,740
Yeah, all the dogs shielding us, back in their load.

276
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,740
Back in their load, back in their load.

277
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,660
All the dogs shielding us, back in their load.

278
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,840
Down in Carolina at the PTL.

279
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,500
There's a change in the wind, it sure does smell.

280
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,400
Old Jim and Tammy from the TV church.

281
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,400
Back in their load, now they're alert.

282
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,620
Jimmy called Jimmy, he was mounting his steam

283
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,400
Buck ass naked, taking the lead

284
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,580
Packing some fudge for the PTL

285
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,440
For front page news, for the Post to tell

286
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,500
Back in their load, back in their load

287
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,340
All of God's children just back in their load

288
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,380
Back in their load, back in their load

289
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,240
All of God's children just back in their load

290
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,220
Jimmy called Tammy, she was running the race

291
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,320
Another woman's man riding by her face

292
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,020
Just a friend of the music man

293
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,220
Wasn't packing his load, I was braving his plan

294
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,020
Reverend Jerry Fowle, he slapped him so hard

295
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,040
Took away the gold and the credit cards

296
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Hang your head in shame, leave my flock

297
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,900
Don't mind packing your load, but you got caught

298
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,060
Back in their load, back in their load

299
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,040
Old Kimmel says, back in their load

300
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,160
Back in their load, back in their load

301
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,980
All the TV churches are back in their load

302
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,020
Back in their load, back in their load

303
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,900
All of God's children just back in their load

304
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,840
Back in their load, back in their load

305
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,800
All of God's children just back in their load

306
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,740
The whole stupid public keeps rolling the steel.

307
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,700
Keep the TV churches running, bank borrow steel.

308
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,560
Listen to the lies on the TV screen.

309
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,000
Bend over backwards, accept your reed.

310
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,640
Jimmy Swaggert screamed, I ain't packing no load.

311
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,840
Or what is cried, Jimmy Baker's a toad.

312
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,120
Jerry Fowler says, get the PTL and Jack Frank to rip off the heads.

313
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,820
On the next.

314
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,860
Back in their loads, back in their loads.

315
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,660
All of God's children are back in their loads.

316
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,040
That's a PTL by Iron Liver.

317
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,340
Thanks to Cleve again for that one.

318
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,740
Yee-haw.

319
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,300
Social commentary, dear friends, about reams of Xerox paper.

320
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Somewhere out there.

321
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,840
This is G. Gordon Gordon.

322
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,440
Terminal folds of Nunu.

323
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,460
It's not just the child zombies that murdered their mediocrity parents

324
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,400
and then cruised the streets with bloody feet.

325
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,460
It's not just those starry old vets on the park benches

326
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,580
with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

327
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,500
It's not just the anesthesiologists for knee-heat.

328
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,440
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses

329
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,180
that grope and flutch all day.

330
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,800
It's not just the bones all around you.

331
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,180
It's not just the diner bones for Wotan.

332
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,160
It's not just the broken headlight,

333
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,300
snapped antenna, and human excrement on your car hood.

334
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,120
It's not just that the old ways were best.

335
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,360
It's not just the bastardization and perversion

336
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,520
of every honest means of self-expression.

337
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,120
It's not just the kill of Ganja from the dark side of the bush.

338
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,180
It's not just the penoid of the dead.

339
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,180


340
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,280
It's not just the dying snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

341
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,440
It's not just the wide-screen technicolor corporate daisy chain

342
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,460
that has defiled the entire planet.

343
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,140
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-falls the size of basketballs.

344
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,620
It's not just the prophets crying lonely in the loam in the wilderness.

345
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,180
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, nun-entity son of a bitch

346
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,520
who thinks workers are property.

347
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,160
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

348
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,960
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing

349
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,680
that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

350
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:59,100
It's not just some asshole with a pipe and an I-know-more-than-you-do dog grin all over his homogenized face.

351
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,600
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world

352
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,260
that you certainly never made.

353
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,180
It's not just the doorways of the world that are closed,

354
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,180


355
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,720
or the doorway to doom.

356
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,420
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

357
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,640
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

358
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,660
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

359
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,420
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

360
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,620
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

361
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,240
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

362
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,380
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus,

363
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,700
you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there,

364
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,180
if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

365
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,320
Not off.

366
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,180
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

367
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,160
In his back pocket.

368
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,700
Just you try it.

369
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,040
I'm busy plumbin' mud.

370
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,160
I'm busy keepin' quiet.

371
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm busy stayin' still.

372
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,820
Don't always run.

373
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,840
I'm busy mankin' tape.

374
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,680
Bob is a ballpoint pen.

375
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,220
Bob is a rooster and Bob is a hen.

376
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,600
But what is a subgenius?

377
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,840
How can they, we, differ so much from the humans,

378
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,880
whose nonsensical laws and customs we have been forced to obey?

379
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,280
Why have so many of us been kept in ignorance of our true heritage,

380
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,620
a heritage that dates back farther than man is thought to have existed?

381
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,520
For in the days of Atlantis, we helped to design the humans.

382
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,500
Certainly, in retrospect, this now seems to have been our greatest mistake.

383
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,860
The End

384
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,800
The End

385
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,360
The End

386
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,260
The End

387
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,260
The End

388
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,000
The End

389
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,300
The End

390
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:17,900
The End

391
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:30,700
The End

392
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,760
The End

393
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:30,800
The End

394
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:30,840
The End

395
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:30,880
The End

396
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:30,920
The End

397
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:30,960
The End

398
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,000
The End

399
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,040
The End

400
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,080
The End

401
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,120
The End

402
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,160
The End

403
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,200
The End

404
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,240
The End

405
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,120
because he brought them toys and bubblegum.

406
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,480
All the parents put their kids in Cookie's hands.

407
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,000
Cookie put his hands on their little glass.

408
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,760
What he did was an awful fright.

409
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,500
When the kids got home, they cried all night.

410
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,900
The kids got smacked, squealed on the clown.

411
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,460
Cookie got scared when the cops came around.

412
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,360
They dragged his ass to the courtroom floor.

413
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,100
40 years, he should have got more.

414
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,960
This is Iron Liver.

415
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,400
Now Cookie rides in the fit house alone.

416
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,360
Late at night, you can hear his groans.

417
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,720
They beat his legs.

418
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,620
With baseball.

419
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,580
Exposed his buns.

420
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,300
The champ.

421
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,080
So this is the story of Cookie the Clown.

422
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,440
Wait, there's more.

423
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,240
Stick around.

424
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,220
They removed Cookie's skin just to out a layer.

425
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,260
They poured gasoline on his bozo head.

426
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,340
They set him on fire that fateful night.

427
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,660
A flaming clown.

428
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,740
He was out of sight.

429
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,860
Cookie robbed his kids of their childhood dreams.

430
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,340
The last thing they heard was Cookie's death.

431
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,620
Ah!

432
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,440
Ah!

433
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,860
Ah!

434
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,560
Ah!

435
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,980
Ah!

436
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,100
Ah!

437
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:41,780


438
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,120
Ah!

439
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:42,820
Ah!

440
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:42,820


441
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,740
Ah!

442
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,140
Ah!

443
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,800
Ah!

444
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:45,800


445
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,660
Ah!

446
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:46,760
Ah!

447
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:46,920
Ah!

448
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:46,920


449
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,320
Ah!

450
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,320


451
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,660
Ah!

452
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:47,660


453
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,260
Ah!

454
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,020
Ah!

455
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,900
Ah!

456
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,840
Ah!

457
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,060
Ah!

458
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,220
Oh!

459
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,220


460
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,260


461
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,340
Ah!

462
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:12,340


463
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:12,340


464
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:12,540
Wooah!

465
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:12,660


466
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:12,660


467
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,640
Ah!

468
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:13,680
Ah!

469
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,680


470
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,680


471
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,680


472
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,680


473
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,680


474
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,680


475
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,460
Those vocals are by Dr. Felix Cruel, formerly of the fabulous Billy Goons.

476
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,840
And it's Iron...

477
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,840
liver out of Boston. Nowhere but the hour of slack. Oh, there they go. Goodbye to the

478
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,260
iron liver man.

479
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,920
This is Mike Mahan. Got a minute? I'd like to bring you down.

480
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,120
Hello, microphone. What are you taping?

481
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,000
No matter how much you shake and dance, the last few drops go down your pants.

482
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:54,860
Oh, let me like tell you how I feel about condoms right now. I think condoms are okay,

483
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:01,900
but I heard a little bit about the oral dam, which is like a saran wrap type fixture that

484
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:08,800
fits on the genital area and you can step away and not get diseases. I think it's hideous.

485
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:15,000
Why don't we all wear a saran wrap body stocking and like prevent everything that we possibly can?

486
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,980
We're all scared.

487
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,740
The richest.

488
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,140
Longest lived, best protected, and most resourceful civilization with the highest technology,

489
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,660
the most fearful. Aren't you afraid of getting old and sick and then we'll let you die?

490
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:32,120
Ha! This is your roving cynic. I did approve it. I just can't say specifically when.

491
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,660
I did approve it. I just can't say specifically when.

492
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:46,220
Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing? Oh gosh, I've got two visitors here. All right, all right.

493
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,280
Go ahead, go ahead.

494
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,220
Oh, Auntie Georgina?

495
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,500
Oh, what's happening, Bobby?

496
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:04,840
I was reading an article about Keith Schmering and Jean-Baptiste Goodley Squad and they used

497
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,320
a word that I didn't understand.

498
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,960
And what pretal little slob head was that?

499
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,920
Um, it was pretentious.

500
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,200
Pretentious?

501
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:23,760
Okay, wipe that slime off your face and keep quiet while I tell you all about this disgusting

502
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,840
concept of pretentious.

503
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:33,720
Now, according to Webster's Dictionary, it means making usually unjustified and excessive

504
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,580
claims as of value or standing. But I know your little brain pen can't grasp that kind

505
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,820
of talk, so here's a little game that will teach you how to spell the word as you absorb

506
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,340
the meaning.

507
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:54,280
Now, P stands for paparazzi, who pander to the weak yet inflated egos of the brain-dead-walking

508
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,360
tree socket celebrities.

509
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,100
R stands for relic, what the pretentious have succeeded in becoming in terms of the present.

510
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:12,060
E stands for effluent or waste material, what critics agree upon as being the new cultural

511
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,640
icon.

512
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,200
T stands for the old.

513
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,200


514
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,480
E stands for talent, something the pretentious most definitely lack.

515
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:26,220
E stands for euthanasia, what the parents of the future pretentious pinks should have

516
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,600
practiced.

517
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,360
Now, N. N stands for narcissism, an all-important quality that is needed to fuel the fashion

518
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,260
sleaze and cardboard cutouts posing as people.

519
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,860
T stands for trickle, that sickeningly sweet and cloying way that pretentious peoples have

520
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,180
with making even as good as they can.

521
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,100
So, when you ask a person, do you want any vulture droppings and stealth slivers of podium

522
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,840
to satisfy a gnawing hunger?

523
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,800
Make it sound sincere.

524
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,700
I stands for ism, the suffix that the pretentious attach to anything that their truncated vocabularies

525
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,840
are unable to explain in really American English.

526
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,520
For example, they say carian finly ism, when all you really have to say is empty-headed

527
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,480
boob with excretion fixation.

528
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,040
.

529
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,360
O stands for ostentatious.

530
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,100
The ability to stand up proudly while wearing skunk skin and silk headdress,

531
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,640
50 pounds of overpriced designer makeup in shades of orange,

532
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,100
and $3,000 chain mail suit.

533
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,320
U stands for ululate.

534
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:39,400
That's ululate, the sound that the pretentious make when they meet their enemies slash contemporaries.

535
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,860
Oh, Brigida, it's been only 15 minutes since the last I saw you at the gallery opening.

536
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,960
And S.

537
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,580
Finally, S stands for self-important.

538
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:57,120
The ultimately imploding quality that determines how much of a legend a pretentious person is in their own mind.

539
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,080
So, little Bobby, do you think you can remember all of that?

540
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,200
Um, uh, no, Sister Grigima.

541
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,920
But, uh, now I know how I can be just like, um,

542
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,060
Oh, what's her name?

543
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,560
Taima Jonowitz.

544
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,100
Oh!

545
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,400
Oh!

546
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,220
followers

547
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,160
more

548
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,160


549
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,960

00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:21,640


557
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:21,640


558
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:21,640


559
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:21,640


560
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,300
my there

561
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,540
Thank you.

562
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,260
Thank you.

563
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,700
We're the communication people.

564
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,160
The people whose talk is strictly state-of-the-art technology.

565
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,020
It's disposable.

566
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,020
Reversible.

567
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,480
Reusable with almost any leading brand of idea,

568
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,040
including our deluxe line.

569
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,520
Yours.

570
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,940
Sound costly?

571
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,660
Put away that semantic checkbook.

572
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,320
Now communication can be yours at a fraction of what it cost Grandpa.

573
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,000
Why clutter up your world

574
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,280
with a lot of hard-to-perceive,

575
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,080
subtleties.

576
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,560
You either like a thing or you don't.

577
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,540
And in your case, it's the former.

578
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,660
That's why we like you.

579
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,820
And that's why we're always looking for quicker,

580
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,480
easier ways to tell you so.

581
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,240
Slogans.

582
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,680
Jingles.

583
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,400
Logos.

584
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,940
Ways of reaching out and touching you

585
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,520
the way you want to be touched.

586
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,360
Slightly.

587
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:21,860
Slightly.

588
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,980
Who are we?

589
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,740
We're the real people.

590
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,380
The people who make you real.

591
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,720
So real you can almost hear yourself.

592
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,600
More real than you've ever been before.

593
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,900
But then, you've never been at all before us.

594
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,160
In fact, nothing has.

595
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,920
And not even very much of that.

596
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,480
Not even this sentence.

597
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,980
Because when we say disposable,

598
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,440
we could mean just about anything.

599
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,980
Who are we?

600
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,900
We're the other people.

601
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,280
The people other than you.

602
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,800
People so other we're opposite.

603
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,060
Yet so people, you'd never guess we weren't the real thing.

604
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,920
The people who are almost you,

605
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,000
but couldn't quite make the final pre-season cut.

606
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,160
Still skeptical?

607
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,360
Try this simple test.

608
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,640
Listen to my voice now.

609
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,720
Notice anything?

610
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,220
Now you know how we feel.

611
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,340
Separate.

612
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,660
A little gone.

613
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,680
Slightly repeated.

614
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,260
Like you, only over again.

615
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,840
We can't help noticing.

616
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,100
In fact, we have an old saying.

617
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,280
We're not the same.

618
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,280


619
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,280


620
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,280


621
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,280


622
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,640
Hi.

623
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,520
Why do we say it?

624
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,320
It's a tradition.

625
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,360
Like I said, we're old fashioned.

626
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,900
We don't much care why we do the things we do.

627
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,120
Just so long as they're the right things.

628
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,000
Because even though the newer the better,

629
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,020
deep down inside you know the new is wrong.

630
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,920
It's different.

631
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,880
So it could be a mistake.

632
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,020
If it wasn't a mistake, then why didn't it happen before?

633
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,040
Because you see, we don't really want to know what we're doing.

634
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,740
We want to know what we're supposed to do.

635
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,860
And that's why you're here.

636
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,420
You take all the crazy random things we do we can't even explain ourselves

637
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,080
and put a good solid reason behind each and every one of them.

638
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,800
Because you don't really care what happens.

639
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,100
You want to know what's supposed to happen.

640
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,040
And that's why we're here.

641
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,840
Who are we?

642
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,040
We're you.

643
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,460
You don't settle for a less.

644
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,760
You don't have to.

645
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,720
You're you.

646
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,180
We're nothing without you.

647
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,180
And within you.

648
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,720
And someday you'll be nothing too.

649
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,200
Don't you think it's time you said,

650
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:24,900
Hi?

651
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Call now.

652
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,360
You remember our number.

653
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,360
Void will be prohibited.

654
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,300
Everywhere.

655
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,260
Hurry.

656
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,880
While the customer lasts.

657
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,540
Supply is limited.

658
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,600
In fact, we have an old saying.

659
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,820
Bye bye.

660
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,160
Bye.

661
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,240
That was Michael Pepe.

662
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,440
Michael Pepe doing ad, dear friends.

663
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,960
And if you don't know any of this,

664
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,620
you're listening to the Hour of Slack,

665
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,720
the voice of the subgenius race

666
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,520
in the great Southwest.

667
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,420
Thank y'all.

668
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,200
Praise Bob.

669
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,520
And you can write for information

670
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,100
from P.O. Box

671
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:31,060
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

672
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,700
www.subgenius.com

673
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,100
We may get that number again at the end of the broadcast

674
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,220
if we remember.

675
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,700
Don't just eat a hamburger.

676
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,120
Eat the hell out of it.

677
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,340
And I'm a man.

678
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,300
As I said, that would do anything for Bob.

679
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,680
What's that say, Bob?

680
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,240
The thing at all.

681
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,780
Bang my head against the floor.

682
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,500
Right now, Bob,

683
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,440
He killed himself for Bob

684
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,100
But I know I said that, Bob.

685
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,240
That's gonna hurt, Bob.

686
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,780
Well, I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it now, did I, Bob?

687
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,800
All I said was that that was gonna hurt, Bob.

688
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,280
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

689
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,480
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

690
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,100
thank you, Bob.

691
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:08,900
Thank you, Bob.

692
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,480
You're welcome.

693
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,120
Thank you so much.

694
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,080
Thank you, Bob.

695
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,100
Thank you Bob.

696
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:22,740
The advanced initiate, once freed from conspiracy programming as well as the worldly goods that enslaved him,

697
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:29,860
makes his pilgrimage to Dobstown, the church's fabulous walled encampment deep in the jungles of Malaysia.

698
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,580
There, the initiate's third nostril is surgically opened by psychic surgeons,

699
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,620
allowing him or her to whiff-read the psychic stench of those around him.

700
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,840
He masters the sciences of schizopreniatrics and memory editing,

701
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,900
creating a clean slate on which Bob may write.

702
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:54,540
The art of extra-meditation is taught, whereby the mind is voided upon the great throne of relief.

703
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,920
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

704
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,760
What is it that truly sets Bob apart from other would-be holy men and self-appointed gurus?

705
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,840
Everything.

706
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,460
For Bob has always existed.

707
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,240
There have always been Bobs.

708
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,780
Every epoch of man's history has had its Bob.

709
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,340
Most were what we would call good Bobs.

710
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,140
Others? Well, we needn't dwell on that.

711
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,200
The travelling sailor jokes of mythology are based on his early exploits.

712
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,860
So many ask, is Bob God?

713
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,500
The slapmaster himself vehemently denies that he is the messiah.

714
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,880
His mission is merely to show us how to live with our sins.

715
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,100
And who better?

716
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,220
Bob and Bob.

717
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,040
Bob admits he is a sinner.

718
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,540
He practically embodies all the failings of mortal men.

719
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,880
He has the power to fail.

720
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,480
Children, you'll never find an infallible post in the church of the subgenius.

721
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,800
Secondary and inferior imitation, churches might mean an infallible post.

722
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,340
But here, we've got to fail to succeed.

723
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,440
Bob is a very special kind of religious leader.

724
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,080
Bob is a short-duration personal saint.

725
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,220
He is a man of the world.

726
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:18,240
Yes, children, Bob wants you to take him in your heart and in your mind.

727
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,800
Bob wants you to take him in any checkbook.

728
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:27,380
But after you've taken him into the sacred place, Bob wants you to think about him, consider him, cast him out!

729
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,120
Bob wants you to do that in your own religion, your own rules.

730
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,080
Short-duration personal saviors, or Shordurper saints.

731
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,220
It is foolish and cowardly to cling to any one person's religion.

732
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:50,260
The hectic pace of modern life demands disposable saviors, specific ones, suited to the moment at hand.

733
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,620
A sort of while-you-wait-do-it-yourself religion.

734
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,880
Now, you're Shordurper's son, if anything, from a book you're reading,

735
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,300
to a smudge on the corner of a page of that book,

736
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,320
to a TV star you're currently enamored of,

737
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,600
to a brick that just misses crushing your skull as it falls from the cornice of a rotting building,

738
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,200
to the coagulated, dripping neck-stuff of a decapitated World Cup golfer,

739
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,380
and it can last anywhere from a nanosecond to your entire lifetime,

740
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:25,280
and you can have one or ten or millions of Shordurpers saints, concurrently, consecutively, and simultaneously.

741
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:33,380
Skeptical reporters were surprised when scientists from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory corroborated the story.

742
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,000
Short-duration personal saviors. It solves a key problem that kept cropping up in earlier days.

743
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,580
Turns out it only takes five minutes to solve a problem.

744
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:40,580


745
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,240
Five or six generations before the memory of a great spiritual leader like Muhammad or Jesus of Nazareth

746
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,960
is totally corrupted by the people who are retelling the story, all of whom have their own motives.

747
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,740
Five or six generations. That's only a hundred years, and up till now, that's been the maximum useful life of a religion.

748
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:05,300
After that, a sexual paranoid like Paul, or a megalomaniac like the Pope, King James, or the Ayatollah take control.

749
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,360
At that point, the religion is virtually used up.

750
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,580
The mass repression completely outweighs the problem.

751
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,420
The Church's other virtues.

752
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,920
Like a joke that's been told too often, it can only be used for punishment.

753
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,460
But with the short duration personal saviors, blind faith in an exalted person or object doesn't have to last even one generation.

754
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,880
It doesn't even have to last an hour.

755
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,260
Exactly.

756
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,820
A sub-genius judge can't be corrupted because it couldn't be more corrupt.

757
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,200
Which makes the crucial difference in long-term performance and maintenance.

758
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,240
Form your own local denomination or clinch.

759
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,820
Go forth into the world.

760
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,540
Spreading the C-word.

761
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,660
Even humans can be tricked into thinking they are sub-geniuses.

762
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,240
As Bob once said to L. Ron Hubbard,

763
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,460
They may be pink, but their money is green.

764
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,660
But there is a danger here.

765
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,820
A grave danger in sharing Bob's wisdom with the unworthy.

766
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:04,240
For prophecy tells us that the greatest threat to slack will come from inside the Church.

767
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,580
From those we sneeringly call the Bobbies.

768
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,500
Who would make this Church just like all the other religions?

769
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,680
I want to bring you to that.

770
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,560
It's frustrating dealing with them.

771
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,460
Very frustrating because they never know that I'm talking about them.

772
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,820
There's plenty of them here tonight.

773
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,420
Get them.

774
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,020
Bobbies.

775
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:24,860
Bobbies.

776
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,740
They'll be trying to sell you.

777
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:33,140
They'll be trying to sell you Bob Dobbs on a silver platter, my friend.

778
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,260
A cleaned up Bob.

779
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,600
A fancy Bob.

780
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,680
A new fangled Bob.

781
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,280
Not quite so.

782
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,260
Not so spooky and abnormal as he once was.

783
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,960
My friend, you'd better fear the day when Bob Dobbs becomes as wholesome as he looks.

784
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,280
Because on that day, my friend, your paychecks shall crumble.

785
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,040
Your three-room condos will fall to the ground.

786
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,760
You'll be tearing your face.

787
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,240
Tearing your face in agony trying to get one last breath of that Church air.

788
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:08,240
The one last glimpse of paradise before you get that eternity in hell that they talked you into buying.

789
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,800
Bob does not desire a monolithic one-world subgenius inquisition.

790
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,980
Schisms and interdenominational squabbling are encouraged and frequently forced.

791
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:24,500
Thus the con can never pin down our true numbers nor our actual plan.

792
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
You know what the anti-Bob wants?

793
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,120
The anti-Bob wants to see a planet of Bobs.

794
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,960
An entire planet of all-white, all-male salesmen.

795
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,960
In the subgenius Church, the only real heresy is orthodoxy.

796
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,060
There is a big difference between salvation and salivation.

797
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,660
I run a schism for a hostile division within the Church.

798
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,140
Called the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

799
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,360
That's named after me, Buck Naked.

800
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,020
That's my name.

801
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,180
That is my name, by the way.

802
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:01,320
We are involved always in casting out the false prophets within the Church.

803
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,220
The Namby Pamby, Pinkoid, Mediogra Nins, and Pucoid, whatever.

804
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:05,780
Great.

805
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,400
Great.

806
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,080
Great.

807
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:07,780
Great.

808
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:08,780
Great.

809
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,000
Great.

810
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,360
Great.

811
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:11,900
Great.

812
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,100
Great.

813
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,140
Great.

814
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,540
Great.

815
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,220
Great.

816
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,000
Great.

817
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,320
Great.

818
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:16,840
Great.

819
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,320
Great.

820
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:17,420
Great.

821
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:17,980
Great.

822
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:17,980


823
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,360
Great.

824
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,980
Great.

825
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,540
Great.

826
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:19,540


827
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:19,540


828
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:19,560
Great.

829
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,560


830
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,420
Great.

831
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:20,620


832
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,420
Great.

833
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:22,940
Great.

834
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,320
Great.

835
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,960
of the subgenius video towards down towards the end of the video remember to wear your favorite

836
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,520
socks okay

837
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:44,100
the subgenius is not a member of any group any club any organization the subgenius is not even

838
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:51,140
a member of the church itself i want to make sure you understand that because as soon as we start

839
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:57,260
thinking thinking for ourselves we might come up with something dangerous something that they don't

840
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:02,760
want us to think that's why we have all these things we have to buy we have to get we have to

841
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,260
be we have to wear we have to think because they don't want us to think at all they want to keep

842
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:14,280
busy all the time working on all these distractions because if we ever once think for

843
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:20,080
ourselves we'll realize that we have always had slack and we always will have slack and the only

844
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,900
thing they can take

845
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,120
are things that we don't know

846
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,180
from us is our awareness of slack they can never really take our true slack

847
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:39,960
he said I love you watching me right now is a god they must be taught that Bob is

848
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:58,760
not the answer and neither is anything else only their money and so we must purge our ranks of the

849
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:06,700
unclean deprogram our own zombies the methods he advocates are drastic for he hath commanded

850
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,940
you shall do as I say and so shall I

851
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,360
think for yourself or kill me

852
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,400
this is a key rule for dealing with the pink members of the society the conspiracy that

853
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,440
wants to crush you and turn you into a mindless dude the or kill me rule elevates every every

854
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,620
instance of contact every interface as we say here on the coast with the conspiracy

855
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,500
into the all-time encounter

856
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,460
rule that raises the stakes of your dealing with conspiracy

857
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,420
the rule that lets the conspiracy know that you don't take no mess

858
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:39,840
you

859
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,100
have

860
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,240
versus children

861
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,880
I don't know let's let's think of an example let's say you go into the boss and you want to raise

862
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,780
you say to that boss I want to raise or kill me

863
00:49:52,100 --> 00:50:08,040
now let's say that Boston policeman has had a very odd moment and he's decided to pull you over for a movie violation I know it's unheard of but cast your imagination out there children let's say he does and he pulls you over and says where's the fire buddy and you say the fire did my heart survive or what

864
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,720
fire

865
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,100
fire

fire

867
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:09,860
fire

868
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,800

871
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:23,480
fire

872
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:23,520
fire

fire

877
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


878
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


879
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


880
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


881
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


882
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


883
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


884
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


885
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


886
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


887
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


888
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


889
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


890
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


891
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


892
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


893
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


894
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:49,660
Bob is a conspiracy duped clone, uh, glorp.

895
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,520
So he probably ought to be off.

896
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,780
He supports the conspiracy.

897
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,000
He, uh, he promotes class division.

898
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,120
Um, but other than that, you know, he's a pretty nice guy for a personal savior.

899
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,980
But none could have guessed how literally the words,

900
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:12,500
or kill me, were to be taken until that fateful night of January 22nd, 1984.

901
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,100
A night that will live in infamy.

902
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,280
For it was in this San Francisco theater that, if we are to believe the photographic evidence,

903
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,440
Bob Dobbs was slain by a crazed assassin's bullet.

904
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:34,500
Steal yourself, for the footage you are about to see is not for the faint-hearted.

905
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,500
Oh, Bob, we'll be here tonight!

906
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,360
Tonight, Bob will be here!

907
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,640
And I'm scared!

908
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:45,720
Can you, can you be ready for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for!

909
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,560
Friends, this is it.

910
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,080
This is the moment.

911
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,640
On, recorded on sound, and also in the video.

912
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,700
The video you can see at the Stark Club this weekend.

913
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,960
Bob Dobbs walks out on stage.

914
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,580
He waves to the audience, he's grinning.

915
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:04,520
And suddenly, a crazed gunman runs out and fires three, no, four, five bullets into him!

916
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,480
The gunman is hit over the head with a...

917
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,860
a whiskey bottle and knocked out and he lays on the ground.

918
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,140
Friends, the backstage is in confusion.

919
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,320
The footage that I'm seeing here on this video replay is hideous and bloody and gory.

920
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,620
And you can see it too.

921
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,860
You can see the death of Bob on this videotape.

922
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,040
This new and...

923
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,660
Friends, let's get back to that revival.

924
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,260
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure all of you know by now that just a few moments ago,

925
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,980
the Supreme Epops of the Church of Subgenius, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

926
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,380
was felled by a crazed, lone nut assassin.

927
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,100
Felled in the prime of his life.

928
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,800
His pipe, Bob's pipe is broken.

929
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,660
Could it be that the reign of Bob on Earth has ended?

930
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:01,720
Friends, friends, we're going to have to continue this investigation next week

931
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,480
because we've run out of time.

932
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,100
Yes?

933
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,320
Next week on the Hour of Slack, Hour of Slack number 101 it will be

934
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,900
because this was the 100th Hour of Slack.

935
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,880
100 hours of Slack ending with Bob's death.

936
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:20,060
Next week, however, we will find out just what insidious details

937
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:27,680
and what puzzling evidence leads us to believe the actual truth behind this alleged assassination.

938
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,000
All that and more next week.

939
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,200
The theme of Doc's Doc.

940
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,840
Doc's Doc Mountain all the time.

941
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,780
Doc's Doc Mountain.

942
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,920
Doc's Doc, for those who didn't suffer through it last week,

943
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,260
is the subgenius re-indoctrination education camp

944
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:54,380
that's held out in the woods for the noble subgenius doctors and musicians,

945
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:00,100
those who operate, who rip and tear into each other creatively.

946
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,620
It was, I think this was Doc's Doc number 46,

947
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,800
or .01101, something like that.

948
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:12,440
And it was as important as the post-ritual instructions with St. Byron Werner

949
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,920
at the Temple of the Big Blue Cylindrical Life Force

950
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,500
that seemed, friends, to emanate the true essence of Dob's

951
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,780
and his fusion from Aleph to Yomamama.

952
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,680
Perhaps not, but how can we beat,

953
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,060
how can we express the ineluctable modality,

954
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,860
of our sodality, dear friends?

955
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,320
For we Wotan'd, we Wolwode, we Kabrog-fran'd,

956
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,880
and we launched the head at Doc's Doc,

957
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,780
and Bob still pretends to be dead.

958
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:52,780
But we know that when that lightning ripped across the sky

959
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,400
after Doctors for Bob finished jamming,

960
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,140
that vertical, diffused, non-linear lightning that came from everywhere at once,

961
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,420
we knew that Bob had returned.

962
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,040
And what about those mysterious power surges

963
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,780
that began when the band that does not speak to each other

964
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,600
started playing Synchro Bob?

965
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,540
Oh, it was hot, dear friends.

966
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,020
Why was it impossible for me to stand up that Saturday night?

967
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,440
And who was that doctor who called the cyborgs in

968
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,680
and put me in the Resistaint module?

969
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,620
All I could see was the white wall Vreedies

970
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,540
holding out his safety deposit box.

971
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,920
Oh, Kabrog-fran and I were losing.

972
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,660
My nose.

973
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,940
But it's okay. It's lighter now.

974
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,940
And I've got a new implant!

975
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,320
And the third phase RNA program just kicked in!

976
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:49,500
But what did Philo mean when he said he knew all about the conditions at the bottom of the lake?

977
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:53,440
And why were the only pills available 25 bucks a shot

978
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,940
and already on the prohibited index?

979
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,760
Swami Hagen wasn't there, but we did our best.

980
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,460
And Jaina agreed.

981
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,640
But what could he know as he...

982
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:08,560
...surprised and flopped on the floor with the living gee shocked out of him by Dobbs or perhaps...

983
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,140
...who only knows...

984
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,920
...some ungodly pharmaceutical popery?

985
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,640
Oh, Dockstock.

986
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,400
It was Dockstock.

987
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,040
The abrasion popes were there.

988
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,300
The pope of all New York arrived by parrot ship.

989
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,240
Uh...

990
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,340
And, uh...

991
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:30,880
To personally oversee, I believe, the closeout of the defunct llama stud farm.

992
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,820
And G. Gordon...

993
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,320
Gordon Gordon was there, dear friends, desperate as ever.

994
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,160
He took me behind the left speaker banks and messed up my attitude.

995
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:41,500
Gave me three recipes for plastic explosives.

996
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,840
Easily made from, uh...

997
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,720
...redly available cheap chemicals.

998
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,760
Dear friends, anytime.

999
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:52,520
So later when he and Unibrow were swapping f-stops and showed everyone some fancy shootin'...

1000
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,340
...a lot of people left, uh...

1001
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,740
...to go, uh...

1002
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,920
...cruising around on the lake to avoid shell shock.

1003
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:58,740
And that's...

1004
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,120
...that's what happened at Dockstock.

1005
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,780
But that wasn't nearly as...

1006
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,260
...see, I'm delirious, friends.

1007
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,660
This Dockstock virus has just got me...

1008
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,120
...it's got me just wearin' down.

1009
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,680
I'm...

1010
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,340
...batteries, batteries, just all...

1011
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,060
...I need a recharge.

1012
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,860
I need to sap into the power of some listener out there.

1013
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:18,920
Hmm...

1014
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,060
...let me whiff.

1015
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,900
Yes, I smell a new one.

1016
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,040
They're easy to recognize.

1017
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,800
Oh, yeah!

1018
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,060
Oh.

1019
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:29,700
Oh.

1020
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,360
Oh.

1021
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,220
Where was I?

1022
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,080
Oh.

1023
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:32,940
Oh.

1024
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,200
Oh.

1025
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,960
You were in 1987, maybe, Ivan...

1026
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,620
...and, uh, you were in the little Dallas station that went bad.

1027
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,600
K-N-O-N.

1028
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,980
And it was the 100th hour of slack as opposed to this rerun...

1029
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:51,320
...which is the 1,176th hour of slack...

1030
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,900
...uh, which is on 20 or so stations that are good.

1031
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,760
Uh, there's been some water under that old bridge, let me tell you.

1032
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,820
But you can learn more about our church, our books and videos, and how to become an ordained minister from...

1033
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,440
...subgenius.com.

1034
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:18,140
Or from P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1035
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:28,640
Or you could check out our events page regarding the November 15th Subgenius D-Vival in Baltimore at Load of Fun.

1036
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:28,740
Subgenius.com.

1037
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:33,780
Uh, last year's Baltimore D-Vival was great, and this one likewise features...

1038
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:39,500
...the amino acids, Priestess Pisces, Reverend Carter LeBlanc, Reverend Susie the Floozy...

1039
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,520
...the band Fat Free, and even the Motor Morons.

1040
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,660
And yours truly, Reverend Stan.

1041
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,500
This background music, by the way, is from Save Your Self.

1042
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,160
Again, that's subgenius.com for everything.

1043
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,980
But really, really for everything.

1044
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,780
What you really need is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1045
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,620
Praise Bob.

1046
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,080
Praise Bob.
