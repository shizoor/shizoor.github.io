26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,100
look at these dropouts they think they're having fun if we were agricultural workers the day would

27
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,160

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,380

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,800
anthony the room's going a bit spinny anyway you know justимость isn't something to brag about

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:19,800


31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,600
and I think I might, um...

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,000
I've got some sick.

33
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,840
Can you get me out of here, Mark?

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,100
OK, OK.

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,740
What you need is some peace and quiet and some rest

36
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,620
and a cup of tea and some toast with peanut butter.

37
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, that sounds nice.

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,740
Hey, Soph, where are you going?

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,180
We're going to have a spleef.

40
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,300
Say hello to my little friend.

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,100
She's going to bed.

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,880
She doesn't want any more of your drugs.

43
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,040
Right, OK, that's it. Turn the music down.

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,680
You can stop smoking your drugs.

45
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm making tea and toast for Sophie.

46
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,840
I'm putting on Radio 4.

47
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,220
Everything's normal.

48
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm not really high on drugs,

49
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,160
so you can stop talking your nonsense on my time.

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,620
Well, what's the problem, man? Can't we just chill?

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,180
No, you can't. You've been chilling long enough.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,340
This is reality calling.

53
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,060
But what about you and me? The bond?

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,760
There is no bond.

55
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,280
You're not a bad person, but I'm afraid to say you are a moron.

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,400
Now, pull your socks up and get your shoes on.

57
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,180
Come on, all of you.

58
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,160
Oh, man!

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,440
And listen.

60
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,160
While we're at it, there are...

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,540
The Soul Genius Hour of Swag.

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,100
Mr. Smith, he tried to kill me.

63
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,280
He tried to kill me.

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,140
We were in this car and he kept going faster and faster.

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,860
You get some rest, Bob.

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,480
Yeah, you, uh, sleep it off.

67
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,220
There's an explanation for everything.

68
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,120
You're all doped up and you're all so dead tired.

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,380
You sleep it off and I'll see what I can do about getting you a leave to get on home.

70
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,420
All right.

71
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,860
All along, I thought there was some kind of malfunction up there.

72
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,580
Fuel or propulsion or just communication.

73
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,140
Maybe the malfunction was closer to home.

74
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,360
Maybe it was right up here between my ears.

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,220
Look, you talk like that, you think like that, and you'll come around to believing it.

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
And that's stupid, Bob.

77
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,500
We're dealing with nine natural laws plus a whole string of imponderables.

78
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,500
And reasons are going to come out.

79
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,580
Legitimate, rational reasons.

80
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,340
Well, you just...

81
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,840
Just lie there and breathe through your nose.

82
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,700
Dream good. I'll see you later.

83
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,620
And I think everyone has room to grow.

84
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,980
And I think everyone has room to grow.

85
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,900
But Bob is perfectly satisfied.

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,800
Everything you say is completely right.

87
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,660
And everything Bob says is completely wrong.

88
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,620
I've got dozens of items like that.

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,260
Men talked about who never existed.

90
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,480
Men who existed and not even mentioned.

91
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,780
Historical events that I know.

92
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,220
No, happened a certain way.

93
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,060
Somehow, according to the encyclopedia, didn't happen.

94
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,180
Or happened another way.

95
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,160
The things I remember are not delusions.

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,040
They're the legitimate recollections of things as I remember them.

97
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,260
But somehow, someway, this world seems to have turned upside down for me.

98
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,500
It's as if there were...

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,800
There were another world parallel to mine.

100
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,820
As if this world were almost a twin.

101
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,380
Except for some minor differences that happened somewhere along the line of evolution.

102
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,940
Bob, for the love of heaven...

103
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Do you want to follow that line of reasoning?

104
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,180
Because if you do, there are a couple of built-in conditions that go along with it.

105
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,580
Conditions that I don't think you or anyone else wants to admit.

106
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,060
First and foremost, they happen to be that if all this is true...

107
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,540
If you suddenly uncovered a theory that there are two Earths, two sets of people, two histories...

108
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,220
And you somehow, inexplicably...

109
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,280
Inexplicably...

110
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,760
Inexplicably...

111
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:47,760


112
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:47,760


113
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:47,760


114
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,040
crossed over to the other dimension,

115
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,820
then you're not who we think you are.

116
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,600
And we're not who you think we are.

117
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,960
Meet Bob.

118
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,240
Meet Bob.

119
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,200
Meet Bob.

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,000
Meet Bob.

121
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,500
He's a typical American who works hard,

122
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,860
loves his family,

123
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,680
and has cheated on his tax return.

124
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,160
Life is good.

125
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,880
But lately, he's noticed some slight changes in his

126
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,240
power.

127
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,940
We only lost you for about six hours.

128
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,380
We had contact with you all the rest of the time.

129
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,740
I can't help that, sir.

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,280
During that six hours, I lived out a week.

131
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,580
Doing what?

132
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,460
Looking at our counterparts.

133
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,340
Looking at us.

134
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,380
Us?

135
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,200
Us, as we exist in a parallel world.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,640
One that exists alongside, but which we can't see.

137
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,540
It's the world I stumbled into.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,920
I don't know how.

139
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,220
Some kind of space-time continuum.

140
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,400
Some war page.

141
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,060
There's a doorway up there somewhere.

142
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,660
I know.

143
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,720
It exists.

144
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,680
Every now and then, I think it's possible for somebody to fall through it.

145
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,800
And I did.

146
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,140
How did you get back, Bob?

147
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,820
I don't even know that.

148
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,620
All I can remember is running toward the spacecraft.

149
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,720
And then, I was up there again.

150
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,640
And then I was back here.

151
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,440
Well,

152
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
Bob, I think, uh,

153
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,000
sleep on this for a little while, will you?

154
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,320
Why?

155
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,980
Well, because, uh, I think, uh, this may just be a delusion.

156
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,180
A delusion?

157
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,700
This was no delusion.

158
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,540
It was no dream.

159
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
I have no proof I told you that.

160
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,220
Mm-hmm.

161
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,260
Well, um, okay, Major.

162
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,060
We'll, uh, talk about it later.

163
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,380
Merry Christmas, Bob.

164
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,880
Off you later, Bob.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,280
Oh, my goodness.

166
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,540
Oh, my goodness.

167
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:46,740


168
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:46,880


169
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:46,900


170
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,740
Yeah, love you, Slreb.

171
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,620
No, Bob!

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,540
They can't!

173
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,020
Tell me r-i-a-a

174
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,400
You that sue all the sites

175
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,700
You that tear down the torrents

176
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,580
You that fight dirty fights

177
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,900
You that haven't got gonads

178
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,880
You that haven't got gonads

179
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:16,880


180
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:16,880


181
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,740
You that cease and desist

182
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,900
I just want you to know

183
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,660
We are going to resist

184
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,100
You that never done nothing

185
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,100
But lawyers employ

186
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,460
To stop us from file sharing

187
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,240
You, your minions deploy

188
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,740
You put a suit in my mailbox

189
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,860
And you take me to court

190
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,940
Lest I pay you the millions

191
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,260
You try to extort

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,460
Like a wretch of old

193
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,320
Nesterizing your greed

194
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,340
Slithering through the courtroom

195
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,220
Sewing your blood

196
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,540
And your evil seed

197
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,820
You send out your subpoenas

198
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,700
To the children in schools

199
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,700
You're a cowardly pack

200
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,940
Of goddamn little fools

201
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,360
Let me ask you one question

202
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,120
Are the settlements good?

203
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,480
Does it make us buy CDs?

204
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,480
As you wish that it would

205
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,760
I think you will find

206
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,840
When your law bills come due

207
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,780
That they'll never be covered

208
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,960
By all the people you sue

209
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,320
And I hope you go broke

210
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,000
And you'll file bankruptcy

211
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,500
As your towers of power

212
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,200
Will fall apart

213
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,200


214
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,200


215
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,200


216
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,700
And your old business model

217
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,840
Sink into their deathbed

218
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,760
And you forever in hell

219
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,160
Give Justin Bieber a head

220
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,300
Praise Phineas Narco

221
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,180
And I hope you'll see you next time

222
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,180


223
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,720
Who did that?

224
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,640
Let us start by your learning

225
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,520
What are the dynamics of a crowd?

226
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,060
How do you move a mob, Mr. Fulmer?

227
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,540
How do you excite them?

228
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,640
How do you make them feel as one with you?

229
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,620
I don't even know how

230
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,080
Join them first, Mr. Fulmer

231
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,820
Join them?

232
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,380
Yes

233
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,300
When you speak to them

234
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,920
Speak to them as if you were a member of the mob

235
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,780
Speak to them in their language

236
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,220
On their level

237
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,400
Make their hate your hate

238
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,020
If they are poor

239
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,280
Talk to them of poverty

240
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,260
If they are afraid

241
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,400
Talk to them of their fears

242
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,100
And if they are angry, Mr. Fulmer

243
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,280
If they are angry

244
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,260
Give them objects for their anger

245
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,320
But most of all

246
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,300
The thing that is most of the essence, Mr. Fulmer

247
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,380
Is that you make this mob

248
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,360
An extension of yourself

249
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,820
Say to them

250
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,420
Things like

251
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,240
Things like

252
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,380
They call us hate-mongers

253
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,840
They say we're prejudiced

254
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,700
They say we're biased

255
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,540
They say we hate minorities

256
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,780
Minorities

257
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,120
Understand the term, neighbors

258
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,800
Minorities

259
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,360
Should I tell you who are the minorities?

260
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,620
Should I tell you?

261
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,160
We

262
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,800
We are the minorities!

263
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,200
We are the minorities!

264
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,440
We are the minorities!

265
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:15,440


266
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:15,840
Neighbors

267
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,980
Neighbors

268
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,180
They call us hate-mongers

269
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,340
They say we're prejudiced

270
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:38,540
They say we're biased

271
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,460
They say that we hate the minorities!

272
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,640
They say we hate the minorities!

273
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,240
The minorities

274
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,900
Understand the term, neighbors

275
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,940
The minorities

276
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,640
Shall I tell you who the minorities are?

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,820
We, we, we

278
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,320
We are the minorities!

279
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,980
Because patriotism

280
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,100
Is the minority

281
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,260
Because love of country

282
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,640
Is the minority

283
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,360
Subject is the minority

284
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,880
Because to live

285
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,040
In a free white America

286
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,420
Seems to be of a minority opinion

287
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,560
Well

288
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,380
If it's a minority opinion

289
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,320
That we have to survive

290
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,840
Then we are the minority!

291
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,240
And this minority

292
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,960
Will not stop

293
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,300
Until it is the majority!

294
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
This minority

295
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,960
Will not give up the fight!

296
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,720
This

297
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,780
Is the promise

298
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,520
And this

299
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,340
This is the legacy!

300
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,180
Thank you, Mr. Harper

301
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,820
And now, Mr. Harper

302
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,200
American Television

303
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,180
You ready?

304
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,960
Budapest is the capital of what European country?

305
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,100
Budapest is the capital of what European country Nathan has already locked in?

306
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,680
This might be a stupid question

307
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm guessing it's probably going to be

308
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,380
Okay, like

309
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,620
I thought Europe was a country

310
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,800
I don't know what I'm doing

311
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,360
Kel

312
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,140
What?

313
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,500
Focus

314
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,520
Let's see

315
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,140
Buda

316
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,500
Budapest?

317
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,940
Let's talk about this

318
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,360
I've never even heard of that

319
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,020
Alright, here's your option

320
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,000
Like I'm listening to what you're saying

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,460
But I only hear what I want to

322
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,980
I mean, you could drop out with $10,000

323
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,160
See, I am just going to

324
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,960
Like I know they speak French there

325
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,500
Don't they?

326
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,160
Like I want to say

327
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,740
So what if you beep instead of getting back?

328
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:17,740
I'm talking about shit

329
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,220
What about stock oil?

330
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,320
I mean, can I just kiss the head or something?

331
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,500
I don't know

332
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:23,960
Look, I cant see

333
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,180
It would be tough if I had the brain

334
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,160
Do you think the French country is separate

335
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,380
What's the subject of the question?

336
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,380


337
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,600
Well

338
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,020
Um

339
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,560
Are they talking about foreheads?

340
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:37,160
In a way, the receding forehead of the American television guest.

341
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:43,900
And the prosthetic head, the one that Dave wears on the back.

342
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,760
The fine electric forehead of Dave.

343
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,800
And we must say, yes, Lonesome Cowboy Dave has just called the station.

344
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,900
He's the only one who's allowed to call the station.

345
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

346
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,400
The only one with the onerous plasticity and the right length of arm units per inch.

347
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,720
He's got a long one, all right.

348
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,420
Yep.

349
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,040
Now, we have to thank Reverend Sweetness McGee for that last little cut.

350
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,740
Ms. Budapest in the Big Ten 8 place.

351
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,120
Phineas Narco, Reverend Phineas Narco did that great song, Masters of RIAA.

352
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,000
And Phineas is with NASCAR.

353
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,360
National Cynical Radio, nationalcynical.com.

354
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,100
And his show, in fact, streams, I think, every Sunday night right after Hour of Slack.

355
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,960
But not on insert station named here.

356
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:52,260
You could, if you looked at alt.slack or scrubgenius or subgenius.com radio page,

357
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,720
you might find links to that streaming where you could go straight to

358
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,000
National Cynical Radio.

359
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,920
Nationalcynical.com.

360
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,440
The collages were by The Large, except for the Twilight Zone or Toilet Zone bits, as we call them,

361
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,060
which were edited a bit by me.

362
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:16,280
And yes, that was Dennis Hopper ranting Hitler style from a Twilight Zone.

363
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,160
And we'll hear more of that surprisingly familiar sounding ranting.

364
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,400
Even though that Twilight Zone, about like a little Hitler,

365
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,320
a little fascist Nazi in the U.S.

366
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,420
That Twilight Zone's from 1963.

367
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,540
And yet it sounds just like Hitler in 1940-something.

368
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:46,620
And yet it also sounds just like what you hear on your AM radio dial here in the year of 2010.

369
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,340
40 years after Dennis Hopper was doing a satire on Hitler.

370
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,940
It sounds just like what you hear on the radio today.

371
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,380
And we will be hearing more of that.

372
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,640
Isn't it unusual that it's 80 years after the radio programs of such people as Father Coughlin,

373
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,360
who preached a form of American Nazism, and the seven nasty no-no's of propaganda.

374
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,080
And it's only been a scant, I don't know how many years, but it's like around 20 years.

375
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,820
I look a scant at them.

376
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,740
You look at scantily clad.

377
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,080
But yeah, yeah, it's like nothing has changed.

378
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,220
But Dave, you know, before the radio and the TV,

379
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:33,640
why they were rantin' the same way 500 years ago, thousand, 10,000 years ago.

380
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,220
First, I was a damned Hitler.

381
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,360
Some guy in Sumeria was standing on top of the temple going,

382
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:47,860
Are we going to allow these foreigners to enter our country and taint our Sumerian culture?

383
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:57,200
Will they stop us from our beloved freedoms of disfiguring women and boogering little boys?

384
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,200


385
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,800
Will they stomp on our freedom?

386
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,420
No, because we are the minorities.

387
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:12,180
And of course, we subgeniuses have learned a lot from these demigogs and demigods,

388
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,440
demitasses of very, very strong coffee.

389
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,700
It is a rhetoric-based cult.

390
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,720
And these policies and usages and slang terminologies brought by the aliens to us

391
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,260
and transmitted directly into our forebrains and exciting the pineal gland gives us a little

392
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:38,160
bit more juice than the other Socratic clubfoot, you know, arguing is like,

393
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,800
I will present the facts.

394
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,500
We don't have to present facts.

395
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,900
I wanted to play some of this where after you called in so you could hear more of the Dennis Hopper.

396
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,960
I mean, I love the fact that it's Dennis Hopper.

397
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,260
It's only about, what, four years before Easy Rider.

398
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,140
Here, let's see.

399
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,660
Oh, is he cute, too?

400
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,620
Oh, my goodness.

401
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,520
I remember back then Robert Duvall had a bunch of hair.

402
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,480
Yeah.

403
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:16,600
Yes, we saw him in a Twilight Zone where he played a nerdy little fellow who fell in love with a female doll in a dollhouse in a museum.

404
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,200
And of course, it being a Twilight Zone at the end of it, there he was, a little doll in the museum.

405
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,260
That's in every Twilight Zone.

406
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,700
You find out that you are a doll.

407
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:26,700


408
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,320
So, we want to welcome you to this line of dialogue.

409
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,360
Maybe we should have external

410
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:41,840
Or even innate quantitative analysis.

411
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,900
He was never a ghost but he стоит still and thinks he knows something and feels like he knows something and he's frozen.

412
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,440
Why did Mr.

413
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:01,660
One minute of Dennis Hopper playing an early teabagger on the Twilight Zone.

414
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,500
I am.

415
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,600
Like, I'm listening to what you're saying, but I only hear what I want to hear.

416
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,780
I understand, honey.

417
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,600
I understand.

418
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,520
Thank you, Miss Budapest.

419
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,740
Come on, Dennis.

420
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,160
Come on up.

421
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,600
Very stupendous.

422
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,560
Very stupendous.

423
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:17,840
Very stupendous.

424
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,100
Like, I'm listening to what you're saying, but I only hear what I want to hear.

425
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,800
Examine the phenomenon of foreign control.

426
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:37,060
You examine it, and you will note with absolute clarity that the lines lead directly to...

427
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
The Muslimics.

428
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,240
Palestine.

429
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,500
They lead directly to Africa.

430
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,640
And the Muslimics.

431
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,720
They lead directly to the Vatican.

432
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:47,920
The Vatican.

433
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,300
Some genius stark fist temple launch.

434
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,140
So, so, there we are.

435
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,780
There it is.

436
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,760
There is a conspiracy.

437
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,960
There is an insidious, enveloping conspiracy.

438
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,960
A conspiracy personified by the yellow man, by the black man, and by foreigners who come

439
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,740
in and infiltrate into our economic structure.

440
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,880
The slack man.

441
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,880
Oh, there come a warning.

442
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,640
Yes, there will.

443
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,680
There will come a warning.

444
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:25,840
When these men have taken over your home, they've taken over your daughters, and they'll

445
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,860
be sitting right there on your doorstep.

446
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,180
If anybody's sitting on your doorstep, buddy, he's a man in a white coat.

447
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,220
You better just go with him quietly.

448
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,080
You think that's pretty funny, don't you?

449
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,480
They chopped off all my hair.

450
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,780
They chopped off all my hair.

451
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,360
They chopped off all my hair.

452
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,740
They chopped off all my hair.

453
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,020
They chopped off all my hair.

454
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:46,960
They chopped off all my hair.

455
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,820
They chopped off all my hair.

456
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,440
They chopped off all my hair.

457
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,980
They chopped off all my hair.

458
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,860
They chopped off all my hair.

459
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,080
They chopped off all my hair.

460
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,940
They cut my nose in a...

461
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:53,940


462
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,760
Trust that.

463
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,580
This look will hopefully get me more vag in the future.

464
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,140
I think we can get more vag in the future.

465
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,600
Then they give you a bob.

466
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,940
They gave her a bob.

467
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,820
They cut off her hair, and they gave her a bob.

468
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,340
And that's what they're going to do to you, my friend.

469
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,920
And then she got more vag?

470
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,680
If you don't hang on to your American freedoms.

471
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,860
Well, how about that—

472
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,540
That would be a hell of a bob cut, wouldn't it?

473
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,800
To have all our freedoms removed.

474
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,040
No slack whatsoever.

475
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,600
So ever.

476
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,360
That would be.

477
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:17,960
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,420
Well, I've read several times on the Internet today that we already have no freedoms at all.

479
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,600
None.

480
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,660
They have the freedom to say that much.

481
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,520
But that's it.

482
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,600
It's the last freedom.

483
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:38,040
This guy was heaping as as as I as the one guy said, if it wasn't for the liberals blaming others for all their problems, I wouldn't have any problems.

484
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,300
It's all the liberals fought for blaming other people for all their problems.

485
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,040
So it's just too confusing to even think about.

486
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:59,620
If if with if if everything's all mottled and tarled up, everything's a lie concealed in an enigma shrouded in a of disinformation.

487
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,100
Unfortunately, it makes me pee, Stan.

488
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,480
It makes me pee in angst, nausea as I bark to the wind.

489
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,180
I scream out dirty names and I don't even know what they mean.

490
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,220
I got to stop watching and listen to my median.

491
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,420
I don't feel like that young children ought to be exposed to that stuff.

492
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,020
And neither do I.

493
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:32,800
I think I think everybody's cerebral cortex needs to be exposed to truth, justice in the American way.

494
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:41,200
I don't mean specifically in that order, but I think that there needs to be something done or something needs to be.

495
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:41,760
I'm sorry.

496
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,880
There needs to be something dumb.

497
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,920
Oh, wait.

498
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,840
There you go.

499
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,560
I think they beat us to it.

500
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,960
The church of the subgenius wasn't dumb enough.

501
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,680
Just like my flaccid unit.

502
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,060
It will not respond.

503
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,280
That's when you try and teach something something and it refuses to admit or decipher.

504
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,000
So I got a mind of its own.

505
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,280
Don't you?

506
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:04,620
Yep.

507
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,000
A kind of mess of ganglion of all rodded and become.

508
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,280
I don't know.

509
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,720
This peptic and septic and.

510
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,920
When your brain is rotten, you got some problems.

511
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,360
Well, but how do you know?

512
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,560
See, how do you know when your brain's gotten all rotted?

513
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,920
Well, my third nostril is how I know I can smell it.

514
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:32,540
There's a lot of people out there with rotten brains who want to tell everybody else that they're the only ones whose brains aren't rotten.

515
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,720
You won't hear me saying I don't have a rotten brain that proves my brain might not be rotten.

516
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,860
See, because I'm still suspecting.

517
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,600
Of myself.

518
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,220
Could my brain be fully rotted yet?

519
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,980
Double check every minute.

520
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,940
And but again, how do you know?

521
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,420
How do you know when you've gone as crazy as the next guy?

522
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
Keep a log, baby.

523
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,380
Maybe keep a diary with a lot of actually that makes it worse.

524
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:05,420
My experience with that is that the more crazier they are, the more detailed of a diary they keep of everything.

525
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,080
Yeah.

526
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,820
As if you could to control.

527
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,020
You see.

528
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:10,840
Yeah.

529
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:10,840


530
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:10,840


531
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:10,840


532
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:10,840


533
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:10,840


534
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:10,840


535
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,560
Well, control what is uncontrollable.

536
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,280
Indeed, the circumstances engulfing a person like that who has to write down every.

537
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,280
Wait a minute.

538
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,600
Let me get.

539
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,740
Let me take notes.

540
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:23,940
Yeah.

541
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,480
I can't.

542
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,480
This music in the background is.

543
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm not sure how to pronounce this guy's name.

544
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,220
Joseph Mestres or Mestres.

545
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,380
An album called Quadrini.

546
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,120
Mr.

547
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,600
Sister gave it to us.

548
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,360
With a bunch of other.

549
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,680
Really weird stuff from his collection.

550
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,560
Listen to that.

551
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,160
Avant.

552
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,760
Yeah, it's Avant.

553
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,340
This is the sound of the late 1960s.

554
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,680
You're tripping out on LSD.

555
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,940
You're tripping out.

556
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,280
Your favorite.

557
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,760
Tune on.

558
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,620
Turn out.

559
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,160
Tina.

560
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,100
Turn on.

561
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,500
Tenant.

562
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,080
Tenant.

563
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,540
Tenant.

564
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:08,720
Tenant.

565
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,120
Tenant.

566
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,200
Tenant.

567
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,340


568
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,020
I don't want it to get even worse.

569
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,160
I'm sorry.

570
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,260
There we go.

571
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,500
We can make it even more tripped out.

572
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,540
Screwy.

573
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,760
Crazy in the background.

574
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
The only problem.

575
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,540
There's a вс a gy ïn show we play four different

576
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,660
soundtracks in the background at once.

577
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,640
The thing that's wrong with a lot of these tone,

578
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,380
tone poems of the late 60s and late 50s or late 50s

579
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,220
all the way through the late 60s and even include

580
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,700
thing all the way up to the Reformation period

581
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,680
of people like glass and so forth who we can see

582
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:38,960
so.

583
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,900
市 car lives together so to speak.

584
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,920
rather than a random possibility with a tone poem.

585
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,620
And what we find is...

586
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,160
But anyway, it's like you hit the piano,

587
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,260
like get five different keys at one time,

588
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,640
and then you go...

589
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,980
Then you go...

590
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,280
Like that, three times.

591
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,460
You can be in Frank Zappa's band.

592
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,240
Oh, he's dead.

593
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,580
Oh, shucks.

594
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,160
Well, you know, in the Church of the Subgenius,

595
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,080
or at least in our early books,

596
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,140
we promoted something called anti-music.

597
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,120
And to tell the truth, we were kidding.

598
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,980
We didn't think anybody would take us up on it.

599
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,160
And much to our horror,

600
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,080
all these anti-music doctor bands formed,

601
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,060
and they would expect to play at our shows.

602
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,920
And they did.

603
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,000
Whether we said okay or not,

604
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,340
I can remember bands setting up right on the floor of the theater

605
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,440
and just making as much horrible noise as they possibly could,

606
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,460
deliberately not...

607
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,600
Playing an instrument that knew how to play.

608
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,220
I've found that I've been guilty, but only when I was getting paid.

609
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,360
When I was in doctor bands, I got paid at least $5.

610
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,580
Which in those days, I mean, $5, you could buy a house for that in 1980.

611
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,620
Well, yeah.

612
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,500
That's how I got to where I am today.

613
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,220
Bringing new meaning to the word dissonance.

614
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,780
Mortgages, houses, $5 houses.

615
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,160
Pick them up, sell them, get rid of them.

616
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,820
Flip them, flip them.

617
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,440
Move them.

618
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,660
Now, talk about mysterious audio material.

619
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,660
What's in the background now came to us on cassette tape.

620
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,340
Remember those?

621
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,520
I do.

622
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah, they had moving parts.

623
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,780
It's completely different from a CD.

624
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,860
And about a month ago, we got a cassette in the mail.

625
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,520
Or cassette.

626
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,660
A cassette.

627
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,020
As my mother would say, yes.

628
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,980
It was in true subgenius fashion.

629
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,900
It sounded like this.

630
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,300
And it wasn't labeled at all.

631
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,640
It came from...

632
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,900
It came from Berea, Kentucky.

633
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,260
And I guess I have a street address, but there's no name.

634
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,340
And there was nothing written on the cassette.

635
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:52,880
It just had some random cutout from a magazine illustration, you know, stuck onto the cassette.

636
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,700
It was just a...

637
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,980
That's the way all of the subgenius cassettes looked in the 80s and 90s.

638
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,880
And then we got used to getting CDs.

639
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,660
They emailed me MP3s, you know, or we download stuff or whatnot.

640
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,940
It was just refreshing to get a CD.

641
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,520
I mean, a tape.

642
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,020
Well, two important things to consider are that it was Kentucky.

643
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,020
And if it's rural Kentucky, it could have taken 20 years to get here.

644
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,540
That's one thing.

645
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,200
Indeed.

646
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,780
And also, you know how some people marry each other in the family there for a while?

647
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:33,200
He might be one of those people that assumes that he is sending you an actual love song with lyrics and a structure.

648
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,320
Well, it has many love songs with such things.

649
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,980
But not for long.

650
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:45,480
So you can kind of hear him in the background along with somebody skinning a fish or something.

651
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,280
Yeah.

652
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,900
That's art, man.

653
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,020
Skinning a fish is art.

654
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,280
Well, if it's mixed with a sweet love song, then I guess that's the world of collage.

655
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,540
I was planning to do a collage-oriented show soon.

656
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,440
And we're accidentally doing it now.

657
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,300
And isn't that the nature of collage?

658
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,800
It's still a wonderful...

659
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,040
It's still art, despite its many, many drawbacks and its limitations.

660
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:23,560
But we have to conclude that there's a lot better crap out there in the slimy little midst of the average person sitting behind you in the bus ready to vomit

661
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:33,460
than there are in the halls of academia and the big boys in the biz spelled B-I-Z with a capital Z, I think.

662
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,820
We've seen this before.

663
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,720
We have seen...

664
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:37,920
We have seen...

665
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,480
We've seen this...

666
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,840
Actually, I'm going to play some more of that.

667
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,180
Let's hear Dennis Hopper some more.

668
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,040
Okay, this is real moralistical.

669
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,440
Okay, I'll turn down that music.

670
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,160
I'll turn up that music.

671
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,760
Friends and neighbors and co-fighters did not die in vain.

672
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,920
They stilled his great heart.

673
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,480
But they could not.

674
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,900
Stifle his memory.

675
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,500
Or his flatulation.

676
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,800
They could not obliterate his courage.

677
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Or his peace.

678
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,160
They could not wipe away his honor.

679
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,620
Or his...

680
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,900
He lives in you, and he lives in me.

681
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:34,020
He lives deep in the gut of every human being who wants to see the United States of America be free.

682
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,300
That's not the third.

683
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,540
We're overdue.

684
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,520
We're overdue.

685
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,220
I've seen it before.

686
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,460
I've seen it all before.

687
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,940
That was another time, Mr. Gantz.

688
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,400
Another place.

689
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,040
Another kind of people.

690
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,260
That doesn't go here.

691
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,060
That's what we said, too.

692
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
That's what we said.

693
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,020
They were brown scum.

694
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,320
Temporary insanity.

695
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,500
Part of the passing scene.

696
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,300
They were being too monstrous to be real.

697
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,720
So, we ignored them.

698
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,620
Or laughed at them.

699
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:20,300
Because we couldn't believe that there were enough insane people to walk alongside of them.

700
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,120
Then one morning, the country woke up from an uneasy sleep.

701
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,420
And there was no more laughter.

702
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,940
The wild animals had changed places with us in the cage.

703
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,740
We simply can't let it happen again.

704
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,640
It can't happen here at all.

705
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:55,700
Do you want your homes infected with the vermin from foreign shores?

706
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,780
No!

707
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,460
Do you want a bunch of mongrels?

708
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,680
Big boys.

709
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,560
To come over here.

710
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,780
Keep them coming.

711
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,720
What is this one here?

712
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,560
The new model?

713
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,360
A 1963 Führer right off the assembly line?

714
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,680
For this one is not too new.

715
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,100
He's not too fresh.

716
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,400
This one is nothing but a cheap copy.

717
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,840
Adnan.

718
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,560
Stop.

719
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:24,920
That's us.

720
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,860
A cheap.

721
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,400
Nothing but a cheap copy of the original.

722
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,160
A ranta.

723
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,520
You will never.

724
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,420
You cannot stand in the Führer.

725
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:35,680
You will never.

726
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:35,680


727
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:35,680


728
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,860
You will not be able to fit in your boots because your feet are far too small.

729
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,400
You will...no.

730
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,480
No.

731
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,020
It's a cheap JPEG.

732
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,100
All fuzzy around the edges.

733
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,080
Just if extremely.

734
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,660
Just if extremely.

735
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,740
Will you let the pink boys come and steal away all of your schlag?

736
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,920
Yeah they spit on us.

737
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,360
Don't you love your schlag?

738
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,380
Like we're swimming in the water without underpants.

739
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,400
They mark us and put extreme gravy on our pants.

740
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,400


741
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,400


742
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,400


743
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,400


744
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,400


745
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,400


746
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,400


747
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,100
places. It's tiring,

748
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,500
but it's no longer available.

749
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,040
And we hiled

750
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,320
writing Sir Palin's face.

751
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,240
I don't mean to get political, kids,

752
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,700
but let's face it,

753
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,700
in today's society,

754
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,080
we see an encroaching,

755
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
ever more threatening

756
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,240
brown shirtism. Notice

757
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,400
I had an R in that word

758
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,500
shirt. I could have left

759
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:31,840
it out.

760
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,920
And if we do not

761
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,800
raise our voices

762
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,040
in a singing

763
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,220
choir of

764
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,760
Bob is here to save us,

765
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,080
then surely he will not save us,

766
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,000
and we will all be destroyed and dragged down

767
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,340
into the cesspool

768
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,060
of cable television

769
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,900
and modern

770
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,740
FM and AM radio

771
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,240
and YouTube

772
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,360
and Facebook,

773
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,980
MySpace, all of that.

774
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,720
Sick, sick, sick

775
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,640
eating away at

776
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:04,780
the

777
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
body politic and the mind

778
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,100
of the subgeniuses.

779
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,640
Yeah, boy, I wish Father Joe Mama

780
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,380
was here. He could really do that.

781
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,560
He could not only

782
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,240
mimic Hitler's rants

783
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,640
in German, but he could

784
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,620
also imitate

785
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,580
Sir Alec Guinness

786
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,600
playing Hitler in the last days of

787
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,840
Hitler, which was the best.

788
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,620
Talk about oblique.

789
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,720
Yeah.

790
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,340
Well, I mean, it was easier to understand

791
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,200
the

792
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,280
the

793
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,280
, the American or the British actor

794
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,980
playing Hitler than it was to understand

795
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,660
Hitler himself.

796
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,680
Well, of course, because

797
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,960
Nix des Spackens

798
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,580
Deutschlandlander.

799
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,200
But, boy, I mean,

800
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,300
to be able to

801
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,080
summate the entire movie

802
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,500
in a few small erroneous moves,

803
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,420
you know, a couple

804
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,080
kind of almost

805
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,240
below the belt type of things,

806
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,160
and he expects to have, what,

807
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,900
a modicum of freedom and

808
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,240
immortality at the same time?

809
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,240
I mean, come on.

810
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,960
There was only one Fuhrer.

811
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,760
I mean, and there always only will be one Fuhrer,

812
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,440
just like Wagner.

813
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,560
There were always fewer Fuhrers.

814
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,880
Nobody will ever write librettos like Wagner.

815
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,020
I remember back in the days

816
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,580
before I changed my accent,

817
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,200
before I took the pills

818
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,620
and the treatments in Argentina

819
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,860
to maintain the youth.

820
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,960
I remember

821
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,260
at the swimming pool

822
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,280
and I was invited.

823
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,680
It was Tuesday.

824
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,120
The wind,

825
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,680
it was...

826
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,700
That's a weird wind, Dave.

827
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,420
Break, wind, break,

828
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,320
and crack, cheeks crack.

Copyright Fireside Theater, 1973.

830
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,860
Oh, no!

831
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,080
Creeping!

832
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,340
Nazism!

833
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,180
Or is it subgeniusism?

834
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,560
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.

835
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,860
Boy, the people that we kick out of the

836
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,720
subgenius-only club,

837
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,280
they just, they really feel offended.

838
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,100
I can tell.

839
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,140
They're still in the

840
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,520
anything-goes club.

841
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,780
I only did it because I thought it was fun.

842
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,200
Where they scream and holler at us subgeniuses

843
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,240
from outside of our cage, you see.

844
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,320
We are safe within our

845
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,760
our cage, our bars.

846
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,880
You see,

847
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,220
I'm not trapped in here with you.

848
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,100
You're trapped in here with me.

849
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,520
We have physically created,

850
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,520
we have used our own environment.

851
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,260
We have used our hands and our feet

852
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,480
to make it.

853
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,460
As the gods would make it.

854
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,320
We are as the gods.

855
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,060
The gods are naked

856
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,340
and the dogs are howling.

857
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,360
If only it were the other way around.

858
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,720
If only the gods were howling

859
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,580
and the dogs were naked.

860
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,680
I love a naked dog.

861
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,840
They look so different when they're shaved.

862
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,640
When they have no hair at all.

863
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,900
Or when they're soaking wet.

864
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,760
And they smell so wonderful.

865
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,040
A wet dog?

866
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,760
Oh, yes.

867
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,980
Would you let them take away our freedom

868
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,540
to sniff a wet dog, my friend?

869
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,220
That which is most valuable

870
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,920
to the subgenius heart?

871
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,540
To our fatherland?

872
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,120
Would you let them take away

873
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,120
our wet dog smell?

874
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
Mach schnell

875
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,500
with der dog smell.

876
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,100
Jawohl.

877
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:30,940
Jawohl.

878
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,740
It's the only kinakree, you know.

879
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,620
It's the big J.

880
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:35,880
Jawohl.

881
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,440
You know, you can only give it the old jawohl.

882
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,960
When was the last time you had your big

883
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,520
steaming hot jawohl of wolfberry and chili?

884
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,540
Well, that's too long.

885
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,040
How about some whooping chili

886
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,060
made by Grandma Maxine and her onerous pad?

887
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,260
It was horrible.

888
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,240
I dreamed I was on a suitcase

889
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,320
and I, well, it was like a little room

890
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,700
but I could tell it was horrible.

891
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,160
It was a suitcase

892
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,080
and there was a little compartment

893
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,260
filled with pipes

894
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,840
and I, well, I thought maybe

895
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,540
I could use one of the pipes

896
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,960
to gain an exit

897
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,280
from the suitcase.

898
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,500
So, what I, well,

899
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,560
the first thing that came to my mind

900
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,100
was...

901
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,180
You see, from that day forth

902
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,380
it seemed only by great effort

903
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,280
as of gymnastics

904
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,620
and only under the immediate stimulation

905
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,340
of the...

906
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,840
drug

907
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,360
that I was able to wear

908
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,720
the countenance of Stan.

909
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,000
At all hours of the day and night

910
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,300
I would be taken

911
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,440
with the premonitory shudder.

912
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,260
Above all, if I slept

913
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,840
even dozed for a moment in my chair

914
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,220
it was always as Doug

915
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,120
that I awakened

916
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,460
under the strain of this continually impending doom

917
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,580
and by the sleeplessness

918
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,900
to which I now condemn myself

919
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,260
yea, even beyond what I thought possible to man

920
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,620
I became in my own person

921
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,080
a creature eaten up

922
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,540
and emptied by fever

923
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,040
languidly weak

924
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,380
both in body and mind

925
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,180
and solely occupied by one thought

926
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,860
the horror of my other self.

927
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,580
But when I slept

928
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,920
or when the virtue of the medicine wore off

929
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,260
I would leap almost without transition

930
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,860
for the pangs of transformation

931
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,240
grew daily less marked

932
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,340
into the possession of a fancy

933
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,860
brimming with images of terror

934
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,380
a soul boiling with causeless hatreds

935
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,240
and a body that seemed not strong enough

936
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,500
to contain the raging energies of life

937
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,060
the powers of the world.

938
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,880
the powers of Doug Smith

939
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,820
seemed to have grown

940
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,720
with the sickliness of Ivan Stang.

941
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,960
But now Dave, couldn't you find your way

942
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,100
through the pipes to the luggage?

943
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,000
I course could

944
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,300
but then I had to stop

945
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,860
and listen to heckle and jekyll

946
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,800
But the pipe is the path to life

947
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,480
and truth

948
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,500
and power

949
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,800
power

950
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,960
and pleasure

951
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,460
pleasure

952
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,880
pleasure beyond your wildest dreams

953
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,000
and more

954
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,460
and more

955
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:00,700
and more

956
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,840
will you choose pleasure

957
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,980
or will you plunge into the pool of

958
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,740
Koonvasner?

959
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,060
I mean Koonvasner!

960
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,240
references in dirty language in Dutch

961
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,380
or whatever there is in there

962
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,320
you think some, some

963
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,180
the Ministry of Information

964
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,080
is not going to hear that?

965
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,980
oh now get this

966
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,860
here's what our critics say about us

967
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,840
oh turn that down

968
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,420
turn this up

969
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,540
the problem he was thus debating

970
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,920
as he walked was one of a class

971
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,040
that is rarely solved

972
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,300
"'Reverend Stang was pale and dwarfish.

973
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,780
"'He gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation.

974
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,300
"'He had a displeasing smile.

975
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,140
"'He had borne himself to the lawyers

976
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,000
"'with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness,

977
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,260
"'and he spoke with a husky whispering and somewhat broken voice.

978
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,280
"'All these were points against him,

979
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,000
"'but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust,

980
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,160
"'loathing and fear with which Mr. Smith regarded him.

981
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,800
"'There must be something else,' said the perplexed gentleman.

982
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,600
"'There is something more if I could but find a name for it.

983
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,660
"'God bless me, the man seems hardly human.

984
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,540
"'Something troglodytic, shall we say?'

985
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,180
"'Hmm. Oof! Oof!'

986
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,580
"'It's that naked dog again.

987
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:19,740
"'Stinks.'

988
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,280
"'Well, I don't like the way Robert Louis Stevenson

989
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,020
"'compares us to a bunch of, uh,

990
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,760
"'half-animal beings.

991
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,540
"'I mean, what right does he have as an erudite but dead person?'

992
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,360
It's true. I was reading from the book, uh,

993
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,660
uh, Mr. Hyde and Reverend Seek.

994
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,400
Reverend Seek. Yes.

995
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,620
I thought it was Jekyll and Jekyll, but I would prefer to Seek.

996
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,720
No, this was the remake.

997
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,200
This wasn't the Frederick March version.

998
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,080
This was the Spencer Tracy version.

999
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,660
Oh, jeez, man.

1000
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,080
You know, there were, uh, to date,

1001
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,420
there have been 126 movie versions

1002
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,000
of documentaries.

1003
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,320
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

1004
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,560
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, actually,

1005
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,520
is the full title.

1006
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,760
Um, yes.

1007
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,720
And most of them suck.

1008
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,620
Whoo!

1009
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,200
Actually, the Frederick March one in 1931 is great.

1010
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,660
It's really quite well done.

1011
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,780
He is scary because he looks so daddy-like to begin with,

1012
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,200
and then all of a sudden he has those big choppers.

1013
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,240
Yeah.

1014
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,260
And that weird, like, you know,

1015
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,300
manic smile that's...

1016
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,200
Oh, if only you could see the imitation I'm doing right now.

1017
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,740
He jerks and jiggles around.

1018
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,940
We just saw that movie.

1019
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,660
And he, he, it really is a great acting job.

1020
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,560
Oh, get this.

1021
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,560
Okay, I think it was M...

1022
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,420
Could have been MGM anyway.

1023
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,560
The studio that made the 1931 Jekyll and Hyde.

1024
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:50,240
Ten years later, they remade it with Spencer Tracy.

1025
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,700
Well, for some reason, they decided that

1026
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,920
in order to do it again ten years later,

1027
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,720
they had to destroy all existing prints of the 1931 movie.

1028
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,200
Now, is that conspiracy executive thinking or what?

1029
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:04,960
Mm-hmm.

1030
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,980
And so for the longest time,

1031
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,480
there wasn't a really good copy of the full 31 version,

1032
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,980
plus the Hays...

1033
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,760
It was done before the Hays Code.

1034
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,800
So the versions that we saw on television

1035
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,120
when we were little children in the 60s and 70s

1036
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,220
had eight minutes of hot stuff cut out

1037
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,680
with Miriam Hopkins,

1038
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:25,980
who was the director of the movie,

1039
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,280
as a prostitute.

1040
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:27,940
Sizzling.

1041
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,920
Ooh, majorly.

1042
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,820
Yeah.

1043
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,140
Yeah, movies were actually a lot dirtier before 1932 or so,

1044
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,060
and then they became gradually more filthy and dirty

1045
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,580
until we now end up with art films

1046
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,600
like Antichrist by Lars van Trieg,

1047
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,500
or whatever his, however you say his name.

1048
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,580
I did notice a difference in the...

1049
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,380
The human centipede, which I won't even watch.

1050
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,180
It is...

1051
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:55,920
Well, I...

1052
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,020
I did skim through it.

1053
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,420
I looked at the good parts.

1054
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,140
More now, Dave.

1055
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,120
They were really bad.

1056
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,380
Really bad.

1057
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,140
The human centipede.

1058
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:04,680
Yes, Dave.

1059
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,100
It's a...

1060
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,520
It's a horror movie about a mad doctor.

1061
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,000
Mad?

1062
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:09,720
Do you call him mad?

1063
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,040
What, a madman?

1064
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,160
Suture?

1065
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:12,960
People?

1066
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,520
Mouth to butt?

1067
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,720
In a series?

1068
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,620
In a chain?

1069
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,980
Making a, yes, human centipede.

1070
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,160
That's the subject of a movie made last year.

1071
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:23,780
How about that?

1072
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,820
Well, I would not say he was...

1073
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,920
Not per se.

1074
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,300
Any more than any other top-grade scientist or politician.

1075
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,300
Not per se.

1076
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,680
At the very top.

1077
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,820
The cream of the crop.

1078
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,260
Once they reach that level, they're all a little bit...

1079
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,760
Screwy.

1080
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,520
Screwy.

1081
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,720
Are mad scientists truly mad?

1082
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,960
Or are they just a little bit ticked off?

1083
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,720
But these...

1084
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:55,860
Crazy.

1085
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,940
These philosophers, whose hands seemed only made to dabble in dirt,

1086
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,380
and their eyes to pour over the microscope or crucible,

1087
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,120
have indeed performed miracles.

1088
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,920
They penetrate into the recesses of nature

1089
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,940
and show how she works in her hiding places.

1090
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,800
They ascend into the heavens,

1091
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,620
and they have discovered how the blood circulates

1092
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,220
and the nature of the air we breathe.

1093
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,960
They've acquired new and almost unlimited power,

1094
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,840
and they can command the thunders of heaven,

1095
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,240
mimic the earthquake,

1096
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,700
and even mock...

1097
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,000
the invisible world with its own shadows.

1098
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,040
And that's why I smoke Kool's.

1099
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,280
That's a manly cigarette.

1100
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,900
For those of you out there that haven't really discovered existentialism,

1101
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,360
you'll notice the rich, flavorful smoke of Kool.

1102
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,500
Caps it off like an evening in the bathroom.

1103
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,820
And for those out there that enjoy having shortening with the rest of the food,

1104
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,360
time to climb aboard with Kool's.

1105
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,700
I like Kool's.

1106
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:55,880
I don't...

1107
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,680
I can't...

1108
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,600
And...

1109
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,760
What's the matter?

1110
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,380
Don't you want to be cool?

1111
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,900
Afraid your mom's gonna find out?

1112
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,820
Come on!

1113
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,700
Light up!

1114
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,580
Everybody's doing it!

1115
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,000
Everybody's doing it!

1116
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,080
Here, take the matches and set your hair on fire.

1117
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,240
And we'll smoke your head!

1118
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:16,840
Yeah!

1119
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,400
I don't know, eh?

1120
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,820
Come on, you wanna?

1121
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,580
It's the Bulgarian folk music!

1122
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:27,880
Oh!

1123
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,820
They're blowing up my backyard again.

1124
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,500
What happens if I put on this music up here?

1125
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,060
This is a whole nother disc.

1126
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,620
Ooh.

1127
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,080
Oh, this is Sid Redlin of Boron Nuzzle.

1128
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,460
We met them in Detroit at the Detroit Revival.

1129
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,880
Is this like Stang Girl Talk or something?

1130
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:47,520
No.

1131
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,440
Well, you'll be...

1132
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,900
No, it's more like Girl Stang Talk.

1133
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,460
Oh, Girl Stang Talk.

1134
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,440
Um...

1135
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:55,380
Oh.

1136
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:01,020
It was indeed with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being.

1137
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:10,780
No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards like a hurricane in the first enthusiasm of success.

1138
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:18,500
But who can conceive of the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave?

1139
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,120
Or tortured the living animals to animate the lifeless clay?

1140
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,360
Yeah, I see.

1141
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:25,360


1142
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,360
I started reading Frankenstein...

1143
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,600
Mary, Mary...

1144
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,040
...by that teenage girl.

1145
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,880
Oh, and Dave.

1146
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,480
Now, this is interesting little synchronicity.

1147
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,080
I was starting to read Frankenstein.

1148
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,400
I mentioned that to my...

1149
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,120
one of our students.

1150
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,140
Let's call him Reverend Gavin, who happens to be on the Isle of Wight.

1151
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,400
We were chatting in my online course.

1152
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,700
And I mentioned I was reading Frankenstein and all these old books because the wordage is cooler...

1153
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,060
...than it is in the comic books that I usually read.

1154
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:02,500
And he said, did you happen to ever see that movie called Gothic?

1155
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:19,400
Which is Ken Russell's 1986 film about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron and their libertine friends writing Frankenstein.

1156
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,860
I said, no, I haven't seen that movie.

1157
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,060
I sort of wanted to.

1158
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,540
And I looked at my collection.

1159
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,300
I couldn't find it.

1160
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,520
Within 24 hours, I was standing at Dave's supermarket.

1161
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,140
Your supermarket, Dave.

1162
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,120
It certainly is.

1163
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:38,540
And I happened to glance at the $1 DVDs that they have now sitting next to the National Enquirers.

1164
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,400
It certainly are.

1165
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,240
And there it was.

1166
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,240
There was Gothic by Ken Russell for a buck.

1167
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,760
And we got what we paid for because the middle of it was real choppy and hard to watch.

1168
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,080
But it didn't matter because the movie is god awful.

1169
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,380
And the first...

1170
00:50:53,380 --> 00:51:00,680
When the music started on the credits, I said, I can tell this music was done by one guy with a computer.

1171
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,760
And then the credits said, music by Thomas Dolby.

1172
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,760
And boy, back in the late 80s, it certainly sounded like it too.

1173
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,600
They deafened him with bad film.

1174
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,320
It was awful, actually.

1175
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,500
The score was awful.

1176
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,760
The movie was awful.

1177
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,940
They were on laudanum.

1178
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,060
The characters were on laudanum all the time.

1179
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,780
And then everything got weird.

1180
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,860
And it was like weird.

1181
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,600
Real weird.

1182
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:35,880
There's weird butlers and weird hunchbacks and weird little devil guys and weird dead guys and weird weather and weird music and weird people and weird sex.

1183
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,680
And then it turned out it was all a dream.

1184
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,120
It was all a dream?

1185
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,200
Yeah, that was the climax of the movie.

1186
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,180
It got weirder and weirder.

1187
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,340
And then Mary Shelley woke up.

1188
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,040
And Mary Shelley woke up and woke her eyes or something?

1189
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,340
Yeah, she woke up and wrote Franken...

1190
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,240
Stein.

1191
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,320
Oh, what a tragic ploy to employ.

1192
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:57,760
Franken-Einstein.

1193
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,320
And then the next day, Nenslo, the great Nenslo sent me a piece of artwork called Frank Ein Bob.

1194
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:12,880
And it was a merging of the faces of J.R. Bob Dobbs, Albert Einstein, and the Frankenstein monster.

1195
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,540
And no one can see that picture except on Facebook.

1196
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,260
And I'm not on Facebook.

1197
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,580
So I can't see nothing.

1198
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:23,260
I can't see...

1199
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,360
Well, I can just tell you that in the supermarket the other day, my son...

1200
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,520
I was wearing a hood.

1201
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,080
And I was wearing a Bob hood, as a matter of fact.

1202
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,440
A Bob sweatshirt hood.

1203
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:37,320
And my son noticed that I looked like Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein.

1204
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,320
That's really insulting.

1205
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,860
I would feel awful.

1206
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:42,420
I feel bad, man.

1207
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,340
I would feel really bad about that.

1208
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,940
Your son has a great imagination.

1209
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,180
That's all I can say.

1210
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,100
Let's see.

1211
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:56,160
We're coming up on the end of this hour of Slack number 1,286.

1212
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,240
There's that mecha dog again.

1213
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:58,780
Did you hear that?

1214
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,140
Mm-hmm.

1215
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,520
Shaved down to the very nubs.

1216
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:10,440
Boy, this show has had some darned weird background music, if you don't mind my using strong language.

1217
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,380
Not at all.

1218
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,040
Go right ahead.

1219
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,320
Can you say a second of that background music, everything you played?

1220
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,040
You can even say gosh darn if you want to.

1221
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,460
Well, let's see.

1222
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,040
We have the Sid Redlin on right now.

1223
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,800
To mess with your head.

1224
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:29,820
Oh, and speaking of heads, the Subgenius bathroom is at subgenius.com.

1225
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:39,360
That's the dump, the latrine, so to speak, where it all goes in and doesn't have to come out.

1226
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,180
Fireside Theater, 1984.

1227
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:49,020
By the way, Sid Redlin has permanent eyeglasses that he has made for himself with one lens being used.

1228
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,580
One being perfectly round and the other one being perfectly square.

1229
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,500
And the lens material on the right eye is red and on the left is blue.

1230
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,140
Mm-hmm.

1231
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,180
He's in another world all the time.

1232
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:01,700
All the time.

1233
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,460
Creating virtual experience.

1234
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,120
But if he goes to a 3D movie, he's completely blind unless he switches the glasses.

1235
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,340
He has to reverse them.

1236
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:18,920
So he must have kind of a very loose middle part to fit over the nose, so it can be either up or down.

1237
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,060
Depending on which way.

1238
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:20,640
Right.

1239
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:30,980
And the way to go is subgenius.com if you want to learn more about all the awful things that we've discussed and far, far worse.

1240
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,720
All the awful things go all the way to subgenius.com.

1241
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,540
Do it now or, um...

1242
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:37,960
Or don't.

1243
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,480
We don't really care whether you're saved or not.

1244
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,740
We really don't even care.

1245
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,080
Dave, I'm going to fade you out very soon now.

1246
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:47,920
Okay.

1247
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:55,200
I'm going to play one weird little song here at the end called It Is What It Is by Rainbow.

1248
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:02,060
And then a couple of little TZ clips that I really want to end the show with.

1249
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,700
And don't believe in our Dave in a pile of Jell-O and cotter pins.

1250
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:13,300
Oh, you know the guy who discovered that Bob always leaves cotter pins and Jell-O behind him wherever he goes?

1251
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,840
The guy who discovered that fact, Reverend John Stakely, died last week.

1252
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,600
Aww.

1253
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,940
I hadn't talked to him in 40 years.

1254
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,500
But the Jell-O and cotter pins live on.

1255
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,580
I went to high school with him.

1256
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,840
Isn't that funny?

1257
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,720
I guess there won't be another armor book.

1258
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,560
Anyway, friends, thank you.

1259
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,680
And, uh, I think we're going to go good nighty-night here.

1260
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,300
Good night to everyone.

1261
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:44,880
It's been such a wonderful, wonderful evening trying to accept what we need to accept to learn what we must all be fighting for.

1262
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,820
Oh, Dave faded himself out.

1263
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,060
Yeah ...

1264
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,060
How'd you do that?

1265
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,980
It is what it is, it-

1266
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,500
It is what it is, it-

1267

It is what it is.

You've made a terrible mistake.

1289
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,120
I made out of steel.

1290
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,060
You understand that I made out of steel?

1291
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:18,240
Mr. Smith.

1292
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,100
Mr. Smith.

1293
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,000
Jack.

1294
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,060
Oh, Jack.

1295
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:29,680
Jack.

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,860
Oh, Jack.

1297
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,340
You're all right.

1298
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,460
Jack, Mr. Smith, he tried to kill me.

1299
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,640
He tried to kill me.

1300
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:34,940
I know.

1301
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,420
We were in this car, and he kept going faster and faster,

1302
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,360
and there was this other car coming at us,

1303
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,820
and he headed straight for that car.

1304
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,380
It's all right now.

1305
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:41,460
It's all over.

1306
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,360
He was sitting right there next to me,

1307
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,580
and then he was gone.

1308
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,040
What's going on?

1309
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,820
What happened?

1310
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,620
Tell me.

1311
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,000
Listen to this.

1312
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:51,980
Mr. Douglas Smith,

1313
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,080
former star reporter and chief line-of-type operator for the Courier,

1314
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,340
resigned his position and left Dansburg for his home at 11.29 this evening.

1315
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,580
His contract with Mr. Douglas Smith declared null and void

1316
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,220
owing to Mr. Winters' incomplete understanding of the terms of the document.

1317
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,440
Contract?

1318
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,560
What contract?

1319
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,680
It means that he's gone.

1320
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:08,420
Gone?

1321
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,320
And he won't be back.

1322
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,740
Doug, will you please explain this?

1323
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

1324
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:13,900
I'll tell you.

1325
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,660
Maybe tomorrow.

1326
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,160
Right now, let's get out of here.

1327
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,140
He's gone.

1328
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,140


1329
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,420
Exit the infernal machine.

1330
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,240
And with it his satanic majesty, Lucifer, Prince of Darkness,

1331
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,200
otherwise known as Mr. Smith.

1332
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,520
He's gone, but not for good.

1333
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,120
That wouldn't be like him.

1334
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,060
He's gone for bad.

1335
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,900
And he might be back,

1336
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,080
with another ticket to the Twilight Zone.
