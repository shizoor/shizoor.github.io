1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,700
What do we do now?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,340
The only thing we can do, Robin.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,300
The hour of slug.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,580
Oh, no, sir, not that.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,120
I'm afraid so, Alfred.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,920
That man would be the first to say so if he were here.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,920
And if you do not believe me,

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,540
try turning on your water faucets at 2 o'clock this afternoon.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,660
2 o'clock?

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,480
2 o'clock!

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,560
Mama, mama, mama, please.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,440
Thank you.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,700
Cash award.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,500
Praise Bob.

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,300
Moving the universe from the top of the Empire State Building

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,340
and broadcasting loud to all time zones around the world in stereo,

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,880
this is Bob.

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,120
There came an awful sound.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
And from his lips there came an awful sound.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,140
Bob.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,980
Where'd you two take me?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,140
Where's the elevator from, Shangri-La?

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,780
I was supposed to be a boy named Thomas.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,560
Me.

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,160
I'll get him.

26
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,120
No talking behind my back.

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,420
Ponderosa.

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,440
What's that?

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,620
What's that?

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,740
That's the home place of the Cartwright.

31
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,380
My name's Joe Cartwright.

32
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,520
Who's Cartwright?

33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,560
And this is Adam?

34
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,580
Yes, we've met.

35
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,900
Oh, the dream.

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,180
You come out here, you run down our country.

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,240
It's a country we love.

38
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,700
It's a country we're proud of.

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,680
I think I'm stronger than you.

40
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,100
We don't boo you because you support Russia.

41
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,300
Get ready to Dwayne the Swamp at Electomania 2020.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,840
Take a runner out here looking like a big fat bowl of fruity pebbles.

43
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,680
It's an all out smackdown of democracy.

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,940
You're right.

45
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,700
He is scared.

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,660
You're right.

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,500
We're looking at what would happen if a homeless lumberjack banged a noopaloopa.

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,060
Electomania 2020, only on C-SPAN 2.

49
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,080
Information wants to be free.

50
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,720
Access to computers and anything which might teach you something about the way the world

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,240
works should be unlimited and total.

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,220
Always yield to the hands-on imperative.

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,920
All information should be free.

54
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,260
Mistrust authority.

55
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,160
Promote decentralization.

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,680
Information wants to be free.

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,080
Information wants to be free.

58
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,460
Information wants to be free.

59
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,060
Information wants to be free.

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,540
Information wants to be free.

61
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:39,540


62
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,280
Information wants to be free.

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,280


64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,280


65
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Yab balabalabs.

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,380
This is what angels would do if only they had bodies.

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,460
Yes, we are the messengers of love.

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,200
Drink of my limps.

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,660
Anxiety.

70
00:02:59,660 --> 00:02:59,660


71
00:02:59,660 --> 00:02:59,660


72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,160
I am the word made flesh.

73
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,180
They're questioning my religious practice.

74
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,420
You just don't know.

75
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,640
You don't know anything.

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,860
You haven't been where I've been.

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,060
You haven't seen what I've seen.

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,160
You haven't done what I've done.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,860
Don't question me, bucko.

80
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,020
Don't question me.

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,600
Praise Bob!

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,800
Praise Bob!

83
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:07,680
Praise Bob!

84
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,320
Praise Bob!

85
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,160
Praise Bob!

86
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,080
Praise Bob!

87
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,540
Praise Bob!

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,920
Ah, yes, dear friends.

89
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,980
And that was a tune called Las Bragas

90
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,000
by the Rudy Schwartz Project

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,080
from the new album Postal Code for Ham.

92
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,000
Look it up.

93
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,660
I can't play the best album.

94
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,400
I can't play the best stuff from that album

95
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,600
on broadcast radio

96
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,080
because it's too bold.

97
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,660
Before that, we heard some

98
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,440
Media Barrage-style audio collage

99
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,360
by the redoubtable Cool Hand Chris.

100
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,100
And there'll be lots more of that

101
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,240
near the end of the show.

102
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,620
Most of what follows

103
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,200
on this hour of Slack,

104
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,100
number 1,687,

105
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,220
is one 40-minute

106
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,020
generally uncut recording

107
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,640
from July 5th

108
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,400
at the 21X Day

109
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,920
Drill event.

110
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,100
Actually, the 23rd drill.

111
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,600
From my portable

112
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,900
Tarzan's radio station

113
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,620
being used by Dr. Hal Robbins,

114
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,620
Reverend Mother Racine Miller,

115
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,480
Reverend Anna Mall,

116
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,020
Reverend Fanboy,

117
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,100
with Dr. Philodrum Engineering,

118
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,160
and

119
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,360
if my voice

120
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,240
sounds kind of thin

121
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,160
right now,

122
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,520
it's because that portable radio station

123
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,440
is still in Ohio

124
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,320
with Princess Wee and her mom.

125
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,280
But I'm alone with two dogs

126
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,880
on Stang Ranch

127
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,420
in blistering rural

128
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,060
north-central Texas

129
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,420
using tinfoil and toothpicks

130
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,260
for a microphone.

131
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,100
It's due to a family

132
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,260
situation that is still ongoing

133
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,340
but making great

134
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,380
progress finally.

135
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,460
And my heart

136
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,380
has lifted again after a while.

137
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,880
I'm sure you've all heard

138
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:33,880


139
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,780
routine in this cave.

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
I don't have Princess Wee

141
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,540
here to spoil me,

142
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,420
but I'm learning.

143
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,820
And I have hope for the future,

144
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,640
mine anyway.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,860
And I'm confident that soon

146
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,980
we'll be able to move on

147
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,780
to new subgenius book projects

148
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,440
for one thing.

149
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:51,920
Anyway,

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,600
meanwhile,

151
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,720
here are Anna Mall,

152
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
Dr. Hal,

153
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,640
and rotating cohorts

154
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,300
broadcasting

155
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,360
the latest

156
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,360


157
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,360


158
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,360


159
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,360


160
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,360


161
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,360


162
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,360


163
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,360


164
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,360


165
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,660
broadcasting,

166
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,300
I think late at night

167
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,340
at the Caffeinist Cafe

168
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,800
at Wisteria Campground

169
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,740
in Southern Ohio

170
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,260
last July 5th

171
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,560
upon the failure

172
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,080
of the world

173
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,240
to end

174
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,360
again.

175
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,780
I really like the flexibility

176
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,660
in nature

177
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,560
that you're bringing

178
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,400
to the table here,

179
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,880
Dr. Hal.

180
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,480
Versatile is all I get out.

181
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,240
That's okay.

182
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,300
I've been hit in the face

183
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,360
with a microphone before.

184
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,120
I like,

185
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,340
I like the fact

186
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,340


187
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,340


188
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,340


189
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,340


190
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,340


191
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,460
that I'm in the middle

192
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:29,460


193
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,020
I like it when liquids

194
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,560
are near electronics, guys.

195
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,320
That's not a good question.

196
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,320
Makes me feel safe.

197
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,320
Okay.

198
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,720
Let's then arrange this way

199
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,900
and I'll take this accident

200
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,120
in utero out of here.

201
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,420
This is not a coaster.

202
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,080
This is the book.

203
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,180
I'm gonna put that book

204
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,280
right here.

205
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,880
That's the book

206
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,820
about all the wild

207
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,400
and crazy sex things

208
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,780
these crazy kids

209
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,060
are doing out in,

210
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,540
in where?

211
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,240
That's where we're going.

212
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,240


213
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,440
that's where we're going.

214
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,620
That's where we're going.

215
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,880


216
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,880


217
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,880


218
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,880


219
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,880


220
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,880


221
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,960
Not sure where.

222
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,200
But I do know

223
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,240
that if you're gonna get

224
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,440
a short duration marriage

225
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,480
and you're out of ideas

226
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,240
of what to do

227
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
after the first couple of days.

228
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,100
I do perform that all the time.

229
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,260
I do do that also.

230
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,340
Perform the short duration marriage

231
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,300
ceremony.

232
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,960
You know,

233
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,820
as a subgenius,

234
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,440
you get to.

235
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,560
Yeah.

236
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,020
I've actually performed

237
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,220
many short duration marriages

238
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,860
and unfortunately

239
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,220
a couple of them stuck

240
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,780
and are long term marriages

241
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,960
and I keep telling them

242
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,940
that's really not

243
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,960
how you do it, kids.

244
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,460
But, uh,

245
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,320
I'm not sure

246
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,320


247
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,320


248
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,320


249
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,320


250
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,500
if I can tell you

251
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:29,500


252
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:29,660
you know,

253
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:29,920
they're,

254
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,900
they're all kooky

255
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,980
these mutants.

256
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,740
Reverend,

257
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,420
do you use,

258
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,540
uh, headphones?

259
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,060
Let's see.

260
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,880
It's amazing

261
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,040
once you've got it

262
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,000
going through your head

263
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,600
and, uh,

264
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
now you really feel,

265
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:42,920
uh,

266
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,580
plugged in

267
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,500
a part of the old,

268
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:45,760
uh,

269
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,240
radio stream

270
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,340
to use

271
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,600
archaic terminology.

272
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,900
Now we got odd

273
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,820
casts,

274
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,440
podcasts.

275
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,020
There's new streams.

276
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,460
There's new streams.

277
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,340
Streaming casts.

278
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,560
Radio streams,

279
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,900
podcast streams.

280
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,100
Just don't cross

281
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,800
the streams,

282
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,400
they say.

283
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,040
No.

284
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,720
They're the same.

285
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:04,860
No,

286
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,900
you can't cross them.

287
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,460
I'm telling you.

288
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,880
Some people say,

289
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,300
I've had some people say,

290
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,480
well,

291
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,800
it's just the same as radio.

292
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,680
You're talking,

293
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,580
people are hearing.

294
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,720
But, uh,

295
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,100
you know,

296
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,380
like,

297
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,980
radio,

298
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,780
you can pick up

299
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,440
on your car,

300
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,360
radio.

301
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,180
Yes.

302
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,440
Rumbling along

303
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:21,940
in the

304
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,700
Badlands

305
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,140
or something.

306
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,340
Cool,

307
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,200
I get a car now.

308
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,720
No,

309
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,180
I missed that.

310
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,420
A sporty special.

311
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,320
Awesome.

312
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,120
I missed that about radio

313
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,020
and I don't listen

314
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,520
to a lot,

315
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,700
any commercial radio.

316
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,340
I cannot

317
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,780
listen to it anymore.

318
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,380
And non-commercial radio,

319
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:39,960
not enough.

320
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,740
My favorite radio station

321
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,080
It's a guest.

322
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,960
is a public radio station

323
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,420
in Austin, Texas

324
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,280
that, uh,

325
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,360
lets pretty much

326
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,820
anything be played

327
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,120
and there's one show

328
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,540
called Commercial Suicide

329
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,880
where the,

330
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,360
ooh,

331
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,140
that sounded like

332
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,860
some church air.

333
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,120
Oh,

334
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,500
oh,

335
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,780
oh,

336
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,140
yes.

337
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,180
And, uh,

338
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,740
the Commercial Suicide

339
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,180
show,

340
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,400
the air of the church.

341
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:00,900
Honestly,

342
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,240
one of the most

343
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,040
Is there any despair?

344
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,160
They had a

345
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,380
half hour song

346
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,380


347
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,300
let's offer one

348
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,820
at any rate

349
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,020
if we can.

350
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,160
of a clicking,

351
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
random clicking sound

352
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,860
the other night

353
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,140
and I couldn't figure out

354
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,620
what was wrong

355
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,800
with my vehicle

356
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,500
and it turned out

357
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,380
it was just the song

358
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,920
that was playing

359
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,500
on the radio.

360
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:14,920
Oh,

361
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,740
it wasn't the tap

362
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,240
of the Death Watch Beetle.

363
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:17,740
No,

364
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,460
it was actually

365
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,660
probably mic'd that

366
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,840
and that was the song.

367
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:21,940
Well,

368
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,320
that's, uh,

369
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,740
using natural sounds

370
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,380
as the basis

371
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,000
of, uh,

372
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,700
your music.

373
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,140
Do they still have

374
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,780
that recording

375
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,540
that you just like,

376
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,060
that, you know,

377
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,840
you go out and just like

378
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,020
catch the sound

379
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,840
and it's there

380
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,260
and it's,

381
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,360
capture the sound

382
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,580
and the feel.

383
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,100
It's on the hill

384
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,840
beneath the moon

385
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,360
and under the sun

386
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,120
I know there's people

387
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,740
who are storing

388
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:40,980
sounds.

389
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,000
in the roaring traffic

390
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,640
boom

391
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,920
in the silence

392
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,340
of my lonely room

393
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,000
What?

394
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,720
Sigh.

395
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,520
Roaring

396
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,020
traffic

397
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,020


398
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,980
sound effects

399
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
by Philodrome.

400
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,460
We are on that,

401
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,840
uh,

402
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,280
diurnal,

403
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,200
nocturnal cycle

404
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,960
here.

405
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,080
Night and day,

406
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,360
uh,

407
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
some of us under normal circumstances

408
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
do not go out

409
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,600
in the sunshine

410
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,700
because of its

411
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,060
deleterious effect

412
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,180
it has on our being.

413
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:09,940
Mm-hmm.

414
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,520
It hurts.

415
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,180
But,

416
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,580
it need not

417
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,940
if you put some of your

418
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,740
coffin earth

419
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,700
inside special

420
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,680
hollow shoes

421
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,140
like I have made,

422
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
you can even walk around

423
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,020
in the daytime,

424
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,740
though not really

425
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,000
very often.

426
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,700
You can do all your secrets.

427
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,680
Oh, no.

428
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,960
Everybody does that.

429
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,460
Uh-huh.

430
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,560
All the people

431
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,980
who need that.

432
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,820
It's commonly done.

433
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,100
I wish I had

434
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,200
the hollow shoe concession.

435
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,820
You,

436
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,840
they have to

437
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,500
make them

438
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,200
for you.

439
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,800
Uh,

440
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,380
here we have

441
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,300
some more church air

442
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,220
coming up to the

443
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,260
podium now.

444
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,960
Fantastic.

445
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,740
Let me just

446
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,140
hand it over

447
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,760
and,

448
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,200
uh,

449
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,700
I hope you'll enjoy.

450
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,420
No, I'm good.

451
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,240
Okay.

452
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm good.

453
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,580
Thank you, though.

454
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:51,840
Church,

455
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:51,840


456
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,220
yes,

457
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,860
he wants to keep

458
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,640
all the brain cells

459
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,240
he's got.

460
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,700
I know that attitude.

461
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,360
Oh, no.

462
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,220
When you can count them,

463
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,760
then you gotta

464
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,600
conserve them.

465
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,000
That's right.

466
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh,

467
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,360
cartridge it.

468
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,120
Oh, you haven't,

469
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,660
I didn't,

470
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,580
I thought it was loaded.

471
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,180
Pardon me.

472
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,880
Oh, no, no.

473
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,640
That's just our

474
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,460
audience participation.

475
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,400
Let me give you

476
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,720
a special little

477
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,400
greenish metallic

478
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,440
cylinder.

479
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,760
Now,

480
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,520
everything's

481
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,220
gonna be all right.

482
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,400
I didn't realize

483
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,280
it wasn't loaded.

484
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,040
I'm gonna go

485
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,380
to a place called

486
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,060
the Fun Shop.

487
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
The Fun Shop?

488
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,420
The,

489
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,300
it was Joe's Fun Shop.

490
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,600
And then we,

491
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,380
then Joe,

492
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,320
I don't know what

493
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,820
happened to Joe,

494
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,380
but it was called

495
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:31,640
the Fun Shop.

496
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,860
Have fun at Joe's Fun Shop.

497
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,120
Eat at Joe's

498
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,880
and then go to

499
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,840
Joe's Fun Shop.

500
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,480
That was,

501
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,580
uh,

502
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,760
that was in the,

503
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,020
uh,

504
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,980
Austin, Texas area

505
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,600
back in the

506
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,460
90s,

507
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:40,960
80s,

508
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,060
90s.

509
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,080
This shop had good

510
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,940
fun shooey.

511
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,940
I don't know what

512
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,800
was fun about it,

513
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,680
but I had a bunch

514
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:45,880
of,

515
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,820
there was church

516
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,560
here in the back.

517
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,400
More fun than a

518
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,240
barrel of mankies.

519
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,720
Why the tinfoil?

520
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,660
Is this a,

521
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,060
a,

522
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,260
a,

523
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,220
It's preventing

524
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,240
feedback from that

525
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,560
speaker.

526
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,520
Okay, amazing.

527
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,680
What do I think

528
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,020
of next?

529
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,980
I like this music

530
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,060
quite a bit.

531
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,440
I think it's great.

532
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,000
Well,

533
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,840
now things are

534
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,960
working as they

535
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,820
should be.

536
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,380
The larks on the

537
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,600
wing,

538
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,920
the snails on the

539
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,260
thorn.

540
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,920
God's in his

541
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,180
heaven.

542
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,140
All's right with

543
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,500
the world.

544
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,060
Until it goes

545
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,920
haywire again.

546
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,680
There we are.

547
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,820
Well,

548
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,640
I wonder,

549
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,280
first of all,

550
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,980
did you try it

551
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,160
all?

552
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,160
What?

553
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,460
Now I'll just

554
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,480
load myself up

555
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:34,720
one,

556
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,460
or maybe a

557
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:35,760
double.

558
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,780
If anyone would

559
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,460
like a double,

560
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,280
I'll put

561
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,920
chew in just for

562
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,380
your trouble.

563
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,660
Thanks Rev Mom Dog.

564
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,260
That's the new,

565
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,820
that's our new

566
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,760
first four short

567
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,200
in the name.

568
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,740
That's a dead

569
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,560
soldier there.

570
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,460
I love,

571
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
I love that Viking

572
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:56,860
helmet.

573
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,260
Let me comment on

574
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,480
it.

575
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,760
Those playing along

576
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,220
at home,

577
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,700
there's somebody

578
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
wearing a hat.

579
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,080
A Viking helmet.

580
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,300
And it's very

581
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,880
impressive.

582
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,100
It is impressive.

583
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,040
It's,

584
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,820
it's certainly

585
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,760
got big horns.

586
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,720
Yep.

587
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,160
Indeed.

588
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,340
Anybody

589
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,100
ready to sing opera

590
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,760
in that thing?

591
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,720
That would be

592
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,140
appropriate.

593
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:16,640
Yes.

594
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,440
You see the Vikings

595
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,760
didn't have horns

596
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,480
on their helmets.

597
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,600
I'll check backstage,

598
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,680
maybe there's a breastplate.

599
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,840
But the opera

600
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,040
had that design

601
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,600
by Arthur Rackham

602
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,260
for Wagner's

603
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,100
Ring Cycle Opera.

604
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,660
Can't,

605
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,340
can't assume that

606
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,080
everyone with a

607
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,220
helmet wants to

608
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,800
sing opera.

609
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,500
Everybody thinks it.

610
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,440
But if you have

611
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,460
that hat with

612
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,200
those horns,

613
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,760
then you're like

614
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,120
Brunhilde,

615
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,340
the warrior woman

616
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,820
who,

617
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,700
who loves Siegfried,

618
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,540
who's surrounded by,

619
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,840
by fire,

620
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,940
because Wotan forced her

621
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,200
into exile

622
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,020
in the eternal flames.

623
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,820
Like you do.

624
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:55,820
Yeah,

625
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,820
and then Siegfried

626
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,460
got her out of there

627
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:58,860
and,

628
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,500
Where was Roy?

629
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,300
There's sentencing

630
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,620
guidelines.

631
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,320
You gotta hold to them.

632
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,020
I just put one of these

633
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,420
in here.

634
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm just gonna have

635
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,380
a single,

636
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,940
not a double.

637
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,360
It's greedy to have a double

638
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,480
and he used it all up

639
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,700
at once just for

640
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,980
a heightened effect.

641
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,680
It's,

642
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:13,920
it's,

643
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,840
it's good to remember

644
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,740
the golden rule

645
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,820
in these

646
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,120
circumstances.

647
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,020
And do unto others

648
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,860
as they

649
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,760
would do unto you.

650
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,560
As you would have

651
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,120
them do unto you.

652
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,680
That's great.

653
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay,

654
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,640
I didn't kill it.

655
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,800
Does,

656
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,240
does this music

657
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,860
have a name?

658
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,680
No?

659
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:41,960
I don't think

660
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


661
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


662
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


663
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


664
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


665
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


666
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


667
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


668
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


669
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


670
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:41,960


671
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,820
it does now.

672
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,560
It's enjoyable.

673
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,660
The Toad,

674
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,040
or Todd Death Music.

675
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,740
Toad meaning death.

676
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,620
Nice.

677
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,460
And Toad,

678
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,720
well,

679
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,120
it could be

680
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,260
the death of a toad.

681
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,500
I told you so.

682
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,800
The death

683
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,480
of a toad.

684
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,260
Oh,

685
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,580
for a minute

686
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,420
I thought it was a poem.

687
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,000
A toad,

688
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,340
the power mower caught.

689
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,960
Oh,

690
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


691
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


692
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


693
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


694
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


695
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


696
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


697
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


698
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


699
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,960


700
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,240
the power mower caught.

701
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,200
Chewed and clipped

702
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,800
of a leg.

703
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,460
Oh.

704
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,480
Where the hobbling

705
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,660
hop has got

706
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,860
to the garden verge

707
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,880
and sanctuaried him

708
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,000
under the cinerary leaves.

709
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,160
In the shade

710
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,980
of the ashen

711
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,060
heart-shaped leaves

712
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,580
and a dim,

713
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,740
a low

714
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,180
and a final

715
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,920
glade.

716
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,840
The rare

717
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,640
original

718
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,740
heart's blood

719
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,620
spends,

720
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
flows

721
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,360
on the earthen

722
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
hide

723
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,940
and

724
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:41,940


725
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:41,940


726
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:41,940


727
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:41,940


728
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:41,940


729
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:41,940


730
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,320
in the flows

731
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,420
and wisenings

732
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:44,960
of the banked

733
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,020
and staring

734
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,900
eyes.

735
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,340
He lies

736
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,200
as still

737
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,100
as if he would

738
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,520
return

739
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,240
to stone

740
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,860
and soundlessly

741
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,300
attending

742
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,460
dies

743
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:55,960
toward

744
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,160
some

745
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,920
deep

746
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,180
monotone.

747
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,680
Toward misted

748
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,340
and ebullient

749
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,720
seas

750
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,160
and cooling

751
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,620
shores.

752
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,180
Toward lost

753
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,380
amphibious

754
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:06,960
emperies.

755
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,860
Something's burning.

756
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,440
Day dwindles

757
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,320
drowning

758
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,940
in the

759
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:11,960


760
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
and at last

761
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,460
is gone

762
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,320
in the wide

763
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,980
and antique

764
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,540
eyes

765
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,720
which still

766
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,120
appear

767
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,860
to watch

768
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,440
across

769
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
the castrate

770
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,540
lawn.

771
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,580
The haggard

772
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,140
daylight

773
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,160
steer.

774
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,020
Haggard?

775
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,960
Like Merle?

776
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,960
Yeah,

777
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,640
like a

778
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,960
jagged

779
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
You know,

780
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,820
it goes on.

781
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,760
Things are not

782
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
as they should be

783
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,060
but

784
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,380
there it goes.

785
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,660
Aww.

786
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,860
I don't know.

787
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:41,940
It's a

788
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:41,940


789
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,360
It's one of those things.

790
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,720
Anyway, that toad

791
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,000
died nobly

792
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,760
and honorably.

793
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,420
I feel bad

794
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,220
for the toad.

795
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,740
That's too bad.

796
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,100
The toad had a good

797
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,660
death,

798
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,640
a philosophical

799
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,460
death

800
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
in which he was able

801
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,080
to visualize

802
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,200
the great

803
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,080
amphibious

804
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,480
empire

805
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,360
of earlier ages

806
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,680
and then just

807
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,520
kindly

808
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,640
die from

809
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,340
blood loss.

810
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,660
As happens,

811
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,660
I've run over them

812
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,640
with the power mower.

813
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:05,840
Web loss?

814
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,720
Blood loss.

815
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,660
Oh, blood loss.

816
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,380
Probably web loss, too,

817
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,980
at that point

818
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,820
if you've been run over.

819
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,460
It chewed him

820
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,220
and clipped him

821
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,740
of a leg.

822
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,560
Power mower.

823
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,840
I take the blades off

824
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,060
before I go driving around

825
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,960
in my power mower.

826
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,420
The whole idea

827
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,300
is you're mowing

828
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,780
the castrate lawn

829
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,140
it describes

830
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,360
at the end.

831
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,860
So, yeah,

832
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,780
humans are really

833
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,800
the top predator now.

834
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,440
I mean,

835
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,280
that's what keeps

836
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
populations down.

837
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,300
Because we have

838
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,360
lawn mowers.

839
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,820
Because we have

840
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,260
lawn mowers.

841
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,740
Well, seriously.

842
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,720
The lawn mower.

843
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,220
The lawn mower.

844
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,320
Yes, indeed.

845
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,840
Is it the grim reaper

846
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,300
or the international harvester?

847
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,820
Some kind of

848
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,020
mechanical device.

849
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,800
Uh-huh.

850
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,480
I had a pool lawn

851
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,020
for a while.

852
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,020
With flashing blades

853
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,980
and swishing sides.

854
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,260
Chopping, hacking,

855
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,340
and hewing

856
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,580
its way along.

857
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,780
A lubricated dreadnought.

858
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,360
Those machines

859
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,960
are fascinating.

860
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,000
They are.

861
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,580
They cause

862
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,500
all those terrible

863
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,820
farm machinery accidents.

864
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,600
I'm afraid so.

865
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,700
Implements.

866
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,860
Implementing.

867
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Jake and John.

868
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:11,940
They're the best.

869
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:11,940


870
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:11,940


871
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:11,940


872
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:11,940


873
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:11,940


874
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:11,940


875
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:11,940


876
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:11,940


877
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:11,940


878
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:12,960
They mark the beginning

879
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,900
on YouTube that

880
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:13,940
humanity is

881
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,000
only in control.

882
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,560

888
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:34,240
here and he and I are going to be doing our show for the pagans it hasn't been a

889
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,780
pagan kind of thing but we can craft it there are pagans at Starwood that's

890
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:49,920
right wonderful star would going to star would never have been that'll be

891
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,380
interesting that's an interesting act for them yes it should be it different

892
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,920
after the low-key nature of x-day where they come in and they measure with

893
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,240
measuring tape every possible occupiable spot of ground for their pavilions and

894
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,680
tents uh-huh yep I've seen that I've seen that occur it's very ambitious for

895
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,660
us not leaving anything behind they want to measure it first yeah we know what

896
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,980
they're missing I saw you worse earth-worshipping pagans leave more

897
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,180
garbage than we cynical snarky subgeniuses that's interesting

898
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,600
you

899
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:30,280
yes I'm the mess I don't leave one see dang always said that the pagans paid

900
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,740
more attention to his sermons than the subgeniuses did that's that's easy yes

901
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:47,340
that's not hard to understand yeah we used to go camping out near pagans and

902
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,160
we just put down a giant tarp okay roll it up at the end was that okay that work

903
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,400
out Home

904
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,020
Out

905
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,020


906
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,240
Out

907
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,380
Out

908
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,380


909
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,380


910
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,400
Out

911
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,500
Out

912
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,580
while it was all rolled out.

913
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,560
You mean when you rolled it out again?

914
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,460
When we ruined the earth repeatedly year after year.

915
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,880
For people that are interested in seeing that live,

916
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,060
they can come to Mischievous Columbus Day weekend in North Texas.

917
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,660
That sounds like a lot of fun.

918
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,560
Yeah, it would be if it's not sold out already.

919
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,020
Do you get a holiday at that time?

920
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,380
You know, it's not like I want to say I need the weekend off

921
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,940
because it's my people's holiday.

922
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,520
That's not one of those things that you...

923
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,640
In the name of the Italian-American heritage

924
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,860
or the admiral of the ocean sea or whatever.

925
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,580
It's like the jerk that says he discovered stuff that was already here.

926
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,740
Oh, yeah, right.

927
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,620
It's like, I need Columbus Day off.

928
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,520
It was a venture. It was in itself worthy of praise.

929
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,720
The lessons, though, that I received as a child about Columbus

930
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,260
and about having Christmas celebrations in public school and stuff like that,

931
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,800
it gave me this mythology,

932
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,200
which is how I view the world.

933
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,840
And I have to constantly have that stuff deprogrammed out of me.

934
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,300
That's why I believe in the conspiracy.

935
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,400
Well, they decided that I was going to think one way about all this stuff.

936
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,140
After you're told something to go,

937
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,960
examine it yourself and get comfortable with what you hear.

938
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,680
I don't introspectively look at anything.

939
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,160
I just get more stuff in there.

940
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,300
That way it's all garbled.

941
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,300
I don't know what's true.

942
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,020
That's an approach.

943
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,220
What should I believe?

944
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,080
It's kind of like my accounts online.

945
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,380
If anybody ever wanted to figure me out online,

946
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,320
they would look and they would be like,

947
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,840
I don't know what to think of this person.

948
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
What about the compartmentalization of belief?

949
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,760
You know, like in Japan,

950
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,740
you compartmentalize what you choose to believe at different times

951
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,880
on the basis of different things,

952
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,400
maybe different attitudes.

953
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,060
It's impressive to me that it's recognized.

954
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,260
You can think scientifically or you can think magically.

955
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,460
I think you can seek out or discard omens.

956
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,020
But the point is to...

957
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,140
Why not both?

958
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,420
You don't share some compartments.

959
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,200
Nope.

960
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,360
No.

961
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,280
And it's...

962
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,560
I think it's Western Christian religious culture that says,

963
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,780
you can't do that.

964
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,960
You have to be genuine.

965
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,240
You have to be genuine.

966
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,240


967
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,240


968
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,940
You have to be genuine to yourself and genuine to God.

969
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,720
And I think it's...

970
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,700
Of course, God created the drugs and the receptors

971
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,560
that make them operative in the human case.

972
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,800
Sure.

973
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,680
I thought some dude just wrote up some dogma

974
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,280
and said that that's how it was.

975
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,700
Often it was like that.

976
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,160
Okay.

977
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,400
Often it is like that.

978
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,380
That's why I don't really hang out with people

979
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,760
that are, once again, writing things down,

980
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,000
admissible in court.

981
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,560
Well, putting something in writing does make it official.

982
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,940
I'm sorry.

983
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,560
I'm fascinated by an inflatable poo emoji

984
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,880
being towed in a little red wagon by...

985
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,340
There, there.

986
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,220
It's all right.

987
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,020
A tall person who is...

988
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,560
You're okay.

989
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,420
...demasked.

990
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,160
You're my friend.

991
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,460
It looks like they've got their crap together.

992
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,440
Good.

993
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,300
I'm glad.

994
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,500
I feel calm.

995
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:29,880
Their poo emoji.

996
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,000
Because it was quite a vision.

997
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,620
Yeah, that's real.

998
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,280
That's real.

999
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,800
You're not...

1000
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:34,860
Oh, good.

1001
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:34,860


1002
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,340
It's all real.

1003
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,800
You'll keep telling yourself,

1004
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,120
it's not just a movie.

1005
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,300
It's not just a movie.

1006
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,680
It's a sequel to a movie.

1007
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:43,960
Right.

1008
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,220
The sequel to...

1009
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,720
Are you familiar with The Tingler?

1010
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,220
Why, yes.

1011
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,780
A most interesting movie.

1012
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,460
Is it not?

1013
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,200
Is it a movie?

1014
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,120
It is a movie.

1015
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,740
It's a movie.

1016
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,980
I've been fed that line before,

1017
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,720
and I did not see a movie afterwards.

1018
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,300
This is the movie.

1019
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,800
The Tingler is this horrible centipede-like creature

1020
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:04,840
that...

1021
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,000
that's more than a foot long,

1022
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,840
that forms at the back of your spine

1023
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,880
when you're scared,

1024
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,440
but is destroyed...

1025
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
destroyed when you give a scream.

1026
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,800
So, uh...

1027
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,840
In this movie,

1028
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,580
they get a...

1029
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,300
a woman who's a mute,

1030
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:19,920
terrified,

1031
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,800
and then she can't scream,

1032
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,300
and then they cut out The Tingler,

1033
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,020
and it escapes,

1034
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,640
and it goes into a movie theater,

1035
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,540
and it's crawling under the seats.

1036
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

1037
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,640
The Tingler has just entered this theater.

1038
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,760
The only way to defy...

1039
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,800
to defy it...

1040
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,580
is to scream for your lives,

1041
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,500
ladies and gentlemen.

1042
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,980
Scream.

1043
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,760
Also,

1044
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,660
in the same movie,

1045
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,180
Vincent Price takes LSD.

1046
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,940
It is said to be LSD.

1047
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,820
He takes it.

1048
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,120
He's...

1049
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,860
He's noting his, uh...

1050
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,500
reactions.

1051
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,620
12.45.

1052
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,500
My pulse seems to be, uh...

1053
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,720
slightly greater than normal.

1054
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,020
You know, and it goes into this horrible trip of, uh...

1055
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,660
William Castle horror effects.

1056
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,120
Bathtubs full of blood.

1057
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,520
Bloody hands coming out.

1058
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:01,540
You mean...

1059
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,720
You mean a difficult experience.

1060
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,900
Uh...

1061
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,200
Uh...

1062
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,180
Yeah, so like...

1063
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,860
It's just a difficult experience you're having.

1064
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,400
It depends.

1065
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,360
You work through it.

1066
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
It might be somebody's typical acid trip.

1067
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:10,840
I don't know.

1068
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,800
But anyway, that's how Vincent Price does it in the movie.

1069
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,300
There's nothing that won't, uh...

1070
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,580
you know, won't end in seven to nine hours.

1071
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,420
You'll be fine.

1072
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,600
The Tingler is such a preposterous movie

1073
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,720
that I think it deserves a place in subgenius bull.

1074
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,240
Uh...

1075
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,120
You refer to it.

1076
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,560
Everybody ought to refer to it

1077
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,180
because it resonates in so many peculiar ways.

1078
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,120
Another one that is just so hardcore,

1079
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,880
it's ridiculous,

1080
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,980
is Life Force.

1081
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,200
Don't you think that one's a real subgenius movie?

1082
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,740
Yeah.

1083
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,480
You know that one?

1084
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,560
Very, very much.

1085
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,820
About the space vampires?

1086
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,340
I don't think I've seen it.

1087
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,900
I got a deficit in that department.

1088
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,280
It's based on Colin Wilson's novel,

1089
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,660
The Space Vampires.

1090
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,860
But they come to Earth and they are, you know,

1091
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,040
one's a beautiful naked woman who walks around,

1092
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,080
but they zap your youth and your beauty from you

1093
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,500
and you turn into a horrible, withered, shrunken mummy.

1094
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,180
And then on the operating table...

1095
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,180


1096
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,500
I mean, not subjective at that point.

1097
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,640
The mummy sits up

1098
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,520
and then the mummy performs mouth-to-mouth on you

1099
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,800
and now you're all old and horrible

1100
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,240
and the mummy is young and walking around.

1101
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,040
The mummy's kiss?

1102
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,360
Well, they're exchanging the life force

1103
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,160
with this mummy zap kiss

1104
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,600
and it gets out of control

1105
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,220
and the whole city of London is shambling,

1106
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,660
mouth-sucking mummies.

1107
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,460
Always London.

1108
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,560
That's a real cinematic image right there.

1109
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,860
And sometimes the space vampires,

1110
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,100
reveal themselves as enormous bats,

1111
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,720
which is nice of them.

1112
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,900
Anyway, the whole thing.

1113
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,600
Damn good, I thought.

1114
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,800
It's just a wacko movie,

1115
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,140
but it's very subgenius.

1116
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,400
Life force, we're talking about.

1117
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,420
I have to go see that.

1118
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,700
Yeah, you ought to.

1119
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,420
Get it on my television.

1120
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,080
It's been around for so long,

1121
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,540
you can probably watch it for free on the...

1122
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,000
You really ought to.

1123
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,740
It's good.

1124
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,740
It's got a good script.

1125
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,080
It's always exciting when you find pre-code movies

1126
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,280
and things that are in public domain on YouTube.

1127
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,980
I believe Frank Finlay is in there as Dr. Filardo.

1128
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,340
And of course, Steve Charles Manson-Railsback

1129
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,680
is there as an astronaut

1130
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,080
who is seduced by this alien being.

1131
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,760
Well, somebody's got to do it.

1132
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,100
It's wonderful.

1133
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,220
They're up in space

1134
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,260
and they find these godlike beings

1135
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,320
in their bat-like ship and so forth.

1136
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,720
Do you remember the man who could make miracles?

1137
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,880
Yes.

1138
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,820
Yes, by H.G. Wells.

1139
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,620
I do believe so, yes.

1140
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,100
But the movie itself.

1141
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,580
The movie I do remember by Alexander Korda.

1142
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,180
Yes, absolutely fantastic.

1143
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,300
Pretty good, yes.

1144
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,400
That's public domain these days.

1145
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:46,960
Uh-huh.

1146
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,920
And you can't get enough of that.

1147
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,280
It has great moments.

1148
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,820
Have you read the story?

1149
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,080
I have.

1150
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,680
Yeah, the story is wonderful, too.

1151
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,340
I've actually read a book.

1152
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,900
That was the book.

1153
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,760
That was the one...

1154
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,300
The only book I've read.

1155
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,840
Well, the two books that I've read.

1156
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,620
The church book.

1157
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,540
You see, in all these stories,

1158
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,100
when somebody is given a miraculous power,

1159
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,240
they always fuck it up.

1160
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,660
I mean, this is the form of the story.

1161
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,960
How could you write such a story

1162
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,660
where they don't fuck it up?

1163
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,280
I think I might have figured it out.

1164
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,960
Well, how come it's always like

1165
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,520
the weird, unhappy, drunk person

1166
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,000
that gets the power?

1167
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,360
Instead of some...

1168
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,960
A successful, confident person.

1169
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
It's like, this person looks level-headed insane.

1170
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,400
Let's just, let's give them a power.

1171
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,020
See what happens.

1172
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,940
A successful, confident, self-satisfied person

1173
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,260
might wreck the world soon.

1174
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,360
Or a young child with ambition.

1175
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,420
Mr. Fatheringay spends most of his time

1176
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,480
trying to get this woman to like him.

1177
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,200
That's not even in the story, but...

1178
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,420
No, it is.

1179
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,860
But at the end, he starts to get a sense of his own power.

1180
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,120
Oh, Mr. Fatheringay.

1181
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,780
Oh, Mr. Fatheringay.

1182
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,460
How dare you?

1183
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,140
Oh, you're so cheeky, Mr. Fatheringay.

1184
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,700
He wants more time for his meetings,

1185
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,240
so he stops the world,

1186
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,320
causing all the continents to fly off

1187
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,220
and everybody to be killed.

1188
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,320
And an entire pantheon...

1189
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,700
Of gods.

1190
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,120
Of gods and goddesses.

1191
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,660
Including Torrin Thatcher,

1192
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,800
are up there watching.

1193
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,160
Are looking down at him,

1194
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,860
and, oh, this is what we've done, huh?

1195
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,660
The evil magician from the seventh voyage of Sinbad

1196
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,640
is one of those gods.

1197
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,500
It was a bet between two of them, wasn't it?

1198
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,000
Yes, yes.

1199
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,860
Again, not in the story, but in the movie.

1200
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,500
In the movie.

1201
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,980
Well, the problem with it,

1202
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,740
with having the superpowers,

1203
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,980
is you're not in a stable state.

1204
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,620
You're always finding out

1205
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,300
the extent of your superpowers

1206
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,620
until, eventually, you are destroyed

1207
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,480
because something happens that is irrevocable

1208
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
and you just can't deal with.

1209
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,400
But what if you use your superpowers on yourself?

1210
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,460
You decree that most of the time

1211
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,220
you forgot that you had it.

1212
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,340
But things are going to go well for you.

1213
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,660
You get this all figured out.

1214
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,520
And then, you know, you forget for a while.

1215
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,740
You forget that you have superpowers.

1216
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,340
Then you wouldn't be the chump

1217
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,980
who is knocked down for...

1218
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,700
For using superpowers.

1219
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,580
For using superpowers or whatever, yeah.

1220
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,380
So, basically, you're saying

1221
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,200
if you just subject yourself to your own will

1222
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,800
and don't use your will on other people...

1223
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,220
It's difficult, given human nature,

1224
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,680
to say that you can control it.

1225
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,620
But if you deliberately subtract elements of your own ego,

1226
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,540
you might be able to live with it.

1227
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,340
So, a loss of ego and being...

1228
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,520
using more of an Eastern philosophy

1229
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,820
of wanting what you have

1230
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,880
as opposed to having what you want might...

1231
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,900
Stephen King, America's most popular writer,

1232
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,260
wrote a short story called

1233
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,260
The Word Processor of the Gods.

1234
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:50,840
Ah, yes.

1235
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,080
Do you remember that one?

1236
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,980
I do. I do remember that one.

1237
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,880
This kid, who's a brainy genius type,

1238
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,960
who's also a sensitive, molested character.

1239
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,960
He repairs this guy's word processor

1240
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,480
and it turns out that anything he writes on it comes true.

1241
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,580
How many machines gave powers...

1242
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,520
Stephen King was a hack.

1243
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,980
Or is a hack, sorry.

1244
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,820
Yeah, of course.

1245
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,080
But still, he's playing in the classic vein.

1246
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,560
Now the guy can change things around

1247
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,020
and he eventually changes around

1248
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,020
so that this kid is his son

1249
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,920
instead of his actual son, who he hates,

1250
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,320
and changes around all the facts of his life

1251
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,520
and then the word processor...

1252
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,200
The word processor busts a fuse and gives out, you see.

1253
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,960
What if you had some magical device like that?

1254
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,820
Or what if you had some alien equivalent of the iPhone or something?

1255
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,720
It operates on probability vectors that are totally outside our science.

1256
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,760
But you have it and anything you write there will come true.

1257
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,320
You should write that you forget that you have this for a while.

1258
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,360
That nobody else ever gets it.

1259
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,140
Gets it.

1260
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,020
And then you write their hands on it.

1261
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,020
And then everything that happens, even though you have written the script,

1262
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,580
is a pleasant surprise to you.

1263
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,980
And furthermore, you're contained by the fact

1264
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,500
that you're not leaving it wide open for you to start

1265
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,560
a giant cosmic temper tantrum,

1266
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,540
which will inevitably mean your downfall.

1267
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,860
Sounds fantastic, actually.

1268
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,180
It's a great idea.

1269
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,800
A lot of foresight put into that

1270
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,260
that I don't think most people are capable of having.

1271
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,060
But...

1272
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,800
Would you want to forget?

1273
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,480
Well, the next time I get one of those devices, you see,

1274
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,320
I'll be all prepared for it.

1275
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,540
This is so wonderful. Why would I want to forget this?

1276
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,920
Oh, how can I take this away from myself?

1277
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,720
I've known joy.

1278
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,340
But you remember.

1279
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,080
The thing is, you might get to a dangerous stage of annui.

1280
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,520
You know, now nothing matters.

1281
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,660
I can have whatever I want.

1282
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,240
That's true.

1283
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,600
In a large charge.

1284
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,140
But if you forget that...

1285
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,360
Because if you remember joy, then you'll remember sadness.

1286
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,020
Oh boy, things are going great.

1287
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,400
You know, what'll happen next?

1288
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,120
And then in the still of the night, you remember.

1289
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,920
Oh, yes, I have that thing.

1290
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,380
And oop, there it is, right there.

1291
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,200
Couldn't see it before.

1292
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,960
Well, let's write some more.

1293
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,240
Take a nap, wake up, and it all starts over again.

1294
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,800
All anew, all afresh.

1295
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,300
Well, you can't wish for a million wishes, that sort of thing.

1296
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,380
You'll get nothing for nothing.

1297
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,200
I've never been given the opportunity to wish for anything,

1298
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,600
much less a million wishes.

1299
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,280
Well, you know, the joker who's given three wishes and the last wishes.

1300
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,480
And I wish for a million more wishes.

1301
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,980
That's a very dangerous procedure.

1302
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,940
To follow.

1303
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,580
As opposed to the staunch list follower, the joker.

1304
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,960
I don't understand.

1305
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,380
Did he actually get a million more wishes?

1306
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,880
Or did they do something...

1307
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,180
Well, what he would get was something that would rebound against him.

1308
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:55,460
Like the three wishes he already had, he would get a million more times,

1309
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,240
or something like that.

1310
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,540
Oh, wait.

1311
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,340
The guy that...

1312
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,720
That's what it was.

1313
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,680
If you wish for a million more wishes, you become the genie,

1314
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,500
and you have to give the millions of wishes.

1315
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,300
Perhaps. It could be...

1316
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,580
That is Shazam.

1317
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,120
Yeah.

1318
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:08,940
Zing.

1319
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,360
And other sounds.

1320
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,580
These stories are really variants on deals with the devil stories.

1321
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,340
You know, you try to get a good bargain with the devil,

1322
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,240
but that is always difficult to do.

1323
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,400
Yeah, but if you don't come from that kind of dichotomy,

1324
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,520
like the good and evil...

1325
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,100
Sometimes people win, but...

1326
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,700
No.

1327
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,740
Usually the house wins.

1328
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,060
Just like, maybe it's just a trickster.

1329
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,360
Maybe it's more of a Loki or a Kokopelli or something, that rabbit or something.

1330
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,560
Well, once you're dealing with the devil, you're in a Christian framework,

1331
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
including Satan worshippers.

1332
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,860
These people are actually Christians because the devil is a Christian character.

1333
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:58,160
But there is a bleed over into the ancient devil worshippers.

1334
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:06,980
The worshipping of fire and Zoroastrianism and the demons of Arabic mythology.

1335
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,180
Yeah, there's always set.

1336
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,440
Yes.

1337
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,700
He was such a wonderful seagull, I swear.

1338
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,380
That's Egyptian.

1339
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,500
If I may, it's interesting that today, 21st century, when we think about superpowers,

1340
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,460
we think about containing them.

1341
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:33,520
But when the modern superhero started, it was supposed to be somebody who beat up the bad guys,

1342
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,160
including the corrupt officials.

1343
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,400
He was the savior.

1344
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,240
Now we think of them...

1345
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,200
I mean, both comic book companies have basically put the non-cooperating superheroes in concentration camps

1346
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,640
in their different universes.

1347
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,500
That's what it all seems to boil down to.

1348
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:55,480
A struggle against conditions which wouldn't prevail if the superheroes weren't there.

1349
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,260
That's what happened to the new Dirk Gentry.

1350
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,160
I swear, have you seen the Dirk Gentry's Holistic Detective Agency of late?

1351
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,440
No, not yet.

1352
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:11,960
The new episodes are all about how he's got this special superpower.

1353
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,260
He's not just necessarily...

1354
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,300
He just wants to be a holistic detective.

1355
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,680
He just wants to call it holistic detectivism.

1356
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,560
He just is really good at being at the right place at the right time.

1357
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,760
That's his superpower.

1358
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,460
So, I'm not sure.

1359
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:25,460


1360
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:25,460


1361
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,900
Instead of just being a really awkward detective,

1362
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,300
he's trying to be contained by some government agency.

1363
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,180
Whatever works.

1364
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:41,880
I know Stang always brings up the forgotten DC character Bouncing Boy.

1365
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,120
He's one of the absurd Teen Titans.

1366
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,740
The bouncing superhero power.

1367
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,500
But you gotta play whatever hand you're dealt.

1368
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,380
So what is your superpower, Dr. Hal?

1369
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,600
Oh, I would never claim to have a power of particular discernment.

1370
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,320
What's your okay power, then?

1371
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,040
I think an extraordinary power of yours is the power of recitation.

1372
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,260
It impresses me.

1373
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,180
I'll just go ahead and say that.

1374
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:17,220
Yes, I've got a recitative thing going as part of my act.

1375
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,860
You know, it's the recapitulating poems and so forth.

1376
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,440
Here at X-Day, it smells like...

1377
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:25,820
Bacon?

1378
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,660
It certainly does.

1379
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,800
I think the late night meal is a cookin'.

1380
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,480
I think...

1381
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,820
Or hot dogs.

1382
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,860
Hot dogs.

1383
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,280
The motion picture.

1384
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:34,760
Yes.

1385
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,540
Actually, there was a movie of talking hot dogs recently.

1386
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,340
Wasn't there?

1387
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:39,920
Was...

1388
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Oh, the sausage thing.

1389
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,560
The sausage party movie?

1390
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,300
Yeah.

1391
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,580
I didn't see it.

1392
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,400
I heard about it.

1393
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,460
It's really snarky.

1394
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,780
These hot dogs address each other in contemptuous fashion.

1395
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,120
Yeah, I know.

1396
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,740
Only so many euphemisms I can pack in in an hour.

1397
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,180
And that was a little much for me.

1398
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,240
Did you see a portion of it?

1399
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,320
I saw none of it.

1400
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,740
I only knew that it was happening from a distance.

1401
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,300
A serving of it?

1402
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,160
Did anybody actually see that movie?

1403
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:10,820
Or was it...

1404
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,600
Maybe they just did the prequels.

1405
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,760
I'm looking forward to the new Ant-Man movie since I liked the first Ant-Man movie so much.

1406
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,120
This one has just gotten good reviews.

1407
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,060
What's not to like?

1408
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,880
It's like he gets really tiny and he hangs with his ant friends.

1409
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,140
Also, the wasp is along with him this time.

1410
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,560
That was a good trailer.

1411
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,420
Yes, I didn't see the trailer, but did you see the first Ant-Man movie?

1412
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,200
No, I'm superhero deficient, I'm afraid.

1413
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,060
If you hate them all, this is the one to see.

1414
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,360
It's interlocked with all the rest like they are, but it's quite a charming and witty movie.

1415
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,380
I'll take your word for it.

1416
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,320
I think the last movie of that nature was Birdman.

1417
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,000
Oh, I saw Birdman.

1418
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,640
That was depressing.

1419
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,260
It was an interesting film though, the whole movie pretending to be shot in one single shot.

1420
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,980
Is that what it did?

1421
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,820
That was the movie?

1422
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,720
Birdman.

1423
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,460
Oh, I thought there was a plot and I didn't realize that was the...

1424
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,460
Oh, the camera never goes off the guy, right?

1425
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:19,780
The shot is always running whatever happens, except at the end when he goes out the window.

1426
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,920
There you go.

1427
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,680
You mean also like Hitchcock's Robe?

1428
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,080
Or there he went.

1429
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,080


1430
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,740
This is another film like that?

1431
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,640
Birdman?

1432
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah.

1433
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,600
Well, like what?

1434
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,780
There's no other film like it that I know of.

1435
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,860
It's a trope.

1436
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,420
It did receive...

1437
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,180
Now it's a trope.

1438
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,520
Yeah.

1439
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,020
It wasn't yet a trope.

1440
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,460
I've...

1441
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:46,380
There have been other movies that have been similar, that have had similar gags.

1442
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,900
I've read a bit about how difficult that movie was to make.

1443
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,640
Because they had to make breakaway sets that were silent.

1444
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,200
Right.

1445
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,320
Because to move back, you have to go through walls and things like that.

1446
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,500
Alfred Hitchcock's Robe was done that way many years ago.

1447
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:12,120
But they had to cheat by sometimes while they were panning past a chair or something, they'd stop the camera and then rearrange things and continue passing.

1448
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,320
But at any rate, it's still all the same single shot.

1449
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:15,860
Single shot.

1450
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,260
Yep.

1451
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,800
There's one more.

1452
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,380
Well, anyway, Ant-Man.

1453
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Now you'd like him.

1454
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:22,820
He's...

1455
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,300
You know, he's real small.

1456
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,820
That's the nice thing about him.

1457
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,700
Nice guy.

1458
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,320
Can he change from very small to very large?

1459
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:31,900
Is this the same thing?

1460
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,340
Well, yes.

1461
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,320
Now he can.

1462
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,080
You remember in the comic, he could also become Giant Man.

1463
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,740
Yes.

1464
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:45,720
But at the end of Ant-Man, the villain, who is also the insect dwindling superhero type,

1465
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,780
there's, as always in these movies, the mighty Batman.

1466
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:49,780


1467
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:49,780


1468
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:49,780


1469
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:49,780


1470
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:49,780


1471
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:49,780


1472
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:49,780


1473
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:49,780


1474
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:49,780


1475
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:55,960
And they generally meet in front of a crowd that has carefully dis fury.

1476
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:55,960


1477
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:55,960


1478
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:03,880
He's both a role model and aedly fiddler that's a master of rest mystery

1479
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:12,720
And he's, uh, what they call open sly.

1480
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,020
The sound effect that cut in is really great.

1481
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,020


1482
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:18,840
but let's take a brief整 Background обı teams

1483
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,220
to the mass

1484
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:25,460
size of a dog and races out and later on in the movie it's seen that the guy's daughter is feeding

1485
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:32,000
the ant under the table a beloved pet by this time and a lot of good things in the in the movie

1486
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:41,540
i like honey i shrunk the kids uh i even somewhat like honey i blew up the kid if you saw that one

1487
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:47,300
where they make the toddler an obscenely huge giant because that's that's the kid you want

1488
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:54,160
to make larger one in diapers well he's of course uh irritatingly cute and impossible to control

1489
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,520
and the bad guys want to blast him with helicopter gunships and so

1490
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,860
so rick moranis is actually coming back he was a where did he go oh that's very good news yes

1505
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,800
now i've got to find zag nuts and

1506
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,840
manuals for the recently dead dick cavett

1509
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:04,500
johnny carson show but dick cavett was like the hip version of that where they would get

1510
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:10,680
more interesting guests and it's better to have multiple venues i don't think i was allowed to

1511
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,020
stay up that night or had been invented yet

1512
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,400
so

1513
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,160
it wasn't

1514
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,780
for a lot of folks but uh right

1515
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,840
anything past 10 o'clock was monty python in my house yes monty python was still uh

1518
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,100
Eric Idle, except, you know, I did, and yet I didn't.

1519
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,120
I was at the studio in Hollywood

1520
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,360
where we were doing the Conspiracy Zone TV show,

1521
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,460
and the car pulled up, this long black car,

1522
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,860
and I had nowhere to stand, nowhere to move,

1523
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,000
and the door opened, and Eric Idle got out,

1524
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,300
so there he was, and I was like,

1525
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,100
how do you do?

1526
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,880
Great, great fan of yours, nice to see you, and so forth.

1527
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,920
That's not really meeting yet.

1528
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:17,780
Anybody.

1529
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,260
Didn't get a Christmas card written afterwards.

1530
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,980
Yeah, that would have been nice.

1531
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,860
Letters from camp.

1532
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,900
He didn't follow you on Twitter.

1533
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,700
We had good guests on that show.

1534
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,240
It's a pity that I feel the show had potential,

1535
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,620
but we had the wrong emphasis.

1536
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,860
So many things here at X Day having potential.

1537
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,460
Missed potential on today's

1538
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,300
Subgenius Podcast.

1539
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,000
Yes.

1540
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,520
Our story begins before the beginning.

1541
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,260
Out of the cosmos.

1542
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,720
Out of the silence.

1543
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,420
Out of the mind of Bob.

1544
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,100
Out of no thing at all.

1545
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,140
Emerged everything that was, is, and will be.

1546
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:17,820
All.

1547
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:31,260
The design of those first three seconds

1548
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,620
of the original flaring fourth

1549
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,160
were perfect, supremely intelligent.

1550
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,920
And that impulse, that design is still

1551
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,560
operating through us now.

1552
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,240
You hit the button and off it goes.

1553
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,620
It felt like you were making a difference, you know, just you yourself.

1554
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,380
And you didn't even have to leave your home, you know.

1555
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:04,940
You just sat at your computer and followed instructions and stood up for what you believe in, so to speak.

1556
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:10,220
You made your say in the world and hopefully it turns out better for it.

1557
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,360
Yeah, that was some really crazy stuff to watch.

1558
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:22,040
To be sitting there in front of a monitor and you have just information just flying in front of you and it's this unseeable internet war.

1559
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,060
Knowledge is free. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.

1560
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:33,000
It's over. You're not going to be able to follow people back to their house anymore with impunity.

1561
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:40,320
You're not going to be able to just issue a cease and desist letter to any reporter who wants to write some shit about you that you don't like.

1562
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,180
Bob invites you to join us in an act of solidarity.

1563
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,680
Bob invites you to take up the banner of free speech, of human rights, of family and freedom.

1564
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,460
Dress accordingly. Cover your faces because they will try to find out who you are and screw with your life.

1565
00:49:53,600 --> 00:50:00,320
Rule number 17. Cover your face. This will prevent your identification from videos taken by hostiles.

1566
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,600
It is the idea that none of us are as cruel as all of us.

1567
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:11,820
You have this massive crowd of people who are anonymous that is going to fight against a bigger thing and win.

1568
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,280
And what the hell?

1569
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,640
What just happened? What changed? Who flipped the switch?

1570
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,940
The world looked very different to me at that point.

1571
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,040
We all met each other.

1572
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,040
Here's your culture.

1573
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,040
You meet your own people finally.

1574
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,140
The hour of flat.

1575
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,340
We do not forget. Expect us.

1576
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,500
We stand for freedom. We stand for freedom of speech.

1577
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,200
The power of the people. The ability for them to protest against the government.

1578
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,420
To right wrongs. No censorship. Especially online but also in real life.

1579
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,820
We have members throughout society and all stratas of it worldwide.

1580
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,220
Yet we have no leadership.

1581
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,200
Bob!

1582
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,960
Now we are going up.

1583
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,800
We can't survive the fires that have burned down our immortals.

1584
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:20,800


1585
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,200
And Europe.

1586
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:23,940
I don't think in time but still.

1587
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:23,940


1588
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,720
And let Peatsanao know this.

1589
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:24,720


1590
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:31,380
I am aitenst Schlisselfluege.

1591
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,040
When we began our passions.

1592
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,240
Until believe me.

1593
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,040
When we began to imagine the future outside our mimics.

1594
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,040


1595
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,100
O Sole Mee.

1596
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:49,020
new began to come in. We had surplus. Out of this came civilization, came arts, came

1597
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:58,500
culture, came this great explosion of creativity. And around about 800 BC, something new began

1598
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:08,100
to emerge again. Great individuals broke through and founded the religions of this world. We

1599
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:19,100
had, for example, Isaiah in Israel. We had Zoroaster in Persia, Buddha in India, and

1600
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:27,580
of course, Jesus and Mohammed. These were individuals, in my understanding, who had

1601
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:33,520
the experience of the core of the spiral breaking through as their consciousness.

1602
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,780
Civilizations were built around these great humans.

1603
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:45,080
And we loved them so much that they became the center of each great culture on this planet.

1604
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:01,620
You see, in this whole sequence in the last 8,000 years, and now more recently with the

1605
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:07,760
origin of religion, this yearning for something more, to transcend the limitations of the

1606
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,700
human condition, to transcend the limitations of self-consciousness, to transcend the limitations

1607
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:18,060
of the creature-human condition. And remembering the spiral, nature takes quantum jumps. It's

1608
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:23,860
always building toward more consciousness, more life, more freedom. And very recently,

1609
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:32,200
the last 300 years, we begin to gain radical new powers that actually lead to transformation.

1610
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,840
The first of these powers is democracy itself.

1611
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,760
The idea that we have to be free from the power of the world is to be free from the power of the world.

1612
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:37,760


1613
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:44,420
The idea that all people are created equal. The idea of the release of individual creativity

1614
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:50,720
and potential through freedom. Democracy, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

1615
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,100
This can be seen as an evolutionary advance. Nothing can stop it.

1616
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,200
And the other great tool of radical transformation is

1617
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,660
Bob.

1618
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,420
Oh yeah, yeah, cue the jackasses. Get your freaking eyelids down.

1619
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,700
It's my time to speak. We…

1620
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:21,400
She… she once had a scabies cluster on her… well, on her out mouth. It was pretty gross then, true,

1621
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:29,940
but I… I love that about her now. Now that the worms are the last ones to get to eat her at.

1622
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,160
Not like this, little dog.

1623
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,180
Meow! It's my way!

1624
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,760
If you are what you eat, the worms are the last ones to eat you.

1625
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,980
than I am her.

1626
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,940
And those worms out there,

1627
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:44,720
ditto.

1628
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,460
Toddly,

1629
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,560
but I'm a spy.

1630
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,740
All you phonies and cronies must fly.

1631
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,920
All you phonies and cronies must fly.

1632
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,640
All you phonies and cronies must fly.

1633
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,680
Phonies she just couldn't take.

1634
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,400
If you wanna know, then read along.

1635
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,720
And if now you are stupid and wrong,

1636
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,460
oh, you fool, you thought you were cool,

1637
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,540
but she thought you weren't.

1638
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,400
Oh, no.

1639
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:28,960
Undo.

1640
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:30,800
Undo.

1641
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,720
Dude, just drink it all.

1642
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,100
Spazzy.

1643
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,080
Hey, friends, I have no idea

1644
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,100
where most of those audio sources come from

1645
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,020
because I'm old,

1646
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,100
but Cool Hand Chris is,

1647
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,620
or seems to be, relatively young by comparison,

1648
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,540
and he assembled those disparate parts into something.

1649
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,560
I'm gonna close the show

1650
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,220
with a very new song

1651
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,260
from an upcoming but as yet unreleased album

1652
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,220
by Una Walkenhorst,

1653
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,640
and her pa, Bob Walkenhorst.

1654
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:13,780
Yes, my songwriting hero, Bob of the Rainmakers,

1655
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,480
is working with his talented daughter, Una.

1656
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,200
Now, I work with a talented daughter myself sometimes,

1657
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,340
so I really identify.

1658
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,720
And I wish you could see the video

1659
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,440
that was made to go with this song.

1660
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,140
Hopefully you will.

1661
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,900
You could Google or YouTube the title

1662
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:35,960
Bob and Una Walkenhorst for Tomorrow.

1663
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,260
And place cierto patria en poner que...

1664
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,620
it comes from this piece

1665
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:54,180
to say it's consequences e

1666
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:54,180


1667
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:04,060
Everybody's talking about the way it used to be yesterday

1668
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,760
But I'm living for tomorrow

1669
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,320
Everybody's talking about the times

1670
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,780
Feel the dream is in decline

1671
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,920
But I'm hoping for tomorrow

1672
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,300
These kings ain't learning from the past

1673
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,280
Think their reign will always last

1674
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,840
The change is coming for tomorrow

1675
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:49,420
So let them go and try to draw a line

1676
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,760
Of hate and hate

1677
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:50,760


1678
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,260
Dividing you and I

1679
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:58,140
We'll be rising up tomorrow

1680
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:05,300
Ooh, I'm tired of standing around

1681
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,440
Feet planted on this ground

1682
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,060
Aren't you tired too?

1683
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,400
Ooh, we could change it all

1684
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,480
Right now

1685
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,980
Tear all these statues down

1686
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,920
If we really want to

1687
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,940
What will we do?

1688
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,100
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

1689
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,860
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

1690
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,440
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

1691
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,900
What will we do?

1692
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,900
Everybody's standing in the storm

1693
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,860
As the future flips and falls

1694
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:26,720
We're all fighting for tomorrow

1695
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,680
Every dreamer, hoper, and defender

1696
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,700
All the names that you remember

1697
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,720
Will be coming round tomorrow

1698
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:47,360
Ooh, here

1699
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:47,880
We're all fighting for tomorrow

1700
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,140
We're tired of standing down

1701
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,820
Being punched and pushed around

1702
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,840
Aren't you tired too?

1703
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:06,220
Ooh, we could change it all right now

1704
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:10,200
Tear this foolish wall on down

1705
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,780
If we really wanted to

1706
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,880
Ooh, what will we do?

1707
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:24,880
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1708
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:34,660
What will we do?

1709
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,400
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1710
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,960
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1711
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,420
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1712
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,860
What will we do?

1713
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,580
Bob and Una Walkenhorst, For Tomorrow.

1714
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,900
Title track of the upcoming album by this father and daughter team.

1715
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,800
As a family man, I'm very touched to see this collaboration.

1716
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,200
I'm not always a crazy ranting preacher.

1717
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,880
You know, that's just my job.

1718
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:27,320
Anyway, this is Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1719
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:35,320
Subgenius.com, P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1720
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,060
That's subgenius.com again.

1721
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,540
Praise Bob and let there be slack.

1722
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:43,940
