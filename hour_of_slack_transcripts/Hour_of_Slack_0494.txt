Oh, yes, dear friends.
This is K&O AM in Dallas, Texas.
And thanks to those who pledged in last week's Pledge Drive show,
which, by the way, is not played on the sister and brother stations
to which we send the tapes of this show for later replay.
But, friends, you can still call in and pledge.
We've only got Willa Dobbs here, though, this time answering the phones.
He might have to let it ring until he gets to you.
We still need a few more pledges to meet our quota
and help this station go to 55,000 billion watts of hell, baby.
Start bending over, and I want you to start bending over,
and I want you to start bending over.
Glory by Shanda, love of Soto by Sata.
Oh, the best Sata.
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-soto, hallelujah.
Glory by Shanda, love of Soto by Sata.
Oh, the best Sata.
That's right.
You are now listening to that show.
We're going to make you real mad tonight.
Actually, most of you will just love it, but there'll be a few out there.
You know who we're talking about.
We're going to get back at you this time.
Arr.

Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slang,
sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
Well, that's lost.
That isn't somebody that's out there shaking their fist at God.
It can be either active rebellion or passive indifference, either one.
I was never rebellious against God, just indifferent.
I was God's enemy.
In other words, I had not become his friend,
because you can't become a friend to somebody.
But you don't know.
They walk through their lives barely functioning.
Inside, there's a nagging feeling of hopelessness
and the thought that they are trapped in life's circumstances.
But there is hope.
Well, you are joining up with one of the most dynamic,
major corporations in the world.
You're joining a group of dedicated people
and an organization of great resources, both human and material.
And you will never know.
None of those things are important.
And so, we stand here behind you as a major company.
But they can't do anything for you, and you will never know.
You have signed the application.
Welcome aboard.
And we'll be looking forward to seeing you,
whether at conventions in your area or as a new direct distributor.
Just maybe, it could happen to you.
Please.
It's only the first step in a new life for you.
How can I purchase that?
Go on the air.
We don't want to go to commercial.
This is not a situation where we make any money.
We're not infallible.
This money goes into giant baskets that carry it out throughout the day.
We don't claim to be heroes or gods.
We don't claim to be heroes or gods.
But you guys are good.
Huh!
Uh, yes, dear friends.
Uh, yes, dear friends.

Listening to a little bit of old KPFA show here on new...
Dobstown National Park, where we're spending the summer.
We're broadcasting live out of our tent tonight.
We've got very many strange animals here.
We've got collars, all sorts of horrible things.
Any caddies out there?
No caddies. You carry your own clubs and green helmets.
Because we are calm and relaxed.
Okay, wait a second. Move it closer to him.
No, I don't want to talk.
Nobody can talk.
He only wants to talk.
Just talk.
When you take his microphone away.
When you're talking about the plant, things fall apart. You don't understand.
It's a scary religion.
Okay, Bob was going to run for Big Brother in 1984, but Wotan has decreed that he will lose.
Not ammonia breath.
Hey, Doug.
Let's build a spaceship out of spare parts.
We can fly back.
I'm sure we can put it together. There's enough of the ship left.
You mean a show out of broken parts?
Stuck together with ice cream and...
I'll help.
...yogurt.
Yeah.
Get started with your draw windshield.
We can use the stereo.
Yeah. There's enough wire in the...
Yeah, I got some paper here.
That'll give us directional.
Come on, Gary. You start painting the game plan.
Okay. We can use these old bicycle tires for the power drives.
Somehow you can repair the reactor.
We can make that for the wings. We'll get back to the station.
And we'll...
Nelson will be so happy to see us.
Yeah. He thought he missed us, but we're here on this little tape. We'll fly back on this tape.
Yeah, this program's his baby.
We'll save you, Bob. Just keep talking.
Well, come on, Pa. Help me pull the stereo in here.
Don't put the stereo in here.
Just play sound effects.
Here, take this guitar neck and nail it up there to help.
I can make a microphone out of these old stupid wires.
I feel seriously ill. There must be some terrible mistake. Stop. Let go of me.
Wait. Wait. Look. How's things going with Hal?
We can use the vomit to stick together the...
The stuff.
No, no, no. You don't want to see the stuff.
Get a load of this.
Oh.
You sent in the money. You were supposed to send in his name to the police department.
And afterwards, when was it that you began to notice the strange psychic effects that you tell us about?
Did you inform members of his family that his strange activities...
It's hard to admit members who won't follow instructions.
...are due in fact to his religious activities?
Yeah.
I called earlier, but you hung up.
Well, that's our... That's our way of doing things.
Well, that's just our way.
And because we're not even awake or anything...
You call in, you answer honest questions, and we'll talk all at once, all over again.
It seems just like this.
...generalization because of the faulty analogy of...
Right into the ground.
Just like a little animal trying to get across the road.
All right.
It's an infernal opportunity for all of us.
Yes, calling this show is like...
Appeal to your...
...across a modern highway with your...
It's kind of like being in hell, you know?
...consequence.
The school is where the false process starts.
The thing is, by calling back, you have an option of actually showing up on the Subgenius album someday.
He finds his victory by begging the question.
Yes, it's true. Your voice could be used on almost anything, even this show.
Well, you know you're being tape recorded, and your voice is going to be sent to almost every important member of the Subgenius church within 24 hours.
So if you have anything really, really important to say to Philo or Stang or any of those scary people, you better say it real quick.
They're waiting to hear from you.
You use the present tense.
Follow the guy at the black hair and the glasses.
Yeah.
There's the morning of the bad luck that's gone down the drain since World War III.
Vienna, New Jersey, and the other swanky towns like Cairn and Dresden.
The fire soldiers you see there at Ross is probably the worst thing that's happened.
So I think you'll have a good meeting.
Though I know you're officially a great fan.
How's this situation in Staten?
Not too bad.
What about you, Phil?
The thing about Staten Island right hell.
I hate being part of that big Sith.
You're still doing well.
Pretty good.
The breach of all prophets, all standing by,
Better day for the future,
Cards being cast out, away from time,
From your soul, from the human mind,
Your fate is covered in blood,
No one but you is all spurned.
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
It's in your head, I've gone away,
subgenius is gonna outbid our hate callers for the price of killing me.
What it all boils down to is this.
We as a species, one master species of all colors and multiple religions besides subgenius,
are under attack by a foe who, in the name of Jesus and George Washington,
would undermine the very foundations of this shifting sandy beach upon which Bob Dobbs has built his church.
They would make it as rigid and conformist and vapid as the better paid face.
But we will not let that happen.
We will overcome.
We will come all over you.
We will bury you.
We will sell more books and make more money and get more schlack than you.
And we will sharpen our swords of words and carry on the war against the...
whores of boredom.
We will destroy youracoels.
We will burn you to ashes and kill your sixteenth and learning skirmishers.
It's a silver theme, though treating us like the mad,

on this merry
occasion
let's drink
love and sing
our wine has
a spring
the world is in pain
our secrets
to gain
but still let them
guess and keep on
they'll never define
the words are the sign
of free
strong men
of the nation
here's health
to the men
of the nation
the
the
list long before a little warning signal goes off inside the fifth what
sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error
but the language the pure
language of heaven
something said look out the sky is fishing
caucus for some with his
theological wires
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English, but soon
they're rattling off in a completely unknown language when they haven't even been to kindergarten
spiritually.
We eat more, drink more, play more, and do less to earn a good living than any other
people in history.
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music, and I might add a lot of its worst,
else the cultists would have no following.
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically for more.
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I
know.
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous
executions, it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.
There are little eyes upon you and they're watching night and day.
With a vocal and activist minority ready apparently to take over.


To burn a bomber's shield or kill for more.
And most incidentally are in their teens or their twenties.
And that's Washington people, I'll tell you that.
They dwell in caves, not high-rise apartments.
They may not have found a huge affluence, but they found an endless supply of dope,
uninhibited sex, an endless supply of money.
Free access to a distillery, I suppose.
And that's the end of it.



Ah yes, the harvest.
You can count on that.
A theory for more.
Why friends, we could feed another nation with our garbage.
What more than a space hogger on earth?
Is the church of geniuses?
I don't know.
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?
Bang.
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?
Atomic warheads?
Don't.
I don't know.
I only know that it will signal the end of time.
Why?
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
The past blotted out, and the future assured.
Ah yes, the harvest.
Forty years ago, I warned of it.
Thirty years ago, I warned of it.
Twenty years ago, I warned of it.
It's here today.
Crime, humanism, hedonism, pornography, profanity, one divorce for every two marriages.
We live in a world where this is happening.
of fever, of terror, of bombings, of international crimes. Ah yes, the harvest is here. What kills me?
What kills me? Ah yes, what kills me?
And the result is nothing, nothing. It can't mean something, nothing or nothing something.
There is no energy, there's no mass, there's no personality, there's just nothing.
Are we to say we came from nothing, nothing to the present universe?
America, wake up.
You are in black darkness and confusion.
You have been hugger muggered and carried into a war and you know nothing about it.
You know nothing about the forces that caused it or you know next to nothing.
You are not to be in this war. You cannot win this war.

I'm not really wrong
If you wander around
With a napkin on
With a bell on a stick
And your hair is all gone
The geek shall inherit nothing
You say your life's a fun deal
And you're up against the wall
Well, people, you ain't even got no kind of deal at all
Because what they do
In Washington
They just take care of the number one
And number one
And you
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them
It's the people

It's not just the dull and empty distaste
For a smothered culture
That expires all around you
In pools of its own wastes
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu
It's not just the child zombies
That murder their mediocrity in appearance
And then cruise the streets with bloody feet
It's not just those starry old vecks on the park benches
With looks on their faces
Like those who shuffled out of the boxcars
And Belson and Ogden
And the old Swiss
It's not just the anesthesiologist for Negi
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses
That grope and clutch all around you
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae
And human excrement on your car hood
It's not just that the old ways were best
It's not just the bastardization and perversion
Of every honest means of self-expression
It's not just the kill-a-shit ganja
From the dark side of the bush
It's not just the penoid snipers
Locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop
It's not just the wide-screen technicolor corporate daisy chain
That has defiled the entire planet
It's not just Mongo in the Congo
With fa-fa-fas the size of a moth

And the size of basketballs
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness
It's not just the indignity of having to work
For some bland, nonentity son-of-a-bitch
Who thinks workers are property
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil
It's not just the battling eco-freaks
Who want to go back to nature
Without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer
It's not just some asshole with a pipe
And a 90-more-than-you-do dog grin all over his homogenized face
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world
That you certainly never made
It's not just the doorway to doom
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.
Bob ain't no idiot.
No nickel-dime bum-show.
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus
You don't need to rise precious early
You sinner there if you want to diddle the almighty Bob
Not all.
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.
In his back pocket.
Just you try it.
That was Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.
And we're gonna try to take this next caller here.
Take his...
mind away.
Back in them old days, friends.
Yes.
Oh, what were we listening to there?
The ancient, ancient shows.
The ancient shows of the sub-dini's.
Going backwards in time, of course.
Little clip of Frank Zappa.
Lots of Liebach music.
That rendition of Blockhead, the old Devo hit, was by the Doguloids.
Wherever they are.
Our dear friends.
And, uh, oh, we heard a little song called It's In Your Head by Joe Velvet.
Oh, where is Joe Velvet?
Let's see what else is in our head here.
Um...
It's in your head.
Let me give you Joe Velvet's address.
P.O.
Box 1526 in Council Bluffs, Iowa.
I'm gonna go ahead and get this.
I'm gonna go ahead and get this.




Is that right?
I-A?
I guess so.
Yes?
Uh, Joe Velvet there at P.O.
Box 1526, Council Bluffs, Iowa.
Yes, and we've been delving back into the olden days.
Ancient hours of slack and, uh, and shows that were more than an hour, but yet so, so
much less than a show.
It's in your head.
It's in your head.


Huh.
That's a bit scary.
He saw the pipe.
These are scary thoughts.
On the run producers often insert a picture of Dobbs into their movies subliminally at
high speeds to induce uneasiness and tension in the viewers.
You get the feeling of having seen his face in this movie, but you can't quite tell exactly
where.
My friends, these are scary thoughts for this hour.
He was just a salesman.
That's why Bob is left in his own private spaceship to go to Mars.
Bob's gone for help.
And we need dollars.
Dr. Brady is going into a trance now.
It's not a taste to communicate with him.
Now Dr. Brady has the electric telephone.
All this for the great distances that we call out of space.
Dr. Rex is going crazy.
Oh, he got all sleepy and fell down into the octis, but I'll light him up.
Sorry, you gotta go to another caller.
Okay, destroy the caller.
Yeah, why'd you do that to Roy Rogers anyway?
Huh?
Okay, we figured out that at least 80% of everything you ever made is going to be taken
by the people in this room.
Okay, 800 trips.
I took 800 trips.
It's all right.
It's a distance from the satellite to the Earth.
And no one's gonna understand.
I'm not a very, uh...
You're on air all you say.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
Can you guess what happens when that happens?
They just kill the caller.
I mean every week.
You know, it's always the same.
It's impossible to really get direction.
You start it now and start it.
The friends are all arguing about who's abused the most.
Okay, so anyway, you know, they're trying to signal from the other side of
the Earth.
It doesn't matter.
You can't hear anything.
I mean the slide show from Jehovah starts now and the music fades in, and I'll put
back the sound effects, and we start the show over and over again.
Very well, welcome.
You know, I'm sorry to have to preach so much this week, but you see I'm a called
man.
of that man J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And that doesn't mean I'm against
better connected saviors like Jesus or Muhammad or Elvis.
Because believe me, J.R. Bob Dobbs
has broken bread with Jesus.
He's smoked frop with Muhammad.
He sung backup vocals for Elvis.
He drove the limousine for John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
He shined the shoes of Martin Luther King.
He partied with Jimi Hendrix.
And he gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
to Lenny Bruce, vainly.
He sold insurance to the Buddha.
And he gave Marilyn Monroe the best time of her life.
Life, life, my friends.
You can kill us for preaching life,
but by gobs, that's all we're preaching.
That's all!
Your rituals and your rituals.
And hymns and prayers are nothing but brain support systems
for something of yours far more valuable to God
than all that rigamarole.
Your life and your sanity,
to appreciate it for what it is.
And if you can truly do that,
if you can really, really appreciate
what it means to be alive and sentient as you are,
no matter the pain,
then you have gained riches beyond measure.
For free.
For free!
The greatest gift for nothing.
Something, my friends, something for nothing.
Bob's promise rings true.
Life as life.
Life.
Life as life.

You can tell by my accent, right?
Seven, five, two, one, four.
What?
Oh God.
This background music Nen's Losense was such a relief, I guess, from that barrage of crazy,
live things.
Well, we've only got a few minutes left in the show.
I'm going to go ahead and put on one more store-bought tune here, friends,
except that, once again, it's not store-bought.
This is from a bootleg called Studio Haze, and it's a beautiful thing.
This is a bootleg called Studio Haze.
This is a bootleg called Studio Haze.
This is a bootleg called Studio Haze.
This is a bootleg called Studio Haze.

In fact, if you see a school bus, speed up.
You never know what you're gonna score.
Hey, there's Huffcum, the sound effects.
And we start the show over and over again.
Good welcome to the Oh, Half Science.
Washtes a box tabii.
If you take an apartment...
We've got a yard man and we've got a mower man.
Yeah, wake up to the yard man and the mower man.
The capacity should be accepted by the dubious.
Ah, yes.
We recommend concurrent...
The Dobbs Town prisoners are lined up.
The people that still refuse to give up their old religions
and join subgenius are herded here into the pits.
There's slacks taken from them, and they're lined up.
Seven, this is Cape.
The weather and the recovery area is...
