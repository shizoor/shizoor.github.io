Yes, and praise Bob!
Hey!
Time for show, live show for you now!
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
How come always scary on show, says Doug Smith?
Of Dallas, Texas?
Well, it's actually been some time since Gary has been on the show.
Strap in, help. Show's about to take off.
...to about two and a half miles in wind.
Bob?
Oh my God, the pilot's dead!
He's been dead for over ten years!
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry,
Power of Slang, sponsored by the church.
...of the subgenius.
Wow!
Oh, wow!
Slang!
Hey!
Bob!
Praise!
Oh, yes, it's scary on the show again tonight,
because, as it says in Isaiah 28, 7, 8,
the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink.
They are swallowed up with wine.
They're out of the way through strong drink.
They err in vision.
They stumble in judgment.
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness,
and there is no place clean.
...who then?
...who speaks for man.
I do. I am the spirit of man.
Bob?
They shall all drown in lakes of blood.
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.
Now they will learn why they fear the night.
Keep me covered, Ma.
When Captain America throws his mighty shield,
all those who chose to oppose his shield must yield.
If he's led to a fight and a duel is killed,


then the red and the white and the blue will come through
when Captain America throws his mighty shield.
...he's led to a fight and a duel is killed.
...he's led to a fight and a duel is killed.
Continue fighting.
Why mess with the enemy in the name of the eagle?


And he's sent to the moon to conquer manchuria.
...he's sent to the moon to conquer manchuria.

I'm so worried about the shows on TV that sometimes they want to repeat.
I'm so worried about what's happening today, you know.
And I'm worried about the baggage retrieval system they've got at Heathrow.
I'm so worried about my hair falling out and the state of the world today.
And I'm so worried about being so full of doubt about everything anyway.
I'm so worried about modern technology.
I'm so worried about...
All the things that they dump in the sea.
I'm so worried about it.
Worried about it.
Worried, worried, worried.
I'm so worried about everything that can go wrong.
I'm so worried about whether people like this song.
I'm so worried.
Worried about this very next verse.
It isn't the best that I've got.
And I'm so worried about whether I should go on or whether I should just stop.
I'm worried about whether I ought to have stopped.
And I'm worried because...
It's a...
It's a sort of thing I ought to know.
And I'm so worried about the baggage retrieval system they've got at Heathrow.
I'm so worried about whether I should have stopped at the end.
I'm so worried that I'm driving everyone around.
I'm worried about the baggages retrieval system they've got at Heathrow.
Crocodile hunter here in the wilds of Afghanistan.
On the trail of the fierce and elusive Osama bin Laden.
The bin Laden is a native of Saudi Arabia.
But recently migrated to Afghanistan.
Where it caused...
Now under...
Trouble...
upsetting the natural order of things, you know.
Hold on, I think I see one now.
You have to approach the bin laden with extreme caution.
And when you're meant to grab at him,
don't go for the turban.
It'll come right off.
My preferred method is to just grab him by the beard.
Gotcha!
Ha!
Ornery little fellow, ain't he?
And just look at those teeth.
Actually, I think those teeth could use a good brushing.
And I just happen to have a nice wire brush here.
All better now,
except for this one tooth in the front here
that just has to come out.
Fortunately, a good wildlife management professional
always carries a pair of pliers.
Now many people think the only good bin laden's a dead bin laden
and kill him on sight.
But I've found that his behaviour can be modified quite effectively
with neutering.
And all you need for that is a nice sharp box cutter
to cut off his gads like this.
And then you can safely release him back into the wild,
confident that he'll become docile and surefire.
And don't throw away the gads.
They make a tasty treat when roasted slowly over an open fire
and served up with red, white and blue sauce
just the way you yanks like them.
G'day from our mates,
and be sure to tune in next time when we go off
in search of the strange and wily Slam Hussein.
We sell them missiles
We sell them tanks
We give them credit
You can call up the bank
It's just a business you can pay us
and prove
You'll love these toys
Just go play out your fuse
I've got no pride
Don't care who's boosin' to lick
We act so greedy
Make me sick, sick, sick
So get up, stand up
Out of my way
I wanna talk to the boss right away
Get up, stand up
Who's gonna pay?
I wanna talk to the man right away
We walk the highway
We walk the highway
We walk the highway
We walk the highway



We walk the highway
Send them in to the front line
And open the door, catch the hill fire
Of hot guns and cold, cold knives
We walk the highway
Send them in to the front line
And tell them to pipe in the sunshine
Of hot guns and cold, cold knives
We walk the highway
All right
I lose the thread and
I drop with wrist
And sometimes dictators need
The slap on the wrist
I know the Munich just can't afford
We're gonna ascend
The Hades in a hair симul...
Get up, stand up
Now who's gonna pay?
I wanna talk to the boss right away
Get up, stand up, out of my way
Why won't I talk to a man right away?
We want the highway
Putting the world on a deadline
We're hoping we don't taste the shellfire
Of hot guns and cold, cold nights
We want the highway
Putting the world on a deadline
We're catching them back on the prime time
With hot guns and cold, cold nights
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Get up, stand up
Get up, stand up
Get up, stand up
We want the highway
Sending the men to the front line
We're hoping we back the right side
With hot guns and cold, cold nights


cold at night
We walk the highway
Send them into the front line
Hoping to go catch the hill fire
With hot guns and cold, cold, cold, cold, cold at night
Yeah
Oh yeah
We walk the highway
We walk the highway
If this had been an actual emergency, this station serves the alert tone.
This is your game plan.
We just want schlitz
Yeah, yeah, nothing else comes near
When you're out of schlitz
You're out of schlitz
The shadow
The shadow
What have you to say?
Schlitz
Schlitz
Schlitz
Schlitz
Schlitz
've got tomorrow people we're heading to new moat
And if
there's no other
than my newavour
To mina
yeah
the
they
半
Give me drinks, set the floor
Give your time to you
So it's saving
And you've been a stunt
Swimming through the sea
Let the storm and the tide
They are changing
Writers and critics
Of other stars with you here
Keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
Don't speak too soon
For the wheels still in spin
I'm just telling you
That it's name is
The loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are
They're changing
A scientist's promise
Made me speak of all
Not standing alone
Of love and fear

And the heart
He then gets a clue
That he who has stalled
Is a better man
Outside and it's raining
In a suit
The windows rattle your eyes
For the times they are
They're changing
Mothers and mothers
About the land
Of the land
Of the land










Well, they know


But there's just
One who can stay
Something that doesn't
They'll be undefined
The road that is rapid angel
Please can anyone
Look at these Azariahs
Who are turning
Please just say

Please I invite you
It is long and the castle is cast
Slow down, we'll later be fast
As the present now, we'll later be past
The old world is rapidly fading
And the best one never will be to be left
But the dark will never change
And the public will swear out of the schools
The abortionists will have to bear some burden for this
Because God will not let us drop
And we destroy 40 million little innocent babies
To make God mad
I really believe that the patriots
The abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians
Who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle
ACLU, People for the American Way
All of them
Who are trying to secularize America
I am
I really concur
And the problem is we have adopted that agenda
At the highest levels of our government
And so we're responsible for free society
For what the top people do
The top people of the support system
Amen
The ACLU and all the
The American People, the American Way
The OW, etc
We're totally different
From the Democrats and the Republicans
In all powers of Congress
As they went out on the steps
And called out to God in prayer
And sang God bless America
And said let the ACLU be happy
In other words
When the nation is on its knees
The only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do
Is what we ought to be doing
And all the time
Calling upon God
You are new here
And we don't expect you to believe us
When we tell you how bad we are
It is a flat scary jungle
Bricked with scrub trees and tall grass
Hot and wet in intermittent rain
And strong tropical dragonflies
And Vietcong monsters
You are a long, long way from Port Riley now
And there is no Jersey Cafe in town
On Washington Street
Where you can sit around the counter
Eating on the go
And sipping coffee without having to be afraid to eat
Or make a go
Like a dink at that restaurant inside on a V-Way's back
You can get killed here
Get out while you are still alive
And before it's too late
Get out while you are still alive
And before it's too late
Get out while you are still alive
And before it's too late
Get out while you are still alive
Amen

Speed







Well I see fingers
Hands and shades of faces
Reaching up but not quite
Touching a promised land
Hey, what?
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper saying,
Oh Lord, please give us a helping hand.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Way down in the background, I can see frustrated souls, the city's burning.
And on across the water, babe, I see a weapon sparking out the sting of death.
And up in the clouds,
I imagine UFOs chugging themselves, laughing they sing.
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess.
Hey!
Hey!










Hey!
Hey!

Some things in life are bad.
They can really make you mad.
Other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on life's gristle,
daa, grumble!
Give a whistle!
And this'll help things turn out for the best.
Ayyyyyyyyyy!
Ayyyyyyyyyy!
Ayyyyyyyy!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life
If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
And always look on the bright side of life
Come on
Always look on the bright side of life
For life is quite absurd, and death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin, give the audience a grin
Enjoy the night, and you'll be fine

Enjoy it, it's your last chance, anyhow
So always look on the bright side of death
Just before you draw your terminal breath
Life's a piece of shit when you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
And laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Come on, boy, cheer up!
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
The brightest things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life
And what you gonna lose?
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What you lost?
Nothing!
Always look on the bright side of life
Nothing will come from nothing, you know what I say?
Always look on the bright side of life
Cheer up, you old bugger
Not my music quiz
There you are
See?
It's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record's available in the foyer
Always look on the bright side of life
Someone's gotta live as well, you know
Alright, it's a lot
Always look on the bright side of life
You can charge this man from there in three weeks
You can pick place for this, brother
Always look on the bright side of life
I told you
I said to him
Bernie, I said to him
I never
so I'm expressly gone
But you were only a stele
When I turned the work up tonight

I turned things into no alternates
I started seeing the government
What happened?
What happened?
Somebody set up us the bomb
We can't say no
What?
What?

Mainstream
Turn on
It's you
How are you gentlemen?
All your base are belong to us
You are on the way to destruction
What you say?
You have no chance to survive
Make your time
Captain
Take off every dick
You know what you're doing
Music
For great justice

Take off every dick
You know what you're doing

Music
I just said it
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Listen air
Hey
Hey

Well I think your life is dead
You are on the way to destruction.
We get signal.
Living is easy with us close.
Misunderstanding all you see.
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out.
It doesn't matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Field.
Nothing is real.
Nothing to get hung about.
I just saw you play show.
I am lucky to have such a good pilot.
Oh, I'm sorry, did I shoot you?
Oh, my gun, it keeps going off.
I must point it the other way.
Oh, I ricocheted.
Oh, I hit you again.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, here, let me, I'll point it at me.
How can you laugh at a time like this?
Well, golly, some days you can't do anything right.
We just want to remind our listeners
that there's nothing to be afraid of.


There's nothing funny about what's going on.
This is just human nature and quite understandable.
However, if we are to find the truth and get down with trash tax,
well, we have to force all these battle lines
and leave what began from peace history.
History is a wartime activity stirring up monsters.
Yes, huge monsters sleeping in the millennial deep
are being stirred up by the wartime activities of man.
That restless man.
Oh, my gun.
Oh, I've got a thing be happening on this ship.
Yes, I'm at peace now.
Did somebody say peace?
We don't want peace, especially if that dirty commie,
Gorby, tries to force it down our throat.
He came up with the idea it must be some sort of trojan war here.
Over here.
Never trust a commie.
Especially if they try talking of peace because you know.
Oh, no.
He starts speaking.
Speaking of peace.
They really have war.
Actually.
Some kind of people are out here now.
I've got to pass me the bandages now, man.
It is in current.
Look, it's a parade, man.
We're late for the parade.
I have never known anyone who would even venture to stick his toe
in its polluted ground.
Ask for fun.
Oh, shut up.
Stay.
I always wanted to do that.
Isn't it fun?
Uh-huh.
You think it's so easy.
Most things want him happy.
Toto.
Here on show.
No, on this show.
This has been Radio Moscow, the freedom-loving people of communist Russia.
Oompa, oompa, doompadee-doo.
I've got another puzzle for you.
Oompa, oompa, doompadee-dee.
If you are wise, you'll listen to me.
Who do you blame when your kid is a
Trap pampered and spoiled like a sign?
I am East.
Cat blaming the kids is a lie and a
Shame.
You know exactly who's to blame.
The mother and the father.
Oompa, oompa, doompadee-dah.
If you're not spoiled, then you will go far.
You will live in happiness, too.
Like me.
Oompa, oompa, doompadee-doo.

My special host, Abbott and Costello.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You know, Lou and I were thrilled when they asked us to host the Midnight Express special here in Istanbul.
Now, Lou, this is your first trip to Europe, isn't it?
Yes, it is, Buzz.
You like turkey?
Oh, you know me, I love turkey.
I love turkey with stuffing and gravy on the side.
Turkey, turkey, the country.
I wouldn't call it a turkey, Buzz.
We've only been here a couple of minutes.
Oh, cut it out.
Softly, Lou.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a great show for you tonight.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.



They're making their big comeback on the show tonight.
So, Lou, why don't you introduce the band?
You want me to introduce the band?
That's right.
All right, I'll introduce the band.
What band?
The band.
What's the name of the band?
I'm telling you, man, the band.
Well, who's the band?
No, no, no.
Who's on next week?
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.
Who's on next week?
What do I care who's on next week?
If I'm going to introduce the band tonight, I've got to know their name.
That is their name.
That's whose name?
The band.
The band.
What's the matter with you?
Look, are you the fellow who booked the band?
That's right.
Well, who's the band?
Who's on next week?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Well, I'm telling you.
Look, have you signed a contract with the band?
That's right.
Was the band's name on it?
Absolutely.
It's no good unless they sign it.
It's no good unless who signed it?
The band.
Well, who signed it?
Who's on next week?
I don't care who's on next week.
I've got to know the name of the band that's on tonight.
Are you listening to me?
The band is on tonight.
Who's on next week?
You follow me?
Yes.
No, no.
Yes said no.
They were booked.
Who's booked?
Didn't I just say who's on next week?
Yes.
No, no, no.
They're booked.
Who's booked?
Yes.
Look, let me get this straight.
Yes is booked.
Who's on next week and the band is on tonight?
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said.
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
And frankly, I don't give a darn because this is for the birds.
What did you just say?
I said this is for the birds.
Ah, they broke up long ago.
Now, look, forget the band.
They probably packed up and gotten home by now.
You took so long.
Well, I don't blame them.
A band without a name is certainly not going to go anywhere.
Just introduce John Denver.
John Denver.
Well, at least he's got a name.
He's got a name.
Here's John Denver.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
It's kind of like the old-timey war shows, isn't it?
Just lots of fun and inspirational music to lift us above and away from it all.
That bit just there, the Abbott and Costello parody,
was, I believe, from an old Second City TV bit.
We heard the Oompa song from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
Some war from Papa Joe Mama, Dr. Howell, and puzzling evidence on KPFA,
Berkeley, back in 1991.
Strawberry Fields by The Bobs.
All Your Base Are Belong to Us by Net Poet and Xenon.
Bright Side of Life, of course, is by Monty Python, as was the Worried song.
Jimi Hendrix did Somewhere Over the Rainbow,
and Star Spangled Banner.
That Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson mix rap thing is by Blindfold.
We also heard, of course, Bob Dylan live in New York City from a bootleg in 1991 or so.
The Rolling Stones' High Wire.
This is Devo in the background.
And, friends, coming up will be some ESO Swamp radio clips
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Professor Chaz and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.
But first, friends, let's find out about why The Rudy Schwartz Project did this song,
I Married Bob, The Rudy Schwartz Project.

I Married Bob

My friends all laughed at me

I guess they just can't see
We look stupid when we're dancing
But what the fuck
I'm Mary Bob
I'm Mary Bob
So what if he leaves open doors of may
So what if he makes noises when we fuck
I don't care if he snows
But I'm sleeping on the couch
He doesn't beat me, isn't that easy
I'm Mary Bob
I'm Mary Bob
I'll love him till I'm grey

Before they'd been bobbed
Ouch, man
It hurts just to think about it
Yeah
When I remember back
to when they bobbed me
Yeah
I was just
five minutes old
I'm still sore
Damn
It's rough being a sub-genius
my friends
But it's probably
a hell of a lot easier
than being a genius
Yeah
Yeah




Yeah
Oh, no
They're just dumb
Them geniuses
They're just dumb
I'm gonna join
that sub-gum cult
Cause they
They know how to party
I've seen them pictures
I'm gonna start a
They get vagina
I'm jonesing, baby
No, Bob
You're getting to be
a pretty big fella
Yes, sir
Maybe
this is a good idea
A chance for us
to have a little talk
Why, sure, Dad
What's cooking?
You mind
if I smoke in your room?
Oh, I'm good
I know, Dad
Go ahead
Mm-hmm
Oh, but Dad
That's wrong, isn't it?
I mean
No, no
It's not at all wrong
It's not at all wrong
Well, maybe you're ready
for the next break
Oh, shoot, Dad
I'm all ears
Oh, here's a match

Really com
Let's shoulder
Real cool, man.
I got a new voice thing.
Vagina Jones, some of her songs uses, she has an artificially adapted voice box.
Yeah.
Vagina's got an adapted box.
I do.
That she can switch on and off.
You speak the truth.
Yeah, I've got one too, only mine works for swallowing.
It's called the diverter.
See the little knob on the side of my neck?
Which one?
When I switch that, the food that I eat will go down to the little sack, the sack over here on my side.
See, it's kind of full.
I was at International House of Pancakes earlier.
I ate a whole bunch of fattening food and I didn't want to get fat, so I just diverted it into that bag.
I got a switch that makes mine throb.
Do you mind if I empty my bag?
That's alright.
You want some?
Empty your sack.
You want some?
It's already chewed up, but it's mostly pancakes and syrup, so what's the difference, you know?
You can have some, it's still warm.
I just swallowed it, you know, about half an hour ago.
That's good for later.
Yeah, okay.
You can sit in that.
After the show.
It'll keep your booty warm.
Yeah.
Well, for a while.
After a while, it becomes air temperature.
Well, if it's ice cream.
And then go.
It's cold.
Oh, it's cold.
You know?
But it warms up.
But I didn't mix, I didn't eat any ice cream because I wanted to eat the pancakes again later when I get really hungry.
Yeah.
I ate something with vitamins in it, too.
I understand those urges.
Yeah.
Eat it again later.
I'll turn the switch and actually eat it to digest it later.
Right.
It'll swallow.
After I turn the switch, when I swallow, it'll go straight into my stomach.
What kind of noise does that make?
What, the diverter?
Yeah.
Well, you want to hear it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I need something to eat, though.
There's a Dr. Pepper you can eat.
I'm not going to touch that thing.
I don't know where that thing's been.
It's been in Vagina's mouth.
Yeah, that's exactly what I was envisioning.
Vividly.
I could almost, well.
Well.
I shouldn't.
Boom, bop, boom, bop, do-ba-dee-doo.
I've got another puzzle for you.
Boom, bop, boom, bop, do-ba-da-dee.
If you are wise, you'll listen to me.
What do you get from a glut of TV?
A pain in the neck and an IQ of three.
Why don't you try simply reading a book?
Or could you just not bear to look?
You'll get no, you'll get no, you'll get no, you'll get no, you'll get no commercials.
Boom, bop, boom, bop.
Doom, bop, dee, da.
If you're not greedy, you will go far.
You will live in happiness too.
Like the.
Boom, bop.
Boom, bop, doom, bop.
Boom, bop, dee, doom.
You see enough bad monster movies, you don't have much choice but to become a preacher.
And that's why we have to watch for these shows.
Or mad scientists.
Or mad scientists.
Or mad scientists.
Or mad scientists.




We prefer to be called differently abled scientists, if you don't mind.
We prefer to be.
Different, differently saned.
Like you wanted to be mad.
Differently sanitized scientists.
There wasn't a degree for that.
Boy, was I mad.
Oh, you've been very concerned.
It's that steel plate in his head.
It glows when the aurora borealis acts up and it sends him radio signals from Duluth, Minnesota.
It could be that plastic genus that he keeps on his helmet there.
It's Albert Einstein, I believe.
That plastic genus or is that, wait a minute.
It's a genusaurus supremus, I'm afraid.
Wow.
With an order of fries on the side.
Yeah.
The time is right to start your own new religion.
Think of the seal of the new followers.
We'll follow you anywhere in the name of RocketBud.
Oh, yeah.
Found a new religion and it's same and fortunate.
The religion of RocketBud.
Been there.
Final final.
Been there.
Done there.
Done there.
Been there.
Done there.
Shredded self perspective.
We will do it there.
Sure.
Yeah, I see what you mean now.
I just thought, you know, RocketBud, what a character.
What a new emblem for mankind.
What a new symbol for us, as Bob was in the days before the days.
It's like VT before Tuesday.
Those were the days of Bob.
RocketBud.
RocketBud.
Son of Bob.
And now it's like Superman and things happen really neat and fast and everything.
Look, bullets just bounce off. Maybe this war isn't going to be so bad after all.
Oh, looky there. What's set up in the sky?
Is it a bird?
It is some sort of aircraft.
It is a plane.
It is Super USA Man.
And he does not look too happy.
Yes, it's Superman.
Strange visitor to another planet with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.
Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, then steal in his bare hands.
And who, disguised as Glark Brent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper,
fights a never-ending battle against truth, justice, and the American way.
It's an anti-ship missile. It'll be used in the opening.
I'll just take out the little teeny, teeny, teeny Iraqi Navy.
Oh, no, Lois, you're not going to scoop me again.
You're not going to be a fan on this big story.
And all those way out about 60 mirages.
Oh, Ken, really? Sometimes I think you're such a win.
Ha, ha, ha. If she only knew.
Well, Perry, I guess we both have tickets on the steamer to Iraq, the latest trouble spot.
And I guess the planet is going to be right there with the coverage.
Ken, I'm worried about sending you over there.
The fact of the matter is, I think Lois is more of a man for the job.
But, Mr. White, don't argue with me.
...and luxuriating in the golden light in San Francisco.
I still don't see what this is going to do to...
Maybe I should use my X-rated vision to check up on Lois.
Oh, no. Jimmy, use your Superman beamer.
Zee, zee, zee, zee.
Look, up at the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane.
It's...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Ha, ha, ha. Supernon, so good of you to join us.
Just in time.
Hi, for my latest invention.
Hold on. Let me bare my chest so these bullets can bounce off.
It won't do you any good, Superman.
I'm afraid I have my special crypto ray.
Oh, no.
Ah!
Blacking out.
Lois must reach switch to cut off kryptonite field.
It won't do you any good, Superman.
After all, I thought of everything.
It's only unconditional coincidence that allowed you to beat me.
And boil my plans in the past. Ha, ha.
All right, Luthor. You've got me.
Good.
At long last, I have the Man of Steel at my very beckoning.
First, you must answer to my every whim.
All right, uh, what are your other demands?
Got to keep him talking until I can get out of range of this red K.
First, I want a shrubbery. Yes, a shrubbery. Ha, ha, ha.
And I want it right here now.
And it must be of kryptonite red.
And that's the joke. You have to go to Kryptonite.
To get it. Ha, ha, ha.
But krypton doesn't exist except as billions and billions of gigatons of glowish greening rock.
At last, you see the irony of my plan.
Ha, ha, ha.
But the only way I could get to krypton was to fly backwards around the Earth
until I threw up and found myself back in time on my original home planet.
Only I know that he knows about the alternative universe.
And there he can get the krypton that he needs.
Maybe that was in the vest pocket universe on the square planet of Bizarro, I thought.
Ha, ha, ha.
When he tries to go to the alternate universe,
I'll have my special clone follow him.
Oh, not that tiny deformed imp, Mr. Mixitleplick.
What? He's reading my thoughts.
All right, Superman, this time you're indeed a deep poo-poo.
Ha, ha, ha.
It's really neat when they do that, you know.
And then I'm just waiting in the airport and you put a quarter in these TVs and they play these, like, old Superman movies.
If I can just make sure that my hairpin hits that lever, I think I can deactivate his kryptonite.
Gee, Miss Lane, do you think that would do any good?
We've got to try, Jimmy. It's the only thing we've got left.
You know, I've noticed something about all these bad guys and blowhards.
They may talk tough, but when you get right down to it, they're just a big cream puff.
Well, Jimmy, I really hate to ask you to do this, but you think maybe you can go over there and knock him on the chin?
Oh, you mean I have to do that?
That's the kind of stuff Superman gets involved in.
Oh, here he is!
It must be the alternative universe Superman. He must have beckoned out with them at the Super Race.
No, I'm one of the super robots who do that.

I just recently escaped from Clark's closet along with his 80-year collection of skin mags.
I've been double-crossed!
This is terrible, but this time I'm going to get even. Just you wait and see, Superman.
Why am I laughing? This is terrible.
Oh, boy, it feels great to be out of the range of that red cape.
How come he does that?
Fortunately, I've got my special Luthor-mobile. It'll fly me out of here quicker than the speed of light.
Oh, hold on, Lois. I have to see a man about a car.
What a car!
Clark Kent, what are you doing here now? You just missed Superman again.
Oh, uh, sorry, Lois. I'm looking for my clothes. They seem to have burned off my body when Superman went over.
You're never here in time to have helped us. We could have been killed by Lex Luthor.
Oh, is that who that was? I saw him going by his name.
He went by like a bat out of, uh, well, pardon my French.
You're such a wimp, Kent.
If she only knew.
They should all drown in lakes of blood.
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.
Now they will learn why they fear the night.
You fear the night because you have no barbed light to guide you.
A barbed night light available from the same place where you get this show, friends, which I'm about to tell you that amazing address.
And, uh, we've been hearing some old, old puzzling evidence with Dr. Howell and Papa Joe Mama on KPFA in Berkeley.
Plus some new ESO, Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland with guest Vagina Jones,
whose music is heard in the background.
And also, I think, Dr. Legume on there.
And, uh, the, oh, the Sexy Squid Jazz Sex Mix.
Uh, Smoke to Squid is by Champion Jack Codini.
All addresses available from me, stang at subgenius.com.
That's www.subgenius.com.

And, my friend, you better put down that joint or that cigarette and pick up that pipe.
Uh, cause you ain't got that much time left.
Think about it. Think about your lung, Dave.
Think about it and then get paranoid.
Iron footballs lodged in your thorax.
How old are you? How much time do you have left?
73, 45, 68 years.
Think about it. It's scary, isn't it?
Time is running out.
There's kids out there just laughing, going,
those old people, they think they're just afraid of death.
Ah, yes.
They're afraid, well, they think they're gonna get lung cancer or something just cause they smoked cigarettes for 45 years.
Well, that's never gonna happen to me.
Nothing bad ever happens to me, they say.
Oh, yeah.
Until that day when you find Dr. Legume inside your chest.
Deep in the iron lung.
Legume in your chest.
You got like a, uh, an iron lung and a, uh, you got a wooden hand too, don't you?
And a glass eye and a crystal ball.
Yeah, switch one, you switch.
You got like a scrap of hair if you take it you just just leave...
It's like a-

Close your ears.
You need the old song.
