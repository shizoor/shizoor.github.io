1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
So will the first paying member of the audience please raise their hand.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,280
Oh, well I guess we don't have to give away the automobile.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,540
In five minutes we'll be working on the rowboat,

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,500
so be sure to have your little numbers come in the door. Thank you.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,300
Okay, well anyone who speaks after me is going to be sneezing violently tomorrow.

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,240
Microphone that is working properly.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,260
In the last place we...

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,040
Oh, it's a little difficult.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,580
And we add ours.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,540
Answer, well, here.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,340
So just with this, and we'll start in there too.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,540
Is this a little better? Test, test, test, test. There we go.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,700
I think we're on the right track.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,860
Right track to slack!

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,040
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,220
We're having operating...

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,000
Operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our...

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,420
Some genius hour of slack!

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,020
Test one two.

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,480
Our time control is just about... There we go.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,880
Now we're ready to rock and roll.

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:27,520
Well folks, due to massive under personnel for our crowd management control,

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,580
we're having real difficulty managing the masses.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,320
We're going to be starting up here at 8.30, which is in about four minutes.

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,940
All you folks back there with all your money trying to purchase one of a kind tapes,

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,940
direct from the manufacturer, no middle man.

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,060
Do it now, because we're going to be shutting down there in a second.

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,220
How the hell does anyone expect me to be on cue when I don't have my...

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,340
Yell a little, you know.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,160
I am yelling a little bit, what the problem?

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,240
There we go, there we go. Hey, hey, hey!

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,700
We're the monkeys!

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,100
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good!

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,300
Whoa, yes, thank you!

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,000
Because we are not going to stop spreading the same word of Bob across the yards of America,

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,940
spreading that manure.

37
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,500
We are not going to stop until everybody is a deuce-paying subgenius,

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,760
whether they believe in it or not.

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,640
Praise God!

40
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,680
Well, there you have it, my friends.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,140
A somewhat traditional way of celebrating Easter on The Downey Show.

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,440
We are joined by the Reverend Stang.

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,980
Reverend, would you introduce yourself to an anxious audience

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,520
bound to kneel at your feet in prayerful attitude today for the gratitude of having you with us?

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,420
Well, either that or they're bound for hell just for listening.

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,840
Amazing Grace

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,240
How sweet the earth

48
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,340
That formed a witch like me

49
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,580
I once was burnt

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,540
But now I've survived

51
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Was hanged

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,780
But now I see

53
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:41,020
T'was grace that drew down the moon

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,840
And grace that raised the sea

55
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,820
And grace that raised the sea

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:04:03,340
The magic of the people's will

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:12,420
Will set our mother free

58
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,820
Tonight we're going to try to start off Bob's.

59
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,080
Bob's Five-Year Plan

60
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,980
The Five-Year Plan

61
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,460
Because the next five years are the only ones that count

62
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,420
Between now and X-Day, when the men from Planet X arrive.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,960
And during that time we have got to generate more hate, more money, and most of all, more slack!

64
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,020
Yeah!

65
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,080
Oh, excuse me.

66
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,040
Well, that's slack, same thing, in some cases.

67
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,080
That's not a good idea.

68
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,940
The curse is mightier than the sword.

69
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,740
So friends, I want you to open your heart, close your minds, unzip your lips.

70
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,720
And bend over, because here comes Bob!

71
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,620
Bob!

72
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:12,820
So as to authenticate, alright, the Reverend, I should say, well, J.R. Bob Dobbs, who is the deity figure of your church.

73
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,060
Let me give a little background on this gentleman.

74
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,860
And folks, you're welcome to participate if you care to.

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,540
Bob Dobbs' father was an immigrant.

76
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,740
And a descendant of the only Spanish Mayans.

77
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,960
Or Mayans, as people with an education refer to them.

78
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,440
Who had maintained a furtive underground existence in Spain.

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,600
Now he also ran a pharmacy.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,180
Alright.

81
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,040
His partially anglicized name was, and let me see if I can pronounce this,

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,700
Giaccia Cisjian M. Dobbs.

83
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,860
And he apparently died in 1949 in an explosion while mixing chemicals in the back of a store.

84
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,540
I think it was a PCP front.

85
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,340
Alright.

86
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,880
Bob's mother, an American of Irish descent, was Jane McBride Dobbs, a relative of the Irish revolutionary hero, Arthur McBride.

87
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,660
Obviously Bob doesn't resemble his father in the least.

88
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,540
And this has given rise to Jane Dobbs' reputation as the Divine Virgin.

89
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,100
Wasn't that Divine Anti-Virgin?

90
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,020
No, I believe she was the Divine Virgin.

91
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,640
I mean, there is, however, no little evidence that a mysterious milkman, probably Jewish,

92
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,840
was the true Dobbs' dad.

93
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,340
We suspect now that that milkman may be the legendary figure that Santa Claus is based on.

94
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,460
It would make some sense.

95
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,960
You know, Bob Dobbs is a lot like Santa Claus.

96
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,920
He brings you something for nothing.

97
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,500
Well, not for nothing, for twenty bucks.

98
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,060
But you get a lot of slack.

99
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,740
The milkman played by Dobbs' father.

100
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,200
Was that Dobbs' father who was the milkman?

101
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,740
We suspect so.

102
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,960
This is all sort of embarrassing to the Dobbs family.

103
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,760
I don't know whether we should have brought this up.

104
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,460
I mean, it could be an earthquake any minute now.

105
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,740
Upsettingly enough, this is beginning to make sense.

106
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,900
Ah, yes.

107
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,100
Now's the time to give more to call.

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,320
R.C., go right ahead.

109
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,020
Hi, John, I just have a couple of questions.

110
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,160
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,580
Oh, that's quite all right.

112
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Did you hear the program?

113
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,260
Yes, I find it fascinating.

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,300
I'd like to ask him, could he tell me how this merger will affect business at my office supply store?

115
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,880
Will it have any major impact on it?

116
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,800
How it will affect a supply store?

117
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,220
Office supply, yes. Pencils.

118
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,240
And you export to Chad or to Libya?

119
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,220
Yes, in relation to those countries.

120
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,120
It would be very hard to predict whether it would have any influence at all.

121
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,560
I wouldn't see why it should.

122
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,100
Why?

123
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:53,100
I don't want you to reveal any business secrets, but do you find a big market for office products in either Chad or Libya?

124
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,700
Especially Chad and Libya.

125
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,340
Is that right?

126
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,840
Yes.

127
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,120
What kind of office products?

128
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,980
Usually filing cabinets. That's how they bury their dead.

129
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,620
Pencils, lots of pencils.

130
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,100
Mind if I ask my second question?

131
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,840
Go right ahead.

132
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,280
Who is this guy, Chad?

133
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,900
He came from a different planet. What planet are you from?

134
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,860
1940. This is us, though, pulling your leg down.

135
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,060
Burying their dead in filing cabinets.

136
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,080
The next voice you hear will be mine.

137
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,020
Unconsistent, self-validating genius of oxymorons.

138
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,160
The James Joyce of swing set assembly instruction manuals.

139
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,120
The Pee Wee Herman of politics.

140
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,100
The Nathaniel Turner of pacifism.

141
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,720
The what's-his-name of whatever the hell it is.

142
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,320
The Lenny Bruce of fundamentalism friends.

143
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,060
The Timothy Leary of Barbara Bushes.

144
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,740
The Papa Joe Mama of the church of the subgenius.

145
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,520
Praise Bob.

146
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,300
Praise Bob.

147
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,360
I said praise Bob.

148
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,820
Praise Bob!

149
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,660
$500.

150
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,600
The price went down.

151
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,740
We had a couple more people walk in.

152
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,460
I don't know if they paid.

153
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,520
$500 each you paid to be here to bestow your presence in Bob.

154
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,400
You better get your $500 worth because you're paying it one way or the other.

155
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,420
Is this religion a joke?

156
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,300
Yes, it's a joke.

157
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,640
Make sure you tell your friends it's a joke.

158
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,300
Because if they knew the truth.

159
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,680
The sermon tonight friends is entitled X Day 1998.

160
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,720
Why did we make this religion a joke?

161
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,220
The reason?

162
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,740
Tell us why.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,020
I'll tell you why you made this religion a joke.

164
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,280
Because that's the only way we can slip it in right underneath their noses.

165
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,060
Slip it in!

166
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,520
They can discount it as a joke.

167
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,540
Slip it in!

168
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,520
A fad.

169
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,080
A sci-fi concert.

170
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,420
Perhaps some sort of artsy fartsy faggy waggy little get off trickster religion.

171
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,660
Faggy waggy!

172
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:38,660
When they ask you what the church of religion, what the church of the subgenius is, the last thing you should tell them is it's about killing you, pink boy.

173
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,500
It's about rounding up you and your friends, your family, your relatives, your girlfriends, everyone that's a part of your life.

174
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,040
And supporting you and putting a bullet in their skull.

175
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,480
A bullet in their skull!

176
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,140
A bullet in their skull!

177
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,620
A bullet in their skull!

178
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,040
Bleeding head good, healed head bad.

179
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,840
Why is it a joke?

180
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,760
Because life is a joke.

181
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,280
And we're going to extinguish this joke.

182
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,800
Because we are a bad joke.

183
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,040
A joke where the only people that laugh at it.

184
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,920
Is ourselves.

185
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,580
And we laugh when we see them in their death throats on the ground.

186
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,680
Going, oh god, I thought it was a joke.

187
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,240
It's not so funny anymore.

188
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,500
Somebody help me.

189
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,940
Somebody put my legs on fire.

190
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,400
And we'll drench them with that type of liquid.

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,020
Which some call gasoline.

192
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,000
Some call charcoal repellent.

193
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,820
Some call the energy juice of Bob.

194
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,020
Those monks in Vietnam are going to be our martyrs.

195
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,320
Those folks are going to be our marshmallows.

196
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,660
We're going to set them on fire and eat their flesh.

197
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,640
We're going to eat the hell out of them.

198
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,880
Iballs roasted at 500 degrees Fahrenheit.

199
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,480
Tastes good after three minutes.

200
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,180
You don't know that, friends.

201
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,520
But it's a fact and you're going to find out.

202
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,080
July 5th, 1998.

203
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,020
Bob's word has been coming to this planet.

204
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,020
For hundreds of years.

205
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,100
Just as time control transcends time.

206
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,500
Bob's word transcends understanding.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,740
One never knows how his word is going to be let loose on the public.

208
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:37,900
In 1939, on Halloween, we were bestowed with another joke.

209
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,040
It was nothing but a small little religious radio.

210
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,060
Radio drama.

211
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,120
People listened to it and laughed.

212
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,140
Some people thought it was a joke.

213
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:58,020
Allow me to share you some of that transcript which I have from declassified radio drama archives.

214
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,100
Let us look at Bob's prophecy and what the normals have in store for them.

215
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,760
Bob's word comes in many mysterious ways, not all of which are immediately recognized or divine in origin.

216
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,020
Indeed, just as Bob can trick the normals into not understanding what he has to say,

217
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,900
he can also trick us, the subgenies.

218
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,520
After all, we are subgenies.

219
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,640
This, taken straight from the transcripts.

220
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,800
I've thought it all out.

221
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,080
Right now, we're caught as we're wanted.

222
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,580
And an exodus only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run.

223
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,240
This is from a radio drama, friends.

224
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,020
A radio drama about aliens?

225
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,540
A radio drama about exes?

226
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,600
A radio drama about invasion on ex day, 1998?

227
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,860
Maybe it didn't say 1998.

228
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,040
But it was 1998.

229
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,840
They won't need to be doing that.

230
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,900
They'll begin catching them systematic-like, keeping the best in store in case of emergencies.

231
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,200
They haven't begun to work yet.

232
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,660
Yes, dear friends, it was entitled The War of the Worlds.

233
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,220
And we just saw it as a joke.

234
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:12,100
But for a brief moment, the entire public were scared the hell out of their skins.

235
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,000
They were begging God Almighty for peace.

236
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,420
They were begging God for forgiveness.

237
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,460
They were calling the police force and saying, where do I enlist?

238
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:26,780
They were asking the divine saver, be he Bob, be he Jesus, be he the Hindu God, please God Almighty, save us.

239
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,400
But there was no answer.

240
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,840
The next day, dear friends, they were told The War of the Worlds was a joke.

241
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,500
And they believed it.

242
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,020
They came so close to salvation, so close.

243
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,440
But they blew it.

244
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,040
Where does that leave you tonight, dear friends?

245
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,280
When you go home.

246
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,160
When you go home, what are you going to think?

247
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,720
Glory! Glory! Glory!

248
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,860
What is the Church of the Subgenius?

249
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,560
A joke.

250
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,760
I was there. I saw it. It was a joke.

251
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,520
Is that what you're going to think?

252
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,660
Good, because you'll be one of those bastards up against the wall.

253
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,360
Or, or you can change.

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,520
And you can become one of Bob's select few.

255
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,260
His soldiers are first.

256
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,420
Turn that light off!

257
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,000
Turn that light off!

258
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,040
Turn that light off!

259
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,520
Turn that light off!

260
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:17,560
Turn that light off!

261
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:27,420
And you can become a soldier of death, a soldier of Bob, a leader of the general massacre.

262
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,740
You've only got four more years.

263
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,940
Four more years.

264
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,460
Four more years.

265
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,420
And then we're going to kill him.

266
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,120
We're going to kill the hell of him.

267
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,120
Praise Bob!

268
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,600
Praise the joke.

269
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,140
Praise Bob!

270
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,520
Praise the religious fallacy.

271
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,560
Praise the religious parody.

272
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,020
And whatever you do, friends, don't tell them what the Church is all about.

273
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,600
Here is the word of our praise Bob.

274
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:56,960
Amen.

275
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,860
Draw six, six, six.

276
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,320
Good exercise to practice.

277
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,460
Draw those as much as you can.

278
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,580
We are going to test this guy.

279
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:44,580


280
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,480
to be played

281
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,800
I'm a hit back and I'm sad

282
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,200
I got a toilet full of sin

283
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,700
And I want to throw you in

284
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,100
I got a toilet full of sin

285
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,700
And shame and misgrudging

286
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,560
And death

287
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,420
At last I have control of your radio tubes

288
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,040
And I do too

289
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,480
Good, this is Rand Hoack

290
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,060
And this is Stimson J. Catt

291
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,520
Of the Rand and Stimpy Show

292
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,080
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack

293
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,480
On KNON

294
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,400
Keep listening you idiot

295
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

296
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,860
Else I shall deal you

297
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:22,980
Yes!

298
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,900
And if somebody out there still doesn't know what Slack is

299
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,920
We'll put them to work out on the Slack farms

300
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,100
Until they remember what they lost

301
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm afraid that's what tights sometimes

302
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,740
Gives people to understand what Slack is

303
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,340
There is such a thing as genetic memory

304
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,920
And friends, we are genetic supremacists

305
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,300
So we best start thinking

306
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,040
While we can

307
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,740
Time to happy up

308
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,900
And look at ourselves

309
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,080
And admit that we are an ugly nation

310
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,580
We are an ugly society

311
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,460
And friends

312
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,160
Sex is messy

313
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Paste the messy sex

314
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,300
Any religion that doesn't acknowledge the messy sex

315
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,980
Is a bad religion

316
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,340
This is a mess

317
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,180
It doesn't

318
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,180
But in the same time guilt raises a lot more money

319
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,580
We want this to be the kind of church where you can feel at home

320
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,140
You can go home to your friends and you can say

321
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
My God, I have a gish gal who missed my life

322
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,160
Squeeze me till it hurts all kinds of mind

323
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,040
And the melding and meshing and geshing

324
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,420
And get your gonads going

325
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,560
Got my mojo and my dojo

326
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,280
It's time to go, go, go

327
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,980
Get real, Connie

328
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,920
Come on

329
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,220
Come on

330
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,080
Come on

331
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,700
Somebody shake it

332
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:41,920
Come on

333
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,160
Come on

334
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,160


335
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,260
Come on

336
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:42,880
I got a fire

337
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,840
And now ladies and germs

338
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,180
It is my great most humble moment

339
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,060
To be able to introduce to you

340
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,280
The man who is subgenius

341
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,940
Just as subgenius is he

342
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,740
The one and only

343
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,800
Jayner Hypercleef

344
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,320
Abruptly

345
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,260
A spokesman of a gorgeous high school

346
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,120
Please take your seat

347
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,240
Back up!

348
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,480


349
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,320
Ay!

350
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:29,980
Yep

351
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,360
It's the Big Me

352
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,880
Duper Senior

353
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,840
Does it know that he is a genius?

354
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,200
All right

355
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,200


356
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,160
Alright

357
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,660
into his lungs. As long as the heart beats in the breast of a single subgenius, we shall

358
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:55,860
continue to fight for our cause. We shall continue to fight for our movement. There

359
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,680
will be no peace in the land until the normal person's body hangs from every lamppost and

360
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:14,380
tree. When Bob Dobbs comes into power, heads will roll in the sand. You've got to hate

361
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:22,940
the conspiracy. You can't just hate the conspiracy. You've got to hate the wind in the trees.

362
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:31,600
You've got to hate a cure for AIDS. You've got to hate a

363
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:31,660
disease. You've got to hate a disease. You've got to hate a disease. You've got to hate a

364
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,140
small child being cured of muscular dystrophy and learning to walk again. You've got to

365
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:47,300
hate a blue jay chirping at dawn. We're talking about pouring rock salt and ground-up glass

366
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:55,300
into the gaping open wounds of the people we went to high school with. You've got to

367
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,860
become the hate. But people always laugh at me as a prophet.

368
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,880
But many of the people that laughed at me yesterday are not laughing quite so loudly

369
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,720
today. And many of the people that are still laughing at me today perhaps will not be laughing

370
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:20,600
at me quite so loudly tomorrow. When I was the skinniest person in ninth grade, many

371
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:29,180
people chose to laugh at me. However, when I attended the funerals of these same men,

372
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,840
I found that the air was so fresh that I could breathe. I could breathe. I could breathe.

373
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,880
I could breathe. I could breathe. I could breathe. I could breathe. I could breathe.

374
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:30,880


375
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:39,720
The air itself was burst by a yetisoned corral of mocking, sneering laughter. He who is very

376
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:49,780
blast laughs best. They used to push me and shove me around, but when Bob Dobbs comes

377
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:59,060
into power, I shall push and shove them around in boxcars. People used to smile at me in points,

378
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,820
but now they're smiling at me in points. I'm going to tell you what came to mind when I

379
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:00,820


380
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:18,320
Now is they who are smiling because their flesh is rotting back revealing the teeth of the skull. There are no frowning corpses. Yes, they are still smiling. The only difference is that now I am smiling with them.

381
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:34,840
There is a lot of hate out there. I want to see you go out and spread it. Thank you. That's a really beautiful level of hate. I hate you too.

382
00:22:48,320 --> 00:23:02,180
I don't know why you can't use your smell. It's like a back-up septic tank from hell. A place where he loves blanking them up. He likes with a Bible when he takes a dump. He likes with a Bible when he takes a dump. He likes with a Bible when he takes a dump.

383
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,920
And there's nothing worse than spending the evening with a documentary on the love life of a squid when you know there's something better to watch.

384
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,560
You end up squirming in your chair in the love life of a squid.

385
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,080
The love life of a squid.

386
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,440
The love life of a squid.

387
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,300
You end up squirming in your chair.

388
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,440
You end up squirming in your chair and just trying to tough it out until bedtime.

389
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,920
Lay your hands on the radio. Lay your hands on the radio band at home.

390
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,660
I hope that I'm certainly, it is never my intention to offend anyone on this program.

391
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,800
Get your hands off my radio.

392
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:46,280
And on this holy day, in an effort to present all of the various religions and the religiosity that goes about this nation on a day like today, a Christian nation I might add,

393
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,300
I feel it's very important.

394
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,860
It's very important that we bless.

395
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,540
Bless those who have nothing.

396
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:02,460
Those who have not been anointed by favor from on high with an opportunity to know of another religion.

397
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,240
One which indeed can give you hope.

398
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,240
One indeed which if you were wrong on your deathbed, you can instantly repent as you see the light approaching at the end of that tunnel.

399
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,300
And then recognize it to be nothing more than a huge sin.

400
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,300


401
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,300


402
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,900
J.T. Wheeler bearing down on your body.

403
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,820
How did you know?

404
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,340
I feel these things.

405
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,760
I feel these things.

406
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,680
Oh, geez.

407
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,360
Right in my crotch.

408
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,420
You felt that?

409
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:31,820
God.

410
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:41,420
Let me tell you something that I hope, Reverend Stang, while I know that you as the pope of this religion are familiar with it,

411
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,500
Bob, who we refer to in our teachings,

412
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,300
Bob grew up in a church.

413
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,920
He grew up fighting the stigma of that Mayan dad of his.

414
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,220
You know, other kids made cruel fun of the, oh, God, of that slope head of full-blood Mayan area.

415
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:06,160
And though Mr. Dobbs maintained dignified silence, little Bobby, well, little Bobby got in a lot of scraps battling for his dad's honor.

416
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:14,800
And it was shortly after receiving a blow to the head during one of those fights that Bob began experiencing precognitive visions.

417
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,040
Oh, that's another one.

418
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,680
Now, I got to tell you, this troubled childhood had a telling effect on this sensitive kid, all right?

419
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:32,020
He became, thanks to the pharmacies, where as a chronic alcoholic at the age of six, oh, but that didn't affect his precocious salesmanship.

420
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,840
And he made his first small fortune selling stolen prophylactics and pills to high school kids.

421
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,040
Bob was always a salesman.

422
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:48,000
I think that was, well, that was a precocious sort of salesmanship, all right?

423
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:58,360
And this pipe-puffing, tousle-headed kid was kind of world-worn and a veteran of life by the age of seven.

424
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:11,480
Later, of course, to regain his long-lost innocence, still a child at age 40, he claims that when he gave up drinking, he lost his fortune and had to come up with a completely new sales technique to regain it.

425
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,080
And I guess you, as one of his so-called, as the pope of the church, could kind of be called the...

426
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,460
Sales manager.

427
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:27,000
There are only three concepts you need to understand, and they're all the epitome of simplicity.

428
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,420
Those three are Bob, slap, and the conspiracy.

429
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
The conspiracy of the normals.

430
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,260
And there are very few rules in this church.

431
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,260
Some of them were mentioned on that video.

432
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,880
But the most important rule of all of those is this.

433
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,620
Bob.

434
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:52,120
Well, if they can't take a joke, that's the only one that really counts.

435
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,600
And what about Mr. Just His Way?

436
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,120
Oh, is he just totally mean and obnoxious?

437
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,260
Well, that's just his way.

438
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,020
Well, did he just pound your face until it was coming out the backside of your head?

439
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,720
Well, that's just the way he is.

440
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,600
Did he just try to conquer the earth and exterminate it?

441
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,840
Did he just try to exterminate entire races?

442
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,340
Well, that's just the beer talking.

443
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,020
Well, I think that's perfectly normal.

444
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,580
I can accept that.

445
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,700
Only this is just my way.

446
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,220
I'm just into sprinkling my lawn with the blood of Mr. Just His Way.

447
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,220
I'm just into painting my kitchen with the blood of Mr. Just His Way.

448
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,400
Oh, I do like your kitchen.

449
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,100
Yes, it's Central Arkansas redneck blood.

450
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,160
Do you really think it's me?

451
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,440
Yes, it is you.

452
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,220
It is me.

453
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,780
But what are the signs of the end times?

454
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,560
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

455
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:07,520
Imagine seeing yourself being executed on live television while you watch the evening news.

456
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,160
Your children being kidnapped and tortured in the Sunday funnies.

457
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,360
Your entire family tortured and dismembered.

458
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,540
Yes.

459
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,480
Part of an ABC miniseries.

460
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,760
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

461
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,180
Comic book stories come to life.

462
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,500
Dinosaurs re-inhabit the earth.

463
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,200
Thousands of pipe-smoking salesmen arise, each claiming to be the real Bob.

464
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,860
Only one is real.

465
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,780
The others will send you to hell.

466
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,180
How will you choose?

467
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,320
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

468
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,260
Thousands of long-haired, bearded men all being crucified,

469
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,600
each claiming to be the real Bob.

470
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,860
scream

471
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,460
Awake, children, spent the rest of their lives as demons but content with the crime of nar Gnome the

472
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,660
Lehman thee

473
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:13,720
Hi, all Jams, buses, pal, peace, taxes, assistance, jezz gets me real, all I'm suffering.

474
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,120
Only попроб for their back.

475
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,100
They say you're dying for your sin.

476
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,100


477
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:22,860
The obituaries threaten to take over the entire newspaper, each to death, reported as more

478
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,280
ghastly than the last.

479
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:30,600
Dozens of alien races do battle for control of the Earth, and yet the president can't

480
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,140
figure out who to surrender to.

481
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:41,660
Know ye well the signs of the end times, and ignore ye not the coming and going of the

482
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,440
time of P.

483
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,840
New superweapons are released by every country on Earth with devastating consequences.

484
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,780
People become so mutated you're afraid to step on a spider.

485
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,820
It might be a distant relative.

486
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,280
The leaders of Earth's nations fight a war over whether or not to fight a war.

487
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,040
Fugitive Nazi war criminals appear.

488
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,420
Earth ripe for conquest, but none of the victors are sure enough to win.

489
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,160
They want it.

490
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,460
Sato Futuristics become an understatement.

491
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,520
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

492
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,220
Poisonous gas replaces oxygen as the predominant gas in our atmosphere.

493
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,660
Suburban guerrilla warfare goes on in American cities.

494
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,200
Comic book stories come to life.

495
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,660
You send your children out trick-or-treating, and they come back with faces more horrible

496
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,460
than the masks they left with.

497
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,400
The world is a mess.

498
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,640
And you can't even tell the difference.

499
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,160
All races are sent to internment camps, including Caucasians.

500
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,160
Criminals arrest cops.

501
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,420
Customers sell items to convenience store clerks.

502
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,700
Mutant giant lobsters with glow-in-the-dark brains terrorize the population.

503
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,460
No one's safe.

504
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,020
Aliens come on the radio and say that Orson Welles has landed, only this time they're

505
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,760
telling the truth.

506
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,380
They're not.

507
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,660
And no one believes them.

508
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,440
Giant insects swallow up tiny dinosaurs.

509
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,020
Believe you me, it all starts in 1998.

510
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,120
Aliens the size of laser beams.

511
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,360
Laser beams the size of dinosaurs.

512
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,900
Dinosaurs the size of entire cities.

513
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,380
The American president becomes little more than a puppet for alien conquerors, who then

514
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,380
enact a ghastly punch-in-judi show.

515
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,380


516
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,380


517
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,080
To the horror of the American people.

518
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,740
All rights in question.

519
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,560
Even breathing is regulated by government agencies, claiming you can only inhale on

520
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,520
certain days and exhale on others.

521
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,920
As if there was an atmosphere left to breathe at all.

522
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,220
Sane people are locked up while the insane begin running things.

523
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,100
I start to run out of ideas.

524
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,220
Gopper head-lodging becomes a national pastime.

525
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,380
And I'm not going to be a cop.

526
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:12,380


527
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:12,380


528
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:12,380


529
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:12,380


530
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,960
Only people are using real gopper heads.

531
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,380
Strange man-eating plants grow out of the soil.

532
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,100
Plants with human faces and human-like intelligence emerge.

533
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,240
The sun becomes a giant black hole, threatening to pull the earth into it.

534
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,640
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

535
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,440
Did you know that 50,000 people were killed in an industrial accident in India?

536
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,620
Bobber!

537
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,220
Bobber!

538
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,840
A real bobber!

539
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,820
100,000 people died in an earthquake in Mexico City!

540
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,160
Bobber!

541
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,000
Bob is the comedian, earth is the straight man, and the end of all normal human reality

542
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,400
is the punchline.

543
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,000
Cousins!

544
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,540
Cousins!

545
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,140
Over!

546
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,360
The human race is over!

547
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,360


548
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,360


549
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,360


550
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,360


551
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,360


552
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,560
Castrate the mass litter!

553
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:24,380
The tragedy for the new freaking world order!

554
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:39,480
Spontaneous human combustion becomes so common that children and midgets are sold as disposable

555
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,360
lighters.

556
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,100
Praise Bob!

557
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,820
Bigger!

558
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,360
More!

559
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


560
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


561
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


562
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


563
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


564
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


565
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


566
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


567
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


568
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


569
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


570
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


571
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


572
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


573
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


574
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


575
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


576
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


577
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


578
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


579
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


580
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


581
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,360


582
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,820
Merry-go-round horses trade places with real horses.

583
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,740
People trying to ride horses find themselves just going around in circles

584
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,500
while children riding merry-go-rounds are thrown to the ground and trampled.

585
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,800
Dear Abby begins questioning her readers for advice.

586
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,940
Breathing now requires a license.

587
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,300
Televisions watch people.

588
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,440
Audiences tell jokes to comedians.

589
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,160
New street drugs are sold to make the user more straight.

590
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,160
Praise Bob.

591
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,860
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

592
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,080
Riots become so common, tickets are sold to them.

593
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,640
People jumping out of windows of high-story buildings become so common.

594
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,440
Pedestrians have to carry giant lead umbrellas around.

595
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,320
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

596
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:52,040
House flies become giant mutants and are used by airlines for transportations.

597
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,320
I finally run completely out of ideas.

598
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,040
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

599
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,020
Snap together do-it-yourself H-bombs.

600
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,220
Free inside specially marked boxes of tricks.

601
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,240
Not recommended for children under 12.

602
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,800
Mounds of bodies being bulldozed into open pits.

603
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:23,080
Open country becomes even more populated and ripped by disaster than the cities.

604
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,100
Seven headed demons arising from the lake of fire is predicted in the Bible.

605
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,160
People swarm in droves to try to join the church of the subgenius

606
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,360
only to find that the P.O. box has now been closed down by the conspiracy.

607
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,220
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

608
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:47,420
Someone spouts off the prophecies listed on the preceding two pages claiming,

609
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:54,100
I know well the signs of the end times, only to find that it does him no good.

610
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,900
He is massacred in a manner just as horrible as everyone else.

611
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,060
So why do I keep saying, know ye well the signs of the end times?

612
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,360
I was a tax-broder, dancing on the corner,

613
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,200
with a giant lead umbrella.

614
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,200


615
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,300
The body with the cleaver in her hand.

616
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,220
Castrate the masses.

617
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,100
A tragedy for the new shrinking world order.

618
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,600
Squeeze, it'll get bigger.

619
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,460
Anyway, they may be looking at you, talking down the street,

620
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,800
and they may be going, oh God, that person, that, hey, he ain't human.

621
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,960
He ain't normal. It must be an alien.

622
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,880
And we here at the Sisters of the Yeti,

623
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,200
we are not asexual or heterosexual or homosexual,

624
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,700
not even bisexual.

625
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,260
We're trisexual.

626
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,580
We do it with aliens.

627
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,680
Yes!

628
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,120
Yes!

629
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,560
Hail, Connie. Thank you, sister.

630
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,160
Praise Queen Victoria.

631
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,400
Whew!

632
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,960
Hurt me somebody, his hair's on fire.

633
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,500
You see, I'm the infrared woman.

634
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,420
I've got the beast of the abyss between my legs.

635
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,500
I'm tighter than a constipated Scotsman on a pay toilet.

636
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,560
I make the Virgin Mary look like the Grand Canyon.

637
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,100
You can run deep, but with me, you can't run silent.

638
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,520
I'll make you howl so loud there'll be green light on the moon.

639
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,740
The new age was invented just for me.

640
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,380
I wore the old one out.

641
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,240
I put the magic in sex magic.

642
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,480
I shocked Aleister Crowley and made the last ten popes

643
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,080
give up their vows just for one moment with me.

644
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,160
Who do you think Sappho wrote all those poems to?

645
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,420
Hmm?

646
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,840
I make Linda Lovelace look like a store window dummy with lockjaw.

647
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,860
When I take off my clothes, fist fights break out all over Mount Olympus.

648
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,020
I've got more swing in my hips than the San Francisco earthquake.

649
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,940
I'm bitchy.

650
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,620
I'm mean and I'm nasty.

651
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,840
Yes, I'm a real shrew.

652
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,420
Mad rapists run screaming for help to the rape crisis center when they see me coming.

653
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:32,420
I gave the anti-Bob back his own VD and turned him into a radical feminist.

654
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,960
Bomb!

655
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,140
Sold it!

656
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,320
Ice!

657
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,560
Smoked it!

658
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,780
That settles it!

659
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:48,700
It's time to stop prohibition and start to bitching!

660
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:56,040
I mean let's start asking some questions and getting some answers, okay?

661
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,260
I mean what is fun?

662
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,060
Happy up!

663
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,980
Start dancing!

664
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,440
Start drumming!

665
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,540
Start feeling really good about one another!

666
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,560
There's no place like my ego!

667
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,920
Me!

668
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,380
Me!

669
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,940
Only me!

670
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,300
What do I want?

671
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,060
Connie always wanted to be a princess.

672
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,980
She always wanted that Cinderella thing.

673
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,080
But then the conspiracy says that only Cinderella.

674
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:41,120
Looking with a Barbie doll can be a Cinderella.

675
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:48,180
And they started saying, oh well we're all just playing with Jane and Francis.

676
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,480
We don't know how to work with fire.

677
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,380
We don't know how to do the dance.

678
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:03,320
But darlings, if you're caught up in trance, you can follow.

679
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,280
You don't need an attitude adjustment.

680
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,720
You need an altitude adjustment.

681
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,520
And just start flying like a UFO.

682
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:18,400
11, 23, 60 man.

683
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,880
Hike, hike, hike!

684
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,380
Catch me, I'm flying!

685
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:31,560
I will sell myself to the one man!

686
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,300
Or the one woman!

687
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,020
Do you know what I'm saying?

688
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,860
She's on the slave block!

689
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,300
She's auctioning herself off, friends!

690
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,680
To the one man that can't build us an empire!

691
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,500
There's no place like my ego!

692
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,100
There's no place like my ego!

693
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,700
I am coming!

694
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,440
I am coming!

695
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,540
There's no place like my ego!

696
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,480
There's no place like my ego!

697
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I am coming!

698
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,700
I am coming!

699
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,360
Oh, many posies, you want it!

700
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,900
Oh, many posies, you want it!

701
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,380
Ten million million dollars!

702
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,820
Ten million million dollars!

703
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,480
Shall open up our ego!

704
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,780
Shall build our great empire!

705
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,540
Although I should mention that we make an offer, as far as repenting on your death bed goes,

706
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,080
no other religion makes this offer.

707
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,460
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

708
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,440
In other words, if you find yourself with the flames of hell licking at you after death,

709
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,740
you get a sixty dollar check from J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

710
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,980
This is an alternate lifestyle religion?

711
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,420
You just mentioned flames of hell licking?

712
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,160
Oh, we're very open-minded.

713
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,000
Okay, alright.

714
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,120
Would you tell me something, because I don't think some of your followers,

715
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,260
which are probably getting us a .1 arb,

716
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,920
alright, what is Dockstock?

717
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,120
Oh, Dockstock is sort of like the subgenius Woodstock.

718
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,880
Oh, thank God, I thought it was some kind of a concentration camp.

719
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,620
Well, that's for after 1998, when the exes...

720
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,920
I thought it was an investment program or something.

721
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,680
Welcome, friends, to the main event.

722
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,600
The sermon tonight is entitled, The Lost Cause.

723
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,400
The Lost Cause!

724
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,580
Because let's face it, dear friends,

725
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,100
starting your own religion is not easy.

726
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,940
The religion today just isn't as easy as it used to be.

727
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,680
Back in the good old days, all you had to do was get nailed to a tree,

728
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,460
burned at a stake, or shot with enough arrows to make you look like a porcupine.

729
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,900
But today, dear friends, you look around you and what do you see?

730
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,960
What do you see?

731
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,460
Times are tough, competition is fierce, the price has gone up.

732
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,160
Nowadays, the Messiah has to give his life, and then a whole lot more.

733
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,800
A modern day deity like Dobbs has got to give his life not once, not twice, but three times!

734
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,300
I'm talking to you, pink boy!

735
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,500
How often have you given your life to Bob?

736
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,720
Well, you gave your three dollars to Bob, but that don't count.

737
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,980
He gave his life to you, and you didn't even say thanks.

738
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,360
Now, it used to be, it used to be that God in three persons was a slogan.

739
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:22,740
But now, dear friends, it's the only way a religion can live enough in order to die enough in order to get noticed.

740
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,980
But that's just the least of it.

741
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,280
Recession, stagflation, unemployment, and growth in the economy.

742
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,880
The crumbaroxy have taken away the profits from self-acclaimed profits.

743
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:35,200
Hell, by the time the regular church and government have stopped feeding it the troth, there's nothing left over.

744
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,760
Gone are the days of spiritual free enterprise.

745
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:44,260
Now religions get regulated, licensed, documented, investigated, stamped, filed, briefed, debriefed, indexed, and numbered.

746
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,420
Is that any way to treat a religion in America, dear friends?

747
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,180
No!

748
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,720
No!

749
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,580
It used to be that a religion was a threat to the system.

750
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,800
But you look around you today, and a religion has become part of the system.

751
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,760
And of course, there's another catch.

752
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,340
You have to become an organized religion.

753
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,900
An organized religion.

754
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,800
Now dear friends, we at the Church of the Subgenius have been called a lot of things.

755
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,860
A lot of things.

756
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,340
And not all of them have been very pleasant.

757
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,180
A lot of them have been rather insulted.

758
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,620
But there's one thing that no one has ever even insinuated that we are, and that is organized.

759
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,200
We are the most disorganized religion the world has ever seen, and damn proud of it.

760
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,360
I want to hear an amen!

761
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,380
Amen!

762
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,360
Amen!

763
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:32,920
Amen!

764
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:33,320
Amen!

765
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:40,620
Have you ever noticed, dear friends, have you ever noticed that organized religion is the one industry that government never even threatens to tax?

766
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,420
Don't you find that just a little bit odd?

767
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,220
I can't hear you.

768
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,340
Just a little odd?

769
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,340
But it shouldn't surprise you.

770
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,020
You want to know why?

771
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,260
I'm glad you asked.

772
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,160
Because it's called a symbiotic relationship.

773
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,280
The government wants religions to thrive.

774
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,760
It's called mass hypnosis.

775
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:05,240
They discovered a long time ago that it's easier to herd the masses around as long as they attend church masses.

776
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:11,800
Because they know that when your heads are up in the cloud, it's easy to manipulate the bodies down on earth.

777
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,480
Why, they could even get people to kill for them.

778
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,360
Why, sure, just ask Ayatollah Khomeini.

779
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,100
The government that has an army of religious fanatics has got the best morale that money can buy.

780
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,740
And what about the money, dear friends?

781
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,620
What about it?

782
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,180
It's money.

783
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,420
It's money, right?

784
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,080
You need it.

785
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,660
What's the best, most efficient way to get it?

786
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,940
Anyone can cheat on their taxes.

787
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,440
After all, the IRS has only got so many million employees to audit you.

788
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,420
But people who believe in God, they can't cheat.

789
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:41,940
Why?

790
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,220
You owe back one little penny.

791
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,740
And you burn for hell.

792
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,920
Burn in hell forever and ever.

793
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,800
Little wonder your money is stamped, in God we trust.

794
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,320
Because as long as you would trust in Him, they could trust in you.

795
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,640
You see, it's a two-way street.

796
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,980
The government supports the church, and the church supports the government.

797
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,400
This little symbiotic relationship is what we at the church call the conspiracy.

798
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,960
And that conspiracy, dear friends, is what the church of the subgenius is sworn to destroy.

799
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,480
Listen, we don't hate God, and we don't love the devil neither.

800
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,080
We love your money, and we hate the way the church and the government get it all.

801
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,760
We hate the conspiracy between the puppet masters and the pulpit masters.

802
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,940
That's why we're the only church, the only church, dear friends, that's proud to pay our taxes.

803
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,740
Because we don't want any of their conspiracy kickbacks.

804
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,380
That's also why we're the only religion to offer a seven-day Sabbath.

805
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,300
None of this nine-to-five bulls**t, five days a week, with another going to church.

806
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,840
And the church of the subgenius, dear friends, every day is your day off.

807
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,600
We don't even expect you to come to church.

808
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,280
You want to know why?

809
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,340
Because we don't expect you to have a ch-

810
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,300
How many of you have a car?

811
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,840
We don't expect you to have a car.

812
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,300
We don't want you to have a car.

813
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:53,740
Because we don't expect you to have a car.

814
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,400
Because we don't want you to have any obligations that are going to make you pay the conspiracy.

815
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,540
Just think about it.

816
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:01,620
That rusting status symbol falling apart out there in the street,

817
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,400
the one that pollutes, the one that you pay 40 cents on the dollar of every gallon of gas you pay for,

818
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,340
obligated you to five years of indentured servitude the moment you drove it off that lot.

819
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,760
It depreciated a thousand dollars that very second.

820
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,600
And now the conspiracy's just got you right where they want you.

821
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,840
Because if you don't pay off that, if you don't pay off the rest of that bill,

822
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,360
they're going to repossess you, your car, and the remainder of your soul.

823
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,260
Oh, and I almost forgot.

824
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,380
The punchline.

825
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,040
The great joke.

826
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,000
The last laugh.

827
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,520
The final punchline of the grand illusion.

828
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,360
All the time, the conspiracy has got you thinking that you're the one in control.

829
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,080
Why, sure.

830
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,940
It's a democracy.

831
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,420
You have a choice.

832
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,040
No conspiracy around here.

833
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,680
Why, no, sir.

834
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,240
Look over there.

835
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,800
Where, here?

836
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,360
In the church where you grew up?

837
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,380
Oh, no, sir.

838
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,260
Shame on you.

839
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,660
Look overseas, perhaps.

840
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,600
Look overseas at your neighbor.

841
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,100
But just think about this, friends.

842
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,840
If it's really a free country, then how come you're paying a third of every dollar to taxes?

843
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,520
And if it's really a free choice of religion, how come you have to choose it?

844
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,940
Or else you burn forever in hell.

845
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,520
That's the beauty of their system.

846
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,400
You see, you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.

847
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,320
No, thunders Uncle Sham.

848
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,160
This is a free society.

849
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,680
All religions get equal treatment in the good USA.

850
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,820
Yeah, right.

851
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:28,880
Then explain to me that when we try to celebrate a simple religious rite, like, say, the head-launching of Arnold Palmer,

852
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,720
we have to use a fake plastic head to do it.

853
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,500
Go figure.

854
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:44,640
Now, the Christians, they got to fight to the death in giant, glorious, state-sponsored arenas.

855
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,500
And we have to use plastic heads.

856
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,280
And the Christians?

857
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:55,680
They got the head of John the Baptist cut off at the neck and served to them on a real silver platter.

858
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,520
And what do we get?

859
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,360
Plastic.

860
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,020
Now, how are we supposed to compete with a religion that gets that kind of free publicity?

861
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,220
I mean, which religion would you be more interested in?

862
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,900
The one that uses real human sacrifices, being fed to the lions?

863
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,200
Or the one that serves fake plastic heads?

864
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:26,340
You see, they got people like Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea in glorious, Cicero, Technicolor surround sound.

865
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,780
And we've got intermittent mics on KRON.

866
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,620
It just doesn't seem right, does it, dear friends?

867
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,820
We at the church know the odds are against us.

868
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,000
After all, Bob Dobbs ran for President of the United States on three occasions.

869
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,260
Three! Count them! One, two, three!

870
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,520
He died just as many times.

871
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,480
He was assassinated.

872
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,180
But did you hear about it on the national television?

873
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,180
No, sir.

874
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,820
Did you see it?

875
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,840
His name on the ballot, dear friends?

876
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,520
No, sir.

877
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:00,360
But when Pat Robertson and Patrick Buchanan ran for President of the United States, you

878
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,480
never heard a thing of it.

879
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:08,800
We may not have the star status of Patrick Buchanan or Pat Robertson or even Pat Boone,

880
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,500
for that matter, but at least we don't have the conspiracy patting us on the back for

881
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,260
a job well done.

882
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,680
We'd rather sell the

883
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:16,800
world's most expensive plastic bags than sell the world's most expensive plastic bags.

884
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,160
We'd rather sell the world's most expensive plastic bags than sell the world's most expensive

885
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:17,820
plastic bags.

886
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,980
Every last thing we have than sell our souls to cooperate with the conspiracy.

887
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:28,140
So maybe it's better to starve than it is to be reduced to spiritual cannibalism.

888
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,960
And who knows, friends?

889
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,840
I'm sad to say it here tonight, but look at your numbers.

890
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,000
Maybe it is a lost cause.

891
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,460
How are we going to revolutionize any part of society with 11 people in the audience?

892
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,240
That's not even enough for 12 apostles.

893
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,480
Automatic weapons.

894
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,780
Well, that may be a solution.

895
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,400
That may be the final solution.

896
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,600
And that may be the solution we have to resolve to.

897
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,840
But don't let it be said we didn't try the peaceful means.

898
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,640
So if it is a lost cause, maybe we should just give up.

899
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,700
Do you think we should just give up?

900
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,440
Let's just give up.

901
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:03,940
No, sir.

902
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:04,820
No, sir.

903
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,880
We will not give up now.

904
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,220
We will not give up later.

905
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,840
Because that which does not destroy us makes us stronger, dear friends.

906
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:16,160
They may have the political machines, the organized religions, the communication networks,

907
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,000
all the police.

908
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,320
All the military and all the money.

909
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,500
But what do we have?

910
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,460
We have the faith.

911
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:30,640
Faith in J.R. Bob Dobbs, the man with the anti-conspiracy plan.

912
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,900
Oh, J.R., we are unworthy of you.

913
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,080
Show us your grace.

914
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,360
How's he going to do it, friends?

915
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,940
How's he going to do it?

916
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:46,580
Well, let's just say J.R. has got some friends in high places.

917
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,000
Very high places.

918
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:55,440
So the next time the conspiracy tries to tell you it's a lost cause, just remember, it's

919
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,920
always darkest before the dawn.

920
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,040
And even J.R. Bob Dobbs can see that it ain't over until it's over.

921
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,680
In final words, friends, remember, Bob Dobbs will return.

922
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,480
Only this time, he won't be alone.

923
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,560
Hearing the thwart of Bob, I'm going to go.

924
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:16,560


925
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,220
Wee!

926
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,980
Bob, ain't it?

927
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,260
Father!

928
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:30,400
The ozone layer has so many holes in it, it begins to look like a piece of Swiss cheese.

929
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,380
Praise God!

930
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,360
The truth will make you very, very paranoid.

931
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,300
People fight duels to the death over morsels of food not big enough to feed a rat.

932
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:46,540
Atmosphere so polluted that the wearing of gas masks becomes mandatory.

933
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:55,060
There are spring fashion shows to introduce new annual fashions in gas masks and camouflage

934
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:55,720
chic.

935
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,360
The smell of rotting corpses becomes so common...

936
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,820
Gas mask?

937
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,620
In times.

938
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,720
In times.

939
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,300
In times.

940
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,200
In times.

941
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:05,220
In times.

942
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,800
How much do I owe you my charge for this?

943
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:16,320
The smell of rotting corpses becomes so common, women are forced to wear... it is sold as

944
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,240
a perfume.

945
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,540
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

946
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:30,540
Rape becomes so common, women are forced to wear chastity belts, even around their husbands.

947
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,660
Human beings are hunted for sport on national television.

948
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:42,300
Displaying human heads on spears once again becomes a common practice.

949
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,260
Christians are called up to the rapture.

950
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,300
The rapture is a sign of the end times.

951
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:51,220
But those who are standing indoors when it happens bump their heads on the ceiling.

952
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:58,900
Others collide with airplanes or suffocate in outer space as their bodies leave the atmosphere.

953
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:08,320
Realizing their fate, some Christians attempt to chain themselves to the ground to no avail.

954
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,120
Animals house human beings in human zoos.

955
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,280
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

956
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,240
It turns you off while there's still a chance.

957
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:32,640
But my friends, I come to you with a heavy heart tonight.

958
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,920
Why, you might ask.

959
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,520
Do you come to us with a heavy heart, Jane or Hyperclakes?

960
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,520
Why?

961
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,140
Why?

962
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,480
Why?

963
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,040
It is because...

964
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,900
Why?

965
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,260
It is because the church is the church of the Lord God.

966
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


967
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


968
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


969
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


970
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


971
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


972
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


973
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


974
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


975
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


976
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


977
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


978
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


979
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


980
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


981
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


982
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


983
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


984
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


985
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,260


986
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,360
The church of the sov genius is facing a financial crisis.

987
00:54:51,500 --> 00:55:00,680
The words stick in my throat, but we are in danger of losing the entire ministry.

988
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,780
I'm not talking about just the radio ministry, just the TV ministry.

989
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,200
I'm not talking about just the homes of slack host children.

990
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,920
I'm talking about the holes to bang.

991
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,800
This church needs new долго having uses like организ catastrophic poverty.

992
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:15,860
Free anvision services, free development, free principles for years to come of Cannon Church.

993
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,820
We can't run this ministry on love alone.

994
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:28,840
If we're going to destroy the very concept of money, it's going to take money, tons of it.

995
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,700
Let me put it this way.

996
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,500
If I were you, I'd give me all your money.

997
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,620
And if you were me, you'd probably take it.

998
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,920
But how do you tithe your money to J.R. Bob Dobbs?

999
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,820
How do you decide how much to give?

1000
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,840
Well, you just take the unnecessary portion of your salary,

1001
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,200
say that what you were going to spend on food and rent,

1002
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,420
and that's the part you send to Bob.

1003
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,340
But we don't want the money.

1004
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,440
We put the money in good piles and burn it.

1005
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:10,920
But that part of your soul, which is attached to the dollar bill,

1006
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,800
goes up with the flame.

1007
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,260
It will be received by our interplanetary spirit.

1008
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,100
We will face guardians, and you will be saved.

1009
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,340
We feel like...

1010
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,700
Why get ripped off somewhere else when you can come here?

1011
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,180
We are prophets, and we want prophets.

1012
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,120
Oh, yeah.

1013
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,440
So can I give the sacred post office box?

1014
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,560
The sacred post office box.

1015
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:42,040
Right here in lovely Dallas, Texas, folks can just write to Bob at post office box.

1016
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,360
So J.R. Bob Dobbs gets this money?

1017
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,400
Oh, he seems to intercept a lot of it before it ever gets to me.

1018
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,800
Well, you know, I'm not really...

1019
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,400
That's how I know he's magic.

1020
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,560
I'm not really resentful of that, you know, because I always hear...

1021
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,560
I hear Reverend Shuler, and I hear...

1022
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,700
I used to hear that guy...

1023
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,240
What's the guy who makes it with all the whores?

1024
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:01,960
Oh.

1025
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:02,840
Swagger.

1026
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,260
Swagger.

1027
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,100
Oh, yeah.

1028
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,860
I've heard him, you know, I've always heard him, you know,

1029
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:11,540
talking about money that I needed for Jesus to continue the good works of Jesus.

1030
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,440
And the money never goes to Jesus.

1031
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:14,860
Jesus.

1032
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:15,180
Jesus.

1033
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,300
Jesus.

1034
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,840
He always seems to go directly to those guys.

1035
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:26,660
You, at least, are very honest, and your all holy of holies receives the money directly.

1036
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,200
Oh, that's right.

1037
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:33,740
Well, of course, a lot of it goes to the home for slackless children and the radio outreach and all these...

1038
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,480
Radio outreach.

1039
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,020
The home for wayward girls and so forth.

1040
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,500
Home for wayward girls, which I believe is one of your specialties, isn't it?

1041
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,980
Well, we're trying to keep up with the Koresh's.

1042
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:45,740
You might say.

1043
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,320
Well, that's not bad.

1044
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,740
You are, you, of course, are owners of Hotel 666's.

1045
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,240
We're trying to buy into that.

1046
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,860
That's not a bad...

1047
00:57:54,860 --> 00:58:01,220
Give us the post office box, too, as you send your offerings to J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1048
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,680
All right.

1049
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,360
That sacred post office box number is 1-4-0-3-0-6.

1050
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,700
1-4-0-3-0-6.

1051
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,060
In Dallas, Texas.

1052
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,540
Is there something about...

1053
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,520
Write down those numbers.

1054
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,340
Let me see if I can...

1055
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,700
You know there is a hidden message, friends.

1056
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:25,760
1-4-0-3-0-6.

1057
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,600
I will tell you in just a moment, my friends.

1058
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,860
When you take 4 and 3, add them together, it makes 7.

1059
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,860
Take the 1 in front, take it away, and it makes 6.

1060
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:44,420
Take the 3 and the 1.

1061
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,320
They make 4.

1062
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:53,260
Take from that 4, take the two 0s that are in that, and count them as 2.

1063
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,760
Add that to the 4.

1064
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,440
It gives you another 6.

1065
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,060
Again, my friends, you end up with...

1066
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,300
Ronald Reagan's street address.

1067
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,120
6-6.

1068
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:12,100
You see how, if you study these religions the way I have, you can always find the veil of secrecy.

1069
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:12,940
Downey.

1070
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,160
E Pluribus Una.

1071
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:15,540
Here we go.

1072
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,540
I really like it now.

1073
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,220
I cannot tell you how.

1074
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,840
I'm doing this for I.

1075
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,660
I've paid my money so much.

1076
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,520
They make up me, make me easy, send your women a ride.

1077
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:35,700
They make up me, make me easy, send your women a ride.

1078
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,900
Rosie the Riddler taught us how to act.

1079
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,620
We must take up our work.

1080
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,080
You bring on...

1081
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,100
Our slack.

1082
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,580
It's the vibes that we love.

1083
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,100
The dicks can shrivel up.

1084
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,860
We licked wash in 92.

1085
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,060
No time to see if slick Willie will do.

1086
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,840
The job that he promised.

1087
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:05,600
Sure, he was slick enough to get in.

1088
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,600
But Willie stayed hard enough to do the job.

1089
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,600
Woo!

1090
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,500
Woo!

1091
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,280
Woo!

1092
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,720
We kind of like Bob Woods.

1093
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:33,100
Bob, if you can hear me now, I'm sending out a message to you.

1094
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,700
It's an unidentified flying object.

1095
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,540
You'll play to know what you really think.

1096
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,520
Yeah.

1097
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,020
Woo!

1098
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,220
Woo!

1099
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:45,320


1100
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:45,320


1101
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:51,660
I want the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

1102
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:58,840
I want my ad man, don't want no blue sad man. I want my phone.

1103
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:07,000
I'll give my job and work to jerk you off.

1104
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:18,060
It's not pornography, officer. Oh, contraire. It's empowerment.

1105
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,820
Well, I never.

1106
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,400
I've never seen her do that before.

1107
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:42,240
I don't know.

1108
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:46,100
Damn, give her a beat and just lick her up a bit.

1109
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,720
Praise Bob and Al Cunnery.

1110
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,580
Al Cunnery.

1111
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,780
I'll be your Bob. I'll build you an empire.

1112
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,460
Yes, I bet you would.

1113
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,080
I'll take ten dollars. Ten dollars and three cents.
