2
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,020
I want to talk to you.

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,220
Hey, punk.

4
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,120
When I get out of here, I'm going to tell you who I know.

5
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,960
So he's our boss.

6
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,300
I'd like a receipt for that.

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,780
Yeah, me too.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,060
I'm feeling my angel.

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm feeling my angel.

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,260
I want you back.

11
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,720
I want you back.

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,640
I want you back again.

13
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,280
Thank you.

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,180
Thank you.

15
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,160
Thank you.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,060
Thank you.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,860
Thank you.

18
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:29,260
Tonight, we're here to pay tribute to an actor, an author, director, humanitarian,

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,200
and incomparable showbiz whore.

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,500
I'm talking, of course, about Bob.

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,980
You are now about to witness the strength of Bob.

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,540
Bob the comic, ladies.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,580
Let's bring him back out.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,000
He's rolling with Bob.

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,240
He's rolling with Bob.

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,840
He's rolling with Bob.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,220
He's rolling with Bob.

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,520
He's rolling with Bob.

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,740
Hey.

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,380
Hey.

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,860
Bob.

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,560
Oh!

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,980
Your dick is so big!

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,180
Hi.

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,440
My name is what?

36
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,640
My name is what?

37
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,620
My name is...

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,260
Bob.

39
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,940
Come on, Grandpa.

40
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,420
We want to watch Terrence and Phillip.

41
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,840
No, we're going to watch the Bob show.

42
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,180
Hi.

43
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,120
My name is what?

44
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,120
My name is...

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,320
Hi.

46
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,220
My name is...

47
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:09,920
Bob.

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
The luckiest man and the worst entertainer in the history of show business.

49
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,180
He's a huge asshole and one of my best friends.

50
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,480
Bob!

51
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,260
If you got the slack running through your face, who you gonna call?

52
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,540
Bob Dobbs.

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,200
If you got some frub...

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,660
And it does look good.

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,920
What you gonna do?

56
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,740
Praise Bob!

57
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,700
If you got the slack running through your face, who you gonna call?

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,000
Bob Dobbs.

59
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,840
If you got some frub...

60
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,080
And it does look good.

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
What you gonna do?

62
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,320
Praise Bob!

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,420
From BR News in Washington.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,180
I'm reacting today to the deadly building process.

65
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,780
The White House is approaching Earth.

66
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,040
President Obama few gigs, as long as it takes.

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,160
President Obama spoke and promised...

68
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,500
There are businesses who will need our continued love and attention.

69
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,820
Obama notes that bad PR news continues to rumble through much of the country.

70
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:29,780
On Wall Street, 415385, a large asteroid is fighting a charge of premeditated murder in the shooting death of his girlfriend on Valentine's Day.

71
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,040
Officially named PR News, this asteroid makes others pale in Puerto Rico.

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,980
The IRS says that it has destroyed PR News.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,380
They were not motivated by proper management.

74
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:58,520
Friends, this is one really unusual hour of slack in that it is a single, excellent, professional recording by Regis Sedlock of a single, excellent, subgenius defival.

75
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,900
Beware.

76
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,100
well, excellent by our standards.

77
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,620
It's the subgenius revival at Starwood of 1998

78
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,220
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

79
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,200
a real classic that I kind of forgot about

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,920
because after I heard the recording,

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,840
I thought we could make an album out of it.

82
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,620
So I treated it special and didn't use it on the Hour of Slack

83
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,160
and even spent money trying to sweeten it,

84
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,980
which all turned out to be a mistake

85
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,640
because nobody else really seemed to be interested in an album.

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,720
So it's been on a shelf for 15 years,

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,620
and yet it's probably the best recorded of any of our shows.

88
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,680
And it has the band ESO, or Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

89
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,220
in their prime revival phase.

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,500
It was recorded two weeks after X Day of 1998,

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,180
what the world calls 1998, that is,

92
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,140
at the 18th Starwood Festival, July 25th.

93
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,580
Now, there is a song by Chaz Smith,

94
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,760
about halfway through,

95
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,400
the revival that cannot be played

96
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,160
on most broadcast radio in the USA.

97
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,640
I can't even say the title of it,

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,300
which is also the chorus.

99
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,420
So if I tried to air it on anything but the Internet,

100
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,300
it would be a mass of bleeps.

101
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,420
And I'm already having to edit an awful lot of cussing from this.

102
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,960
Internet listeners will hear the complete show,

103
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,800
but for broadcast radio listeners,

104
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,760
we'll have to fill in the missing time

105
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,920
with some material recorded at a later show,

106
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,880
which we will play at the end,

107
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,000
because it's not quite as good.

108
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,880
Also, it rips off the doors most majorly.

109
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,400
And so then, let us now hide

110
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,380
to that high recording of that live revival in progress.

111
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,300
If your body's feeling bad

112
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,780
It's the only one you have

113
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,320
You wanna take her to the play

114
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,640
Or go a-walking in the rain

115
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,980
Watch the flowers go to bed

116
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,860
You wanna take her to the play

117
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,440
As the man inside the head

118
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,880
Spirit never have to leave

119
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,320
All you gotta do is believe

120
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,080
The faith, Peter!

121
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,380
The faith, Peter!

122
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,780
The faith, Peter!

123
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,640
The faith, Peter!

124
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,800
The faith, Peter!

125
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
The faith, Peter!

126
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,160
The faith, Peter!

127
00:06:59,860 --> 00:06:59,860


128
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,680
The faith, Peter!

129
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:01,680


130
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:01,680


131
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:01,680


132
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:01,680


133
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:01,680


134
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,140
You never have to leave

135
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,600
Your body's gonna start to feel

136
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,480
The finger drifts settled in fire

137
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Everlasting sweet desire

138
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,220
If you matter what the doctors say

139
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,420
Feel a man, you steal away

140
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,800
Immortality for two

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,380
Miracles, they come for you

142
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,840
Feel a man, you steal away

143
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,560
The Faith Viva!

144
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,040
Oh my friends, oh my God, I know you need it!

145
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,960
I know you've got to have it and you're gonna get it!

146
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,220
Can I put my hands on you?

147
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,640
Yes! We want to put our hands right on you!

148
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,400
One at a time!

149
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,860
But we just can't do that!

150
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,360
Faith and hope and charity

151
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,320
Simple relativity

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,340
He can make you understand

153
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,680
All you gotta do is take his hand

154
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,180
Remember what Ivan says

155
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,200
You can't do that!

156
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,500
As the man inside the head

157
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,000
Finger drifts and holds his fire

158
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,240
Everlasting sweet desire

159
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,380
The Faith Viva!

160
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,100
He is here! You can never escape the eyes!

161
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,960
The eyes of Bob watch you wherever you go!

162
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,920
Can I put my hands on you?

163
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,640
Can I put my hands on you?

164
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,680
He can make you understand

165
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,080
All you gotta do is take his hand

166
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,200
Remember what Ivan says

167
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,900
He can make you understand

168
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:04,900


169
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,320
Everlasting sweet desire

170
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,600
The Faith Viva!

171
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,520
Can I put my hands on you?

172
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,780
Can I put my hands on you?

173
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,020
Can I put my hands on you?

174
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,300
Can I put my hands on you?

175
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:52,260
Can I put my hands on you?

176
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,500
Can I put my hands on you?

177
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,820
Can I put my hands on you?

178
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Can I put my hands on you?

179
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,200
Welcome to the revival, that was Ivan Stang!

180
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,240
Praise him up!

181
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,220
Let's get right to it, I want to hear a moment of sacred noise!

182
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,960
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

183
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,080
Praise goddamn Bob!

184
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,220
Oh, and the fucking Bob too, we'll praise all of the Bobs.

185
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,680
Friends, I wasn't supposed to be here today.

186
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,400
I was planning, like every other subgenius,

187
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,220
to be on the escape vessels of the sex world,

188
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,860
the sex goddesses.

189
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,380
Don't interrupt, I know, maybe we are on them.

190
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,160
There are 180 excuses for ex-day on the internet already.

191
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,560
Personally, I believe that Occam's razor usually,

192
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,640
which says that the simplest explanation is usually the best,

193
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,540
Bob fucked up.

194
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,660
I know, I know that it's hard to imagine

195
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,060
that a holy man like J.R. Bob Dobbs

196
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,880
would lie or fuck up.

197
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,220
I know, can't believe that Bob would fuck up,

198
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,200
but that may be it, maybe that's what happened,

199
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,920
maybe that's why the exes didn't arrive two weeks ago on ex-day.

200
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,680
I'm not going to explain any of that to you,

201
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
you can pick it up from context.

202
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,540
But friends, you know, remember that little nutty religious cult

203
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,480
in Garland, Texas?

204
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,540
The God Salvation Temple, poor little teacher Chen,

205
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,520
they were from Taiwan.

206
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,080
You've heard about them, I'm sure.

207
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,660
They actually, that silly end of the world cult,

208
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,140
was right down the street from where our skyscraper office is,

209
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,640
really is.

210
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,520
And they had been predicting that the world would end March 31st,

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
I think God was going to be on TV and so forth,

212
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,840
and those poor silly cultists, duh, they were so wrong,

213
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,620
and the media laughed at them and made fun of them.

214
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,140
Friends, I remember standing on this very stage six months ago

215
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,440
saying,

216
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,640
well, we don't have to worry about being like those idiots now,

217
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,420
do we, and friends,

218
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,380
two weeks ago, we did the countdown,

219
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,740
at 7 a.m., the exes, the aliens did not show up.

220
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,520
I'll admit it.

221
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,920
They took it out on me.

222
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,440
People don't believe in Bob, they have to, you know, kill the messenger.

223
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,480
So they stripped me down and tarred and feathered me,

224
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,340
poured motor oil and feathers over me,

225
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,100
threw me in that pond down there.

226
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,040
Friend, did you ever have that nightmare?

227
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,080
Where you dream that you're slugging through the mud

228
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,720
and you're naked and everybody's laughing at you?

229
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,960
Well, the next time I have that nightmare,

230
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,800
it'll just bring back fond memories of a fun party, dear friends.

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,380
And I'll tell you something.

232
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,580
Sure, our prophecy may not have come true.

233
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,500
Maybe Bob fucked up that one time.

234
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,680
But you know what?

235
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,000
We're religious nuts!

236
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,560
We don't care if Bob could fuck up a hundred times!

237
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,900
And we'd still show up here at Brushwood

238
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,040
waiting for those blind saucers and having a hell of a party.

239
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,460
Did the Jehovah's Witnesses stop coming to your door

240
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,260
just because their world didn't end every time?

241
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,080
Last time I noticed, they were still at my door.

242
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,720
Well, are we gonna let the Jehovah's Witnesses

243
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,500
be bigger religious nuts than us?

244
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:37,940
Say no!

245
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,420
We are the biggest religious fanatics in the world!

246
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,540
And we will wipe out all other religious fanatics!

247
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,220
But, friends, I guess what that brings us to,

248
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,740
I'm afraid that, now of course there are many pro-visos

249
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,580
for why Bob's prophecy might not work out

250
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,420
if you read the fine print in Revelation X.

251
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,440
But what I think people forget is that, you know,

252
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,340
we can make up all these excuses why we aren't on the saucers

253
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,520
of why Bob's prophecy didn't work out.

254
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,580
But maybe some of you did not read the very first sentence

255
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,100
at the very top of the first pamphlet number one

256
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,880
printed in 1979 in Dallas, Texas.

257
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,340
And I don't mean where it says one dollar, friends.

258
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,920
At the very beginning of the very first pamphlet.

259
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,560
Does it say the world ends July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.?

260
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,060
No, friends.

261
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,400
It says the world ends tomorrow!

262
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,860
Tomorrow!

263
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,540
And you may die!

264
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,180
In fact, I promise that every single person here will die!

265
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,920
Now, are you living your life as if it was the last day on earth?

266
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,460
Some of you may be!

267
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,480
Some of you probably are living your life like it's the last day on earth.

268
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,820
How many of you are living your life as if you've got all the time in the world?

269
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,340
Well, that's just as good!

270
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,720
Friends, the point is, you know, sure,

271
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,480
Bob Dobbs may have fucked up,

272
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,180
but what does that say about all those other religious leaders?

273
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,900
I mean, if Bob's gonna fuck up, what does that say about...

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,880
Well, I don't want to name names.

275
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,020
Jesus, uh, I'm tired of bad-mouthed Jesus,

276
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,840
because he works for me now.

277
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,540
Couldn't be here to send his blessings to everyone.

278
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,720
But seriously, friends, obviously there was,

279
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,640
and I've been saying this to subgeniuses for a while now,

280
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,320
the mystery of X-Day may in fact be an important lesson

281
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,940
that many subgeniuses desperately needed to learn.

282
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,960
That lesson might be,

283
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,120
don't believe everything you read.

284
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,240
And don't depend on Bob!

285
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,940
That was his whole point!

286
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,600
He does not want a bunch of cripples leaning on him!

287
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,700
He's trying to get you, it's like,

288
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,980
okay, you depended on a holy man, he fucked up.

289
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,700
So what are you gonna do about your escaped vessels now?

290
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,860
I think the message is,

291
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,660
build your own ship!

292
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,040
That's what I...

293
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,460
The X's may show up, uh, in 350 days,

294
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,280
uh, dos X's, X-Day 1999,

295
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,400
like Nostradamus said.

296
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,880
But we can't depend on that!

297
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,160
All of those holy men may be liars and cheaters.

298
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,500
Even Bob!

299
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,920
So therefore, are we gonna sit on our asses

300
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,420
and pray for some benevolent aliens to come down and save our butts?

301
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:48,700
No!

302
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,800
Build your own ship!

303
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,500
And while we're working on that,

304
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,820
if you think about it, we're on our own ship right now.

305
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,820
Unfortunately, we're all on the same ship,

306
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,480
and it is badly in need of repairs!

307
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,340
So let's work on the spaceship that we're riding on right now!

308
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,280
Get the motherfucker fixed up!

309
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,780
And then, we shall conquer the universe!

310
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,480
Praise Bob!

311
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,840
But, of course, the conspiracy...

312
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,140
Say, boys...

313
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,640
Maybe we could do some, uh, scary music.

314
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,240
Yeah.

315
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,360
Do you guys know how to play any scary...

316
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,980
We'll work on it right now.

317
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,260
Okay.

318
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,820
Um...

319
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,400
Now, speaking of wishful thinking...

320
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,560
Yeah.

321
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,560
The, uh...

322
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,640
I'd like to share with you something called the keys of magic.

323
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,620
There are a lot of people here that call themselves magicians, right?

324
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,400
I mean, well, maybe they're all the humorless ones that stay away from these.

325
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,880
I don't know.

326
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,740
But, um, you know, I, uh...

327
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:04,520
Certainly, magic is real, but judging by its practitioners,

328
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,840
sometimes I think belief in it maybe defeats the purpose.

329
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,840
And, uh...

330
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,880
You know, we...

331
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:21,280
There, there are a lot of, uh, subgeniuses that are sort of, uh, pathetic and sad and

332
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,760
disgusting and...

333
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,520
But they're not nearly as bad as the Scientologists.

334
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,320
I got hold of the most expensive Scientology newsletter.

335
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,580
The cheaper Scientology newsletters aren't too badly written.

336
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,420
I've ripped them off myself quite a bit.

337
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,540
The ones that you get in the...

338
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:46,420
If you're a $15,000 a year Scientologist are written like Dick and Jane books, uh, for

339
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,260
first graders.

340
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,960
Because that's the kind of person that will spend $15,000 a year on Sci...

341
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,340
On Scientology.

342
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,160
Now, a typical testimonial from the most well-trained Scientologists went like this.

343
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,440
I have a fa...

344
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,260
I had a fancy bicycle that I kept in my garage.

345
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,200
One day, someone stole it.

346
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,180
Using the techniques I learned from Scientology, I drove around my neighborhood and found my

347
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,600
bike.

348
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,800
Praise L. Ron Hubbard.

349
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,380
Now, friends, that guy spent $15,000 to find out what I'm about to tell you for free!

350
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,140
That guy was using one of King Bob Solomon's keys to magic.

351
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,540
The first key!

352
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,960
And there's only four of them.

353
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,060
They're very easy to remember.

354
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,800
The first key to subgenius magic?

355
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,240
Get off your ass.

356
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,180
You wanted a girlfriend?

357
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,240
Talk to a girl.

358
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,080
You hate your job?

359
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,640
Quit your job and get a new one.

360
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,860
Just get off your ass.

361
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,080
That's the very first step, the first key to magic.

362
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,000
Number two key to subgenius magic is bust your ass.

363
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,680
Number three key of subgenius magic is get others to bust their asses for you, which

364
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,400
we call ass...

365
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,380
I guess we call that assholism.

366
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,220
And, uh, there's a lot of people out there who are doing that.

367
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,220


368
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,220


369
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,220


370
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,220


371
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,220


372
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,220


373
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,720
The fourth key, watch your ass.

374
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
And if you watch your ass, no one will kick your...

375
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,580
Oh, wait!

376
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,140
There is, in fact, a fifth key to magic, more important than any of those others, brought

377
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,040
to us by the great Saint Red Fox.

378
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,120
And that is not watch your ass, but, friends, wash your ass.

379
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,860
That will get you further.

380
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,600
In some cases, some of you lonely people, you'd be surprised what a little effort at

381
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,600
personal hygiene would do for you in your life.

382
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,580
Now, we all, uh, we're always, you know, talking about slack.

383
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,520
This is the church of the subgeniuses devoted...

384
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,140
Of course, everyone knows it's Bob and he teaches slack.

385
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,240
Well, what is this slack stuff, you say?

386
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,420
And you go, oh, I know slack isn't that conspiracy bullshit where life is a Miller Beer commercial

387
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,220
and every...

388
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,840
You have slack if you just drank a 12-pack.

389
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,580
Your team just drank a 12-pack.

390
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,560
You just won and all the girls around you look like MTV bimbos and all the guys are

391
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,400
buff jock assholes.

392
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,740
And then that's really slack.

393
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,880
Well, we know that's bullshit.

394
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,460
Then you go back to your stinking job the next day and that's...

395
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,940
Well, we know better than that.

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,500
But some of us go, yeah, man, like slack.

397
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,700
That means like, uh, what Beavis and Butthead do, right?

398
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,560
You like get stoned, watch TV, and eat all day, right?

399
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,620
Sure!

400
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,020
That may be slack for you, but being cheated out of your life by the conspiracy may be

401
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,800
your idea of slack.

402
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,740
The difference between us and them is we won't tell you what it is because it's different

403
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,000
for every fucking one of you.

404
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,500
And if we could bottle it and sell it, we would be the conspiracy and it would be up

405
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,760
to you to kill me now.

406
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,620
I am not bottling and selling it.

407
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,260
In fact, if you come up to me after this and say, Reverend Stang, I saw your show, I paid

408
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,580
money, but I didn't get slack, I would have to say, sir, you will never get slack because

409
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,880
you will never be able to understand Bob's message.

410
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,000
You have to make the slack work.

411
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,280
Slack yourself.

412
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,740
Build your own ship.

413
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,180
And here's the point, friends.

414
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,340
Slack is not necessarily laziness.

415
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,000
There are some of us, we call ourselves the emergent tile subgeniuses as opposed to the

416
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,300
rewardians.

417
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:27,240
I love the rewardians, friends, but some of us, some of us get slack when we are working

418
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,340
so intensely hard at what we wanted to do.

419
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
Not the slave labor, but what we wanted to do.

420
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,060
That you get so into it that you may go without sleep for days.

421
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,340
You may even go without drugs for days.

422
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,280
You may, you just develop this concentration, right?

423
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,440
You're flying, you're in the zone, you're cruising on what you're doing, you're really

424
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,420
into it, and suddenly you become sort of more smart for a second.

425
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:01,980
And you realize that you are God, life really is incredible, an amazing miracle, and you

426
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,460
know, the rust streaks on the side of your car are prettier than anything hanging in

427
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,560
an art museum, and life really is more psychedelic than that old t-shirt that you can't fit into

428
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,000
anymore.

429
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,500
Now, hold that thought!

430
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,640
Hard to do.

431
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,680
Because the conspiracy has a secret weapon, friends.

432
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,960
The conspiracy has this invisible monster.

433
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:42,220
Now, polls have been done that indicate that 87% of Americans, this is just in America,

434
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:48,420
really believe that there is an invisible giant monster in the sky that will do favors

435
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,420
for you if you kiss its ass enough, and will curse your enemies if you kiss its ass enough,

436
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:53,820
basically.

437
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:01,940
Now, friends, I, just because there doesn't happen to be an invisible monster there, I'm

438
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:01,940


439
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:01,940


440
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,540
going to say this, as long as 87% of the dumbasses believe in it, we still have to deal with

441
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:08,800
it!

442
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,640
And that is why we, the Church of the Subgenius, have decided, now friends, this is kind of

443
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,020
harsh, but we have decided to declare war on God!

444
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,640
War on God, like Jason and the Argonauts planned!

445
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,940
My God, we shall, because what kind of a God is it that is so weak that it can't be destroyed?

446
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:31,940


447
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,420
That it's so weak and so pathetic that it has to be defended by illiterate little old

448
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,420
redneck ladies against assholes like me?

449
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,780
That is a sick God!

450
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,460
I can do better with a piece of clip art than those idiots can do with their so-called God.

451
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Do they have a photograph of him?

452
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,400
Hell, they don't even have clip art.

453
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,780
So.

454
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,320
Friends.

455
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,580
If you've obviously, we're no different from all the other religions.

456
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,020
It's not really that we love Bob all that much, it's that we love the idea of everybody

457
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,640
else burning in hell forever!

458
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,160
That's what religion's really all about!

459
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,220
Oh, yes!

460
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:23,620
And friends, we here as subgeniuses, looking around at each other, hell, you may look at

461
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,340
the next one over and go, God, I don't want to be stuck on a spaceship with that nerd.

462
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,820
Friends!

463
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,340
It's true!

464
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,520
Most of us actually have nothing in common, except that we have nothing in common with

465
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,700
the conspiracy of the normals!

466
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,960
And, you know, sure, I'll admit, maybe we're kind of queer for Bob.

467
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm queer for Bob, but it's, and this is something many of you may have wondered about.

468
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,920
Yes, many of us in the hierarchy of the church of the subgenius are bisexuals.

469
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,300
That means, when you go back there and bust a hole in the ground, you're a bisexual!

470
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,300


471
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,880
And if you buy our shit, we come!

472
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,080
You buy, we come!

473
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,040
Thanks, Bob!

474
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,500
Thank you!

475
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,100
Or Bob, Bob, wherever.

476
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,580
So friends, you know, what, and what we're offering is the same thing everybody else

477
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,880
offers, something for nothing.

478
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,380
But, think about it, money, you know, money, your money, we're getting money from you,

479
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,500
well, what is money really worth?

480
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,620
Ask Elvis Presley, or Michael Jackson, or Madonna.

481
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's meaningless to them, you know?

482
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,320
But what they wouldn't give for some slack!

483
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,140
Slack!

484
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,960
Man, now that is something!

485
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,560
Money is nothing but slack!

486
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,860
Slack is something!

487
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,580
And friends, slack is what you need!

488
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,280
Now, there are many people here who are thinking, man, Reverend Stang, that's easy for you to

489
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,120
say, you get paid to preach to drunks in nightclubs.

490
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,340
But, believe me, I know how it's like.

491
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,580
Some of you here are funny looking.

492
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:10,800
Some people here are what you might say, too fat, or too skinny, or have bad teeth, or

493
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,080
have a mental impairment of some kind, some physical problems.

494
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,680
Some of you may just simply be socially awkward, clumsy, not a people person, not a team player.

495
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,500
I know because I have been all of those things and hope to be all of them again all at once

496
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,920
someday.

497
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:37,040
But, and in your case, many of you may have become so accustomed to solitude that you

498
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,720
don't really, you know, you don't need an encounter group, support group for fucking

499
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,640
weirdos and Trekkies that read too much.

500
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,200
You really just, you don't care about your fellow subgeniuses all that much.

501
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,260
You really just want to be left alone.

502
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,660
And here's the miracle of the Church of the Subgenius, friends!

503
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,480
You can be alone!

504
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:57,780
Be alone!

505
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,360
With Bob!

506
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,520
You think about it!

507
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,820
Every other personal savior, though they don't, they don't, being a short duration personal

508
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,220
savior isn't good enough for them.

509
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,860
They've got to be your only personal savior and they're always leaning over your shoulder,

510
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,640
questioning, were you cool enough today?

511
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,120
Did you make enough money today?

512
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,380
Did you, did you kiss my ass and pray enough today?

513
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,800
Friends!

514
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,180
Bob Dobbs does not give a shit about any of that stuff!

515
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,500
Not at all!

516
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,700
He does not care about your sins because he is not equipped to forgive your sins.

517
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,600
He doesn't think you need to be forgiven.

518
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,260
All you ever needed was an excuse!

519
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:46,800
Bob brings no forgiveness, but he brings the greatest excuse and that excuse is Bob!

520
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,720
Praise Bob!

521
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,540
Praise Bob!

522
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,080
Yai, yai, yai, yai, yai!

523
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,360
Whoo!

524
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,780
And friends, that's why we should be doing this.

525
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


526
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


527
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:55,780


528
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,600
We say, sure we may be drunk or neurotic, brain damaged, fucked up, funny looking,

529
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,460
but we've got Bob and they don't!

530
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,860
And for that we can hate them!

531
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,620
Hate them!

532
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,260
Hate!

533
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:07,920
Hate!

534
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,420
Hate!

535
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,040
Hate!

536
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:09,960
Hate!

537
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:10,800
Hate!

538
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,880
Hate!

539
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,100
Pretty good!

540
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,400
Cool, man!

541
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,820
I dig the vibes!

542
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,740
Drink the Kool-Aid, children!

543
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,460
All right!

544
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:25,760
We're going to drink to the Kool-Aid!

545
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:25,760


546
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:25,760


547
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:25,760


548
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:25,760


549
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:25,760


550
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,340
I got 300 people to chant hate at Starwood.

551
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,060
That's not bad.

552
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,180
Two weeks ago we had 400 people line up to drink Kool-Aid at 7 in the morning.

553
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,720
All of them at 7 o'clock.

554
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
We did the countdown.

555
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,020
Three, two, one.

556
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,780
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

557
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,580
And I had to prove that I could take a joke.

558
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,740
But friends, the slack is on.

559
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,720
The immune system is the cochlear implant.

560
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,040
How long do I keep my voice on?

561
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,040


562
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,040


563
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,340
Now we don't have any fake insensitivity.

564
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,140
We are walking into a maze.

565
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,140


566
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,020
We are feeling it condescendingly in this Brionne box.

567
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,020


568
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,900
You want to know what theseÑ‚Ð°place messages are about?

569
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,720
You want to know what this life is all about?

570
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,640
my slack and I'm willing

571
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,860
to wait another, if I have to

572
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,460
goddammit, I'll wait another

573
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,580
350 days and that

574
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,420
brings me to a very important point

575
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,440
my friends, you may be

576
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,660
fucked up, ugly, poor and broken

577
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,080
hopeless, but

578
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,580
you probably only need to hang

579
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,560
in there for one more year

580
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,540
surely Bob and the

581
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,360
escape vessels will be here in a year

582
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,800
so that's all you have to do

583
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,660
for slack, you're not

584
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,160
going to be able to defeat the conspiracy

585
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,520
on your own, and the whole church of the

586
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
subgenius, not this

587
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,560
year I don't think, but

588
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,540
every little

589
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,440
decision you make is part

590
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,480
of the termite digging away

591
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,340
at the foundations, tying

592
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,480
together the shoelaces of the colossus

593
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,720
and

594
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,120
as much as

595
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,440
it would do the church

596
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,540
a lot of good financially with publicity

597
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,520
like everybody here

598
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,160
would commit suicide

599
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,800
while wearing a Bob t-shirt

600
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,000
or if you do what you always wanted to do

601
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,200
take that machine gun to a McDonald's

602
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,180
full of school children

603
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,200
don't do it friends, as much

604
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
as that would help

605
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,960
our church

606
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,300
don't do it, don't go postal

607
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,720
don't kill them

608
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,980
and don't kill yourself

609
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,980
that's all you have to do

610
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,640
that's all you have to do friends, is stay alive

611
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,960
for another 350 days

612
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,020
that is the message

613
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,920
that's more important than getting

614
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,380
your idea of slack

615
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,300
it's more important than quitting your job

616
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,940
it's more important than any of the other things

617
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,900
just hang in there a little bit longer

618
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,880
you don't know what the future

619
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,520
may hold

620
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,040
it sure as fuck surprised me several times

621
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,480
over

622
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,960
so friends

623
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,920
you know how it is

624
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,540
we all look around and say

625
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,860
beam me up

626
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,040
Scotty, there's no intelligent life

627
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,000
down here, well

628
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,680
if only that were

629
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:22,780
true

630
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,920
if only intelligence had not developed

631
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,180
the direction it went in

632
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,460
that's why we call it church of the subgenius

633
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,520
Bob taught that it's not

634
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,760
the intelligence that counts

635
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,200
they've measured that all wrong

636
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,400
it's sense

637
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,560
common sense

638
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,520
sense of humor helps a little bit

639
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,860
and friends I hate to say it

640
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,700
but dollars and cents

641
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,160
corny as that may be

642
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,200
but

643
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,080
Bob gives you, and what do you get in return for that

644
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,660
a dollar and cents

645
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,660


646
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,080
despite grown and old

647
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,320
and paying Compton

648
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,320


649
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,320


650
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,180
I can't wait to get back down to the

651
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,680
they're only instance

652
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,460
to hook up

653
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:21,460


654
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:21,640
they put their money

655
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:21,640


656
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:21,640


657
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,660
but I don't want to fail

658
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,620
next year. Like I say, we should work on our own ships.

659
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,220
We test-fired our first rockets at X-Day.

660
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,100
Stank, you had built a cardboard and wooden vessel, as a matter of fact,

661
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,020
in the backyard of your house, and three men came by to interview you, and you were very rude to them,

662
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,160
as a matter of fact. No, that was those guys in Garland, that Chinese cult.

663
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,080
You said you had also built one of your own, made of twine

664
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,000
and pieces of cheese. Well, anyway, friends.

665
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,960
No, it was scotch tape and pieces of

666
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,460
Velveeta cheese.

667
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,480
No, really, we've sat there, and you know, when you're out in space,

668
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,940
you look down, and it's really not

669
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,540
that big, you know. You really do see that spaceship down there, and

670
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,900
it is just a balloon. It's like that, have you ever filled up a balloon

671
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,220
with the very last hit of nitrous in the canister?

672
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,920
And it pops. Well, you lost what was inside that balloon.

673
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,920
What if you were what was inside the balloon that had to pop?

674
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,300
Well, you tell the story better than I do, what it's like when you look down.

675
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,720
Actually, I wrote a song about it.

676
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,920
Well, I didn't want you to sing a song. I think they should sing the song.

677
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,940
You want them to sing the song? I think they should help.

678
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,740
Friends, you know, because you're out there,

679
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,160
you're looking down at this polluted little

680
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,560
planet, and you're like going, well, it's not that big,

681
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,380
but goddamn, every book I ever read, every

682
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,860
comic book, every cool, cheap monster movie, every

683
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,860
friend, every record I ever listened to, they were all made down there.

684
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,140
All the, every flower

685
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,060
that ever, every good burger was made on Earth.

686
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,280
And, you know,

687
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,260
Earth can be pretty fucked up. We tend to forget

688
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,020
how much of it's not fucked up.

689
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,420
And we also, more importantly, tend to forget how great it is to be fucked up.

690
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,920
If you know what I mean, I mean, nothing's perfect.

691
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:40,540
And the idea of perfection is just what they use to fuck you up, to make you think,

692
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,540
oh, if only I had perfect skin, then I'd have slack.

693
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,580
Oh, if only I looked like Whitney Houston, then I'd have, if only I could

694
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,240
fuck Whitney Houston, then I'd, if only I was Whitney Houston.

695
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,340
Friends, you just, you have to learn to value what you have.

696
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,040
You know, the slack really is there,

697
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,440
and they really are trying to distract you from it constantly.

698
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,980
But you've got to count your goddamn blessings, you know?

699
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,280
And that's the only way, that's why we say, why the only rule

700
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,160
in the Church of the Subgenius is, pardon my language, but,

701
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,680
fuck them if they can't take a joke.

702
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,820
Words to live by, and they really are words to live by, friends.

703
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,120
It's the only workable philosophy.

704
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:35,180
Because, if you let them get, if you let them make you take yourself too seriously,

705
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,440
they have you by the balls or the ovaries.

706
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,180
And they're just squeezing and yanking on them, tickling them a little bit.

707
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,100
But you try getting away from them, they'll yank that leash so hard,

708
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,560
you'll never forget that the conspiracy,

709
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,220
the conspiracy's got its claw up your butt.

710
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,460
And that's what Chaz wrote this little song about.

711
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,700
I forget how it starts.

712
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,240
I get up every morning

713
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,180
My life's in a jar

714
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,300
I drive very far

715
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,980
In my big fancy car

716
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,380
In this big fancy car

717
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,620
I come home every night

718
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,800
And sit and watch my TV

719
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,980
And sit and watch his TV

720
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,280
Somehow I never see

721
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,660
You think you'll never see

722
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,720
Cause my brain is asleep

723
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,960
Cause his brain is asleep

724
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,380
I walk down the street

725
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,840
But keep my eyes to the ground

726
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,100
Keep your eyes to the ground

727
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,360
I go round and round

728
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,420
Go round and round

729
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,640
Like a sad little clown

730
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,260
Like a sad little clown

731
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,280
And at the end of my life

732
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,780
I'm sure you know people like this

733
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,380
I finally see

734
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,600
We finally see

735
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,020
The world and my dreams

736
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,120
Those world and my dreams

737
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,400
Weren't at all what they seem

738
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,720
Weren't at all what they seem

739
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,600
Yeah, and when you're standing on the mountains on the moon,

740
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,440
you look back and there's the earth

741
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,980
just sort of hanging there in that space that's blacker than black,

742
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,720
and you look there and you got a lot of time to think about it

743
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,620
in those down times between picking up moon rocks and stuff like that,

744
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,300
and you look back and you go,

745
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,520
Oh, God, that's where everything started.

746
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,700
That's where all the stories you've ever heard were written,

747
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,920
all the songs that were ever sung were sung there,

748
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,160
all the people who ever lived, all the deeds that were ever done,

749
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,740
they all happened right there in that little blue,

750
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,500
that little blue and white marble hanging there.

751
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,380
And it looks so alone out there in space,

752
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,140
and as Eastern Africa comes swinging into view there,

753
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:58,060
I think, God, you know, that's where humans took their first bumbling little steps,

754
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,820
and it all becomes crystal clear.

755
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,540
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

756
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,740
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

757
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,580
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

758
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,380
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

759
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,580
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

760
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,800
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

761
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,020
Us and all our friends

762
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,460
Sing along.

763
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,100
Us and all our friends are so

764
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,560
Us and all our friends are so

765
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,780
Us and all our friends

766
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,960
Us and all our friends

767
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,940
Come on, it's like you mean it .

768
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,720
Sing it until you believe it

769
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,580
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

770
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,060
One more time.

771
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,660
Sing it loud.

772
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,640
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

773
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,800
And all our friends are so fucked up.

774
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,060
Um, I'm kind of fucked up.

775
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,760
I'm friends!

776
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,280
It's alright, you're allowed to fuck up that song.

777
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,700
You're allowed to fuck up the words of that song.

778
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,180
Build your own ship.

779
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,400
And in the meantime, X day is bound to happen sooner or later.

780
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,700
Every prediction will come true eventually.

781
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,560
And everything you ever wanted you will get for that 30 bucks.

782
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,240
Because in the urgent Carmina Jam,

783
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,920
you look at Book of Revelation, friends, or Revelation X, either one,

784
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,860
and you will see that there are signs in the heavens and signs in the earth.

785
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,040
Blood bunches from the earth.

786
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,240
The lights in the sky rebuke us.

787
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,620
There was a great X in the sky over this campground on X day 1998.

788
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,320
Perhaps that was a message in itself that they were going to X us out,

789
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,400
but only a little later.

790
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,520
Maybe the seven seals have not all come out from the circus tent

791
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,800
barking and juggling balls on the end of their noses.

792
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,560
We shall, when the seventh seal plays,

793
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,840
have a happy birthday on Little Hall.

794
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,440
And we shall be happy.

795
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,460
And friends, the plagues are on their way.

796
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,620
They've got some pretty cool plagues lined up too, man.

797
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,180
You're going to probably pay extra for some of the plagues,

798
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,540
and you'll be glad to do it.

799
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,160
You'll dig some of them.

800
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,740
Friends, the great winepress of God

801
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:39,860
shall crush the stupidity and the brilliance out of the vain human race.

802
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,520
And the great can opener from Jupiter,

803
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:48,460
shall come down and reap off the heads of the faithless and the unclean.

804
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,700
And a great orange squeezer shall likewise descend from the heavens

805
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,320
and crush and squeeze out the uncleanliness of the sin.

806
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,080
And a great comet shall fly through the sky,

807
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,760
comet toilet bowl cleanser.

808
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,560
And it shall cleanse out and swab out the degradation and the lack of faith in God.

809
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,580
Friends,

810
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,380
Bob's judgment will come like a rag doll covered with lemon pledge

811
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,380
and dust off the foul surface of this planet.

812
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,160
Someday, someday soon, friends,

813
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,120
the great vacuum cleaner from space

814
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,820
shall come and suck it all up.

815
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,980
And the bag shall be tossed in the garbage

816
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,420
with all the other once intelligent races

817
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,560
that committed the one unforgivable sin,

818
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,800
the one sin where you do it

819
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,000
while you're fucked up for good.

820
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,560
Pull the line.

821
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,340
Lever down you go.

822
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,840
My legs are on fire.

823
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,360
Preacher,

824
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:45,860
I,

825
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,340
my legs are on fire.

826
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,920
Praise Jainer.

827
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,720
But you see, friends,

828
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,140
there is that one unforgivable sin.

829
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,500
And that sin is the sin of not sending in your $30 for a subgenius membership

830
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,060
so that you too can be one of the same.

831
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,220
That is the one sin that Bob cannot forgive.

832
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,100
Because how do you show your faith in Bob, friends?

833
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,540
Do you give him the thing which is most important?

834
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,560
The thing which is most meaningless to you?

835
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,480
Your children?

836
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,880
Or your car?

837
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,240
No, you give him what is most valuable.

838
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,160
Your money.

839
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,380
He doesn't need the money,

840
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,340
but he needs to know that you believe.

841
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,700
Maybe the reason the exes didn't show up

842
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,040
was because the soul that Bob sold him

843
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,740
just wasn't good enough.

844
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,440
It was bad soul.

845
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,260
It was stepped on soul.

846
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,060
It was cut with the souls of humans.

847
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,260
And friends, that means between now

848
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,080
and the next time the exes arrive,

849
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,520
we have to brew a better breed of soul.

850
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,520
We must have better Bobbies, more Bobbies,

851
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:52,700
and more money to totally destroy the conspiracy built on money.

852
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,260
It's going to take a lot of money, and you're going to have to help.

853
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:55,720
Praise Bob.

854
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,880
And you can't hide from Bob.

855
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,440
You cannot hide from that man, Bob.

856
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,160
He will follow you, and he will not tell you anything.

857
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,200
He will not tell you what to do.

858
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,120
He will not tell you what slack is.

859
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,500
You will have to make your own slack, friends,

860
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,480
because Bob himself will tell you,

861
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,000
if you ask him, that Bob is not the answer,

862
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,500
and neither is anything else.

863
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,400
You have to learn to think for yourself,

864
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,160
but only Bob can show you how.

865
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,300
What we've been trying to get through your head all this time,

866
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,980
question authority.

867
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Question authority or else!

868
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,800
Friends, I want to build...

869
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,620
Hey, hold on a second.

870
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,440
I think it's about time to...

871
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,020
We're talking real big about declaring war on God and all that shit,

872
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,480
and this is some great, inspiring music.

873
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,680
Regis, be ready.

874
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,200
Not yet.

875
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,620
Not yet.

876
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,120
But friends, three of you have heard this before,

877
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,960
but the great sage, Ronald Reagan,

878
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,560
who is probably closer to Bob now than he ever was,

879
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,640
once said to the premier of Russia,

880
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,020
and I paraphrase, I don't have the exact quote,

881
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,700
but this was something he addressed to the Russians.

882
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,660
He said, you know, if aliens from outer space were to invade our planet,

883
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,440
why, all our nations would forget our differences

884
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,040
and we'd all band together.

885
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,860
And of course, even while Reagan was saying this,

886
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,680
he was traitorously selling out this planet to the Greys,

887
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,700
those pipsqueak little dipshit aliens.

888
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,120
Sorry if that offends any of you, but the Greys suck.

889
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,960
I don't even fucking believe in the Greys.

890
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,960
That's how much they suck.

891
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,560
They make spaceships that crash.

892
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:12,480
Our alien allies do not even need spaceships.

893
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,820
They do not need spaceships any more than Bob needs brains.

894
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,780
Soon, eventually, sooner or later, we will have our escape vessels,

895
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,380
even if we have to build them ourselves.

896
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,460
We'll have our own fleets of battle planets.

897
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,260
And the universe will eventually be open to us.

898
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,940
It'll be like Star Trek, only not stupid and corny.

899
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,960
Not derivative. It'll be imaginative.

900
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,920
The aliens will really look like something you want to fuck,

901
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,280
not just something with bumps on their head.

902
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,660
But, in fact, it will be so bizarre.

903
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:53,920
Every day will be so weird that you'll look across the alien shopping mall

904
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,140
and go, whoa, an Earther. There's another Earth person.

905
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,000
Whoa, man, one head, two legs.

906
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,740
Wow, I'm from the North American continent, too.

907
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,540
Do you know Shreve?

908
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,560
Don't be booring.

909
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,060
Sam, my lucky god.

910
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,280
You saw him a thousand times before.

911
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:15,280


912
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:16,900
Oh my god.

913
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,940
So, I say,, were those fijs was the Please-O-Base?

914
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,720
Were there to-and-buss-kinds?

915
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,020
pÃ©n

916
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,100
We're getting all sentimental.

917
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,800
You know, while we were here at home,

918
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,020
my mother didn't like us very much

919
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,640
before we would not clean our rooms.

920
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,980
But soon we will be leaving,

921
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,720
and someone, someone must stay behind

922
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,800
to protect our mother while we party.

923
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,980
You subgeniuses that never did send in your $30.

924
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,860
You will be the new stewards

925
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,880
and stewardesses of Spaceship Earth.

926
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,540
You will be the ones who will have to stay behind

927
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,740
and make sure that lazy humanity

928
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,340
does not sell out to the grains

929
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,060
while we are cavorting on our space.

930
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,680
We won't think about Earth's pollutions or jobs.

931
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,500
We will remember her forests, her cities,

932
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,300
her great monster movies.

933
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,740
But friends, you who stay behind

934
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,560
must just say no to the alien threat.

935
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,920
When we commandeer our escape vessels,

936
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,960
we promise not to come back

937
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,600
and trash our mother.

938
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,280
No, instead we will use the great weapons

939
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,800
which we devised here,

940
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,840
which we once used against each other.

941
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,320
We will turn them against all the other planets

942
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,940
besides Earth until only Mother Earth remains.

943
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,280
Friends, Earth first, Earth first.

944
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,080
War against the planets, war against universe,

945
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,980
war against God.

946
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,200
And if they resist us,

947
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,540
we will crush the Venusians.

948
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,800
We will stomp out the Martians.

949
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,040
We will pick off the Uranus bugs.

950
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,600
And we will move onwards,

951
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,280
out into the Sol, out of the Solar System,

952
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,040
onto other galaxies.

953
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,900
We will harness the Sun

954
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,360
and create a 25-hour day.

955
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,500
And if we cannot conquer a planet,

956
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,260
we will destroy it.

957
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,500
If Bob, if Bob cannot have it all,

958
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,180
if Bob cannot have it all,

959
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:23,180


960
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,400
then no one may have any of it.

961
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,300
All worlds are none.

962
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,200
All worlds are none.

963
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,080
All worlds are none.

964
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,680
Christ Bob.

965
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,720
Christ Bob. Earth first.

966
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,420
Oh, and while we're at it, by the way,

967
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,960
I'm a holy man, you're all married,

968
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,240
you can go have sex now.

969
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,920
You can go ahead of yourself,

970
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,060
you can go, you know,

971
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,260
have sex on your own,

972
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:13,360


973
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:13,360


974
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:13,520
I can do everything by myself.

975
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:13,920
All quick.

976
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,340
I can do everything,

977
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:17,640
be friends with me again.

978
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:17,640


979
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,020
I think I'll eat entirely at the bottom.

980
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,640
I think I'll eat entirely,

981
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:21,380
imiento,

982
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:21,640
seemed so too strong.

983
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,740
In fact, I think we have a lullaby.

984
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,800
What else?

985
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,480
Well, we could do...

986
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,020
Bob did teach me that one lullaby.

987
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,160
The escape...

988
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,220
Bob promised a lot.

989
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,760
We hate to preach an escapist doctrine, you know.

990
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,100
Sometimes, just to keep your own slack,

991
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,520
you've got to hide out,

992
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,460
get away from it all,

993
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,820
and, you know, just say fuck them if they can't take a joke.

994
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,020
Let's call the whole day off.

995
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,600
I've had it involuntary.

996
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,100
Slack has been forced on me.

997
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,700
I tried to do too much.

998
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,680
I give up.

999
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,460
If I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

1000
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,200
Slack comes first in the life of any initiate.

1001
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,500
And, praise Bob,

1002
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,240
I think I'll just go to a movie now or something.

1003
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,200
Let this song drift,

1004
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,560
drift through your little sleepy time pad tonight.

1005
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,060
Is that going to happen?

1006
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,540
I don't think so.

1007
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,160
It will.

1008
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,400
Go to sleep

1009
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,520
And dream of pleasure ships

1010
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,640
From high above

1011
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,400
On July 5th next year

1012
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,880
Go to sleep

1013
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,060
And dream of flying high

1014
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,820
And lullabies

1015
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,600
And lullabies

1016
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,620
And dreams that buy

1017
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,200

we'll follow fools into the hell they build

1044
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,160
follow blob blindfolded

1045
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,340
go to sleep

1046
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:41,440

1047
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,520
and praise the name of the father

1048
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,880
now we'll begin swaying back and forth

1049
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,400
sex goddesses and squids

1054
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,240
sex goddesses and squids

1055
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,300
shall lie your way

1056
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,600

00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,320
will keep you safe until

1060
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,000
not

1061
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,640
oh thank you

1062
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,460
is there like a secret code to the name of bop

1063
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,520
when you spell it backwards its still bop

1064
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,100
good lord

1065
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,060
I never thought of that

1066
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,420
what? wait a minute

1067
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,340
If Bob spelled backwards is Bob,

1068
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:58,780
then what if 1998 turned upside down became 8661?

1069
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,340
Does that mean we have to have a big party here at Brushwood

1070
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,080
every goddamn year for the next 3,663 years?

1071
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,720
Say yes! Yes!

1072
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,340
And it will be the biggest goddamn party this stinking desert's ever seen!

1073
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,600
So, remember, we're all sitting together listening to this.

1074
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,500
Remember, remember, remember.

1075
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,760
We're all sitting together listening to this.

1076
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,440
Remember, remember.

1077
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,980
I am an electromagnetic wave.

1078
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,700
I go on and on and on and on.

1079
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,800
Einstein Secret Orchestra friends,

1080
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,180
Chaz Smith, Michelle George, Bob,

1081
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,880
The Bob on drums,

1082
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,380
and the videotape ripped off from many, many subgeniuses.

1083
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:05,080
Oh, and the poor beset and set upon lonesome cowboy Dave.

1084
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:08,420
He is the clone of a very rich cowboy Dave

1085
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,660
who may need a better liver.

1086
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,860
Also, better genitalia than I've ever had in school.

1087
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,760
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,800
I've signed up and I've been cleared so far.

1089
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,740
Okay, well, if you all been,

1090
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,980
anybody who's been dating the rich cowboy Dave,

1091
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:22,560
you heard that.

1092
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,380
He may not have a lot of money,

1093
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,720
but he's got it where it counts.

1094
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,140
A big tongue.

1095
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,560
And Bleepo Abernathy, thank you.

1096
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,400
And Princess Wiardo, the queen of all the UFOs.

1097
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,740
I know that someday your other helmet horn will light up

1098
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,060
and the exes will arrive.

1099
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:47,580
Oh, yeah.

1100
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,280
You believe your own bullshit.

1101
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,420
I believe as, listen, man,

1102
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,080
somebody else was asking me,

1103
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,340
hey, so is Bob for real or what?

1104
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,220
And it's like, that's like, well,

1105
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,760
show me the last proof you had of Jesus, okay?

1106
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,360
I mean, I want to see scientific proof.

1107
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,620
I've got a newspaper article that says

1108
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,160
Bob Dobbs was shot and killed in San Francisco

1109
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,360
and blah, blah, woof, woof.

1110
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,780
I mean, that's like asking Hulk Hogan.

1111
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,780
That's like coming up,

1112
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,460
that's like going up to mankind

1113
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:24,240
or to goddamn stone cold Steve Austin

1114
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,880
and saying, so is this wrestling stuff really real?

1115
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,480
Or, I mean, it's all fake, isn't it?

1116
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,300
And he beats the shit out of you.

1117
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,900
Does that answer your question?

1118
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,720
See you at the fire.

1119
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:43,840
See you at the fire.

1120
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,740
And this has been the hour of slight,

1121
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,180
number 1437.

1122
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,600
In this case, a show recorded at Starwood Festival in 1998

1123
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,960
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1124
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,560
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1125
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,920
For more information on the hour of slack

1126
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,360
or Starwood Festival, see subgenius.com

1127
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,060
and praise Bob.

1128
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,720
How would you guys support yourselves?

1129
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,700
Haven't you ever heard of Bobby?

1130
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,740
Oh my God, there's that Connie.

1131
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,060
Connie, before you say anything,

1132
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,880
there's something I need to get off my chest.

1133
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,580
I bought tickets to every raffle your church ever had

1134
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,840
and I'm tapped out.

1135
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,580
So whatever it is you came to say to me,

1136
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,180
I'm not interested.

1137
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,980
Well, I'll just go then.

1138
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,800
Oh, by the way,

1139
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,760
my church had its raffle drawing yesterday.

1140
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,380
You won the grand prize.

1141
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,220
I just gotta meet Bob.

1142
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:42,800
Hold on.

1143
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,880
I can't even tell the number.

1144
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:45,760
Okay.

1145
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,080
Wait a minute.

1146
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,680
I can't.

1147
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,000
I can't do this.

1148
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,420
JR?

1149
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,460
JR.

1150
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,660
Hey, JR.

1151
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,720
This is from Kansas

1152
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,080
and I'm sort of a redneck.

1153
00:57:59,400 --> 00:57:59,760
Okay.

1154
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,740
You need me there.

1155
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,620
I'll never see you again.

1156
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:21,960
Dad?

1157
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,640
Lift me to Kat Dooley.

1158
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:27,740


1159
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:33,460
she stillbrand has to cut me some things in my hair.

1160
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:33,920
She is not amused.

1161
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:33,920


1162
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,080
You're not amused at all.

1163
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,080


1164
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,080


1165
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,080


1166
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,200
Hey, you're making it normal.

1167
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,920
You're meeting HoÅŸan,

1168
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,920
and I see Ñ€Ð¾Ð· fÃ­sica all of a sudden.

1169
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,220
And you don't say an idea.

1170
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,460
Come back next year.

1171
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,440
So, I guess I'm gonna break up with my mom.

1172
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,620
Under my umbrella, la, la, la, la

1173
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:57,240
Under my umbrella, la, la, la, la

1174
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,660
Under my umbrella, la, la, la, la

1175
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,480
Believe me, Bob tonight

1176
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:14,220
He's gonna show you one more time

1177
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:19,460
What it's to be here, Bob Slack

1178
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:25,260
When your life is on right track

1179
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:30,460
You believe in Bob tonight

1180
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:36,060
He's gonna show you Bob tonight

1181
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,180
That dirty, Turkish, hark-a-back, flackin' wharton

1182
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,400
Philip Buckaburton, Perkaluma Burton

1183
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,720
Dirtin' buster, that's all

1184
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,240
B-O-B

1185
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,680
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1186
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,220
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1187
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,000
to help us keep on going for another couple of months

1188
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,100
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites

1189
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,600
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

1190
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:14,120
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that Slack back to rebound to you,

1191
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:18,060
you should go to subgenius.com front page

1192
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,620
or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1193
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,940
and help out financially as best you can

1194
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:29,220
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1195
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,940
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse

1196
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,900
But some of you still have jobs

1197
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,220
Even five bucks makes a big difference

1198
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,820
even if it's only once a month from enough of you

1199
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,220
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference

1200
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,520
All we're saying is that

1201
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,920
blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs

1202
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,020
if you don't pay Dobbs

1203
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,580
We also take checks and money orders to
