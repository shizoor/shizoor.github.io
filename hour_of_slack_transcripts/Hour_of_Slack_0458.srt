1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,880
Ah, yes, dear friends.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,180
Rub-a-dub-dub.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,180
Thanks for the grub.

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,940
Souls, friends, it's all souls.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,140
That's all we're after.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,760
Your money is a secondary consideration, really,

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,200
compared to the fine meat of the soul.

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,600
No, wait, Mom, no, not yet, not now, no.

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,840
Really?

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:55,700


11
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,280
That, my friend, is the face of the enemy,

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,540
always trying to get his greedy little hands on endangered species.

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,160
Now, hold on.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,300
Ronald Camp is connected with the dolphins?

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,980
Yeah, that subgenius gave him the land the new stadium's built on.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,700
And look at this.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,220
He's throwing another I'm-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,680
Hmm.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,680
Looks like it's time for me to get myself a date.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,160
All right.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,160


22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,060
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,200
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,960
which reaches from the inner mind to...

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,940
The Subgenius Hour of Sight.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,980
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,560
And it's showtime.

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,280
Wow.

29
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,960
Turn on now.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,340
Okay.

31
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,740
Push-up up.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,080
Sure.

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,640
Twist the dial.

34
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,400
No!

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,860
That's a little too close for comfort, fella.

36
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,640
So I'll say this to Janer and all who would stain or deface our continuing trope.

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,520
This effusion of noise creates slack in its joys.

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,000
So prepare one and all to elope.

39
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,180
So I'll say this to Janer or any complainer who whines for his place in the sun.

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,380
Don't you know in Bob's eyes,

41
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,160
we are all the same.

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,160


43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,800
We are all the same size.

44
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,760
And now I think we have begun.

45
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,400
So I'll say this to Sterno,

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,820
that Dante's Inferno is hardly more grim than this show.

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,260
To the listener's ear, nothing could be more clear.

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,220
So now let's get ready to go.

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,160
So I'll say this to Philo.

50
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,840
It's true I may smile owing to my profound faith in Bob.

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,240
Though I lost my career and I cry in my beer,

52
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,180
this show is my only real job.

53
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,140
Why don't you just tape it and say,

54
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,140


55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,360
I'm a real seller?

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,700
Yeah, really.

57
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,660
No, he makes these beautiful edits and things, you know.

58
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,960
He puts them together on his system and they come out beautiful, man.

59
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,620
I heard that if we could, three feet down and two feet over,

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,900
we can get out of the show.

61
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,880
Well, why would anyone want to get out of this paradise?

62
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,920
Well, if we can do that in 25 minutes, I guess,

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,960
maybe a paradise for you.

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,520
Someone can come in and clean you all up.

65
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,940
This is the eternal living mind of the unending pulsating now, man.

66
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,400
You're going from nowhere, Phil.

67
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,380
This show is really happening.

68
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,120
Crazy.

69
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,280
Crazy?

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,340
Some may call it crazy.

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,140
They called me crazy.

72
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,960
Just a computer.

73
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,600
Okay, now go ahead, Paul.

74
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,880
Is this the Sub-G show?

75
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,920
Here, take some more church here.

76
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,040
No, this is People Radio.

77
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,200
I found your number in the phone book under Bob.

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,820
No, that's not a...

79
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,940
You gotta look under Gary.

80
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,600
You're looking for a chance number.

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,120
Put your feet up on the end line

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,440
and relax with a big mug of Jaffa Joy juice

83
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,420
while you listen to the swellest, humdingest,

84
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,060
sockadolager show ever to come crumbling and toddling down the pike.

85
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,160
This show has got it all.

86
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,520
Everything you could possibly want.

87
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,820
Just hang on your phone.

88
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:32,820


89
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:32,820


90
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:32,820


91
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:32,880
Kebabs at 9,

92
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:32,880


93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:32,880


94
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,860
Huhuhu.

95
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,120


96
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,120


97
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,120


98
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,660
He's a human tornado

99
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,220
Mules has kicked me

100
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,440
Didn't bruise my hide

101
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,840
Rattlesnakes has bit me

102
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,960
They just crawled off and died

103
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,080
I had cover light

104
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,540
And it's with the rage you see

105
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,460
They don't want no

106
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,840
Dilapidated sea slapping

107
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,180
Pigeon toad across out of bow leg

108
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,200
And some guns are messing with me

109
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,520
I've been known to rise up

110
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,880
But I'll cool down later

111
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,220
I'm a bad motor scooter

112
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,620
I'm a human tornado

113
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,100
He's a human tornado

114
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,300
He's a human tornado

115
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:20,820
He's a human tornado

116
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,580
He's a human tornado

117
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,520
Taste the blood on Satan's claw

118
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,080
Dance a jig in crimson bra

119
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,720
Build the fire for a boiling pot

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,440
Watch the neighbors don't get caught

121
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,060
Ernest Borgnine knew him well

122
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,620
St. Bill Shatner strayed to hell

123
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,300
What the hay, it served him right

124
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,820
Eyeball sockets wrinkled tight

125
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,820
Well, there's a big light shining in the coconut grove

126
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,180
Where Satan used to watch the Barney Miller show

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,080
Syndicated television puts him in the mood

128
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,660
Hoping a pagoda just might get nude

129
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,200
Satan gets an erect shot

130
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,740
Staring at a pagoda butt

131
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,320
Meat and poultry by the pack

132
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,900
Extra servings, bring them back

133
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,540
Ain't no need to raise a fuss

134
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,160
Just yodel your way to that flaky crust

135
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,400
I'm going to go off the deck

136
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,260
This is a lie

137
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,660
Satan was invented by religious fundamentalists

138
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,140
Just to keep you acting like the jerk you really are

139
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,660
Sammy Davis Jr. used to worship Satan

140
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,380
When he wasn't taking drugs

141
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,500
Staring in the mirror while his eyeball twitched around

142
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,640
Let's watch Satan!

143
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,980
Sammy's eyeball twitch!

144
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,740
Don't bother asking if it's greasy or red

145
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,400
Or if he's got pointy horns stuck in his head

146
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,960
All you need to prove it is a Bible-thumping prick

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,580
Satan only happens if your tater's all sick

148
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,580
Hey, Satan

149
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,020
Satan

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,920
He works better than guilt from your mind

151
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,860
Taste the blood on Satan's claw

152
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,720
Oh, yes indeedy-o, daddy-o

153
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,520
Uh, Joe Newman there

154
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,720
Hey

155
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,780
Where's the echo? Oh, there it is

156
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,240
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

157
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,080
You know it can drive a man insane doing these shows

158
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
Uh, yes, Joe Newman there

159
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,080
Doing the Human Tornado

160
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,480
The theme from Rudy Ray Moore's great film

161
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,400
The Human Tornado

162
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,180
Rudy Ray Moore playing Dolomite

163
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,180
In that particular work of art

164
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,120
And Satan's Claw by Joe Newman

165
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,580
Rudy Schwartz Project

166
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,080
Well, where are we now, friends?

167
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,560
Uh, uh, uh

168
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,360
458 hours of slack in the can

169
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,580
458 hours of slack

170
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,500
Get one down and dub it and dub it and dub it and dub it

171
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,540
And send it around

172
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,440
458 hours of slack on the wa-air

173
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,200
And I know we're talking about something...

174
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,140
Okay, dear friends

175
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,900
Well, uh...

176
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,100
Uh, this is the second show that I have to do today

177
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,380
So, wh-wh-well, heck

178
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,900
You know, let's try for more of an editing challenge this time

179
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,240
Of course, that means I won't be able to talk much

180
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,400
Uh, eh, or cut in and give credits

181
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,840
Because I must, I must need sync

182
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,520
sink into the edit mode.

183
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,260
Yes.

184
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,460
Yes, friends, it takes super subgenius concentration.

185
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
And when I'm deep in that mode,

186
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,860
I'm out of the speech mode.

187
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,900
It's either rant or edit.

188
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
And tonight, I feel like editing.

189
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,260
So, here's what it's going to be.

190
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,160
Yeah, here's what it's going to be.

191
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,140
The inside joke hour of slack.

192
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,700
Yeah, that's it.

193
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,300
The inside joke show.

194
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,020
Has your show become too normal for you?

195
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,580
Too familiar?

196
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,660
Well, we'll just have to fix that, dear friends.

197
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,600
You already know about how Bob is the center of the universe

198
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,700
and Slack is the be-all of all being.

199
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
Oh, um...

200
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,020
But what about the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?

201
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,820
What about Aunt Bertha?

202
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,260
What about, yay, even Susie's lizards?

203
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,220
I mean, you want to sound cool to the other Bobbies,

204
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,220
like you really know what's happening

205
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,420
and you're really on to the inside track

206
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,040
with the super obscure ultimate intellectual heaviness of Bob, right?

207
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,100
Well, just to prove that subgeniuses can be just as hilariously funny,

208
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440
even when making no sense at all.

209
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean, it just sounds good.

210
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,540
We present these excerpts from the following.

211
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,680
Well, first off, we'll have, uh, we'll, uh,

212
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,380
have just some more keen Rudy Schwartz Project music

213
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:30,480
from the Yodelin' Satan and Salmon Dave albums by Joe Newman,

214
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,760
just to give us in the right frame of mind,

215
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,300
and then it's pure ritual.

216
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,100
Some introduction, shall we say,

217
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,900
to the real inside Arnold Palmer head doctrine,

218
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,820
as preached by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

219
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:54,180
and Dr. Bleepo Abernathy at the Starwood Hippie Fest in, or near, Ohio.

220
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,840
Then, the old-timey subgenius rituals

221
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,000
as recorded live at last month's DragonCon

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,240
sci-fi convention subgenius revival in Atlanta,

223
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,640
starring Jane or Hyperclutes and the Swinging Love Corpses.

224
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,140
Yes, a live recording of the most self-referential,

225
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,000
head-launching ever.

226
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,880
And somewhere in there, we'll hear the highness,

227
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,820
sex-hurt rant of Reverend Susie the Floozy of Atlanta,

228
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,340
finally recorded by Bob Payne,

229
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,180
as well as perhaps, perhaps,

230
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,720
cuts from her radio show on WREK in Atlanta.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,880
Praise WREK.

232
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,960
Not necessarily last, but probably nearly the least,

233
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,640
uh, more from our broadcast with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

234
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,120
and Dr. Bleepo Abernathy.

235
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,980
And Reverend Chaz Smith on Swamp Rot Radio WCSB Cleveland.

236
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,120
But, dear friends, before we go any deeper...

237
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,780
in the course- accessories.

238
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,500
Along with The Bчик Tworry Scholarship Fellowship belly of issue white.

239
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,360
We may, though, have taking grasp some readiness to discover

240
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,360


241
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,440
the gift safely available over cattle.

242
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,440


243
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,440


244
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,760
from Christmas into it.

245
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,800
And that, as well, could leave us mincednecks forлề

246
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,400
in the future at the age ofsee to forget about the camelliac Texas Swing from실�.

247
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:34,520


248
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,920
We want you, as people in young people,

249
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,840
to touch those suckers' silently pulled byPD7 while getting back to their old age politeness,

250
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
Thank you.

251
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:21,920
Thank you.

252
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:48,740
Thank you.

253
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,500
Thank you.

254
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,220
Thank you.

255
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,160
Thank you.

256
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,900
Thank you.

257
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,160
Thank you.

258
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,920
Thank you.

259
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,000


260
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,020
Thank you.

261
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,180
Thank you.

262
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,100
Thank you.

263
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,160
Thank you.

264
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,140
Thank you.

265
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,740
Thank you.

266
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
It has been a pleasure to grow friends with you,

267
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:54,440
I just want to express a huge thank you for watchinghow we shared everywhere it's been

268
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,560
a great time.

269
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:10,700
Well, I'm going to give these two steamed eggs to Mr.

270
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,040
Stanford.

271
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,780
Would you mind getting a Class D firework?

272
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,520
Stop playing with those dangerous fireworks and come in the house.

273
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,180
Can I go to my local Red Devil distributor and get me a Class D firework?

274
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,020
You cannot.

275
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,480
You can march right up to your room and stay there until I say it's safe to come down.

276
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,020
Oh, I can't do anything, can't I?

277
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,460
What on earth do you mean, talking to Aunt Bertha like that?

278
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,040
I've only got ten fingers. I don't need all ten of them.

279
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm falling off. I'll blow a few of them off. It should be my decision.

280
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,660
God gave you your fingers, Timmy.

281
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,880
Hand me those matches, will you, Dr. Howell?

282
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,420
Here they are, buddy. Go ahead and have fun.

283
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,040
This is the famous Chinese flower. I'm lighting it right now.

284
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,640
Okay, here we go.

285
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,460
Don't listen to that young man. He's possessed by Satan.

286
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,760
Oh, darn it, it's a dud.

287
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,920
All fireworks come from Satan and his imps.

288
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,440
Every year.

289
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,300
Every year I waste my money on this stuff. I don't know what I'm going to do.

290
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,520
Yeah, me neither.

291
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,460
Billy!

292
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,700
Now Aunt Bertha's voice comes and haunts him repeatedly as he tries to make important decisions.

293
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,260
What has God wrought?

294
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,020
Billy, stop that!

295
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,720
Billy.

296
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,860
That, of course, is what...

297
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,360
Oh, Billy.

298
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,580
Oh.

299
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,600
Billy, what are you doing?

300
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Oh, Billy.

301
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,720
Oh, my.

302
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,800
Billy.

303
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,420
Billy.

304
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,740
Billy.

305
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:46,740


306
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:46,740


307
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:46,740


308
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:46,740


309
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:46,740


310
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:46,740


311
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,860
Little Billy was bilious that day when he awoke and saw Aunt Bertha's bulk

312
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,180
leering at him from the other side of the counterpane.

313
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,820
Billy, what are you doing?

314
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,400
A joint knife perfectly clean, Billy.

315
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,440
Now, work to and fro.

316
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,100
Avoid lumps, bumps, and uneven application

317
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,860
because Jesus wants this world to go all the way up to heaven.

318
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,160
Oh, I'm sick of that.

319
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,340
Jesus.

320
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:13,580
Jesus.

321
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:13,940
913.

322
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,520
Jesus.

323
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,620
Place your knife over a clean scrap of wood.

324
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,660
Not over the edge.

325
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,380
Not the puzzling evidence shelf.

326
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,920
Oh, there we go.

327
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,840
Okay, now the little Christ-kini.

328
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,880
Choke.

329
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,560
Timmy and Billy stole an atomic submarine when they should have been in church.

330
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,560
Timmy and Billy were always doing that.

331
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,600
That's why Billy's mayor of the world and Timmy is one of the most sought after...

332
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Now, Billy, don't you imitate your dear father.

333
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,140
I'm the real Aunt Bertha.

334
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,040
You certainly are not.

335
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm the real Aunt Bertha.

336
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,780
I'm the real Aunt Bertha because...

337
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,700
Uh-oh, look what's happening.

338
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,460
Another duel of the Berthas here on planet Earth.

339
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,100
There was another Bertha on the alternate world.

340
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,680
Bertha 2.

341
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,840
The alternate Bertha channel.

342
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,860
That the movie was made of.

343
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,220
I saw that movie and I give it a big thumbs down.

344
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,240
I give it a big thumbs up because they didn't have enough time.

345
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,200
But we don't have to worry about it.

346
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
They have to.

347
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,000
They have Anzac, Prozac, and Natal.

348
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,560
They just do not understand.

349
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,800
Billy, where did you go, Billy?

350
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,820
Billy and Timmy sneaked off to go to the movies instead of studying the Bible.

351
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,960
I sure hope Aunt Bertha doesn't find out that...

352
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,220
We're not in our Bible lesson.

353
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm scared.

354
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,640
Oh, forget about that old bag.

355
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,400
Let's light some cigarettes, smoke them, then we can go burn some churches and worship Satan.

356
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,200
Cool.

357
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,680
If you're right in front of your left, open out your eyes and bring us together...

358
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,300
Experimenting again?

359
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,600
Every evil thing that ever happened was the result of an experiment.

360
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,180
Yeah.

361
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,460
Yeah.

362
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,580
Drugs?

363
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,920
Oh, my.

364
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,440
Don't you know you're supposed to give all drugs to Aunt Bertha?

365
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,860
Dial a something or other.

366
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,900
Bacteria.

367
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,860
Grand Dragon.

368
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,260
Two Clucks Clash.

369
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,240
Hehehehe.

370
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,900
Clash.

371
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,720
Quit sticking your pencil in there.

372
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:36,920
Clash.

373
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,820
Now pipe down.

374
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,220
Pipe down.

375
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:45,300
I want you to confine your shenanigans to the rumpus room and keep it down to a dull roar.

376
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,920
I don't want to hear one peep out of you students, or it's right down to Mr. Hennessy's office.

377
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,220
I'll meet you in the rumpus room, Peach.

378
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,280
All right now, calm down, John.

379
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:03,220
When the number of outer electrons, defined as the number of electrons lying outside of the nearest rare gas, Ns2Np6...

380
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,240
Rare gas.

381
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,060
That's what I smell.

382
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,160
Or pseudo rare gas, N minus one, the quantity d10, or...

383
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,860
Good thing this good thing's gonna be open book.

384
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,260
This goes on and on about this stuff.

385
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,500
Who cares?

386
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,300
Who knows?

387
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,500
What can we do to make him stop?

388
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,580
Remember this in real life.

389
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,040
Now vape it on, and keep more people coming in.

390
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,480
...that there are certain things which a good subject never does.

391
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,200
Like what, Aunt Bertha?

392
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,380
Well, he always puts his thumb along the seams of his trousers like this.

393
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,280
He never stands vulgarly with arms akin to a...

394
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,660
Oh, but I've tried to stand correctly for many hours.

395
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,060
I've prayed...

396
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,080
That doesn't matter, Billy.

397
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,240
It's what you do, not what you try to do, that counts in the long run.

398
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,860
Oh, I'm so tired.

399
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,560
But I don't understand.

400
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,800
Be silent when your elders are talking.

401
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,580
But there's...

402
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,480
And you won't be thrown into the pit of scorpions and worms as it practices to say.

403
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,260
But Aunt Bertha, there's giant ants, and they're coming up to me.

404
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,880
They're coming up to the house real fast.

405
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,340
Oh, who cares about those?

406
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,940
They must be going a hundred miles an hour.

407
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,020
Oh, those do seem to be rather large ants, Billy.

408
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,380
We'd better get off the porch and go inside.

409
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,600
There's a bee gone high on the porch.

410
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,600
Oh, those ants are getting high out there on the porch.

411
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,400
Oh, my.

412
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
That's against the law.

413
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,320
The police department is investigating allegations that several officers, while on duty,

414
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,260
engaged in questionable sexual activity with a woman.

415
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,960
They call Aunt Bertha the star of the frozen north.

416
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,360
That's the other room over here.

417
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,060
In fact, I can take the phone in there.

418
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,600
Here, you can listen to it.

419
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,720
Exactly how many officers are suspected of malfeasance is unclear.

420
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,300
There you go.

421
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,060
But police chief John Cornkernel confirmed there is more than one,

422
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,980
and sources close to the investigation say there were at least 36 officers

423
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,140
who had repeated sex with the aged woman who lives in North America.

424
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,120
According to the woman's sister, Tant Bertha,

425
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,180
nearly 50 officers had repeated relations with the woman,

426
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,600
though not all the encounters occurred while the officers were on duty.

427
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,140
And not all of them occurred simultaneously.

428
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,420
But the situation had been going on for up to 10 years,

429
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,940
and the woman was extremely tired and wished to stop.

430
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,740
Sources say she liked to be around police officers

431
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,980
and was even called a police groupie by groups of radioactive rodent hamsters.

432
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,440
That was really something.

433
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,620
What are we seeing in the movie drone movie theater?

434
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,080
This is the...

435
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,640
I've seen this before.

436
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,540
It's a trailer for the Big Aunt Bertha production they're doing up in Ontario.

437
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,080
Oh, I've heard that has the latest state-of-the-art special effects.

438
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,040
Yeah, they've hired Industrial Light and Magic to do them,

439
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,340
and they're using the same nuclear reactor that they used to shoot the Abyss,

440
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,660
and they're building the bathtub there,

441
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,240
and they're putting, I believe it's 650 million gallons of cocoa butter in it,

442
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,380
and then they're lowering down this big hydraulic Aunt Bertha

443
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,820
that Dino De Laurentiis made.

444
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,640
Cuckoo for cocoa butter, eh?

445
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,620
And in the article that I saw, there was a picture of Mel Gibson

446
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,540
straining on a crowbar dressed up as Billy, and he just doesn't look like him.

447
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,600
Yes, Mel Gibson essays the role of Billy in this film.

448
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,620
Yeah, it's just, well, you know, they had to get a name for the Billy part,

449
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,580
because they know that I can bring people in.

450
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,000
Nobody's heard of Aunt Bertha!

451
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,160
Now, these clips that we're seeing are rough footage.

452
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,340
This is not the way the finished film will appear in the theater.

453
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,640
Oh, okay, good. Yeah, because I don't know if I can really support

454
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,360
the way the Aunt Bertha character acts.

455
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,360
Well, look at that. That looks pretty good.

456
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,460
Yeah, I guess it does, but still, I mean...

457
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,980
That's jerky animation, jerky.

458
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,500
Yeah, what happened there? The pin registration went out.

459
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,300
Well, we'll just use it anyway, because it costs so much.

460
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,420
Well, you know, they could have done all that.

461
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,380
They built this go-motion Aunt Bertha thing that weighed 74,000 pounds,

462
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,680
which was kind of big. I think they should have only made it...

463
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,860
Pulled the Japanese into pain for her, too.

464
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,580
...double scale.

465
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:03,020
Yeah, well, this scene right here is where Aunt Bertha is turning someone into a pillar of fire,

466
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,300
and you'll notice they're using computer-generated imagery.

467
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:05,920
Nice.

468
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,420
And she's using a little bit of morphing to turn the person into a pillar of fire,

469
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,860
and she says that that's just like what happens to Zen Taff in the Ballad of Zen.

470
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,800
Morphine? Good God, these Hollywood rocksters are sick, sick, sick.

471
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,020
Sure is nice.

472
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,800
I hope you like this story, boys and girls.

473
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,120
If you would like a free picture of me and the nude,

474
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:32,480
write to Aunt Bertha, dial a story,

475
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,760
Box 666.

476
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,720
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

477
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,440
Goodbye now, children.

478
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm checking out over Jordan to that great red dome in the sky.

479
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:52,080
From my perch up in heaven, I'll keep an eye on all you little dirt balls down there.

480
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,260
Goodbye.

481
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,400
Goodbye.

482
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,600
I remember for those who'd like a free can.

483
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,540
Oh!

484
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,740
What the hell is that?

485
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,320
Let's just do the new Bible sitting down.

486
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,740
We didn't have a pulpit or anything.

487
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,560
We'll do the whole, we'll do a two-hour radio show and the Bible.

488
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,040
Why?

489
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,020
Oh, man!

490
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,120
Okay, sorry to take Jimmy out again.

491
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,620
We were just given a donation here.

492
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,440
A little 10-cent used book,

493
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,020
The Professional Career of Arnold Palmer.

494
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,400
Now, some of, it sounds like many of you here are familiar with the,

495
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,400
the first of the sacred schisms from the Church of the Subgenius,

496
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,120
which is called the Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer Launcher Society.

497
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,500
And they have a copy of this book.

498
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,140
Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer.

499
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,180
They have a copy of this book as well.

500
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,720
Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer.

501
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,940
And they discovered, just as we did.

502
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,600
My kids, Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer.

503
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,480
Okay, now here.

504
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,320
No, this is the way you read this.

505
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,280
If there is such a thing,

506
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,060
as getting off to a roaring start in golf,

507
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,500
Arnold Palmer did it in 1960.

508
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,080
Before the Masters rolled around in April,

509
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
he had won four tournaments.

510
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,900
The Palm Springs Golf Classic,

511
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,980
the Texas Open,

512
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,320
the Baton Rouge Open,

513
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,160
and the Pensacola Open.

514
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,060
Okay, here it is.

515
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,380
The crowd went wild,

516
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,120
and one can only imagine how great Arnie felt.

517
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,260
The crowds that followed him,

518
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,860
followed this almost mystical figure,

519
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,420
form what has been best described as Arnie's Army.

520
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,460
Oh, Arnie, sorry.

521
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,420
And no army ever had more loyal soldiers.

522
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,300
Boy, you know.

523
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,680
Wow.

524
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,460
If I had that little miniature bleeding head of Arnold Palmer,

525
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,560
I could launch it here.

526
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,120
But, but, this is not the time.

527
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,500
The time is not yet for the arisal of the launching of the head.

528
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,700
It says here that there was a point

529
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,500
that they believed that Palmer was washed up.

530
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,200
Palmer was washed up on the seas of Mars,

531
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,340
where he was found in a basket

532
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,880
by the kings of Atlantis who taught him

533
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,040
to hit the sacred ball with the sacred nine iron.

534
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,800
And there's a connection there, friends.

535
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,040
Nine irons equals nine inch worms.

536
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
And as it says in Prescriptures 5.16,

537
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,980
inside Bob's head is the same thing that's inside those golf balls.

538
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,360
As every kid knows,

539
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,680
when you cut open golf balls,

540
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,560
you cut open Bob's head with a little pocket knife,

541
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,900
first you come to a lot of rubber bands,

542
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,400
millions of compressed rubber bands.

543
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,620
But deep inside those rubber bands

544
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,720
is a little black marble-sized rubber ball.

545
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,180
But inside that rubber ball

546
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,640
is the deadliest poisonous acid known to man.

547
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,360
And if a kid cuts into that,

548
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,960
now you kids here, you pay attention.

549
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,720
If a kid cuts into that little rubber ball,

550
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,440
this acid drips out.

551
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,620
It'll burn a hole through a spaceship hull.

552
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,140
It'll burn all the way to China,

553
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,820
except that it enters equilibrium

554
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,040
at the center of the Earth.

555
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,660
There's a whole lot of little golf,

556
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,380
the oil from golf balls is like gathering up

557
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,520
at the center of the Earth,

558
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,400
someday to drive the Nazi flying saucers out.

559
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,460
And you know, kids,

560
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,340
if you pick up a hamster by its tail,

561
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,000
its eyes will fall out.

562
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,720
Go ahead and try that at home.

563
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,460
We'd say don't wait for the stuntman.

564
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,000
Just, you see him do it on the movies?

565
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,820
You can do it too.

566
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,760
Go ahead.

567
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,980
We say legalize drugs and abortion

568
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,560
to weed out the humans.

569
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,620
As Bob said, abortion is murder,

570
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,500
but it's murder in self-defense.

571
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,720
And Bob believes in retroactive abortions

572
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,040
up until the age of, say, 50.

573
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,980
If it's not a subgenius by then,

574
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,280
it's merely a human.

575
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,380
It's never going to develop.

576
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,680
Terminate it.

577
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,880
As for the drugs,

578
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,560
let those whining sissies wipe themselves out

579
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,340
if they can't handle it.

580
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:05,580
I don't like drugs.

581
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,160
No, please.

582
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,620
Let them sell that stuff to each other

583
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,820
until, like, you know,

584
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,100
it's a good riddance factor.

585
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,620
Here, have some Tylenol and some Jack Daniels.

586
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,680
Aren't drugs bad?

587
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,320
Calm down, honey.

588
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,680
Those drugs will go away soon.

589
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,240
Yeah, oh, maybe you shouldn't have taken some today.

590
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,760
Maybe...

591
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,680
Okay, well, this usually is the song that we play,

592
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,140
like, when we go out and pray.

593
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,260
But we come back out afterwards honest.

594
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,920
And then we play...

595
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,380
We usually play more songs.

596
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,420
Of course, tonight we might be kind of scared.

597
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,440
We might not want to leave after this song.

598
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,300
We might just stay here and keep playing

599
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,680
for fear that you will leave.

600
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,660
But if Reverend Stang was with us today,

601
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,060
we're supposed to come up here and launch ahead.

602
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,560
At least that would give us temporary respite.

603
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,220
Then we could go back there and clap

604
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,880
a whole bunch of blues.

605
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,440
Okay, okay.

606
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,120
Okay.

607
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,620
All right.

608
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,920
Okay.

609
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,440
Even despite the fact

610
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,660
that we have only the little tiny golf club

611
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,640
in Reverend Stang's complicit game,

612
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,200
we do have the two things necessary.

613
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,160
We've got to get a club, a little tiny club.

614
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,960
And we have...

615
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,820
We do have St. Changer Hypercreek.

616
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,200
Oh, here he is.

617
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:43,720
Here he is.

618
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,040
You said you're sorry, and now you apologize.

619
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,320
Okay, I'm sorry.

620
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,460
I won't get into this with you now.

621
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,080
I'm not going to do this again.

622
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,160
What are you talking some Pat Trevino ?

623
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,640
Are you just bowing your knees to me?

624
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,280
Are you just bowing your knees to Lucifer?

625
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,560
Is that what you're saying?

626
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,040
Are you saying that you're a Trevino head worshiper?

627
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,880
I never had a Trevino head.

628
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,960
I've never lost a Trevino head, but I would.

629
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,020
Oh, yeah, I bet you would.

630
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,340
Oh, yeah, I saw you smoking that Sam Snead head that night.

631
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:11,800
Mm-hmm.

632
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,640
That was a demagnetized head.

633
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,620
I can't get off on a demagnetized Trevino head.

634
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,520
What is this?

635
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:19,840
I don't know.

636
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,100
Some of it's like decaffeinated coffee, you know.

637
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,660
I was trying to get off a magnetized Palmer head.

638
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,620
Some people have to get a demagnetized Trevino head.

639
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,360
It's just, you know, I mean, I'm sorry.

640
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:37,240
I respect where you're coming from, but I hope you'll honor the fact that I'm beating your face in with a pair of brass knuckles.

641
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,180
I mean, if that's your thing, man.

642
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:46,480
I mean, I see you just as a modern-day Lucifer promoting a Sodom and Gomorrah.

643
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,400
I launched one Trevino head once.

644
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,600
Okay, I admit it.

645
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,480
Yeah, and one leads to another.

646
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,360
Oh, just one more.

647
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,620
Just let me launch one more Trevino head.

648
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,660
He said, day after day, the Trevino head rehabilitation center.

649
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,560
Oh, just give me one more Sam Smead head to snort.

650
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,060
Oh, and it was only cut 20% with the ground-up glass and the comet.

651
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,500
Oh, no, no, look.

652
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,340
There's ranchers lined up, and I'm sure there's probably people who'd love to make a witness.

653
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,840
Look, they come here.

654
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,820
They want to see you, Dan.

655
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,300
You know, one of these days, you're going to be in a...

656
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,020
A stadium surrounded by cheering Christians with your head on the block.

657
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:40,040
And that guillotine blade will come down probably to the beat, the demonic beat of some Christian rock music.

658
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,460
And you know what the heck?

659
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,960
It lives for another 12 seconds after it's chopped off.

660
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,880
You'll still be alive before the blood stops flowing to your brain long enough to...

661
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,440
Maybe you'll just be seeing the inside of the basket for the last 12 seconds.

662
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:04,420
Or maybe your eyes will roll around seeing the blade smeared with your blood and row upon row of Christians.

663
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,740
Oh, is this...

664
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,440
Of blood and wildness.

665
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,160
Oh, is this slack?

666
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,120
Is this slack he fought as his head landed in the basket?

667
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:21,420
Or perhaps, maybe, possibly, this is what those comedians, those satirists, the Church of the Subgenius were talking about when they talked about the conspiracy.

668
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,300
When they talked about evil.

669
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,080
When they talked about a modern-day corporate...

670
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,980
Sodom and Gomorrah.

671
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,820
Yes, we stand with Robert Tilton.

672
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,500
We stand with Jerry Falwell.

673
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,340
We stand with Jimmy Swigert.

674
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,240
We stand with a finger of hate, a righteous hatred of modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah.

675
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,900
We can launch the head.

676
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,100
We will launch the head.

677
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,220
We must launch the head.

678
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,440
We shall launch the head.

679
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,820
Where is the head?

680
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,620
Bring forth the head.

681
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,600
I'll burn your eyes.

682
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,160
At least not a month.

683
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,900
The head.

684
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,060
No arms.

685
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,980
No legs.

686
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,600
Not a single bone in his body.

687
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:17,380
By the time you've seen the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, you'll thank your lucky stars you're all in one piece.

688
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,740
If you don't throw up your money for the Washington.

689
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,060
If I had to launch the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?

690
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,500
If I had to launch the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer one more time, I'll vomit.

691
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,340
Of course, a lot of people vomited the first time I launched the head.

692
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,520
That's beside the point.

693
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:31,760
What about the T?

694
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,020
What about the T?

695
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,840
What?

696
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,860
The role of the actor.

697
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,460
What about the P?

698
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,820
I'm not talking about the T. I'm talking about the P.

699
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,700
The role of duct tape, sir.

700
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,440
The sacred role of duct tape.

701
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:44,960
The sacred role of duct tape.

702
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,280
Yea, in power.

703
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:54,580
For he who was once called me shall not be known as thee, who was later found to be called Blee.

704
00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:00,500
And he was called Glee, later being involved in the later swing of John Lennon.

705
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,760
But that's the false prophet's interpretation.

706
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,880
But what of the club?

707
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:12,720
What about the fact that the Greyhound bus station, owned by the conspiracy, treats you like dirt?

708
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,600
I mean, when they said, leave the writing to us, I didn't know they meant they were going to take a dildo and sodomize me.

709
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,080
Lost my luggage and lost the sacred nine iron.

710
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,340
But wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

711
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:46,920
It was a miracle caused by the one and only Susie D'Fluzzi that she would be ordained on this night to have given Reverend Ivan Stein this combination bottle opener, seven inch bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, Launcher Society.

712
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,380
Launcher, a miracle of God.

713
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,420
Praise God.

714
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,420
Praise God.

715
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,560
And look at that.

716
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:54,560


717
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:54,560


718
00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:01,240
Oh, for the head was covered in the beard of Milwaukee light.

719
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,940
Milwaukee's beast.

720
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,940
The light, the light of the beard cannot be lost.

721
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,360
You're an amateur failure.

722
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,320
I'm a professional.

723
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:31,380
For the head was turned upside down and mocked for a thousand years by the conspiracy, by the Trevina.

724
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,000
But we shall make it whole again with the beard of Milwaukee's light.

725
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,280
Milwaukee's beast.

726
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,060
We've already had seven.

727
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,100
It's prostitution.

728
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,400
It's prostitution, baby.

729
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,720
I can't do it.

730
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,820
I can't.

731
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,360
It was funny 10 years ago.

732
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,580
Oh, yeah.

733
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,840
It wasn't really funny then.

734
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:56,980
Launch the head.

735
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,540
Oh, yeah.

736
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,320
Let's have some more surreal humor brought up.

737
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,080
There's no life left in any of this.

738
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,840
It was no longer funny 10 years ago.

739
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,460
No, no.

740
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,220
Don't do it.

741
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,540
Okay, we're not going to launch the head after all.

742
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:09,980
Sorry.

743
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,340
The head lays.

744
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,520
The head lays filled with fear.

745
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,560
Thank you for coming.

746
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,080
We appreciate it.

747
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


748
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


749
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


750
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


751
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


752
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


753
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


754
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


755
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


756
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


757
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,080


758
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:17,680
We're not going to do it again.

759
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,220
Watch the head.

760
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,160
Watch it.

761
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,160
Watch it.

762
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,560
Heel head back.

763
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,520
Bleeding head good.

764
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,280
Heel head back.

765
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,300
Bleeding head good.

766
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,080
Heel head back.

767
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,060
He's testing the wind.

768
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,380
It looks like he's flying.

769
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,820
Bleeding head good.

770
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,580
Heel head back.

771
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,400
Bleeding head good.

772
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,420
Heel head back.

773
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,200
We're talking big money, friends.

774
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,320
Big money.

775
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,960
You know what a human soul is worth?

776
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,180
About 5,000 bucks, man.

777
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,880
That's exactly...

778
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,800
You are very close.

779
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,580
It's $5,631.

780
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,620
Is it going right?

781
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,500
I'm using it.

782
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,220
But it's made up of...

783
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,280
A Japanese soul is slightly more valuable right now.

784
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,940
But isn't it made up of 97% water?

785
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,400
A soul is made up of...

786
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:07,420
No, no.

787
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,820
No, that's atherogastric.

788
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,900
No, the soul is actually made mostly of hair.

789
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,660
That's a little-known scientific fact,

790
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,160
but it's like the horn of the rhinoceros or the fingernail.

791
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,840
Oh, it's very rare.

792
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,740
It's hair.

793
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,240
It's a calcified rhomboid.

794
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,320
I would like to trade my soul for stangs.

795
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,900
You want to change your soul for Reverend Stang?

796
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,860
I'm going to make a trade.

797
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,240
I'm going to have to talk to my boss man about that soon.

798
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,800
I want to make a trade.

799
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,760
But you'll be seeing him soon enough, I have a feeling.

800
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,600
X.

801
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,460
X.

802
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,640
X.

803
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,480
Well, I'll tell you, my soul's in hocks so deep,

804
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,800
and I wish I could get it out.

805
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,240
I wish there was a way.

806
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,440
But I know that they're not going to cash it in,

807
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,220
like yours, for instance.

808
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:51,660
No.

809
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,300
Well, in judgmentary days...

810
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,840
It'll probably end up being a paperweight or something.

811
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,280
You're sold up?

812
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:57,620
Huh?

813
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,620
You're sold up?

814
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,960
Sold up, man.

815
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,300
You're sold up and sold out.

816
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,160
On that final judgmental day,

817
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,620
when everyone accuses you of power beyond your own,

818
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,620
which you don't really have,

819
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,340
and say you've been using like a form of witchcraft.

820
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,320
Witchcraft!

821
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,720
I say, man, it's power slack.

822
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,620
That's what Bob...

823
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,300
What's Bob done for me?

824
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:14,820
He's locked?

825
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,840
Bob can bring...

826
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,820
Bob can bring...

827
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,600
Can give you power, friend.

828
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,400
Power.

829
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,440
And that's what you want.

830
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,740
Because you know, if you had power,

831
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,160
then you could have the money.

832
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,160
You could have the Tootsie Rolls.

833
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,800
You could have everything.

834
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,980
You could have all you ever dreamed of.

835
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,200
If you just had the power.

836
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,980
Would you bet the right number on the lotteria?

837
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,980
That's all they really want is power.

838
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:32,860
Power.

839
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,560
Would you bet the right number on the tray pack?

840
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,180
And that is what Bob can give you.

841
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,020
Bob can give you vast, unthinkable power.

842
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,720
Entire planets of your own to do with as you will.

843
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,420
Ha, ha, ha.

844
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,800
And surprisingly enough, it's not even very expensive.

845
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,100
Only $30.

846
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,940
Appaltrance, appittance, appaltrance.

847
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,420
It's only appaltrance and pittance to have your own planet.

848
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,820
And it comes with...

849
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,500
Now.

850
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,400
Triple your salvation or eternal money back.

851
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,640
He's speaking cockabomblian.

852
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,540
Cockabomblian spy.

853
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,280
Kill him.

854
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,740
Look for the flame.

855
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,600
It's one of the old callers.

856
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,160
That's soul.

857
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,500
That's used soul.

858
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,080
Man, the exus won't take stepped on soul, dude.

859
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,900
Isn't the next step...

860
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,980
They can tell the difference.

861
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,860
Isn't the next step from speaking in tongues spontaneous combustion?

862
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,580
Well, now, that's what we try for.

863
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,100
That's what we've been trying to do all this time is work up enough of a fit.

864
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,360
That you just rupture right there.

865
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,620
Premature rupture.

866
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,200
You know, you're fully immaculated in a ball of flame.

867
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,160
Man.

868
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,320
How do you know an exus when you see one?

869
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,720
They can look like anything.

870
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,700
You'll be able to tell by their halos and wings.

871
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,360
And white robes.

872
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,060
But are they good or are they bad?

873
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,000
And pitchforks.

874
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,340
I know, I know, I know.

875
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,380
You keep saying this over and over.

876
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,320
Are they the good guys or the bad guys?

877
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,420
They're coming here to cause some inclement weather.

878
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,140
They're going to really, really disadvantage us, I must say.

879
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,160
Are they the good guys or the bad guys?

880
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,660
I think that would be rather a moot point.

881
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,560
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

882
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,660
He's looking at his watch.

883
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,600
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

884
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,480
Mr. Cowboy Dave, this is Wes from the West Coast.

885
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,720
Oh, yes.

886
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,160
You're on the hair phones.

887
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,320
The Reverend Ivan Stinky is here in the studio, too.

888
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,520
I'll be damned.

889
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,400
You are damned.

890
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,400
I know that.

891
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,220
We're all damned.

892
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,780
Every one, two, three, four people in this studio.

893
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:43,380
Whoa.

894
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:43,400
Whoa.

895
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:51,180
Every one person out there in San Francisco, as you used to like to call it in Baghdad by the bay, is damned right now.

896
00:47:51,700 --> 00:48:13,500
In the obnoxious year 1990, or in the least obnoxious and least innocuous of all years, in the summer tawdry time of 1998, in the time this season when men and women dance and frolic in midsummer's hopes and aspirations, the death knoll, the town.

897
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,640
The knoll?

898
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,120
The bell will toll.

899
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,520
And when the bell tolls, you better not pick it up.

900
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,020
Ask not for whom the head is launched.

901
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,220
The head is launched for thee.

902
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,660
No, it was launched for Jane.

903
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,620
Oh, I thought it was launched for thee.

904
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,720
No, that's the cosmic version.

905
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,360
I'm tired of that cosmic stuff.

906
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,140
I am, too.

907
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,140
I'm into the just down-to-earth bacon and eggs, meat and potatoes.

908
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,560
Rubbing sandpaper all over your nipples and your chest.

909
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:43,640
Yeah, good old...

910
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,380
Good old time prairie squid loving...

911
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,220
Coffee and lemon pie.

912
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,660
Oil and...

913
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,740
Oil?

914
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,160
Yeah.

915
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,160
I forgot.

916
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,560
You know, peanuts and Coca-Cola of old days.

917
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,300
Goobers and chomping on the egg and chomping on yourself.

918
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:01,900
Yeah.

919
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,740
I'm sick of plastic cards.

920
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:12,620
I'm sick of pulling up behind gas stations and punching into, like, little concrete monoliths

921
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,040
and having...

922
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,520
Pieces and eunuchs and...

923
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,060
Yeah, me, too.

924
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,060
Yeah, I'm sick of it.

925
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,740
I hate that stuff.

926
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,540
I hate that stuff.

927
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,940
And I hate when people pull up behind you in some monstrous vehicle that was never meant

928
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,260
to be.

929
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,400
Fueled by beings which may or may not have existed based on someone's own Freudian preclusion.

930
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,920
Or some Velikovsky nightmare.

931
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,660
When the whole time we could be space-traveling billionaires.

932
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,980
We could be eating fried chicken in the park.

933
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,620
Yeah.

934
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,660
We could be...

935
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,420
That burns me up, man.

936
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,140
I...

937
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:42,980
What does?

938
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,660
What you just said.

939
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,100
I can't...

940
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,020
All those dwarfs in the trucks and everything.

941
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,760
Yeah, all the dwarfs in the trucks and the times...

942
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,800
Hey, you guys sound like idiots.

943
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,680
It's getting hot in here again.

944
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:00,640
No!

945
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,780
Take me to a poopy and I'm praying for some pain!

946
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,220
Dave, what is this hegemonic game?

947
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,440
What is it about you?

948
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,380
It's that the hoo sound is from the Yeti.

949
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,260
Home is the wimpy, laid-back universe sound.

950
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,060
Hoo is the true Yeti sound.

951
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:27,700
Hoo!

952
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:29,100
Hoo!

953
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,460
What it's like having a roadie.

954
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,060
What it's like having a roadie.

955
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,340
So tied together, this game that you think is film based, isn't.

956
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,500
Hang it!

957
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:54,500


958
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:54,500


959
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:54,580


960
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,520
What a great idea!

961
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,000
Spirited away!

962
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,600
By Y'all Iitable.

963
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,080
Sub indo.

964
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:01,440
Every Host's Discover, Chef Aaron.

965
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,000
Highole Imperfect!

966
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,360
Celeste!

967
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:11,400
beaut aka.

968
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,540
Yeah, right, right, Dave. That's right.

969
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,440
Yeah.

970
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,160
Do you want some weed?

971
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,820
Would you like some lemonade stuff?

972
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:18,600
Ma'am?

973
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,340
Just give me the keys to the truck.

974
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,160
Huh?

975
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,580
Just give me the keys to the truck and the gun.

976
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,560
I've been driving so long, I...

977
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,400
What?

978
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,140
It's okay, David.

979
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,900
There, thanks.

980
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,120
Fits very good.

981
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:31,720
Now, uh...

982
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,140
Huh?

983
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,500
Princess, we will escort you to your hive chamber.

984
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,560
Do I have to go in there?

985
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,220
For reprogramming.

986
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,600
I have to go in the hive thing again?

987
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,760
Put on these shackles.

988
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,540
But I can't remember all this stuff.

989
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,780
I go in there and I just...

990
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,640
All right.

991
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,640
Be careful while I clamp them on.

992
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,240
Okay.

993
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,440
Oh, my feet.

994
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,980
Do I have to wear these things?

995
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,720
I can't stand that sound.

996
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,880
What's with the guns back there?

997
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,540
Yep, his gun still works.

998
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,040
Too bad about his mind.

999
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,200
What's the wrong time to do it?

1000
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1001
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:10,980
Ugh.

1002
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:11,800
Good.

1003
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,240
I wish I had the...

1004
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:13,880
We've got...

1005
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,480
We've done...

1006
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,820
We've done hour of slack shows

1007
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,640
that we probably could be sued for

1008
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,420
by the families of people who lost their minds

1009
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,280
because their kids thought,

1010
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,740
I know I'm gonna take acid

1011
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,320
and watch a subgenius show today.

1012
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,140
Oh, that sounds like fun.

1013
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,700
It's either that or Fantasia.

1014
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,040
Meanwhile, their soul is being scooped

1015
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,160
into this little metal canister.

1016
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,960
You know, like...

1017
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,540
You know, like Reiki, the way Reiki...

1018
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,820
Has anybody ever had Reiki done to them?

1019
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,200
No.

1020
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,660
He takes the pain out of your body,

1021
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,320
but that's what...

1022
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,240
That's what we do.

1023
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,600
Well, yeah, except that we use real reiks,

1024
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,280
and it's called acubiting.

1025
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,760
Dear friends, you've heard of acubiting.

1026
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,300
It's merely transferal of pain.

1027
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,540
You have a headache?

1028
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,560
We'll take that sledgehammer and hobble your ankles.

1029
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,520
You won't think about that headache again.

1030
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,500
That's an old one, actually.

1031
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,260
I think the Scientologists use that.

1032
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,560
Bhagwan Rajneesh.

1033
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,720
What's his name?

1034
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,040
Stephen King is a secret.

1035
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,440
He's the head of the Church of Scientology.

1036
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,400
Stephen King is a Scientologist?

1037
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:12,640
No.

1038
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,480
Secret head of it, yeah.

1039
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,520
He's running it now.

1040
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,960
He handed the banner to him.

1041
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:16,700
Well?

1042
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,100
It's just a rumor I'm starting to...

1043
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,460
I made it up.

1044
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,260
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1045
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,600
Well, yeah, I heard about the colostomy bag

1046
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,420
in Frank Sinatra.

1047
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,000
Okay.

1048
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,660
Oh, oh, oh!

1049
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,140
Shh!

1050
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,660
Man, I get in trouble for that one.

1051
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,320
Presenting, dear friends,

1052
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,260
Reverend Susie Thub-Blizzy,

1053
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,960
also known as Lois Coleman,

1054
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:33,820
dear God, Mayor.

1055
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,200
A lady just met a man

1056
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,200


1057
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,200


1058
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,200


1059
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,200


1060
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,200


1061
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,560
in the room.

1062
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,480
Stand up!

1063
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,580
What kind of gentleman are you?

1064
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,300
Come on, stand up.

1065
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:44,680
Stand up.

1066
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,880
The lighting just went off.

1067
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,160
And right there is where the tape ran out,

1068
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,280
not only on my video camera,

1069
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:57,860
but also on Reverend Bob Payne's excellent recording.

1070
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,180
So we're going to have to pick up

1071
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,860
Reverend Susie Thub-Blizzy

1072
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,420
right in the middle of her rant

1073
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,780
at the Atlanta Phenomicon,

1074
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,180
backed by none other than the Swimmin' Man.

1075
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,040
Swinging love corpses.

1076
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,540
Let's see what, uh, yeah, what the...

1077
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,700
Incidentally, I wanted to apologize

1078
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,180
for the terrible little edits

1079
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,480
that sound like this.

1080
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,740
In the middle of this tape,

1081
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,920
we're trying to deal with new equipment.

1082
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,560
This is actually the best recorder we have.

1083
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,660
Unfortunately, it's not a very good editor.

1084
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,980
And maybe for next week's show,

1085
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,160
we can work around that somehow.

1086
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,020
Mm, yes.

1087
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,980
So let's get back to Reverend Susie Thub-Blizzy.

1088
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,220
Cut and all.

1089
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,620
Too bad you can't see her, my friends.

1090
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:43,960
Hey!

1091
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,300
And if you can look Bob in his half-toned eyes

1092
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,560
and tell him you don't have the time for slack,

1093
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,780
ha! Try it.

1094
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,920
Try it, you can.

1095
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,280
Oh.

1096
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,280
Yeah, Bob and slack.

1097
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,980
Slack is so many things.

1098
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,300
Slack is an element.

1099
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:10,640
It's a food.

1100
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,840
You need a regular amount of slack in your life.

1101
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,720
And the conspiracy cuts your slack off.

1102
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,940
And please keep away with it,

1103
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,260
throwing it over your head, just out of your reach.

1104
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,740
Well, Bob is gonna fan that slack right down

1105
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,480
in your green-and-go-fingers, kids,

1106
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,740
because you need it.

1107
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,860
You need it.

1108
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,560
It's not enough that they take their slack away.

1109
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,280
They don't even use it.

1110
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,980
It's just enough for them that you don't have it anymore.

1111
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,540
Oh, but it's us and them.

1112
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,960
And thanks to Bob, I know what lies are wrong now.

1113
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,140
Oh.

1114
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,240
Oh.

1115
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,440
Tension deficit can be a wonderful thing.

1116
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,380
You know, sometimes when there's the wrong kind of stupidity

1117
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,580
in your life, it is your duty to go out there

1118
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,680
and get more of the right kind of stupidity back into it.

1119
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,980
If your life is making too much sense,

1120
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,080
you're f-----.

1121
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,960
You're living your life.

1122
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,160
You're living proof that you don't have to have sense to survive.

1123
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,100
I'm not senseless.

1124
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,360
I'm sense-free.

1125
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:14,080
Yes!

1126
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,280
Oh.

1127
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,920
Oh, yeah.

1128
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,900
Sometimes you just haven't been slapping them in the face,

1129
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,360
wagging your weirdness enough.

1130
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,360
It's your job to get back out of there.

1131
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,140
Oh, Bob.

1132
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,620
Oh, Bob.

1133
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,820
You don't have your feet angry, Bob, sometimes.

1134
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,940
But, Bob, sometimes,

1135
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,140
you'll stand on your feet,

1136
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,720
hold you down,

1137
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,620
and breathe in the fumes from that pipe.

1138
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,340
Oh.

1139
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,680
Yeah, and you know what Bob told me?

1140
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,380
Bob told me,

1141
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,300
you have the right to remain slapped.

1142
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,980
Oh, let the sleeping dogs beat the dead horses.

1143
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,360
Guns don't kill people.

1144
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,620
Girls kill people.

1145
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,960
You can get more flies with honey than with vinegar,

1146
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,300
but you can get all of the flies with slaps.

1147
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,320
Oh.

1148
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,560
Oh, the conspiracy drove me to madness

1149
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,660
and then charged me 22 cents a mile for the trip.

1150
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,280
Bob called me.

1151
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:31,280


1152
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,600
I lost only pennies a day.

1153
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:38,340
And you have any idea of the street value of pure, uncut slap?

1154
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,420
Oh.

1155
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,480
But I'm so glad there is Bob.

1156
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,660
He is here to justify our sins,

1157
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,440
to be sincere to your sins.

1158
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,680
Don't give him a wallow in them.

1159
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,060
Oh, please.

1160
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:57,860
Would you rather be separated like a fool from his money,

1161
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,180
or would you want to be separated from,

1162
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,020
like the wheat from the chaff?

1163
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,440
It's your choice, and you can make it by accepting Bob.

1164
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,200
Or, if you'd like to swing the other way,

1165
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,000
there's always Connie.

1166
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,440
The eternal sex ceramic goddess.

1167
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,440
Tara's vulva.

1168
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,800
The wet spill on aisle five.

1169
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,200
This church has all sorts of convenient protuberances

1170
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,400
and orifices to fit your particular faith needs.

1171
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,100
It's a faith that's strong enough to sit on.

1172
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:37,140
And praise Reverend Susie the floozy.

1173
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,000
Uh, the...

1174
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,400
Oh, yes, and the swinging love corpses.

1175
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,960
We'll have to come back to that next week

1176
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,600
when we have a better editing machine, we hope.

1177
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,360
And because it's now time to give you addresses, dear friends,

1178
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,260
so get those pencils ready.

1179
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,720
Uh, because I'm going to give you the addresses of those

1180
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,360
whose tapes we've been playing, at least some of those.

1181
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,680
Um, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz can be reached for tapes

1182
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:17,400
via ESO radio at Box 14776, Cleveland 44114, Cleveland, Ohio, dear friends.

1183
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,560
And, uh, let's see, the Rudy Schwartz Project can be reached, uh,

1184
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:26,360
at Joe Newman at P.O. Box 4542.

1185
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:32,600
Austin, Texas at 78765.

1186
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,320
I hope you have your tape recorders running.

1187
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:39,380
And, uh, uh, the Phineas Narco tapes, uh,

1188
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:43,820
he has many edited tapes of the Puzzling Evidence Dr. Howell KPFA show.

1189
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:49,480
You can reach Phineas Narco, uh, at P.O. Box 1247.

1190
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:54,080
Box 1247 in San Jose, California.

1191
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,360
That's 9510.

1192
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,960
And, of course, dear friends, even though we have physically moved

1193
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:07,240
to a new studio, uh, the sacred post office box of the Hour of Slack,

1194
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,420
Bob, and the Church of the Subgenius remains at

1195
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:17,380
Post Office Box 140306

1196
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:24,200
in lovely Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1197
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,220
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1198
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,500
And we'll be back next week, I guess, with, uh,

1199
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,520
probably quite a bit of Phineas Narco's edits of the Puzzling Evidence show.

1200
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,380
Uh, for you, it'll be next week.

1201
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,240
For me, it's only the next take.

1202
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,720
Uh, thank you.

1203
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,140
So, honey, get right with Bob.

1204
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,680
Because since I got right with Bob, now I count my age and slack years.

1205
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,680
That's right!

1206
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,380
Yes!

1207
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,600
Oh, caution!

1208
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,880
I pray for slack.

1209
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,620
I heart my slack.

1210
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,060
I'll give up my slack when they pry my cold, dead fingers off it!

1211
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,340
This bar is protected by slack.

1212
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:18,280
I get my kicks on Route 666, and there's no slack limit there.

1213
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,280
Oh, so don't just expect the worst.

1214
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,100
Do what you can to make it.

1215
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,160
When you get the worst, make the most of it.

1216
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,980
Look at life through the rose-colored glasses.

1217
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,260
And give your life up to Bob.

1218
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,340
It's the best thing you'll ever do.

1219
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,340
Yes, it is!

1220
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:35,840
Thank you.

1221
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:36,540
Whoo!

1222
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:37,260


1223
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:38,680
Whoo!

1224
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,400
Whoo!

1225
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:40,740
Whoo!

1226
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:41,660
Whoo!

1227
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:44,660
Whoo!

1228
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:44,760
Whoo!

1229
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:45,360


1230
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,160
bass solo
