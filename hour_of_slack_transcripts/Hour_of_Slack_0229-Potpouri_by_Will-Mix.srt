00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,960
Coming soon to a station near you, the radio program that was so scary, so frightening,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,740
so utterly terrifying that you won't believe your ears, and for good reason.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,320
Because if you did believe your ears, you wouldn't believe you were believing them.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,180
It will raise your hair white, it will cause cardiac arrest and produce nightmares for your children,

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,400
even if you don't have any. It's hideous side effect, or to graphic or speak up publicly.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:40,040
Hear the horror, feel the fear, touch the terror, and know the nightmare that others can only imagine in their most dreaded dreams.

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,160
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,040
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,080
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

10
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,840
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

11
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:14,440
The Subgenius Hour of Swag that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

12
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,400
And only in the city of...

13
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,740
So that any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,780
the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,800
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,400
Being inhaled during broadcast.

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,560
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,900
constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,040
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

20
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,200
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

22
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,080
Here is your host...

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,840
It's the Will of Dobbs tonight.

24
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,360
The show itself can begin.

25
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,320
Yes.

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,380
Yes.

27
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,940
Oz is over the rainbow.

28
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,420
God is an astronaut.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,240
And the Hour of Slack is where the monsters live.

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,880
That movie didn't really play long enough for any of you to know where that's coming from anyway.

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:43,620
So tonight it's going to be that potpourri, that mix you love so well.

32
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,240
God, actually, if I had my choice, I think I'd just let this play for a while.

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,120
Oh.

34
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,180
Oh.

35
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,140
Oh.

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,500
Oh.

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,520

00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


46
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,700
But of course, I can't do that.

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,120
Yeah.

48
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900

49
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,140
Oh.

50
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,540
of course, I can't do that.

51
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,240

What's in the phone?

55
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,400

Life is just a sucker's dream, and death is a disgrace. So come on down, you Saucerman,

¶¶

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,660
Alarm Santa Fe parents met again with elementary school officials last night to discuss the growing presence of Bob in the schools.

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,540
Bob, the deity of the Dallas-based Church of the Subgenius, is a comic book character who communicates with aliens and worships money.

90
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:43,780
Parents and teachers complain that the Bob stickers and pamphlets, which have turned up in school laboratories with increasing frequency, encourage troublemakers and weird behavior.

91
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,740
It's not healthy for the children. I'm convinced of this.

92
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:56,660
There has been a pamphlet going around, a Bob pamphlet that I have looked at, and it's the least well-adjusted children, really.

93
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:05,680
It tells them that if they are uncomfortable with their classmates, it is because they are better than their classmates.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,320
Can you imagine this? Better. Not smarter, mind you, but better.

95
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,640
Lies up!

97
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,020
The dark building told it was real funny.

98
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
We don't call the devil your friend, are you?

99
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
Your dreams are true.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,580
Go ahead.

101
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,460
Their little excuse is dull like fun.

102
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
You make fun of the major.

103
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,560
Let's go spend the night in a haunted house.

104
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,820
Let's go.

105
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,640
Let's go.

106
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,720
Let's go.

107
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,320
Let's go mess around.

108
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,960
Let's go make a face.

109
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,480
Let's go.

110
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,240
Let's go.

111
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,260
Let's go.

Let's go.

Do you want to rise or stand?

Weird men arise!

147
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,460
Find out who they are and how to smash them!

148
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,720
You probably already knew that the US government is a sham.

149
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,200
Something propped up there for you to blame.

150

But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

151
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,420
That they are actually shambling, unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?

152
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,140
Yes!

153
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,620
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,600
Defy the sinister star forces which mock us all.

155
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,740
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

156
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,500
God has been misquoted all this time!

157

His actual words may disturb you,

158
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:13,300
but Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind.

159
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,400
God is thirsty for souls and standard man's help.

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,920
And to serve him, he's given holy slings and arrows.

Look! We're losing him! Do something! My God!

169
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,980

170
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,120
What happened, boss?

The doctors for Bob helicopters, the doctors for Bob helicopters, shooting the doctors for Bob airport landed at 9.30.

Oh, my God!

173
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:52,980
Oh, the doctors for Bob army started firing the doctors for Bob helicopters until it was all gone.

174
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:02,720
They kept fighting him and fighting him. They keep fighting him and fighting him. Fighting him and fighting him.

They keep fighting him and fighting him and fighting him.

The doctors, the doctors…

177
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,300
Then they shooted down the bomb.

178
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,540
Blew up.

179
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,660
They kept shooting.

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,500
That's the end.

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,980
Going where?

185
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Bob said he'd like to go to the meeting with us tonight.

186
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,240
Well, now he wouldn't like to go.

187
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,360
So we got a few things to do together, my son and me.

188
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,500
We won't be late.

189
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,080
Look, don't let him talk you into doing nothing you don't want to do, Bobby boy.

190
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,620
You want to sit around all evening with a bunch of religious nuts?

191
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,100
Or how about that little ride we was talking about?

192
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,380
I really think you'd get a lot out of this personally, Bob.

193
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,920
I really think you'd get a lot out of this personally, Robert.

194
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,480
What's all the noise out there?

195
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,840
Would you shut up?

196
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,220
The preacher man here is trying to take money.

197
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,940
He's trying to get Bobby off to save his soul.

198
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,640
Well, ain't that nice.

199
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,580
Look, fella.

200
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,080
I got enough problems without you turning my boys against me.

201
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,960
That religion stuff is for softheads.

202
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,240
And my boys ain't soft.

203
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,940
Get in here, Bobby, and tell your friend to go whistle.

204
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Don't let him make you do anything you don't want to, Bob.

205
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,980
Get my money back.

206
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:27,520
First of all, check out my

207
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:27,520


208
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,940
Whatever opens up the door.

209
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,680
There's some psychomen here.

210
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:37,840
They see them, and the other models have it.

211
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,580
The voices are designed to trigger themselves, same voices in your head, your own head, generating those voices.

212
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,520
Guess what? It's gonna be a while before you can turn them off.

213
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,620
It's gonna be a little while before you can turn them voices off.

214
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Take your headphones off now.

215
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,500
Oh, quick, take them headphones off.

216
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,280
Oh, go ahead.

217
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,200
Hey, hey, hey.

218
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,100
Hey, kid.

219
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,800
Hey, you think it's all legal?

220
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,520
Oh, yeah, we go get a W-2.

221
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,460
I play it for my friends.

222
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,420
You've convinced yourself.

223
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,740
You possess.

224
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,660
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

225
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,900
Little realized, even by leading scientists, there are really two races.

226
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,940
Actually,

227
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,780
two distinct species of so-called human beings.

228
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:51,360
If you gaze upon any given street, normally you might never suspect that only some of these people are true humans.

229
00:15:51,660 --> 00:16:04,500
Outside appearances offer no clue that among this ordinary looking crowd on an ordinary day, a certain number of these people are actually subgeniuses.

230
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,080
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person is a genius or not.

231
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,000
None or that carries the rare subgenius gene.

232
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,320
But once inside those heads, we would discover a vast new universe.

233
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,960
A new dimension, coexisting, not always in harmony, alongside the mundane workaday world of the common human.

234
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,500
Another world that until now has been forced into hiding.

235
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,900
Now at this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

236
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,080
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads.

237
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,260
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads.

238
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,040
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare,

239
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,420
Behold us!

240
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,260
For we are the subgeniuses.

241
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,700
Behold us! For we are the subgeniuses.

242
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,940
There you go.

243
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,180
You brought the guitars in.

244
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,040
We made him 8.9 thousand kz.

245
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,360
We're playing skull drums.

246
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,440
We made him 8.9 thousand kz.

247
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,420
We closed the garage somehow.

248
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,140
We had all our hands on him.

249
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,580
We had all our hands on him.

250
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,000
Every time that we'd get some swag bathroom on the CD, we'd have to get behind him.

251
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,060


252
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,740
Now these are the funniest days in the darkness.

253
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm glad even the carnivores get over it or die for you.

254
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,780
I get sad when I see you going to hospital.

255
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,080
Tell those guys, those are my best friends.

256
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,080


257
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,920
Go, go, make sure you talk with your hero best friends around.

258
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,660
Tell them all about me.

259
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:02,660


260
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,420
All right.

261
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Alejandra!

262
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,960
So as you can see, my life was pretty well messed up.

263
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,320
It's just, it's just the Lord that some of you caught me when I wasn't stoned out of my head.

264
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,120
I think the thing that got to me most was that, with me, everything was wrong.

265
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,160
But you showed me love.

266
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,260
Is it worth it?

267
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,520
A man might live with an alcoholic.

268
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,520
A man might live with a dope addict.

269
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:13,120
This man could live with his wife, but not his wife's habit.

270
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,040
People whisper, it's unnatural.

271
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,640
His wife's habit is tormenting, never sleeps.

272
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,560
Her habit leads her to dangerous places.

273
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,240
And under the influence of the devil, she's a woman.

274
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,520
Unrestrained pleasures.

275
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,520
Yes, people whisper, it's unnatural.

276
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,720
A habit born of reckless passion.

277
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,640
His wife's habit is tenderness and violence.

278
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,020
His wife's habit compels her to convert others.

279
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,260
Even her young, innocent daughter.

280
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,660
When you see his wife's habit, be ready to feel a sensation too startling to describe.

281
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,240
We're going to tune you in onto what's happening.

282
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,220
Now this here is called the The Man Who Made Me.

283
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,220


284
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,880
It's called A Joint.

285
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,560
In a world where drugs were the only gods, she couldn't say no.

286
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,660
I may be a junkie, Rich, but I'm no fool.

287
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,960
Weekend with the Babysitter.

288
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,940
A film that shows that communication is more than just words.

289
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,420
A motion picture that hits home.

290
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,780
Maybe your home.

291
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:02,380
I can see you, you can see me as we stand.

292
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,600
We can live forever, God, and God is wonderful.

293
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,940
Here they are.

294
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,740
The hippies.

295
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,160
The mind blowers.

296
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,560
The pot smokers.

297
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,740
The psychedelic dropouts.

298
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,840
They're the Cosmo Changers.

299
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,240
Reaching for everything.

300
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,360
And wantonly giving love.

301
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,200
Becoming the world's greatest.

302
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,180
Becoming a citizen of a weird new world.

303
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,200
Of voluptuous visions.

304
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,320
Debauched delights.

305
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,340
And bizarre sensualities.

306
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,980
Reality is a bad trip.

307
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,840
Love is beautiful.

308
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,140
People raise their voices.

309
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
Don't get caught in that mess.

310
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,960
Like a fly in a spider's web.

311
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,100
Is it true more is less?

312
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,180
Herded like a happy flock.

313
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,360
To the big TV slaughter.

314
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,720
Why don't you break that leash?

315
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,500
Something happened to her seat.

316
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,300
It's a new generation.

317
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,920
It's a hallucination.

318
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,620
It's a mystic vibration.

319
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,620
It's just intimidation.

320
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,280
It's the will of the people.

321
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,000
It's the church with the steeple.

322
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,280
It's the sacred devotion.

323
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,220
To our plan of denotion.

324
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,700
People raise their voices.

325
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,840
Becoming the world's greatest.

326
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:01,840


327
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,400
When your friends and your neighbours push.

328
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,440
Why don't you push them back?

329
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,820
Don't you think the time has come.

330
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,820
To stand up and be heard?

331
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,900
Ain't no use to try and wait.

332
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,880
For the magic word.

333
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,880
It's a new generation.

334
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,680
It's a new passion.

335
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:27,680


336
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:27,680


337
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:27,680


338
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,620
It's a new perpetuation.

339
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,700
It's a beautiful body.

340
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,840
Both erotic and deadly.

341
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,560
It's the fear of the future.

342
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,280
It's resurgence and suture.

343
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,660
It's a spandex obsession.

344
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,240
It's a lasting impression.

345
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,360
Feel the power.

346
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,220
Feel the power.

347
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,680
That's the power.

348
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:57,680


349
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:57,680


350
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:57,680


351
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:57,680


352
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:57,680


353
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,980
Baptized in electronic water.

354
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,880
Honorable sons and beautiful daughters.

355
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,660
With smiles and bows and rosy cheeks.

356
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,620
And a righteous path.

357
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,280
Do you feel the power?

358
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,140
Do you feel the power?

359
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,960
The voice sounds reassuring.

360
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,680
Completely thorough and so alluring.

361
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,480
It's lived a thousand times before.

362
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,360
And seen the world through soul to soul.

363
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,020
The calmness and tranquility.

364
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,360
That oozes credibility.

365
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,660
With wisdom and confidence.

366
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,760
To see the screen of common sense.

367
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,000
And it makes you feel just like a babe. Daddy holding you tight.

368
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,000
Alright, that is my say with you tonight.

369
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,900
Now he's got you by the balls.

370
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,500
He can sell you anything and all.

371
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,520
From morality to diamond rings.

372
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,120
To genocide to magazines.

373
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,060
From religion to cosmology.

374
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,440
To the end of a democracy.

375
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,300
It's a new generation.

376
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,840
It's divine inspiration.

377
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,940
Always ready to follow.

378
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,540
Never willing to swallow.

379
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,660
All the doctors, doctors, doctors.

380
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,360
All the prescriptions.

381
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,000
All the mystic inscriptions.

382
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,300
It's a standing succession.

383
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,920
It's a lasting impression.

384
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,480
It's a calm invitation.

385
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,480
Of a tranquilized patient.

386
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,840
It's a hallucination.

387
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,480
It's a new generation.

388
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,940
It's a young generation.

389
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,440
it's a new generation.

390
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,180
It's a new generation.

391
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,520
It's a new generation.

392
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,200
It's a new generation.

393
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,200


394
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Uf uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. Uf. U. Ufapardashk listened to these remarks.

395
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,880
guitar solo

396
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,820
guitar solo

397
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,300
Ah, yes, and that was Oingo Boingo.

398
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,420
I got my ticket.

399
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,920
Uh, so we've...

400
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,260
I was going to try and tell you what all we've been listening to,

401
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,440
but, you know, I haven't...

402
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,300
I haven't been able to keep up because our phone's been just

403
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,160
ringing off the hook tonight, friend.

404
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,900
Well, I think that's all the business I'm going to get today,

405
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,300
so unless you have something to buy or sell...

406
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,700
Actually, I do have some business to conduct with you.

407
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,040
You do?

408
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,060
I would also like to make a loan.

409
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:26,920
But...

410
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,260
You have $15,000.

411
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,120
That belongs to the Burns family.

412
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,380
I need money for something personal.

413
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,840
What will you give me?

414
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,420
Well, it depends. What do you have for collateral?

415
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,360
My soul, and seeing that I am a priest,

416
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,100
that should be worth a great deal more,

417
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,100
like everything you've got, correct?

418
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,480
Incorrect.

419
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,820
You see, priests are the only ones that never pay back their loans.

420
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,780
I can't quite understand it myself,

421
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,920
but needless to say, I don't pay anything for a priest.

422
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,060
They're not worth it.

423
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,240
I guess the devil gets them for free.

424
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,320
Amusing.

425
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,880
Well, if that's all, I guess I'll let you go.

426
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,980
There's one more thing, actually.

427
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,840
Well, there is?

428
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,220
Yes. Do you sell guns?

429
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,140
Guns? Are you blind? They're all over the wall.

430
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,240
No, I mean handguns.

431
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,340
Handguns? Now what would a minister want with a handgun?

432
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,140
Are you putting me on?

433
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,120
I thought your business was business.

434
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,800
What do you care about my purpose?

435
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,780
Whatever you say.

436
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,180
I've got handguns. I've got tons of them.

437
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,700
Here's a display case right here.

438
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,720
I covered it up just before you arrived. See?

439
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,480
Whatever you want.

440
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,500
Got a .38?

441
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,220
Sure, right here.

442
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,660
I'm putting her in the front.

443
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,520
May I see it?

444
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,700
Well, you see with your eyes, not with your hands.

445
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,580
Just kidding. Here, here you go.

446
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,760
Is the safety on?

447
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
Well, no. It's unloaded.

448
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,760
Got any bullets?

449
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,180
Look, I'm a pawn shop. I'm not a sporting goods store.

450
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,360
If you want some ammo, there's a shop called Vincent's that's not far from here.

451
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,560
Yes, I know. That's where I got these.

452
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,020
Are they the right type?

453
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,100
Well, those are .38 calibers, but I really wish you wouldn't load the gun in here.

454
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,580
But what harm could I do?

455
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,680
Well, I don't know, but I really wish you'd take those out.

456
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,020
Accidents can happen, especially if you're running with guns.

457
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,700
Oh, I know guns well enough. See? Hold your wrist like so.

458
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,620
Oh, please. Don't aim that thing at me. It might go off accidentally.

459
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,020
Don't worry about it going off accidentally. Worry about it going off deliberately.

460
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,200
What do you mean? You're not trying to scare me, are you?

461
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:16,240
No, that wouldn't do any good. You'd make promises. But the Prince of Darkness is the King of Lying.

462
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,240
Isn't that right, Mr. King?

463
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,260
What, are you crazy? You're not actually thinking of using that thing, are you?

464
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,420
You're a priest.

465
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,000
The Bible says that.

466
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,840
The Bible says thou shalt not kill. You'd burn in hell if you believed in that sort of thing.

467
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,980
I was wondering how long it would take you to quote the Bible.

468
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:37,540
Few are as good at manipulating it as the devil himself, and no doubt it's worked up until now.

469
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,820
But I happen to read the Bible myself.

470
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,980
Thou shalt not kill is the King James translation of the Bible.

471
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,000
God's actual commandment, as he stated it in Hebrew, is thou shalt not commit murder.

472
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,020
Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being.

473
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,000
Satan is not a human being.

474
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,400
And it is God's law to send Satan to hell, and that's where you belong.

475
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,880
Return to hell, Lucifer, in God's name!

476
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,700
And deliver us from evil.

477
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,420
You're having a good time tonight, boys, yes, we surely are.

478
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,420
Hello out there in radio land.

479
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,360
Prell here, inviting you to enlist as a soldier in America's war against drugs.

480
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,220
And it's so easy.

481
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,920
When someone offers you drugs, just say, you're under arrest.

482
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:38,600
That's right, narcotics are illegal in America, and possession and or sale of illegal substances is just a sort of information police want to hear.

483
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,500
Now some of you are saved, but they're my friends.

484
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,460
Baloney!

485
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,200
Friends don't offer friends chemical poisons.

486
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:51,600
So remember, when the enemy offers you drugs, don't turn the other cheek, turn them in.

487
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,440
You'll sleep much better after doing your civic duty.

488
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,460
A message from this great station, and yours truly, Papa Prell.

489
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,440
Crushing the Curry Corporation.

490
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:12,960
That's right, and they had to start up again from the very beginning and build themselves up by their own bootstraps.

491
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,220
But that's exactly how Japan won the war.

492
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,580
Well, someone said that they won it, but I hardly gave it any thought.

493
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:21,580


494
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:21,900
Any credit?

495
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,420
Uh, I can almost hear my own breath now.

496
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,220
Yes, and they can hear it out in the radio world, too.

497
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,980
They can taste it, too, I imagine.

498
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,060
Yeah, I'm sorry.

499
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:42,960
I really suggest that everyone who's hale and hearty seize a microphone and start the lusty life of the airwaves right away.

500
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,080
Well, Dr. Howell, I've got two microphones in front of me, and I can't hear anything on my headphones.

501
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,960
It's causing incredible distortion and feedback, too.

502
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,880
What a show. What a show.

503
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,560
Here you are, boy.

504
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,860
Yes, it started millions of years ago, of course, back in the Proterozoic Age.

505
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,440
Shows like this were just too good to be true.

506
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,860
Don't we have yet another member of our quorum here at the station?

507
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,980
But where is she? Somewhere wandering out among the corridors, the kickashaws and goo-gaws of KPFA?

508
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,220
No, she's out wandering amongst the, uh...

509
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,940
...the horrible backwoods.

510
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,640
Back alleys of birth. Oh, no, there she is. Okay.

511
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:36,060
No, you see, I thought Allison would come in and take a seat and join the Quorum of the Stars here on the most exclusive show ever done, secretly famous here on KPFA 94.1 FM on your radio dial.

512
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:44,020
Wait a minute, Dr. Howell, what do you mean, what do you mean, KPFA? I thought this was K-N-O-N in Dallas, Texas.

513
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:50,940
You thought this was K-N-O-N, right. Well, but Federal Bureau of Demonology Standards and Practices prohibit us from giving false call letters or illusory or misleading signals.

514
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:50,940


515
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
That's right.

516
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,040
I don't make these rules, I just...

517
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,180
Roger to that, Doctor. Howell.

518
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,640
That's right, we don't want to imperil our status as a non-affiliated broadcaster.

519
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:06,280
And for that matter, uh, they won't allow the truth to be told either.

520
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,300
Yes, for without tooth there can be no lies.

521
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:18,720
Now, I suggest we all take a deep breath and take a stress pill and start again. There will be a show later.

522
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,100
As soon as, uh...

523
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:31,160
As soon as certain planets are in alignment and certain buttercups open their faces to the sun and drops of dew fall on, uh, tiny deformed lizards scuttling through the grass.

524
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,460
There they are now.

525
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,560
In fact, that's a sound effect I'd like to hear again if it's, uh, at all possible.

526
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,720
Oh, there it is, yes. It's really remarkable.

527
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,520
I think you ought to be really careful. That's actually some coffee dripping on the board over there.

528
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,460
Oops, ah, is my countenance crimson.

529
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,080
Well, I, if I only had some carts, I could play Babies Crying, uh, Volcanoes Crying.

530
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,840
But it's, it's, it's a little over-the-top, and I, uh, I think it's a little over-the-top.

531
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:59,100
But, uh, it seems that the brow, in his haste to be off, left all the records and sound effects and tapes all locked up. But why do we care about that?

532
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,200
All right, let's start the show now.

533
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,480
A dear friends out there, uh, in, uh, Radioland,

534
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,900
It's so good to be here in, uh, among the Bay-Arians. I, I just...

535
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:16,040
Yes, your Bay-Arian destiny. You must grasp the nettle for your, oh, sorry, pardon me. Go ahead.

536
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,060
I, I, I'd just like to, uh, share something.

537
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,060


538
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,660
I left my wallet in my other pants.

539
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,140
I left my antibiotics at home.

540
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:32,420
Yeah, let's not get squirrely like John Squirrely and over-antibioticize.

541
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,840
Well, I'd just like all the listeners out there to join in

542
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,940
in something that almost never happens on this show,

543
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,440
that traditional old thing that we do out in Texas and Arkansas

544
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,860
on the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack,

545
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,960
originating from K-N-O-N, which, of course, we really are.

546
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,140
And we'd like you to participate if you could.

547
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,180
And, friends, yes, just join us.

548
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:03,380
Just bow your heads for a quiet moment of the sacred noise!

549
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,240
Well, that's one way to do a show.

550
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,760
That's one way to do a show right off the air.

551
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,340
Yes, I've both cut off.

552
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
I've cut off your microphones because you're just irresponsible,

553
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,540
trying those antics and hijinks here.

554
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Oh, he's no fun.

555
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,480
Look at him there.

556
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,840
His forehead was smoking once those meters peaked.

557
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,460
All right, I've put it back to your peak operating capacity.

558
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,260
Oh, very well.

559
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,720
But don't abuse the responsibility of the airwaves again.

560
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,340
Well, the listeners should have gone to their windows,

561
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,100
thrown them wide open, and announced to the world that, yes,

562
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,580
they were up and they were listening to this show.

563
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,560
Some of them are.

564
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,860
Some of them are.

565
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,120
And I will attempt once again,

566
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,960
to engage these listeners in a dialogue on the air.

567
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,760
But, you know, it's complicated, folks.

568
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,620
I don't know how it works.

569
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,100
So let's see once again if we can talk to these.

570
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,500
Radio dialectic going here.

571
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,980
Your happy eater asks you to bow your heads in silence

572
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,260
for 15 seconds in memory of those who have passed away

573
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,800
while watching our next attraction.

574
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,560
Please bow your heads.

575
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,480
Can we be sure that there is no evil force at work in the world?

576
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:13,880
No.

577
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Just as there are forces.

578
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,500
For the good.

579
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,540
Nothing you have ever seen before

580
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,940
and nothing you have ever heard before

581
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,500
will prepare you for the shock of...

582
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,140
My baby is black.

583
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,040
The black musicians.

584
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,460
I've never thought of them as being people.

585
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,880
Or were the past, future problems as...

586
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,480
as...

587
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,340
human beings.

588
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,020
That's right.

589
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,360
You see them as machines.

590
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,940
Turn out pleasure.

591
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,420
To make you dance, laugh, sing.

592
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,000
To give you a merry time.

593
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,720
You know, when people go home.

594
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,260
You forget all about them.

595
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,200
Negroes.

596
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,780
There is nothing funny

597
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,100
about a rat.

598
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,920
Rat fate.

599
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,040
They carry on swimming.

600
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,140
But there is also this secret...

601
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,380
A rat saying....

602
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,940
rat affects my life

603
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:33,160
What is love?

604
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:33,800
It's torture.

605
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,580
Where are they?

606
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,200
As intelligence spills.

607
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,200


608
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,200


609
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,200


610
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,780
The watatién is a papi moth ich mi gaud finds.

611
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,660
How do you go about giving Monday Mother's Day a go?

612
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,900
que oor Derweishachin does read it?

613
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,400
surprise scuffed wingtie What's bing?

614
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,020
I'm the kind of woman

615
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,360
Not hard to understand

616
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,520
I'm the one who cracks the whip

617
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,580
And holds the upper hand

618
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,220
I'll beat you, mistreat you

619
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,560
Till you quiver in quails

620
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,760
The female of the species

621
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,800
Is more deadly than the male

622
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,000
No kidding.

623
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,760
When you mess with me, I'll burn

624
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,060
Around with the flame

625
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,360
When you find that you've been burned

626
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,060
You've only yourself to blame

627
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,080
I'll hurt you, desert you

628
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,240
If you ever should fail

629
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,600
The female of the species

630
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,740
Is more deadly than the male

631
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,380
I don't know what you're doing

632
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,740
I know.

633
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,740
I'm sorry.

634
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,320
ah ah

635
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,260
much Dovii

636
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,360
music

637
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
hahahaha

638
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,840
all ghosts set on attack

639
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,520
removes every factor

640
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,200
there, you

641
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,520
there, me

642
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,880
there, who

643
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,020
Um, um, what's all the hubbub?

644
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,560
B-b-b-bub.

645
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:01,980
These blockbuster bombs don't go off unless you hit them just right.

646
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,040
Watch out!

647
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,500
Not.

648
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,020
Oh, yeah.

649
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,700
Chaps, hundreds of them.

650
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,560
This calls for strategy.

651
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,280
Here's yours, bold eggs.

652
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,920
Here, one for you, monkey face.

653
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,780
That boat shop is plenty for all.

654
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,380
Everybody gets one.

655
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,220
In seconds, the fireball erupts into a geyser that towers 25 miles into the stratosphere,

656
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,100
spreading into a hundred mile wide mushroom cloud.

657
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,840
Well, that's that.

658
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,820
Oh, I think this is booming.

659
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,680
Notice how he keeps from moving or from getting up and running?

660
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,320
Believe me, sweetie face, it's a pleasure.

661
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,740
Bomb can explode any time of the year, day or night.

662
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,440
That boat shop is plenty for all.

663
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,500
Everybody gets one.

664
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,740
You'd better get one.

665
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,500
Now, this is a little fun, huh?

666
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,760
Well, it's admittedly, there's a serious problem with the entire church of the subgenius in

667
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,500
that it is, one might say, the joke that dare not speak its punchline.

668
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,840
The light that failed.

669
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,840
The door that closed.

670
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,880
No, but there's yet a light at the end of that tunnel.

671
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,660
Tunnel.

672
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:10,800
Oh, yeah.

673
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:10,800


674
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,980
Yeah, the light at the end of the funnel.

675
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,080
Unfortunately, that light, in the case of many of us,

676
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,160
is nothing but a Mack truck coming straight at us.

677
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,180
But that just delivers us into the other world,

678
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,640
where we approach the blinding light of the isness of the beyond world,

679
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,620
which is itself just another giant Mack truck bearing down upon you.

680
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,040
It's perfectly, and the records are here, and the brow is tanked up on coffee.

681
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,040
But friends, we haven't reached that world yet,

682
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,800
and we may never reach it tonight,

683
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,480
because right at this moment, he's driving around Berkeley looking for you.

684
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,800
Yes, you.

685
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,740
He's got his show detector caller, and he's wondering if you're listening.

686
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,840
Who knows?

687
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,140
Oh, what a relief.

688
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,560
Now, can we shut up?

689
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,360
Can we go back to bed now?

690
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,800
Well, we could, in another life.

691
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,020
In another life.

692
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,920
In a better world than this.

693
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,460
But as we wander through life,

694
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,860
aren't we looking for something a little bit better than the usual radio show?

695
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,000
We're struggling. We're struggling.

696
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,500
Certainly, Bob insists on something better than what he's getting so far.

697
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,660
But on the other hand, really, what do you people care about?

698
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,560
Bob, when was the last time you said anything about J.R. Bob Dobbs on this show, Dr. Howell?

699
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,820
Well, I try to, but every time I do, a hairy hand,

700
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,480
reaches over and cuts off my ear.

701
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,220
Or a gun is thrust up into the roof of Bob's mouth.

702
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,100
Yes, or someone shoves a long knitting needle into one of my eyes

703
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,580
every time I mention the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

704
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,320
But now, with the brow out of the picture, we can talk about Bob all we like.

705
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,460
And, friends, who is that man, Bob, if he is indeed a man?

706
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,600
Well, Pastor Stang, let me ask you, wasn't it true that,

707
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,440
he received a divine immaculation by shocking the bee Jesus out of himself

708
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,160
through the back of a TV set?

709
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,340
Why, certainly it is, yes.

710
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,720
On the date of Bob's divine immaculation,

711
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,840
he received not just a 220-volt shock.

712
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,060
From his old Zenith, I might add.

713
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,440
Well, it was actually a television of his own invention.

714
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:39,620
It was a basic Zenith chassis that he modified with his interoster unit.

715
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:47,680
It was the moment when Jehovah One, the alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy,

716
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:56,180
chose to reach down with his stark fist of removal and raise up some mortal.

717
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,320
It could have been any of us.

718
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,540
You, perhaps, but no, Bob was luckier.

719
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,240
And so he became the living avatar of Slack.

720
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,460
It wasn't the first person to be chosen, though.

721
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,760
No.

722
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:09,800


723
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,440
No, nay.

724
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:16,460
Three or four others were chosen first, but could not survive the process.

725
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:23,980
And they became the stunted, malformed growths on the trunk of the tree of Bobly wisdom.

726
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:30,220
But Bob, due to the special fillings in his teeth, was somehow grounded.

727
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,800
He fumbled himself and became obedient to entropy.

728
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,560
Therefore we praise his name, which is above all others,

729
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,520
so that every tongue shall slave her,

730
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,700
and every knee shall water.

731
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,460
So that we, yes, can drag this show down into the depths.

732
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,360
Down into the bottom of a bottomless pit.

733
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,760
Now I see all you callers are out there trying to call,

734
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:58,340
but until we receive our word, we're not going to let anyone on this sleepy show.

735
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,480
Just went off.

736
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,420
Just as I thought I was figuring it out.

737
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,900
No, wait, here comes one back again.

738
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,740
So, without further ado.

739
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,540
You might be on the air. Hello?

740
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:08,920
Hello?

741
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,340
Oops, that was unfortunate.

742
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,460
That caused a glitch in our...

743
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,580
Oops, again, there we have another problem.

744
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,260
Whoops, oh, there went another problem.

745
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,520
Oh my gosh, yet another problem.

746
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,300
Why, the problems are snowballing around here.

747
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,180
Are you sure you can't hear us callers?

748
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,140
I mean, we can't hear you.

749
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,840
Hello, you're on the air.

750
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,400
Radio of the deaf.

751
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,000
Well, fortunately we can offend deaf people,

752
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,320
because this is Berkeley, and they can't complain,

753
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:44,400
but I must remind you that other minority groups are not to be tampered with,

754
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,240
even here at 4.30 in the morning,

755
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,360
or else we might lose our license according to the Federal Bureau.

756
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,640
But nobody worries about the subgeniuses.

757
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:50,960
Uh-uh.

758
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,360
No, you can say anything you want about the subgeniuses.

759
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,540
The ultimate minority.

760
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,600
They seem to like it.

761
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,080
The ultimate pressure group, the ultimate splinter group,

762
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,080
are the subgeniuses,

763
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,920
and we have two subgeniuses here in our studio this evening.

764
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,600
Emma Fordyce-Weirbogger,

765
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,300
and Robert,

766
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,040
Ralph Fielding Snell are with us tonight.

767
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,940
Good evening, sir, madame.

768
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,180
Did you appreciate the church air serenade earlier this evening?

769
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:18,940
Mm-hmm.

770
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,200
And what was it that struck you as the most unique aspect of this ceremony?

771
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,100
The seating arrangements.

772
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,640
Ah, yes, the vinyl seating, the vinyl solution.

773
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,100
Some might call it the vinyl frontier.

774
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,500
The vinyl fullback?

775
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:38,720
We do.

776
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,020
I'm Seb.

777
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,800
That's right.

778
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,600
hillock

779
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,880
You got me looking at life.

780
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,200
You got me searching down overcome.

781
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,360
You got me another life.

782
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,280
You got me looking down on me.

783
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:24,580
You said I should accept all this

784
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,340
You think it's funny

785
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,320
But what I say is true

786
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,420
The reason that I live like this

787
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,740
Is all because of you

788
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,180
You got me looking at life

789
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,440
You got me searching down the road

790
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,220
You got me all on you

791
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,320
You got me jumping right in front

792
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:06,720
You got me looking at life

793
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:36,720
You got me looking at life

794
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,180
You got me looking at life

795
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,720
You got me searching down the road

796
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,960
You got me searching down the road

797
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,240
You got me all on you

798
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,440
You got me jumping right in front

799
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:36,720
You got me looking at life

800
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:04,500
You got me looking at life

801
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,420
You got me all on you

802
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:36,720
You got me looking at life

803
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,820
The guy you want

804
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,880
She's just a girl

805
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,180
She's just a girl

806
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,280
The guy you want

807
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,960
Look at you with your mouth watering

808
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,580
Look at you with your eyes spinning

809
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,620
Why don't we just admit it's all about you

810
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,860
That's the guy you want

811
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,320
She's just a girl

812
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,620
She's just a girl

813
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,640
The guy you want

814
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,660
She's just a girl

815
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,060
The guy you want

816
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,120
She's just a girl

817
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,520
The guy you want

818
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,720
She's just a girl

819
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,700
The guy you want

820
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:41,980
She's just a girl

821
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:41,980


822
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,760
Look at you with your mouth watering

823
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,300
Look at you with your mind spinning

824
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,340
Why don't we just admit it's all about you

825
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,640
That's the guy you want

826
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,940
She's just a girl

827
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,300
She's just a girl

828
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,320
The guy you want

829
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,460
She's just a girl

830
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,720
She's just a girl

831
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,760
The guy you want

832
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,700
She's just a girl

833
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,160
She's just a girl, a girl, you know

834
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,580
She's just a girl, she's just a girl

835
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:20,900
Ah

836
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,420
And you are still listening to the

837
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,000
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

838
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,200
For those of you who are used to hearing it this time

839
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:33,860
Also don't forget

840
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,160
If the show hasn't been terribly self-explanatory tonight

841
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,900
It might get that way before we're all done

842
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,020
You may write for that free information

843
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,200
Wait a minute, listen to the music

844
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,420
Whoa

845
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,920
And that P.O. Box is

846
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,660
Bob at P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas

847
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,900
The zip is 75214

848
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,520
I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to talk

849
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,100
Did you have a problem?

850
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:02,960
I'm dying

851
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,720
I'm dying

852
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,220
And

853
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,420
I'm dying

854
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:05,760
And I'm dying

855
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,000
And I'm dying

856
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,000


857
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,860
Waving not

858
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,940
But remain steady

859
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,640
Oh, you say that prop stick was a little too strong for your aim

860
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,180
But I said, well, they dropped the bill

861
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,500
And I'm changing it

862
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,200
I'm not sure I'm having a good time

863
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,060
I'm not going to wait

864
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,800
The sun's out tonight

865
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,440
I'm not going to sleep

866
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,440
Exactly

867
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,020
What are these processes?

868
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,400
I'm dying

869
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,580
I'm dying

870
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,540
I'm dying

871
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:33,540


872
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,020
I have to carry on

873
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,120
If you're looking for a bus to your old home

874
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,120


875
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,120


876
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,120


877
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,160
The bedpat

878
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,980
This soul water we squeeze down you tastes real good

879
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,600
Even at this moment

880
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,840
Your consciousness is sending emissaries

881
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,860
Fugitives

882
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,040
Fugitive soul consciousness

883
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:06,200
The citizens arguing in this very moment, arguing with the elder gods.

884
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:11,900
I think they're civilized. I think they're civilized scientists.

885
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:27,880
The punishment is summed by your willingness to participate in keeping us afloat just a little bit longer.

886
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,600
It is.

887
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:51,380
The pro-friend in this instance, fairly well.

888
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,780
Let's have a sip of the accumulation of tiny particles.

889
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,560
What is left is the average subgenus' mental identity.

890
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,600
After quaffing the essence,

891
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,240
I think he's drained almost from the excretions of the body.

892
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,820
As Bob has said,

893
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:20,400
every penny freely given counts as a molecularly altered percentage.

894
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,320
Another one made ill,

895
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,200
in the eyes of the ill-dressed.

896
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:41,220
An untoward nomination of your DNA encoding presupposed notions of exactly what you were supposed to tell Bob.

897
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:41,880
I'm sorry.

898
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:48,300
I don't think you should say a word to that oso floor at 야.

899
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,360
''Grandpa's dad?''

900
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:58,640
Well, if you think major ill-espeyeable,

901
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:58,700


902
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:58,700


903
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:07,040
So I better assume he's got modalities in a good and constant version of myself.

904
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,060
If you're interested in hearing more about all of this and these üzeryevals,

905
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:08,340
的 sectors

906
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:08,400
I две

907
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,160
of of him.

908
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:11,240
And straight back to the topic of one and only.

909
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,840
If the immense potential reading of your research appels you

910
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:11,880
to going back into universe making and editing worlds,

913
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,960
Certainly, in retrospect, this now seems to have been our greatest mistake.

914
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,800
So, what is the difference?

915
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,820
Examine this seemingly docile crowd,

916
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:28,160
and know that in some few, simmering beneath a placid surface,

917
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,760
there broils a veritable cauldron of repressed subgenius awareness,

918
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:38,260
ready at any moment to explode outward, often with catastrophic results.
