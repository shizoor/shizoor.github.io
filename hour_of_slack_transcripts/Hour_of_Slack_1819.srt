1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,880
I am just a dog.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,000
20 million men have had abnormal sex.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:04,960
Find out how.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,720
The Self Genius Power of Sweat.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,000
Specifically designed to target mouth constipation for a full hour.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,660
I was a nun.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,600
I was married to God.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,280
Then I asked for a divorce.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,880
And he gave me the world.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,260
That surprise winning poem by our little girl here, Rosie Rottenkrotch.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,800
You thought I wasn't going to introduce her, didn't you?

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,100
I thought we'd never see her again.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,740
We bring her up here for her last visit.

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,520
She's going over to the school later today.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,120
They're taking her in the Woody station wagon that's outside with Woody the Woodpecker on the outside.

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,100
To the little Woody, Woody, Woody, Woody, Woody, Woody Woodpecker school.

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,200
Just down the road where she'll be okay again.

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,860
A little while before she's gone.

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:54,860


20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,440
But first, before that, let's introduce her to the crowd.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,540
Here she is, little Rosie Rottenkrotch.

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,300
Thank you, thank you, boys.

Yes, all right.

No show, which Doug Wellman loves.

79
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,500
I love you, no show.

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,280
I love you, no show.

81
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,940
The government totally sucks, you mother of a...

82
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,360
Yeah, if you're in North Korea, the government totally sucked.

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,980
Ben Franklin was a rebel indeed.

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,400
He liked to get naked while he smoked on the scene.

85
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,480
He was the kingiest, but if he was here today,

86
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,060
the government would buttercup his right to your day.

87
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, let me tell you something about the government.

88
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:21,960
What?

89
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,060
Blowing up the environment.

90
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,300
Hey, what?

91
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,060
Taking all the freaking beautiful animals, yeah.

92
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,520
And making them freaking extinct.

93
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,360
Oh, no!

94
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,180
The government totally sucks, you mother trucker.

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,180
The government totally sucks.

96
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,580
The government totally sucks.

97
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,560
In North Korea.

98
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,140
Because the land of love and freedom

99
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,300
is just a baby's breath away.

100
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,800
And if we hold hands together,

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,840
we can bring back the USA.

102
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,880
The USA.

103
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,340
Bring back the USA.

104
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,260
Not the NPRK.

105
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,900
No, the USA.

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,140
Here on KPFA.

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,800
94.1.

108
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,840
KPFA in Berkeley, 88.1.

109
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,320
Bring back the USA.

110
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,380
Oh, yeah.

111
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,640
KFS, KC, KF, KF, KF.

112
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,760
And remember, the government totally sucks.

113
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,920
Wherever you are.

114
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,700
Was that the D?

115
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,260
Yeah.

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
The government totally sucks.

117
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,440
I've never heard that song by the D.

118
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,260
I thought it was Conspiracy Rock for a second.

119
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,520
Oh, that was a great band, Conspiracy Rock.

120
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,620
Yeah, they got that.

121
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,620
I want to more of rock.

122
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,320
Then there's Turok.

123
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,640
We were talking about Turok.

124
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:44,940
Turok, yeah.

125
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,320
Turok, Son of Stone.

126
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,420
Then there's Turok.

127
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,040
Deadly Spell.

128
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,540
Decimons.

129
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,960
That's my new goth band, Deadly Spell.

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,620
Oh, I bet there's 20 D.

131
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,820
You better Google that one and see if there's somebody that doesn't already have that name.

132
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,180
Oh, yeah, there is.

133
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,900
I looked up.

134
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,120
I was trying to contact Sister Decadence.

135
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,880
For some reason, I Googled Sister Decadence and discovered that there were something like

136
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,920
a hundred different bands out there named Decadence.

137
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,840
Yeah, it's like poor K-Rob.

138
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,000
You know, one day we went and looked for K-Rob.

139
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
And there were 100.

140
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,520
100 K-Rob.

141
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,040
50 of them in each city in America.

142
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,600
Well, you get on Facebook and there's something more Bob.

143
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,320
There's so many Bob Dobbs that your finger gets tired scrolling down.

144
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,280
I'm tired of scrolling.

145
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,140
So stupid.

146
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,080
Yeah, there's thousands and thousands of them.

147
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,520
Every now and then, one of them shows a different guy and it's probably someone whose name is

148
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,940
Robert Dobbs.

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,780
James Robert Dobbs or something.

150
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,060
So here we are on the show.

151
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,260
I feel sorry for those guys.

152
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,360
And you can call the November 4th Bureau of P.I.V.D. area code to find us.

153
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,040
I'm Robert Dobbs.

154
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,040


155
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,040


156
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,580
You're listening to KFAB and the Positive Evidence Show.

157
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,620
Or as heard on Hour of Slack, calls get lost, missed, knuckles up, dressed up, and what.

158
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,500
So you can leave that part in because the angels were carrying him while he said that.

159
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,320
I hate to put your number out on my show because it doesn't make any sense.

160
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,620
When some poor guy here is going to get a call.

161
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,360
Once a month.

162
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,800
What?

163
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,960
At midnight.

164
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,040
The KFAB.

165
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


166
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


167
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


168
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


169
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


170
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


171
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


172
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


173
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


174
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


175
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


176
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


177
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


178
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


179
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


180
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


181
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,040


182
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,580
The calls from Cleveland are coming.

183
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,600
They are.

184
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,380
They're rolling in.

185
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,740
Rolling, rolling, rolling.

186
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,220
Trolling, trolling, trolling.

187
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,060
Keep trolling, trolling, trolling.

188
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,580
Keep those niggas trolling, trolling.

189
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,840
Yep, the heat's gone back up so the calls, but the calls don't sound bad now so maybe

190
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,420
that's not related.

191
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,980
Before the internet, Dr. Drummond, remember how we used to troll people on CB radio?

192
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,620
We had the urge to troll.

193
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,140
But then we didn't have the means of the internet.

194
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,140
We could only troll within about a 19 mile radius.

195
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,920
You know, that proves that trolling is genetic to the human.

196
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,140
All humans need to troll.

197
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,220
Well, all subgeniuses need to troll.

198
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,780
I thought he said he was a subgenius butt.

199
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,160
I wouldn't say all subgeniuses.

200
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,420
Okay.

201
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,280
Did you say a subgenius butt?

202
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,360
She said that we're trolls under the bridge.

203
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,020
When we were singing it, I thought he said he's a subgenius butt, but he says he's

204
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,020


205
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
a genius butt.

206
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,080
It's an album put out without the bad words, you see.

207
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,980
It's a genius of those guys.

208
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,760
It's the actual CD of the Pick of Destiny.

209
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,980
My copy of the Pick of Destiny was simply copied from a movie.

210
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,720
Copy.

211
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, that worked?

212
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,960
And this song, I don't remember that song being on in the movie.

213
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,740
Yeah, I haven't seen the movie.

214
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,240
It totally sucks.

215
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,460
Yeah, that wasn't in the movie.

216
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,080
That's in North Korea, not here.

217
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,660
I don't know.

218
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:47,660


219
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:47,840
I don't know.

220
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


221
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


222
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


223
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


224
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


225
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


226
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


227
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


228
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


229
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,840


230
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,220
I don't remember either.

231
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,700
Right, yeah.

232
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,300
And here comes the...

233
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
No, I didn't say that.

234
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,140
I didn't say that.

235
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,760
I didn't say that.

236
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,260
Mr. Gingrich will be seeing you when you get home from the show.

237
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,380
Here is police escort.

238
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,800
Pulls up in front of you and asks, Governor Rhodes will get me.

239
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,440
Which state is he?

240
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,420
He's the one...

241
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,280
He sends the National Guard to shoot the students at Kent State.

242
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,820
He did though, right?

243
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,960
And they name the radio station after him.

244
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,740
WCSB used to be located in Rhodes Tower, named after Governor Rhodes, who told the National

245
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,220
Guard...

246
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,660
That's something about them hippies.

247
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,440
That's still...

248
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,300
People up there get big heartache every...

249
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,100
What if you were on top of her, dead on the ground?

250
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,240
Yeah, they...

251
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,120
What if you were?

252
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:28,980
What if you were?

253
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,880
I know people who did see her dead on the ground.

254
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,080
Well, there you go.

255
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,920
One of them formed a band called The Diva.

256
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,320
That's right.

257
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,720
Yeah.

258
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,880
What do you want to be...

259
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,460
Because he...

260
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,220
Yeah, I think about that all the time.

261
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,160
It's just a second.

262
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,080
I can't get it out of my mind.

263
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,820
The sense of seeing that and then going and starting Diva, because that's the...

264
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,640
That's the only place you can go with that energy.

265
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,180
Well...

266
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,780
But there is a movie called Troll.

267
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,280
It's an Norwegian movie.

268
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,920
Troll Hunter.

269
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,680
Troll Hunter.

270
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,100
Troll Hunter.

271
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,240
Yeah, I have the Norwegian copy on my face.

272
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,420
Yeah.

273
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,320
I mean, my YouTube thing.

274
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:02,860
Yeah.

275
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,240
Because somebody's putting up movies, movies and movies.

276
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,360
I've got that one with subtitles.

277
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,500
I want somebody to look great in that.

278
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,320
They look like real fairytale trolls.

279
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,820
They kind of look like the old radio station.

280
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


281
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


282
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


283
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


284
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


285
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


286
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


287
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


288
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


289
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


290
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820


291
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,520
Well, they're more outlandish looking on that though.

292
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:23,960
They're...

293
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,740
I think we should call the president about it.

294
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,520
They're cartoonish, yet photo real.

295
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,720
That's what I liked about them.

296
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,060
They were like a crazy cartoon drawing that they rendered photo realistically with shaky

297
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,080
cam and fake night vision and everything.

298
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:46,860
I heard that they're American Hollywood mom and pop multi-conglomerate conspiracy is going

299
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,800
to make a Hollywood...

300
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,900
Hollywood version of Troll Hunter.

301
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
Well, maybe the Canadian chief will hear you this time.

302
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,980
Oh my God.

303
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,340
Which they'll probably change the title to Bigfoot Hunter.

304
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,080
I think they should keep Troll.

305
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,220
Well, yeah, but then it needs...

306
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,440
Yeah, but they're already Troll, I guess.

307
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,020
It's like, why remake it?

308
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,980
It's so...

309
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,620
The weirdness of it is that it's so Norwegian to begin with.

310
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,940
Oh, well.

311
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,860
It's Norwegian.

312
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,680
And I really like the fact that the trolls could smell the blood of a Christian man.

313
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,400
Yeah.

314
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,240
You couldn't bring...

315
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,340
Yeah.

316
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,720
It's okay if you're an atheist.

317
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,160
You could go troll hunting, but if you were a Christian man, you'd draw their attention.

318
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,540
They could smell you.

319
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,580
And they wanted to eat you real bad on account of your religion.

320
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,380
They wanted to eat you.

321
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,460
I smell the blood of a subgenius wallet.

322
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,660
Yeah.

323
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,060
Yeah.

324
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,980
Yeah.

325
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,460
Yeah.

326
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

327
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,920
Yeah.

328
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,800
Yeah.

329
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:41,920


330
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:41,920


331
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,400
Yeah.

332
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,720
Yeah.

333
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,400


334
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,280
Yeah.

335
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:47,700
Yeah.

336
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:47,800


337
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:47,800


338
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:47,800


339
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:47,800


340
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:47,800


341
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:47,800


342
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:47,800


343
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:47,800


344
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:47,800


345
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,080
Yeah.

346
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,540
Yeah.

347
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,280
Yeah.

348
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,840
I'm in the middle of the ocean time

349
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,140
And the feeling's laid back

350
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,840
All trees grow and rain's still low

351
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
But you know I keep thinking about

352
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,060
Making my way back

353
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm New York City born and raised

354
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,060
Now that I'm lost between two shores

355
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,040
Here I'll show you

356
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,140
Knock on the door

357
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,260
LH family home

358
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,040
New York's home

359
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,560
We'll never find no more

360
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,700
Now

361
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,780
I, I have given

362
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,060
Red corpuscles enough to fill a frigate

363
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,560
I am myself

364
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,220
To no one there

365
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,180
And they, they keep me alive

366
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,900
And no one but them

367
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,560
Oh not even the child

368
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,300
I am a cry

369
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,280
I am survived

370
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,720
I am alive

371
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,540
I am alive

372
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,560
And I have lost me

373
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,100
And can't even survive

374
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,120
Leaving me lonely still

375
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,560
So supply will never drop off

376
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,320
You understand?

377
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,560
Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of being a king?

378
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,460
And then became one?

379
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,300
He's too hideous

380
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,320
Well except for the names and few other changes if you talk about me

381
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,800
The story's the same one

382
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I got an evidence deep inside

383
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,560
I've tried it, won't let me go

384
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,440
You understand?

385
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm not a man who likes to swear

386
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,340
But I never cared for the sound of being alone

387
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,020
I am myself

388
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,280
To no one there

389
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,280
And they, they keep me alive

390
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,800
And no one but them

391
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,660
Oh not even the child

392
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,180
I am myself

393
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,660
I am survived

394
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,220
And I have lost me

395
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,440
I have given Red Corpuscles enough to fill the frigate.

396
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,800
You understand?

397
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,340
I understand.

398
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:56,980
The Rudy Schwartz Project, covering a beloved Neil Diamond hit from the album Sunshine Supers

399
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,580
Hits.

400
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,120
And now, back to puzzling evidence with caller thing Phineas Narco.

401
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,900
And I saw a documentary on the making of the thing.

402
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,780
Which the thing?

403
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,700
The 1982 or 84.

404
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:11,780
The thing.

405
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:11,780


406
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,160
I was on July 31 with John Carpenter.

407
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,960
Because as we were driving down Highway 10 here, I kept seeing billboards to, Do you

408
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,720
dare to see the thing?

409
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,980
Oh, yes, that's a different...

410
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,780
The thing seemed to be a gift shop.

411
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,700
It was on the other side of the highway, so we didn't pull over, but...

412
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,940
The thing, can you take it?

413
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,560
The thing.

414
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,940
How'd you like it?

415
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, can you take it now that you've seen it?

416
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,160
Maybe.

417
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,480
I may have mentioned this last week.

418
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,200
But one time when I was a kid, my family stopped on the highway to see the thing.

419
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,540
And it was an abused, aged chimpanzee.

420
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,940
Where's my father?

421
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,880
A hairless chimpanzee that picked all its own, scratched all its own hair off and lived in insanity.

422
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,260
Yeah, it was awful.

423
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,540
That was the thing.

424
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,160
I don't think anyone dares to see that thing anymore.

425
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,160
You know where that was, Phineas?

426
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,720
It was like 50 cents then.

427
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,080
I'm talking about in the middle of the previous century.

428
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,900
You know what highway that was, Phineas?

429
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,360
666?

430
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,260
Yep.

431
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,260
Aha.

432
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,320
Lucky guess.

433
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,000
Yep.

434
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,280
The thing.

435
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,700
The thing ones I saw were all on highway Interstate 10.

436
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,920
The thing.

437
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,540
Dr. Hall was familiar with it.

438
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,380
He knew about the Interstate 10 thing.

439
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,380
He said that one is a mummy.

440
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,000
The one I saw was a live abused chimpanzee and the one he saw was a mummy.

441
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,820
Ah.

442
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,800
There's also a mummy in Portland that's kind of a thing.

443
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:56,680
Down by the park in Portland there's a museum of Goldado with a cool...

444
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,700
No, it's a prospector mummy, I think.

445
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,120
Is it near the mystery hole?

446
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,520
Uh, it's in the same town as the mystery hole.

447
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,400
Have you been to the mystery hole?

448
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,820
I've been to the mystery hole.

449
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,080
Man.

450
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,900
Did you get the vapors of encouragement?

451
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,820
No.

452
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,180
Or was it vapors of enthusiasm?

453
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,140
No.

454
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:24,420
You got a little jar of these vapors and you signed a liability thing before you went down into the mystery hole.

455
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,100
And then it was...

456
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,700
It's like the whole world got tinier and tinier as you went down the ladder.

457
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,520
Yeah, okay.

458
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,120
To the point where you couldn't even use the ladder if it got so tiny.

459
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,060
And there were tiny doors at the bottom of the ladder.

460
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,360
And then you had to go through them with tiny things on the other side of the tiny door.

461
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,540
Thing one and thing two.

462
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,820
I just remember everything being really tiny.

463
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,520
Yeah.

464
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,100
Well, but do you remember everything?

465
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,600
Do you remember all the things?

466
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,060
No, I don't.

467
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,660
That's the weird thing about it.

468
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,060
I just remember...

469
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,280
Why?

470
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:55,980
Things!

471
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,380
See?

472
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,000
It's one of those thing things.

473
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,060
That's right.

474
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,040
Well, doctors, uh, I'm going to go to the mystery hole.

475
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,040


476
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,040


477
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,040


478
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,040


479
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,040


480
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,040


481
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,040


482
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,040


483
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,900
I shall bid you adieu.

484
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I shall bid you a do-do.

485
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,220
A do-do.

486
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,660
Oui, oui.

487
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,820
Oui, oui.

488
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,740
Monseigneur.

489
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,600
Oui, oui.

490
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,420
A do-do.

491
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,780
Keep up the good work and, uh...

492
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,820
Do you know who shot Liberty Valance?

493
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,280
No, I don't.

494
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:27,780
The man.

495
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,420
Well, that's...

496
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,900
It was the man who shot Liberty Valance.

497
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:39,000
If anybody can actually successfully answer the question of the night, who shot Liberty Valance, please call us now at 510-

498
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,040
But also...

499
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,700
I just gave the answer a little bit.

500
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,320
Alfredo Garcia.

501
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,820
You have...

502
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,000
I...

503
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,660
Was that por...

504
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,920
Was that a porno movie?

505
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,120
Oh.

506
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,500
Give some head to Alfredo Garcia?

507
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,660
No, from.

508
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,920
Oh, get some head from Alfredo Garcia.

509
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,360
Yeah.

510
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,620
Yeah.

511
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,280
I think that was a porno.

512
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,440
From the head of...

513
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,120
Alfreda.

514
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,440
Yeah.

515
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,880
Alqueda Garcia.

516
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,320
See, there's the porno movie.

517
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,040
There's a porno movie.

518
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,040


519
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,040


520
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,040


521
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,040


522
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,040


523
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,040


524
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,040


525
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,180
There's a porno title in there somewhere.

526
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,140
Yeah, there is.

527
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,620
Yeah, get the head of...

528
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,540
Alqueda Garcia.

529
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,780
Alqueda Garcia.

530
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,500
Alqueda Garcia.

531
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:15,600
Yeah.

532
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,740
Give, like, Machete versus Osama Bin Laden.

533
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,680
Porno movie.

534
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:34,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm struck down for helping to bring North Korea to South Korea, and the damage is severe.

535
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,240
And that...

536
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,860
Um...

537
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,360
To...

538
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,620
To...

539
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:37,840
To...

540
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,400
He...

541
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,780
Uh...

542
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,860
That's PR's Lucas.

543
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,380
On Wall Street 25, the National Weather Service now confirms this is PR News.

544
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,300
Or PR News Washington.

545
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,120
And it's reported that this is PR.

546
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,740
Hi, I'm the Everly Brothers, and in our business we hear a lot of talk about drugs.

547
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,080
The heavy message now is that speed kills.

548
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,680
It refers to a group of drugs called antipetamins, including Ops, Pep Pills, Math Dex, even many.

549
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,140
You see what speed drugs can do?

550
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,480
They're dangerous.

551
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,160
The?!

552
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,900
Personally, I think drugs currently

553
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,440
can be helpful in 여기에 r

554
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,920
So just watch the video used in this directed.

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:06,580
Thank you.

567
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,100
Yeah.

568
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,980
There's not often that

569
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,640
in the movies, I've also heard

570
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,860
mentioned that

571
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,620
Stanley Kubrick's movies

572
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,720
always have a

573
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,900
bathroom scene.

574
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,740
That's right. 2001.

575
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,900
And The Shining.

576
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,740
2001.

577
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,380
And Black or Orange.

578
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,460
And uh

579
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,200
What's the last one he did?

580
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,900
I shut that back.

581
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,400
Yeah.

582
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,360
But United went on

583
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,560
for about half a show and was trying to figure out why we liked it.

584
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,600
I did. I don't know why.

585
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,600
What about Paths of Glory?

586
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,100
No bad... Yeah, probably.

587
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,540
Latrine.

588
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,840
1957 or something.

589
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,820
Of course, we don't know.

590
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
We have to check in the unknown pile right now.

591
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,880
How come subgenius shows

592
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,340
turn into film history shows

593
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,520
for 20 minutes every time?

594
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,440
Because instead of having a life, we all watch movies.

595
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,320
Yeah, old movies.

596
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,900
My latest location I have

597
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,840
to go visit is

598
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,920
Goblin State Park in Green River, Utah.

599
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,300
I saw it in Galaxy Quest.

600
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,340
I was thinking,

601
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,660
some of this is painted in, but some of this is real.

602
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,120
I want to climb around on those real rocks.

603
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,040
On the big old round golf ball rocks.

604
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,660
Yeah, it's alien land.

605
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,060
Is that where Kurt Voskes

606
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,980
went to Gorn?

607
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,880
No, that's at Voskes Rocks.

608
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,760
I was there almost...

609
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,400
Bob Dobbs was almost busted there

610
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,140
a month ago, but I don't want to tell that story

611
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,620
anymore.

612
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,240
No, you told that story

613
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,280
on the last two shows.

614
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,540
The old blind ball.

615
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,800
The Voskes Rocks is where

616
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,640
Kurt walked and fought the Gorn.

617
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,420
And where

618
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,340
Planet of the Dinosaurs was shot

619
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,360
with music in there.

620
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,900
And they did some catch-up parts

621
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
of Jesus Christ Superstar there.

622
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,440
Most of it's filmed in Negev.

623
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,000
They run over to Voskes.

624
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,820
Sometimes you've got to do those extra shots.

625
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,100


626
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,800
I used to have a little Gorn action figure

627
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,600
when I was a kid.

628
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,000
Wow.

629
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,180
How much?

630
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,440
No, I'm not going to say that.

631
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,360
It had to be explained to me

632
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,160
two or three years ago

633
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,380
what a Gorn was because I had

634
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,400
forgotten. I was such a

635
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,340
bad nerd that I'd

636
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,520
forgotten the Star Trek character

637
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,940
of the Gorn and how

638
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,760
stupid looking it was.

639
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,440
Really? I understand the modern

640
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,280
day version is all ugly.

641
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,420
In fact, there is one in that movie.

642
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,300
There's a Gorn

643
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,560
in that modern day Star Wars remake.

644
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,920
The Gorn was a lizard-headed

645
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,040
costume man.

646
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,900
Oh, yeah.

647
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,680
In the fourth episode or something.

648
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,920
And it was really terrible

649
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,460
costume. Lizard-head man.

650
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
That was what made him so famous.

651
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,880
I didn't notice him because I'm always looking for the fake

652
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,840
caves made out of real nice thick aluminum.

653
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,880
Black painted aluminum they have in

654
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,840
Hollywood. You couldn't see that

655
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,780
when I was 12 years old.

656
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,300
But now you can see that.

657
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,600
You can see what everything

658
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,540
is made of. On Day Job Orchestra.

659
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,740
He's running around with a very

660
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,500
phallic stalactite.

661
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,880
There's that devil

662
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,480
in the dark.

663
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,020
I don't remember.

664
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,680
There's phallic stalactites

665
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,720
everywhere. That'd be a good band

666
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,940
named Phallic Stalactite.

667
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,840
The Petrified Penis

668
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,160
Forest.

669
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,760
There was a place

670
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,680
that was like that. It's called the City

671
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,480
of Rocks.

672
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,560
It looked like pagans had spent

673
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,060
millennia carving

674
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,820
giant phallic symbols

675
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,940
in the rock. But actually they were all

676
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,460
natural.

677
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,040
What about that spooky forest

678
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,060
that everyone goes to kill themselves

679
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,920
in Japan?

680
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,840
Yeah. I don't want to go there.

681
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,720
Suicide forest. I don't want to have

682
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,780
X Day there again.

683
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,860
It was a bad place

684
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,800
to have X Day.

685
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,760
We didn't make any money

686
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,280
either.

687
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,080
I can do anything on Google now.

688
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,740
You can go places on Google.

689
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,540
Except as long as it's not

690
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,000
real.

691
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,620
I've been doing both.

692
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,780
I'll Google a place and then I'll

693
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,300
go to the place.

694
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,900
The Puzzling Evidence Show.

695
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,260
I'm just so sad. And I'll gargle it.

696
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,360
Very sad now. Why sad?

697
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,060
Because no

698
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,880
queen of UFOs has come.

699
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:31,760
Enterprise episode.

700
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,440
I think we learned that UFOs

701
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,160
have fallen asleep.

702
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,920
And have Scott Bakula fighting a Gorn.

703
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,980
Is that Ragnar?

704
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,340
It is.

705
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,340
Ragnar's the one who had to explain to me

706
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,520
what a Gorn was again.

707
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,200
Because he was selling a t-shirt for

708
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,620
Magdalene that had a Gorn.

709
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,080
I honestly had been so

710
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,020
far from Captain Kirk

711
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,260
and Spock that I'd

712
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,740
forgotten.

713
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm trying to relearn everything.

714
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,060
The CGI Gorn that they had in the Enterprise.

715
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,500
Episode.

716
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,300
Right.

717
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,160
Oh, okay.

718
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,520
Well, Ragnar, I want to tell you.

719
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,660
I don't, I don't.

720
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,260
The Gorn.

721
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,060
The Gorn porn.

722
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,580
Now you're talking, man.

723
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,600
Now see, up until this point, I was thinking this is pretty nerdy.

724
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,100
The Gorn porn.

725
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,880
They're reptilians, right?

726
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,800
And they're very slow.

727
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
They're Gorn reptilian creatures.

728
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,120
Yeah, they're like sleazestacks.

729
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,220
They're like doing it.

730
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,640
Yeah, like doing it with a dinosaur.

731
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Yeah, they're really slow.

732
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,980
They're really slow.

733
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,100
They're really slow. Super slow.

734
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,560
They have dual

735
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,940
peni reptiles do.

736
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,380
I don't know about dinosaurs.

737
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,600
They may be different.

738
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,880
They're not reptiles.

739
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,060
But neither are Gorns.

740
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,640
Gorns aren't dinosaurs either.

741
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,900
They're different.

742
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,360
Dr. Hal, would a Gorn porn eventually end in a snub film?

743
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,820
Why, yes, it would.

744
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,340
Everything.

745
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,920
Everything would end in a snub film.

746
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,600
I'm surprised Hal's not listening and trying to call in right now.

747
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,840
As Dr. Leguim said,

748
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
nobody's biography

749
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,520
has a happy ending.

750
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,740
There was a fine garden that Antonio Carozzi kept.

751
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,480
There were tall, aggressive beanstalks,

752
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,980
jungles of cotton and tomato vines,

753
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,820
ears of corn like golden footballs,

754
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,480
and out front, placed there to conceal the tempting vegetables,

755
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,980
300 spindly marijuana plants.

756
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,400
I didn't even know it could be smoked,

757
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,760
Carozzi said, when North Tarrytown, New York police

758
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,140
harvested the offending shoots

759
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,540
and planted a drug charge on the 57-year-old Italian immigrant,

760
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,760
which was later discharged.

761
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,640
He visited his native village, Carmonda,

762
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,960
in the Arbruzzi mountains,

763
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,920
and brought back a packet of canapa seeds.

764
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,280
Camardans, he recalled from his youth,

765
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,500
used canapa fibers to make thread and cloth.

766
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,860
Its seeds are used in soups and candies.

767
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,940
The kids, Carozzi recalled,

768
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,700
used to carry them in their pockets

769
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,920
and eat them like peanuts.

770
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,740
Ironically, only the leaves are thrown away.

771
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,540
Always I wondered why in America,

772
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,200
where they have everything,

773
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,340
they did not have canapa seeds.

774
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,420
I look everywhere for them,

775
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,940
even in the bird seed.

776
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,940
How come, I wonder, they do not have?

777
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,120
Now I know.

778
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,380
Only the who of knows.

779
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,980
Those were the words of Harry,

780
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,000
the hash hedge, Carozzi, right?

781
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:15,860
Right.

782
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,040
The biggest dealer in the Italian section.

783
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,940
The biggest and the best.

784
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,900
Yeah, they used to eat these things, officer,

785
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,540
when I was a little kid.

786
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,080
Sure.

787
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,560
We don't do anything with the leaves,

788
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,160
we burn them.

789
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,120
They burn the leaves.

790
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,000
We burn them.

791
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,620
You burn whole books of them at one time.

792
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,960
You can make books on the burnings.

793
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,480
Yeah, you're right.

794
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,140
You can get 5 to 1, 6 to 1,

795
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,060
you can get 10 to life if you're not careful.

796
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,120
But you can get really stung, too.

797
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,240
And badly burned, man.

798
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,520
Yeah, man, some of it's sugared.

799
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,780
It sure is, baby.

800
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,240
Some of it is so sweet,

801
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,220
I put it in my coffee and that's how we use it.

802
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,500
So, smoke it.

803
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,380
That's for the crazy white guys

804
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,900
like Sir Walter Raleigh, you know, man.

805
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,600
We turned him on before he went back to England, you know.

806
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah?

807
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,460
Yeah, he went back and got his head chopped off, man.

808
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,760
We also turned him over.

809
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,020
He used to stand on his head.

810
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,480
He did.

811
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,500
He thought he was in China.

812
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,080
That's right.

813
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
Thought he'd get along with everybody.

814
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,780
What's weird, man, you ever seen a guy with eyes in his feet?

815
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,920
Yeah, sure I have.

816
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,460
Just like a potato, right?

817
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:09,900
Sure.

818
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,780
A spud upside down is an American, right?

819
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,240
That's what we used to call him, Spud.

820
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,900
Spud Raleigh, sure, man. I remember Spud Raleigh.

821
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,040
I was in gym class with him.

822
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,620
Yeah, Jim? Everybody else in my class is named Jim, too.

823
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,860
You must have gone to the same school.

824
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,980
Yeah, did you go to Jim High School?

825
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,760
Yeah, I sure did. That's where I had a plan.

826
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,500
Hi, Jim. What's your name, by the way?

827
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,360
Jim. How you doing, man?

828
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,700
What I'd like to know is why,

829
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,000
when you're watching late-night movies on television,

830
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,420
when all the kids are supposed to be in bed,

831
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,320
they take out the word God

832
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,880
from any European movie.

833
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,360
There's no usage whatsoever,

834
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,920
including when somebody says,

835
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,740
God bless you, it's on television.

836
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,860
Bless you.

837
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,760
I know why.

838
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,540
Oh, Jimmy?

839
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,100
All the other Jimmys, sit down.

840
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,220
The Jimmy I'm pointing at, stand up.

841
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:55,740
Jimmy?

842
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,920
Don't sit down in that.

843
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,040
Okay, Jimmy, come up to the microphone and tell me.

844
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,420
It's because God stays up late,

845
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,840
and it's Him who's watching.

846
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,140
That's right.

847
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,680
They don't want to offend Him.

848
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,600
You gotta get four fenders, right,

849
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,640
for God the four-wheeled man, right?

850
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,280
Sit down, Jimmy.

851
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,340
Sit down on what?

852
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,960
Sit down on Jimmy over there.

853
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,040
Okay, excuse me, Jimmy.

854
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,420
Ow!

855
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,220
Excuse me, can I borrow your Jimmy?

856
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,780
Yeah, but Jimmy over there, he's caught, right?

857
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,380
Just a second, Jim, I'll be right with you.

858
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,080
Get me out of here.

859
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,780
Anybody got any Jack?

860
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,080
I got some Jimson weed, though.

861
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,640
Jackson High School.

862
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,520
That's everybody named Jackson.

863
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,320
That's right.

864
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,460
Night in Jail Junior High School.

865
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,640
Solid geometry, Jackson.

866
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,200
Was that what yours was called?

867
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,420
That's just around the corner from us.

868
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,240
That's where Tiny went, right? Night in Jail?

869
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
I went to the Pink Penitentiary.

870
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,300
That's the baddest junior high school in Los Angeles.

871
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,180
The baddest, man?

872
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,740
The baddest, man, is Night in Jail Junior High School.

873
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,680
They still throw oil at each other there, man.

874
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,180
It's in Highland Park. Very heavy.

875
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,460
Brian Highland Park, isn't it?

876
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,700
I don't know. I can't keep up with him.

877
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,320
I'm dying.

878
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,060
The kind that goes on is,

879
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,000
And they lived happily ever after.

880
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,680
Forever and ever.

881
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,020
Those are my favorite kind of endings.

882
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,780
They lived forever in a century of bliss.

883
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,700
And then a decade.

884
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,280
And then another century.

885
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,400
And then an eon.

886
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,340
And then you get into the crow that comes to the mountain,

887
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,340
sharpens its beak.

888
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,440
And then you get into the crow that comes to the mountain,

889
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,440


890
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,440


891
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:32,980
and you know.

892
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
And the computer in the background.

893
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,200
Are you printing this out?

894
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,180
Open the bathroom door, please, Hal.

895
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,540
The script's printed like 30 seconds before we get there.

896
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,160
The script's printed like 30 seconds before we get there.

897
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,140
Open, Hal, the bathroom door.

898
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:51,560
Open, Hal, the bathroom door.

899
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,340
Quick.

900
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,520
I can't do that, Dave.

901
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,220
It's stuck.

902
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,500
It's stuck.

903
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,440
I can't do that, Dave.

904
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:02,740
Take it.

905
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,620
Must reach.

906
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,240
Oxygen switch.

907
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,080
Must reach. Toilet paper.

908
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,660
Must talk like William Shatner.

909
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:13,840
Must talk like William Shatner.

910
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,960
The History Channel presents Rest Stops of America.

911
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,260
The History Channel presents Rest Stops of America.

912
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,680
With your hosts,

913
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,060
Dr. Philo Drummond, Buzzing Evidence,

914
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,520
and Reverend Ivan Stagg.

915
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,060
And I'll tell you about the best restrooms

916
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,220
on your drive across America.

917
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,320
The best public restrooms you can get to,

918
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,440
The best public restrooms you can get to,

919
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,460
private restrooms that are sometimes

920
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,920
hard to get to, but

921
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,980
just as rewarding in those

922
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,000
times of trouble

923
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
when nature's call

924
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,260
is most urgent.

925
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,460
What about rest stops?

926
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,280
My favorite

927
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,060
rest stop is in Arizona

928
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,140
and it's called Texas Valley.

929
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,400
It's just past

930
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,880
Wilcox, Arizona.

931
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,700
Near Chiricahua

932
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,600
National Park.

933
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:06,140
And it is as good that rest stop is as cool looking as the five dollar national park.

934
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,140
Not that I would discourage people from supporting our national park.

935
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:18,020
But the state of Arizona, I suppose, the rocks around it were beckoning me.

936
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,080
But we basically just stopped for the rest stop.

937
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,580
Yeah, but it's the most scenic rest stop I've ever seen.

938
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,800
That's what's cool about Arizona.

939
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,260
Well, well kept.

940
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,520
When we got to California, the first rest stop we came to was closed.

941
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,460
And I thought, man, this is a bad sign.

942
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:41,160
If they're closed all the way to L.A., then we'll know that government is collapsing.

943
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,900
But the next one was open.

944
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,500
Not for long.

945
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:50,920
And there were signs everywhere saying, if you see anyone smoking, call this number.

946
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,220
Be a fink for America.

947
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,600
Report smoking in national parks.

948
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,500
And rest stops.

949
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,500
I understand fire danger.

950
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,740
Only you can prevent forest fires.

951
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:10,680
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's that as much as just the encouragement of finkery among Americans.

952
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,200
The sub-juniors, junior slack squad, when we take our campers out into the forest,

953
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,700
we've always taught them how to put their forest fires out when they were finished.

954
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,900
It's not out until you can lower your belly under the cold, wet ashes.

955
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,700
When they were finished warming themselves on the forest fire,

956
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,780
we always tried to teach them how to put the forest fire out if they had time.

957
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,820
Before they had to go back to civilization.

958
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,740
Turn in your parents in some sort of jack-chick-in nightmare.

959
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,160
Clean up your forest fire, boys.

960
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,660
I want you to stir that forest two times.

961
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,760
Report your neighbor.

962
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,240
Report your neighbor.

963
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,820
Remember, Smokey the Bear says,

964
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,220
only you can turn in your neighbor.

965
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,000
Only me?

966
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,960
I'm under pressure.

967
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,680
Oh, God.

968
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,820
Oh, thank God.

969
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,660
It was a nightmare about the communist takeover of America.

970
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,200
My opinion, traitors.

971
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,280
Smokey Bear didn't actually say that himself.

972
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,500
Those words were put into his mouth by a marketing PR firm.

973
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,900
Smokey was exploited.

974
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,120
The only bipedal...

975
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,740
Fully bipedal, clothes-wearing bear.

976
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,380
Yogi was just a legend.

977
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,800
But Smokey was real, and they used him.

978
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,820
They took him to government laboratories in the desert

979
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,880
and programmed him to talk about forest fires.

980
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,640
I hear some noodling going on there.

981
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,560
Poor Smokey.

982
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,420
What did they do to you, Smokey?

983
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,860
Help me.

984
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,240
Help me.

985
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


986
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


987
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


988
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


989
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


990
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


991
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


992
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


993
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


994
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


995
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


996
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


997
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


998
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


999
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


1000
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


1001
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,240


1002
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,380
I die now, my son.

1003
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:08,140
But soon there will come on the mountain a sacred fire from a pipe.

1004
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,700
His name shall be J.

1005
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,700
A man will come among you with one sandal and one pipe.

1006
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,020
Followed by a man with one testicle.

1007
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,660
And one morsel of froth.

1008
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,020
And followed by another man with one...

1009
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,760
One ear in the middle of his forehead.

1010
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,140
Now you're getting into the long...

1011
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,820
How come all these guys only have one thing where they ought to have two?

1012
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,280
What about the people who only have one when they should have dozens?

1013
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,080
What about a guy with only one nostril?

1014
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,040
Think about that.

1015
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,100
One nostril.

1016
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,160
In the center of his forehead.

1017
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,520
Full of red hair.

1018
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,340
Full of red hair.

1019
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,260
Yeah.

1020
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,220
Nice...

1021
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,580
Matted red hair.

1022
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,080
Matted red...

1023
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,000
Curly pubis.

1024
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,300
Public hair.

1025
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,140
In a nostril.

1026
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,240
That's all wrong, Dr. Drummond.

1027
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,160
And silly and juvenile.

1028
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,380
And I think it's...

1029
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,780
It lowers the general common denominator of public discourse.

1030
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,260
You made the show hurt, doctor.

1031
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,760
Yeah.

1032
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,640
Yeah.

1033
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,520
Look at that.

1034
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:22,800
I'm sorry.

1035
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,220
You should rub some homeopathic ointment on his chest.

1036
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,100
I'm gonna rub some salve into the...

1037
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah.

1038
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000


1039
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000


1040
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000


1041
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000


1042
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000


1043
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000


1044
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000


1045
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000


1046
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000


1047
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,660
Show's show...

1048
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,020
No.

1049
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,120
Oh, I forgot.

1050
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,860
The bag bomb.

1051
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,960
You have to use bag bomb.

1052
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,420
I'm gonna rub some bag bomb on the show's bag.

1053
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,320
Not that kind of bomb.

1054
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,720
Hey, man.

1055
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,180
That's not funny.

1056
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,280
It's terrible.

1057
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,240
The show's...

1058
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,940
The show's...

1059
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:46,800
Okay.

1060
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,320
I'm palpating the show's bag right now with this bag bomb.

1061
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,600
The show seems...

1062
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,460
This is one I didn't get.

1063
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:54,640
I didn't get it.

1064
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,040
Responder.

1065
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,220
Just a few Index Another .

1066
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,220


1067
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,380
wie

1068
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,660
I give Steve and I give-

1069
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,800
And a

1070
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,080
Should we check to the truck we take?

1071
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,740
I'm sure we'll take a ride.

1072
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,120
Well, I go off and check in the truck first.

1073
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,100
It's going way faster than I thought they would put the X in the motor.

1074
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,120
Kind of, I got leading reading.

1075
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,000
It doesn't make any sense.

1076
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,220
was a drone, she was a drag, paper and wire killed my brother and my sister too, and if

1077
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,840
you don't watch out, you know they're gonna get you, and if I don't watch out, you know

1078
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,880
they're gonna get me too, telephone, telephone, telephone, and I strangled, and I ripped the

1079
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,580
cord, and I saw the bone, and I heard these tweeting things, and twinkling lights, and

1080
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:54,480
there was nobody home, well now those nerve endings coming out of the bone, telephone,

1081
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,820
telephone, telephone, well I ripped the cord right out of the bone, and I saw the bone,

1082
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:05,300
the other gleaming white bone, telephone, paper and wire killed my brother and my sister

1083
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,220
too, and if you don't watch out, you know they're gonna get you, and if I don't watch

1084
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:14,940
out, you know they're gonna get me too, telephone, telephone, and I can't get away, and I can't

1085
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:21,920
get away, it's like a greyhound at the end of the hall, it's like a plastic horned devil.

1086
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,600
Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, a song called Telephone from Duck at the Radar Station,

1087
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,880
oh so paranoid, only one thing left to do, build your own Amsterdam.

1088
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,900
Well, Guido's here in the house, but he seems like he's in a garage or something.

1089
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,320
He's built his own Amsterdam.

1090
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,960
That's the look I got, he's got one eye pointed skyward and one to the ground.

1091
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,400
Perhaps we must build our own.

1092
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,500
Those ships, but in the meantime, since those ships are so dangerous, complicated and expensive,

1093
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,500
you can build your own Amsterdam.

1094
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,680
Of course, if they catch you doing it, they'll throw you in prison for 99 years.

1095
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,220
Yeah, they don't like that very much.

1096
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,980
But, people are doing it all the time.

1097
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,360
Yeah, man, everybody's building like their own private Amsterdam, see, you know, that's

1098
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,720
what the mind is for, you control your mind, you control your own private Amsterdam.

1099
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,040
Well, actually, I was more like thinking about your backyard or your garage.

1100
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,180
Oh, you control your back?

1101
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,840
Yeah, you can control your muscles in your lumbago, you can also control your cesspool

1102
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,540
and everything back there too, you know.

1103
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:36,100
If a yogi can control his lumbago, then make it into a whole separate, almost like another

1104
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,620
mind.

1105
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:42,560
A yogi can control his lumbago and give himself instant healing, but he can't eat a lousy

1106
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,080
piece of fried chicken or some, you know, spaghetti with meat sauce.

1107
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,200
You know what I'm saying?

1108
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,000
The guy can probably make himself fly, but he can't find a pair of shoes that actually

1109
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,420
fit.

1110
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:53,960
What?

1111
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:54,420
What?

1112
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:54,460
What?

1113
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,460


1114
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,460


1115
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,460


1116
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,460


1117
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,460


1118
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,460


1119
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,460


1120
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,460


1121
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,460


1122
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:54,660
What?

1123
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:55,840
What?

1124
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1125
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1126
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1127
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1128
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1129
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1130
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1131
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1132
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1133
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1134
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1135
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1136
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1137
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1138
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1139
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:55,840


1140
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,140
Well, that's the thing about being a holy man, you have to be not of this world, which

1141
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:05,160
usually means you don't have a job and you have to depend on handouts, that's what I

1142
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,320
do.

1143
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,600
Yes, but you are so unholy, I mean, if there ever was a word...

1144
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,680
Well, I'm a holy man of unholiness, you know, I mean, there's a tradition of that, it's

1145
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:16,960
legitimate.

1146
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,620
Not the fuck here.

1147
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:23,260
There's conventions, I mean, you know, I go to conventions with other holy men of unholiness,

1148
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,240
unfortunately.

1149
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,460
Yeah.

1150
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:24,460


1151
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,740
Like Anton LaVey or somebody?

1152
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,320
Well, unfortunately, some of the best ones are dead.

1153
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,580
Anton LaVey is dead, isn't he?

1154
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,400
Anton's dead.

1155
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,760
Koresh is dead.

1156
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,520
Now, do you think he went to hell or purgatory or heaven or Lumbago or any of those places?

1157
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,440
Disney Land.

1158
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,200
Disney Land.

1159
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,540
Guido said it best.

1160
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,500
He went to Disney Land.

1161
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,640
Can't you see the Church of the Satanist guy in one of those weird teacup rides, you know,

1162
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,500
like the Mad Hatter teacup ride or going maybe through Pirates of the Caribbean?

1163
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,660
Actually, I'm sure there was a time when Anton LaVey went through Disney Land.

1164
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,480
Yeah.

1165
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,960
I've been to Disney Land.

1166
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,400
That's before.

1167
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,940
I mean, lots of people go to Disney Land sooner or later.

1168
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,300
Well, Chaz.

1169
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,900
I thought it was really kind of boring and pink.

1170
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,740
Well, you've got to go.

1171
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,180
Epcot Center was cool.

1172
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,780
You've got to take the mystic tour.

1173
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:20,040
Like, Chaz, you know, if you want to be a real Satanist or a craft worshiper, Chaz went to the Crossroads.

1174
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,480
Chaz went to the Crossroads.

1175
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,340
You don't go to Europe.

1176
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,420
You've got to go down.

1177
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,260
You're going to the Mississippi Delta.

1178
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,580
Well, I wasn't trying to suck that mud.

1179
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,940
Suck that mud and suck the brain right out of that mud bug.

1180
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,480
Well, that's fine, but I just wanted to get high.

1181
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,180
What the hell was that thing about?

1182
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,840
What is this?

1183
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:45,920
I've been handed a soundtrack of the movie Constantine with Johnny.

1184
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,600
Keanu Reeves.

1185
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,840
Yeah, with Keanu Reeves.

1186
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,320
Yeah.

1187
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,320
Didn't our friend, Piss Baptist, John Shirley, write like a CD?

1188
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,280
Yeah, he wrote a...

1189
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:54,940
He wrote a...

1190
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,280
He wrote the second Constantine novel.

1191
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,440
I don't know if he actually read his novel.

1192
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,340
Or did he write the novel of that?

1193
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,560
He just wrote a...

1194
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,300
It was a comic book, then a movie.

1195
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,560
And then he wrote like an imagining of other events and things that happened.

1196
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,220
First, it was a subgenius gag on the show.

1197
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,100
Then it was a novel or comic book.

1198
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,340
Then a novel, then a movie, then a novel of the movie.

1199
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,060
And then a trailer.

1200
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,260
Then a comic book of the novel.

1201
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:18,560
Then a trailer.

1202
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,860
Then a theater poster.

1203
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,200
No, actually, the poster and the trailer came first.

1204
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,320
Yeah, that's right.

1205
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,820
Before the show joke, actually.

1206
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,660
We're not giving credit where credit's due.

1207
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,880
It's kind of like Machete.

1208
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:30,940
Yeah.

1209
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,640
Yeah.

1210
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,560
They made a musical out of it.

1211
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,100
And it was a pinball machine.

1212
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,520
And a Mattel toy set at McDonald's.

1213
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,280
Yeah.

1214
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:48,460
The little baby Machete and his baby villains and baby hookers.

1215
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,660
They were able to buy the Queen of UFOs special seat on the sex goddess thing

1216
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,460
with those little...

1217
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,960
With 103 little baby Machete things from McDonald's.

1218
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,600
You never know what's going to be valuable later.

1219
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,160
Exactly.

1220
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,040
Think if you still had that Pee Wee Herman talking doll.

1221
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,140
The wind up, the pull the string and he talks Pee Wee doll.

1222
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,640
Like the one Paul has in handcuffed facing the corner.

1223
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,400
That's funny.

1224
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,900
Potter Nostril has one that's being serviced by the Little Mermaid.

1225
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,480
A marionette Pee Wee.

1226
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,200
Pee Wee Herman is being taken care of by the Little Mermaid.

1227
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,680
I think we should redo Men in Black with Pee Wee Herman as the young guy.

1228
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,480
But Machete is now badass.

1229
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,160
Now Machete played by Paul Rubens.

1230
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,480
That would be interesting.

1231
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,580
That would be different.

1232
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,720
I mean the guy's done 30 Rock.

1233
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,980
He should be able to do Machete.

1234
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,360
Did I tell you I saw that in a theater?

1235
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,660
I went to see the...

1236
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,760
I think the Develettes.

1237
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,340
Yeah.

1238
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,340


1239
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,340


1240
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,340


1241
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,020
Young ladies.

1242
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:56,820
Very funny.

1243
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:57,960
That's what I'm talking about.

1244
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,420
And then yeah it was those two movies played on a big old screen.

1245
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,860
So when I saw Planet of Terror, whatever it was, the first movie was.

1246
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,380
It has Machete afterwards as a commercial.

1247
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,820
It was quite an experience because it was like sitting in the theater in 1970s again

1248
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:19,420
with big splices and cigarette burns in the corner and all that stuff that movies have.

1249
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,740
The soundtrack it was off.

1250
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,860
And then...

1251
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:21,960
And then...

1252
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,840
leap with the raw Mexican.

1253
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,680
Yeah.

1254
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:25,900
Machete.

1255
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,060
And things missing.

1256
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,700
Coming to theaters near you.

1257
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,320
They should have had, like,

1258
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,640
the smell of old cigarettes

1259
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,960
and cheap wine.

1260
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,340
Well, yeah.

1261
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,380
Yeah, yeah, true.

1262
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,400
That comes with the $150 DVD set.

1263
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:37,780
It's funny.

1264
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,600
There was one thing

1265
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,460
that he had to shorten.

1266
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,080
In real life,

1267
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,960
it took a lot longer.

1268
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,100
It's when the film

1269
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,880
would get caught up

1270
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,020
and the bulb would burn

1271
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,960
through the frame.

1272
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,120
And in the movie,

1273
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:47,980
in the fake version,

1274
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,020
it's all fixed

1275
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:49,860
in a second or two.

1276
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,120
And in real life, folks,

1277
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,440
you used to have to sit there

1278
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:52,920
in the theater

1279
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,020
and yell at the poor people.

1280
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,420
Right, throw popcorn at people.

1281
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,520
I've saved the best for last.

1282
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,160
The climax of this episode

1283
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,020
of Hour of Slack,

1284
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,680
if you will,

1285
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,560
it's the Firesign Theater's

1286
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,940
absolute masterpiece

1287
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,620
of social and media criticism.

1288
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,440
The pinnacle.

1289
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,160
It's eight minutes long,

1290
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,780
but by the time you get to the end,

1291
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
your jaw will be on the floor

1292
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,960
in amazement

1293
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,500
at how much information

1294
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,100
they were able to put

1295
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,200
into that mere eight minutes.

1296
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,100
The Firesign Theater.

1297
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,580
Thank you, Mr. Mullins.

1298
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,140
We're very fortunate indeed

1299
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,800
to have with us this evening

1300
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,640
Mr. William P. Bundy,

1301
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,720
who's staff director

1302
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,100
of the President's Commission

1303
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,440
on National Goals.

1304
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,300
Now, you will wonder

1305
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,560
the way I have

1306
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,700
what that commission is,

1307
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,180
and I will address myself

1308
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,480
to Mr. Bundy in a minute

1309
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,240
with the question

1310
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,020
of what exactly this is.

1311
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,300
But before we go into

1312
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,020
the heart of the matter,

1313
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,000
and that is the national purpose,

1314
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:56,960
Mr. Bundy,

1315
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,320
I'd like you to tell our audience

1316
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,280
about your work

1317
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,460
as staff director

1318
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,180
of the President's Commission

1319
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,700
on National Goals.

1320
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,740
What is the commission?

1321
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,440
Well, I'm afraid our time

1322
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,760
is up now, Mr. Bundy.

1323
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,960
We're looking forward

1324
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,780
to continuing.

1325
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,800
It's been a privilege,

1326
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,420
Mrs. Carey.

1327
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,220
No, no, we really should go.

1328
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:20,840
All right.

1329
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,240
Unless you have a question

1330
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,160
right up your sleeve.

1331
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,260
Well, let's stop on that.

1332
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,080
Well, I'll cut that out.

1333
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,220
I couldn't resist that.

1334
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,500
Would you like to ask a question,

1335
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:38,980
Mr. Rose?

1336
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,500
I would make a comment on that.

1337
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,020
Would you like to comment on this?

1338
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,980
Yes, I would like to comment on it.

1339
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,480
Would you like to comment briefly?

1340
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:47,980
Oh, yes.

1341
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,580
Would you have any comment on...

1342
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,360
Well, yes.

1343
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,340
I'd like to comment on that briefly, too,

1344
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,760
if I might.

1345
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,760
How much time do I have?

1346
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,660
You have to leave here.

1347
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,660
No, I say this.

1348
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,480
But he would always say,

1349
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,300
well, from the beginning,

1350
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,240
they...

1351
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,420
I think this is...

1352
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,780
So many people think...

1353
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,140
No, I'm not for a minute saying...

1354
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,560
We always...

1355
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,320
We...

1356
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,020
Yes.

1357
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,040
Yes.

1358
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,580
Well, that's very, very interesting indeed.

1359
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,780
Yes, I'm sorry.

1360
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:40,440
Go on.

1361
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,060
And go on,

1362
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,400
because I'm afraid we did interrupt you.

1363
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,660
Well, it was a very polite interruption,

1364
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,560
and my statement, as I now recall,

1365
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,100
it sounds...

1366
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,860
It sounds very pompous, but...

1367
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,060
I don't really believe you.

1368
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,360
Sorry, I interrupted you.

1369
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,020
No, no, I was just...

1370
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,140
It's running.

1371
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,020
That's all right.

1372
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:00,740
Oh.

1373
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:01,860
Uh...

1374
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,680
Well, go ahead, Professor McDougall.

1375
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,980
Now you can help me on something.

1376
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,040
You know...

1377
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,460
I don't quite know.

1378
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,260
I think it's...

1379
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,460
Do you have sex?

1380
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,480
Uh...

1381
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:18,240
Uh...

1382
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,020
Uh...

1383
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,100
Uh...

1384
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,560
I don't...

1385
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,140
I certainly don't condone it.

1386
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:24,900
No.

1387
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,060
I'm not interested.

1388
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,000
I get terribly, um...

1389
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,100
sort of, um...

1390
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,640
bound up, as it were,

1391
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,640
in, um...

1392
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,420
in knowing whether...

1393
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,080
when one spends a lot of time,

1394
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,820
you know how it is.

1395
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,060
I think that answers it.

1396
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,820
That's the trick.

1397
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:42,440
That's the trick.

1398
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,900
How to handle it.

1399
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
It has serious dangers.

1400
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,220
Serious dangers.

1401
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,240
Politics makes strange bedfellows,

1402
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:50,480
and...

1403
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,460
and, uh...

1404
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,180
your policy, I know,

1405
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:53,680
as a...

1406
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,440
as a faithful patriotic, uh...

1407
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,760
man, is...

1408
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,180
No, no.

1409
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,340
At the very opening meeting...

1410
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,780
But in response...

1411
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,880
In response, uh...

1412
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,240
it's...

1413
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,140
we have...

1414
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:06,960
we have...

1415
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,980
the, uh...

1416
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,280
the communists, uh...

1417
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,940
that, uh...

1418
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,360
the...

1419
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,760
that there are liberal...

1420
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,640
I don't know...

1421
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:16,940
the...

1422
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,760
whether anybody else does it or not.

1423
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,360
And I have a feeling this may be happening.

1424
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,060
I mean...

1425
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,960
Perhaps artificially, but anyway,

1426
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,240
uh...

1427
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,400
uh...

1428
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,060
it has been...

1429
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,020
it has been the, uh...

1430
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,480
it is the...

1431
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,000
the...

1432
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,600
uh...

1433
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,300
I think when...

1434
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:35,800
the...

1435
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,860
where...

1436
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:37,460
Precisely.

1437
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,660
I mean, uh...

1438
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,640
It's terribly tiresome for Indians,

1439
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,540
and I'll tell you why.

1440
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,040
You know, because they have extreme...

1441
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,020
uh...

1442
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:47,520
um...

1443
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,340
um...

1444
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,760
problems there.

1445
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,920
It's an absolutely colossal question.

1446
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,940
I have nothing but praise.

1447
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,900
Well, I suppose that we could spend the rest of our...

1448
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,580
our time here talking about white collar workers.

1449
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,940
There is no other organization which can perform that function.

1450
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,240
There's no alternative.

1451
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,120
Yes.

1452
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,140
And there are others, too.

1453
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,500
Uh...

1454
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,040
There are examples to, uh...

1455
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,020
to show almost, uh...

1456
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:15,880
uh...

1457
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,220
limited kinds of effects which can be...

1458
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:18,940
Neil, in the...

1459
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,620
in the course of this study of ours,

1460
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,640
this isn't quantitative,

1461
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,920
but it's a kind of report.

1462
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,560
They wrote out of the...

1463
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,500
their very deepest experience...

1464
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,180
Anything that would...

1465
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,500
Anything that would...

1466
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,180
Anything that would invite, uh...

1467
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:33,920
interference.

1468
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,400
All right, but these all reflect...

1469
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,800
They reflect not only that, but, uh...

1470
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,940
drain, uh...

1471
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,260
Mm, yes.

1472
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,280
Mm-hmm.

1473
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,820
Sort of, just kind of...

1474
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,040
You know, yes, it's hard to, uh...

1475
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,140
to...

1476
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,000
to lump them together, as we were saying.

1477
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,960
Well, uh...

1478
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,960
Uh...

1479
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:52,960


1480
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,800
Then...

1481
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,060
Then where do we fit in?

1482
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:56,720
The...

1483
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,400
He calls it...

1484
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,060
Uh...

1485
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:03,660
Uh...

1486
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,540
Uh...

1487
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,460
Now, this struck me as rather symbolic, eloquent, uh...

1488
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,340
Mm-hmm.

1489
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,800
Well, that sort of fits.

1490
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,360
I'm sure you all will agree.

1491
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,940
I want to cite something that I, uh...

1492
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:17,660
got over...

1493
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,120
I...

1494
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,120


1495
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,120


1496
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,120


1497
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,120


1498
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,120


1499
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,120


1500
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,120


1501
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,120


1502
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,220
I received by mail just the other day.

1503
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,260
Well, I...

1504
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,160
I was wondering, could I cut in on...

1505
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:23,440
before...

1506
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,840
before you do that, uh...

1507
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,560
Yes.

1508
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,820
...that simply to...

1509
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,600
As it were, um...

1510
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,260
It's difficult to put this without being offensive.

1511
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,220
Um...

1512
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:34,180
So...

1513
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,280
Let me...

1514
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,900
There were...

1515
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:36,820
You know, then...

1516
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:40,220
You know, the important thing, you know, is to be...

1517
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,220
But, um...

1518
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:42,920
This, um...

1519
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,180
You know, that...

1520
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,400
It, um...

1521
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,720
I suppose it...

1522
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,920
It's the, um...

1523
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,480
But the, um...

1524
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,920
The sort of, um...

1525
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,200
Stream of literature.

1526
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,520
But I'm sorry I interrupted you.

1527
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,180
When you...

1528
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,560
That was an exceedingly long answer.

1529
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

1530
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:10,000
Would you agree with Stephen Spender, who said at a party in Wheaton that D. H. Lawrence

1531
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,180
was the last poet to write English poetry?

1532
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,300
Isn't he?

1533
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,220
No, no, and...

1534
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:16,720
And, uh...

1535
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:16,960
Mm-hmm.

1536
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:17,900
And, uh...

1537
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1538
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1539
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1540
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1541
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1542
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1543
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1544
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1545
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1546
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1547
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1548
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1549
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1550
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1551
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1552
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:17,900


1553
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,280
Shall we take, uh, D. H. Lawrence as a focal or a pivotal figure around which we might

1554
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,140
have some conversation?

1555
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,020
No.

1556
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,900
I have no more questions.

1557
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:30,840
He says no.

1558
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:31,300
I...

1559
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,280
Well, all right.

1560
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,060
Supposing...

1561
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,420
Excuse me.

1562
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,380
Go ahead, Mr. Westfield.

1563
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:34,840
Ah...

1564
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,880
Well, Mr. Dahl...

1565
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,900
Excuse me.

1566
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,120
Ah...

1567
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:38,880
Well, Mr. Dahl...

1568
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,480
Instead, it's not...

1569
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,160
Crash, brother.

1570
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,260
Well, do you want to go on with anything else?

1571
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,740
Do we have time for one more question, Mrs. Huff?

1572
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:46,420
Yes.

1573
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,960
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Huff.

1574
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,620
You're welcome.

1575
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:50,920
That's right.

1576
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,200
Well, I feel the same way.

1577
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:51,660
I do agree.

1578
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:52,340
They...

1579
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,020
We were popular in a popular...

1580
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,860
And it was not, for example...

1581
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,240
Yeah, I...

1582
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,580
I don't believe...

1583
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:00,900
I'm sorry.

1584
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,560
I'm sorry.

1585
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,040
Go ahead.

1586
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,500
I don't...

1587
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,920
Um...

1588
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,520
Uh...

1589
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:06,940
Uh...

1590
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,780
Uh...

1591
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,340
Uh...

1592
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,380
I see.

1593
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:16,400
And, in effect, if I follow your thinking correctly, and I would be inclined to say

1594
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:16,400


1595
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,320
that I'm inclined to agree with it if I do...

1596
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,500
Uh...

1597
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,320
Uh...

1598
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:21,380
Uh...

1599
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,260
No.

1600
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:28,980
Well, it pains me to agree with Steven Spender, but I think that there may be something in

1601
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,240
this.

1602
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,840
I'm wondering, since our time is limited...

1603
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:40,200
Well, I think that we've probably run out of time anyway, so thank you very much for being

1604
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,120
with us on Yale Reports this evening.

1605
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,440
Very enough.

1606
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,540
Thank you very much.

1607
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,280
Thank you.

1608
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,500
Uh...

1609
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:58,860
Uh...

1610
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:01,760
Uh...

1611
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:01,760


1612
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:01,760


1613
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:01,940
Uh...

1614
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,980
And since we don't know what time it is, maybe the sun is standing.

1615
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:02,980


1616
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,020
Uh...

1617
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,020


1618
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,600
If you could do that with this newspaper that was already held from theグ дан位

1619
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:15,500
Aladdin Squadron, or even before that like The Hymn to Tomorrow, it could sell gas.

1620
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,400
сам stump feminine

1621
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:24,540
people. You have to, what, dial up a little envelope there to P.O. Box. Friend, all you

1622
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:29,860
got to do is just look at the sub-site on the web. Oh, www.subgenius.com. Or just say,

1623
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:36,040
just to peel back your skull. We're not trying to get money out of radio listeners on this

1624
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:45,160
college station. All you need to do, shut up, Dave, is write P.O. Box. 807 Glen Rose,

1625
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:58,300
Texas. 76043. Go, Dave, go! No. I ruined it. Oh, I'm sorry. I had to do the P.O. Box

1626
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:04,120
and I was imitating Chaz. It's so funny when Chaz goes, shut up, Dave. I think it's one

1627
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,700
of the funniest things I ever hear. I wait to hear that all the time. Well, it gets chaotic.

1628
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,580
People are talking over each other. You can't hear either one. What can I do to make up

1629
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,220
for it, Dave?

1630
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,180
Shut up and let me talk the next ten minutes, both you guys.

1631
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,000
All right. All right. We'll just give it to you.

1632
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,080
No, he just said, he said, what can I do to make up for it?

1633
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:25,500
Okay. Now turn off his mic, too. Now turn off my mic.

1634
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,120
Oh, here.

1635
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,220
Okay, turn off my mic.

1636
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,100
Now isn't that better?

1637
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,060
Than what?

1638
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,740
Man, it's like...

1639
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,140
Bergman knew how to use silence.

1640
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,120
Oh, I bought it.
