1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,660
This is your radio operator, Doug Smith.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,020
We're going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,620
The Self Genius Power of Squirt

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,420
You're on the air.

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,020
What is a crime against the state?

6
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,660
I just got a little pink slip in the mail.

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,020
They said that last time I went in for a checkup, they found a used condom in my ear canal.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,760
Oh, dear.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,860
And I cannot explain, except for maybe some of the stuff that's being broadcast,

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,460
it could be, you know, metaphorically construed as getting...

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,280
Getting effed in the ear?

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:58,760
Yeah.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,540
You know, I've...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
I've heard, yeah, I've heard references to my...

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,360
I've heard my show compared to such things, you know.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,300
Well, no, I...

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,260
In totally different ways, too.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,580
You know, some make it sound like an act of violation,

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,320
and others make it sound like an act of love.

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,960
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,700
Yours is more of a form of subliminal seduction rather than overt rapery,

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,940
which is what I guess happened to my...

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,400
Well, it's actually a part of my brain.

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,040
Yeah.

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,820
So, I don't know.

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,740
I'm just hoping that the storm makes it go away.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,640
Yeah.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,680
The storm will make everything go away in time.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,360
Yeah.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,820
Hello, Bob, and I'm so happy to give my personal testimony.

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,240
50 years ago, I was a freshman in high school,

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,840
and that happened May 10th, 1941.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,200
I accepted Bob as my personal savior, and he's never let me down since.

34
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,940
I'm a retired teacher, a widow, I've had cancer and all kinds of stuff,

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,520
but he's always by my side.

36
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,040
Thank you so much.

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,260
Bob, Bob, Bob.

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,500
Now, give you a little bit of background.

39
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,680
Now, back in the year of 1950,

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,180
when Bob was just a...

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,440
He was merely the greatest salesman who ever lived.

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,120
Bob discovered that there was a conspiracy.

43
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,980
And I don't mean like the conspiracy that killed JFK

44
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,000
or the Freemasons or the Satanists or anything like that.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,320
Oh, no.

46
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,460
This is the biggest, most horrible conspiracy in the world.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,980
The conspiracy of plain ordinary normalcy.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,140
The conspiracy of normal human beings.

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,560
Jehovah One, this monstrous space alien,

50
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,240
came down and seized Bob up in the spirit

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,460
and told Bob that since time began,

52
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,520
there had been this conspiracy of normals

53
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,080
stealing away the slack of all the weirdos,

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,700
the misfits, the disbelievers.

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,420
And so Bob, with that in mind,

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,000
founded this great church of the subgenius.

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,980
It was not...

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,760
founded on a rock like some more popular religions,

59
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,700
but founded on a shifting sandy beach of hypocrisy.

60
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,540
Because where is any good religion without hypocrisy, friends?

61
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,820
And so Bob started this...

62
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,340
this do-it-yourself religion.

63
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,960
A disorganized religion, you might say.

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,820
A non-organization for non-joiners.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,280
Which makes it kind of hard to recruit people,

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,420
if you think about it.

67
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,760
Because every subgenius, by definition,

68
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,620
is completely different from every other subgenius.

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,220
There is no such thing as a typical subgenius.

70
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,640
If any two of them are alike, one must die!

71
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,020
The only thing that any of us really have in common,

72
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,380
besides the love of Bob,

73
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,020
is that we have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normal people.

74
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,980
God thinks the normal people will hate anyone,

75
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,520
for many of them will hate anyone.

76
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,600
We don't have such aways good dreams.

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
So before you even imagine it,

78
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,060
If we shut down this Dead

79
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,220
in an unseen andачneluse daughter-in-law,

80
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,980
and die for the first time in ten years,

81
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,040
then by what we can do and destroying our языclke,

82
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,600
the talking of babies...

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,500
is going to cut us into a bunch,

84
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,220
like words,

85
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,220


86
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,700
all of us.

87
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,040
the lazy man desires. Slackness. How long are you slack? You need to go on and possess slack.

88
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,280
That people were very slack where they should have been slack. They were slack over and over

89
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,560
again. Slack. That they're slack. They should be slack. How long are you slack? Slackness. Comfort,

90
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,200
content, confidence, and assurance. Too slack to slack. Behind the slack. Behind the slack.

91
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,420
Following their blow. That was behind some of the slack. How long are you slack? Go forward.

92
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,720
How long are you slack? Actually, I'm coming up on the five-year anniversary of this show.

93
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,860
Oh, it's been five years? It's hard to believe. It's hard to believe. Yeah, in February, it'll be

94
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:13,320
five years. Well, you know, that's funny. We just did the 25-year anniversary of the Puzzling

95
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:21,120
Evidence show. I tell you, time keeps moving on. And they officially declared themselves extremely

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,960
famous in the third hour of the show when everyone had fallen asleep, except for Dr. Howell,

97
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,400
who can tell you that.

98
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:34,400
I didn't continue to talk because it was important. Yep. The others in the crew, Philo and Stang,

99
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:42,080
just didn't think it was that important. Well, Dr. Howell snores in romantic poetry recitations.

100
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,960
Yeah. Snores in Milton and Shelley and all that stuff. Yeah. Oh, geez, geez, geez, geez, geez,

101
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:55,800
geez. Yes, and we'll hear the rhyming snores of Dr. Howell as we tune into that 25th anniversary

102
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,320
Puzzling Evidence show.

103
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:06,800
Which I was honored to attend, just as I was also on-houred to attend their very first show in June

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:17,140
of 1982, when it was Bob Nelson's show on KPFA Berkeley. And we'll hear tapes of that very first

105
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:25,580
show as they were played on the latest show of December 7th, 2007. We may also be hearing parts

106
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,400
of recent radio patented shows.

107
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,340
And we'll hear a few of the most famous ones.

108
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,340


109
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,340


110
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:37,020
From our Amsterdam Devival Tour and a season in hell with John Hell of Pirate Cat Radio,

111
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:45,440
both with Dr. Howell and other special guests. And we already heard some preaching from the

112
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,580
subgenius Church Devival, which happened to be in an old church in Baltimore in November.

113
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:57,380
And yet more of the collages of Norel Preff and Fernanda Nandescu.

114
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:12,480
And we'll hear more of Dr. Sinister's Radio Sinesthesia from WCSB Cleveland, with Lonesome Cowboy Dave in it.

115
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:27,380
But first, let us join Puzzling Evidence and Dr. Howell and Gary Gabrog-Fran at KPFA Berkeley as they await Dr. Drummond and myself and try to ascertain just which year this is.

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,400
And when really is the 25th anniversary of the show?

117
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,420
It's an emotional time for all of us here at the show.

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,900
June 2008. The 25th anniversary of the show.

119
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,160
No, it's, uh, well actually it would have been June, it's past us now, June 2007.

120
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh, this year?

121
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,160
This year.

122
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Oh, it already happened.

123
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,700
Oh well, then there's no point in planning for it.

124
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,920
But this is the official anniversary of the show.

125
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,960
It already happened and there's no point in doing anything.

126
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,380
I'm a celebratory man.

127
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,880
Except to reflect on 25 years of fabulous broadcasting on behalf of the Nameless Mission.

128
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:52,060
And, uh, we're waiting for Ivan Stang to come to our studio with Dr. Philo Drummond, Bishop Joey of the First Church of the Last Lamp, and perhaps some mystery guests.

129
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,220
So, what a wonderful time awaits us.

130
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,260
But perhaps you are...

131
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,000
Confused because you're tuning in at 2.

132
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,820
And yet you're hearing us, who usually come on at 3.

133
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,260
And perhaps we don't even sound that different from Frank Moore, who was on just before us.

134
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:20,960
Nonetheless, in the intricate interlocking tumbles and chambers of the brain, you will soon sort this tangle out.

135
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,420
And then be prepared to zip down the information superhighway.

136
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,160
And that절um is much appreciated.

137
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,740
The bishop is on the sagt e.

138
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:57,380
But apparentlyécole is one of those places where you read well and read a lot about knowledgery.

139
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


140
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


141
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


142
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


143
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


144
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


145
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


146
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


147
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


148
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,380


149
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:06,320
Just listen to those bubbling sounds of organic evolution occurring right as you listen.

150
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:14,440
And I'll have to say the phone number much more slowly for our friends in Ontario.

151
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,940
I think you know that phone number.

152
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,600
Not now, though.

153
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,700
Not now?

154
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,480
Yeah, there'd be no point in saying it now.

155
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,100
Yeah, who cares?

156
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,180
Yeah, exactly.

157
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,220
We'll say it in a while.

158
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
In the fullness of time.

159
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,460
In Mongolia.

160
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,220
Well, no, actually.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,520
Linoleum.

162
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
Or Congolia.

163
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,340
And there's Germany.

164
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:33,700
Holland.

165
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,320
Mauritania.

166
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,220
Roustart.

167
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,480
Finland.

168
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,360
Sildavia.

169
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,100
Sildavia?

170
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,760
Sildavia, and of course Borduria and Fredonia.

171
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,680
We are some lucky guys.

172
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,680
Just to be able to see all this from up in God's heaven makes a man feel mighty tall.

173
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm not sure why.

174
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,580
Well, if you don't know.

175
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,260
You don't lose your balance.

176
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,260
It's a good view.

177
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,160
We are used to it.

178
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,960
Our mission in the church enables us to see from a high pinnacle of progress and success.

179
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,580
Although ours is also a high and lonely destiny.

180
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,660
I think we've got some alarms going off in the control room.

181
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,100
Yeah, that's the caller alert.

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,360
So let's go away.

183
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,740
That's the best response.

184
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,960
Yes, we aren't able to answer callers at this time.

185
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,520
We will be giving out the number, however, as well as valuable prizes and premiums.

186
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:25,560
Momentarily.

187
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,760
But we must go unroll the red carpet for our little friends arriving from the alien ship.

188
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,400
Exactly.

189
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,360
They'll be disembarking soon.

190
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,120
I understand he has no legs anymore.

191
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,100
Coming through the port authority.

192
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,920
He hasn't actually walked on earth for so long.

193
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,220
Those legs of atropine.

194
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,240
He only uses a crane.

195
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,400
He's like the little guy carried around by the Zipperhead Martians.

196
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,440
He's totally dependent on his little fire engine red gravity sled.

197
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,040
The little bobbies in rubber suits carry him around in balloon-infested underground walkways.

198
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,840
Dressed in rubber suits, didn't they look swell?

199
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,100
He doesn't use a computer.

200
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,980
His monster brain simply thinks the thoughts quickly.

201
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,500
And forty pairs of boots went marching through hell.

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,620
And I was the kid with the drum.

203
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,820
Because you know anything you say on the radio happens.

204
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,960
Hey, don't you remember?

205
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,220
You called me Hal.

206
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,120
It was Hal, Hal, Hal all the time.

207
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,200
That was last night's show.

208
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,600
Hey, don't you remember?

209
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,700
I'm your pal.

210
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,920
Brother, can you?

211
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,720
I'm your pal.

212
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,060
I'm your pal.

213
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,920
I'm your pal.

214
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,200
It was in the year of 1982 that space-men first discovered the great galactic barrier.

215
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,340
In the past ten years, rocket travel to the moon and the mirror planets had become commonplace.

216
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,660
And yet the explorers refused to admit defeat.

217
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,980
It was on June 2, 1987 that the rocket Starcloud made ready for takeoff.

218
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,100
The�m

219
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,580
No one

220
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,900
cares.

221
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:22,900


222
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:22,900


223
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:22,900


224
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,240
Fire at number two.

225
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,880
Number two ready.

226
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,400
I think that's rubbish.

227
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,760
What do you think?

228
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,040
Oh, I think it's terrible.

229
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,940
At least it won't be boring.

230
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,780
At four in the morning, I know that there's quite a few subgeniuses awake,

231
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,320
probably harder than anyone, but subgeniuses.

232
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,100
Now, you may be a latent subgenius.

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,720
You may be feeling like you're just not ready for the word of God.

234
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,260
Well, you don't have to worry about salesmen coming to your door.

235
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,040
This can all be done by man, even the operatives.

236
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,480
We're all doctors here.

237
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,060
We know how to play our instruments as well as we need to know.

238
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,140
That's right.

239
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,480
So any confessions you may have over the air or not

240
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,520
will be strictly confidential and censored by us.

241
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,760
Remember, this is a listener-sponsored radio station.

242
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,400
Do you want to make heaven or not?

243
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,980
Do you want to go through the rapture?

244
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,180
Do you want to call us?

245
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,400
Do you want to go to the subcon?

246
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,960
Do you want to go to the launching of the airport?

247
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,320
Do you want to help KPFA?

248
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,620
Sit down.

249
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
I was saying I was a work shot.

250
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,140
That's funny.

251
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,120
I laugh.

252
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,320
Wow.

253
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,640
I'll tell you about it.

254
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,700
Well, you see, when water begins to seep in the hole,

255
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,720
you pull your gourd pipe,

256
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,000
then you let down the shoe inside the gourd chop,

257
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,340
and you plug up the bottom of the hole,

258
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,520
casing and all with quick-hardening gourd chops.

259
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,180
Then when it's hard with gourd chop,

260
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,540
the bottom keeps the water out.

261
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,980
Funny about that water.

262
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,100
Well, we had the gourd pipe all pulled and cracked,

263
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,360
waiting for it to harden.

264
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,980
Yeah, I hope so.

265
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,240
You see, a gourd pipe is hollow,

266
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,700
and as the gourd pipe digs down,

267
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,980
it stuffs the gourd chops up inside it,

268
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,060
so when you pull it out, you've got a sample of the gourd chops.

269
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,020
There'd be any at that level, according to my figuring.

270
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,240
Oh, I don't know.

271
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,800
Where's everybody?

272
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,980
They all went to town on the whole gourd chop.

273
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,080
Wait a minute, Forky.

274
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,540
Well, what did...

275
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:27,820
Listen.

276
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,540
What's eating you?

277
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:30,840
Doggone it.

278
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,800
I hate to be a gourd chop, but I can't help it.

279
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,620
Honest?

280
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,720
Stupid, ain't I?

281
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,580
I know how you feel, Billy.

282
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,840
Everybody's made other gourd chops.

283
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,820
I guess so.

284
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,320
You eat!

285
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,780
Now, look at this.

286
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,440
And I did look.

287
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,620
And what he was holding was a gourd chop.

288
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,640
And there wasn't any kidding about it.

289
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
It was real.

290
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,460
We don't need to get into a lot of technical double talk.

291
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,340
But the question for tonight is,

292
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,380
is cynicism a requirement,

293
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,180
or is it a luxury, or is it a necessity?

294
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,280
An economic.

295
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,180
Necessity.

296
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,420
And today's bustling world of global economic competition

297
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,000
and low-price knockoffs of Chinese classics.

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,520
Well, cynicism is a relative value.

299
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,840
One man's cynicism is another man's joyous optimism.

300
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,860
That's good.

301
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,720
It could be true.

302
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,140
Or could it?

303
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,320
It's like me-ism.

304
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,420
I remember that from back in the 70s.

305
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm a meanderthal.

306
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,620
The me generation and the you generation.

307
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,300
Let's get back to the basics.

308
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,920
The meanderthals have a dog, Eric.

309
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,940
I have a simple, pepsy generation.

310
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,560
The meanderthals are from the generation.

311
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,660
Actually,

312
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,780
the Greek restaurants

313
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,360
have the same credo as the dogs.

314
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah.

315
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,140
It's cynics.

316
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,020
It's a Greek restaurant.

317
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,480
A ghost meatball.

318
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
I'll have, um,

319
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,380
if you consume it,

320
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,480
I'll have intercourse with it.

321
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,500
Scratch an idealist and find a cynic?

322
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,800
Is that what you're saying, Phineas?

323
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,100
Well, I, uh,

324
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,560
I think that's a somewhat cynical attitude.

325
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,340
Greek.

326
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,980
A ghost.

327
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,420
Do you have to?

328
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,380
Cynical ghost.

329
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,460
Okay, call back later.

330
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,920
We need you to call back later.

331
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,280
Put your retrieve button on hold.

332
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,120
Ghosts can be cynical.

333
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,580
It is a white person.

334
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,120
Now.

335
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,900
Ghosts can be nicey-nice.

336
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,020
Particularly when you palpate them.

337
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
You palpate their subluxations.

338
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
See, people just meet here on the show and then they go off.

339
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,040
Meat, flesh, blood.

340
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,620
Flesh and blood is weak and frail.

341
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,800
But cookies are strong.

342
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,660
Susceptible to nervous shock.

343
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:47,700


344
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:47,700


345
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:47,700


346
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:47,700


347
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:47,700


348
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:47,700


349
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,220
Bob predicted that by this time, a ghost would be called as a witness in a court case.

350
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,240
When did that happen?

351
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,400
Well, it was supposed to have happened in the 90s.

352
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,140
And I'm wondering if that, like so many things, Bob predicted, was covered up.

353
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,060
Please, call me Bob.

354
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,280
Please, call me Bob.

355
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,640
Your old boss, Bob.

356
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,060
What the hell is going on?

357
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,560
Who really killed the cat?

358
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:15,840
Why?

359
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,680
Please, call me Bob.

360
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:17,680


361
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:17,680


362
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:17,680


363
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:17,680


364
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:17,680


365
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:17,980
Please, call me Bob.

366
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,300
He was dangerous.

367
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,340
We thought he was just able to heal.

368
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,180
Cellular regeneration.

369
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:32,740
What we didn't know is that if your cells continually regenerate, after a while you

370
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,640
stop growing old.

371
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,340
You Bob, I dare-

372
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,980
You Bob, I dare-

373
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,460
If you die, Bob, the company dies with you.

374
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,380
Please, call me Bob.

375
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,600
Please, call me Bob.

376
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,880
Please, call me Bob.

377
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,100
Please, call me Bob.

378
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,880
You're old boss, Bob. What the hell is going on?

379
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,140
Somebody asked, what is in Bob's pipe?

380
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,740
And I said, what's in Bob's pipe is the same thing as what's in his head,

381
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,860
which is also what's in Bob's pills.

382
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,020
But Reverend New Monet answered it much more correctly.

383
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,240
Here's what's inside Bob's pipe and his head.

384
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:25,040
The multiverse and antiverse, the negaverse, the demiverse, the quasiverse,

385
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,460
the paraverse, the division by zeroverse, the square root of negative oneverse,

386
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,480
the averse, roboverse, Hitlerverse, knockverse, gayverse, pooverse,

387
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:43,760
also known as the universe, perverse, the quantumverses, hooterverse,

388
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,840
the claymationverse, the monsterverse, antispace, hyperspace, hypospace,

389
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:57,220
overspace, underspace, throughspace, wormholes, beetleholes, blackholes, buttholes, blackwhores,

390
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,680
patrazibby, verschluggener, trace amounts of halva, and the Alamo.

391
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,120
But nothing is etched in brass.

392
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,300
The subgenius church maintains a certain amount of mercurial fluidity.

393
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,220
When I come...

394
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,000
When we come back, we're going to be talking about the universe.

395
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,940
When we come back in February, that's just to...

396
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,000
I have...

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,240
It's for the Bob Mitzvah, you might say, of my nephews-in-law who live here.

398
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,640
Those crazy kids.

399
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,280
Thirteen for that as well?

400
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,260
Well, the Bob Mitzvah is a new concept as far as I know.

401
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,000
Can you explain?

402
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:31,900
Yeah.

403
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,140
No, I can't.

404
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,660
Okay, well...

405
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,520
I honestly don't.

406
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,320
Choose not to?

407
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,960
Yeah, it just jumped out.

408
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,480
Does Princess Wee have anything to do with that?

409
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,680
Uh, well, it's her nephews.

410
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,940
Uh-huh, I see.

411
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,980
And I think I'm supposed to circumcise them or something.

412
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,900
Isn't that what happened?

413
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,820
Or circumscribe them.

414
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,240
Very nice.

415
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,460
Uh, you know, it's...

416
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,820
I've got these special...

417
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,620
One or the other.

418
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,800
You could use this bottle opener right here.

419
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,300
How about that?

420
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,580
Puzzling evidence is...

421
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,160
That's it.

422
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,120
Just sit there.

423
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,960
That's his flinging knife.

424
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,020
He always leaves something behind.

425
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,500
Just sit.

426
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,020
It'll pinch.

427
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,040
It'll pinch a little bit.

428
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,200
It has a special, uh, bris knife.

429
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,940
That's great.

430
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,480
That's it.

431
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,040
Yeah, it comes in your, um...

432
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,900
Your tool man.

433
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,180
Tool man kit.

434
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,860
That's really nice.

435
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,100
Hmm.

436
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,220
Provided by Bob, I understand.

437
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,540
He had many tools.

438
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,860
He used to sell those.

439
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,100
Are his tools.

440
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,480
Ah.

441
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,160
Yes, he has many tools and he calls them his flock.

442
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,780
That's right.

443
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,520
You've seen those New Yorker cartoons where the guy opens his sample case on the street

444
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,620
and puts down a bunch of little wind-up guys walking around.

445
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,100
That is essentially what Bob's ministers are doing.

446
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,740
Wind you up.

447
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,200
Let them roll.

448
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:37,600
Yes.

449
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,780
We are walking around demonstrating for Dobbs.

450
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,980
And, of course, we are up for being privileged.

451
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,140
Purchased by the next bidder.

452
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,100
What's the latest bid been on some of the ministers of Bob?

453
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,340
Well, I don't know, but I have a strange superstition.

454
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,700
I always bend over to pick up a penny.

455
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,840
You've probably heard that many yuppies won't because they've calculated that their time

456
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,740
is so valuable that to bend over and pick up a penny would be losing money.

457
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,120
But I believe that if you find money in front of you, it's the fractal end, the tail of

458
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,280
a possible fortune.

459
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,920
So in order to grasp that, you have to pick it up.

460
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,580
Depending on how much money you find, the more money you're going to get.

461
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,380
And the other night, walking down to the show, I found a $20 bill on the sidewalk.

462
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,140
Did you leave?

463
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,580
Picked it up and put it in my pocket.

464
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,480
Did you leave a few dollars for taxes?

465
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,100
Hell no, my friend.

466
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,940
The important thing, of course, is to pause and look to see if there are any more $20

467
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,100
bills leading in a trail to a dark alley where there's a dead bank robber.

468
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,060
With a torn open sack.

469
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,260
Didn't see the bag.

470
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,780
And a sack of $20 bills.

471
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,260
That's what the true subgenius looks to see if there are more $20 bills perhaps raining

472
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,040
from the sky.

473
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,740
You just never know.

474
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,460
I always make a point of smashing.

475
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,700
Some people go, oh boy, $20.

476
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm going to run to the bar right now.

477
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,020
Running right past the passed out bank robber with his big sack of money.

478
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,700
Well, that's not surfing the luck plate.

479
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,200
No, no.

480
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,260
You have to, you know, don't be rash.

481
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,240
Don't rush off to spend that stolen or found money.

482
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,240


483
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:19,420
You know, look around and see if there's not some cataclysmic event that produced more

484
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,540
$20 bills.

485
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,840
Same thing happened to me about a year ago.

486
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,280
I encountered that $20 bill.

487
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,960
That slight bait that Bob uses to lead us further along.

488
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,120
Well, usually you find pennies, a nickel, a dime or a quarter, but a dollar is unusual

489
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,260
and $20 is very unusual.

490
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,240
But every time I've ever picked up anything of a large, the luck line is always a $20.

491
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,240


492
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,240


493
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,240


494
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,000
Rip gosh, that's the hard part.

495
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,980
We've got trouble.

496
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,220
This is real real products.

497
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,620
So we have a question for you.

498
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,800
How one month ago, how have people since this day become religiously Married?

499
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:03,860
And I'm not a masses and also on a a toothy a leper.

500
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:04,480


501
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,360
Otherwise, how many days?

502
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:06,680
How many years later?

503
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,080
How many years?

504
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,760
I don't have swallowed a barb.

505
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,060
You всп Rachel pass in November.

506
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,540
I found out.

507
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:10,540


508
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,240
No one here in Texas had anything the commit which UT no one or.

509
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,120
things like used condoms and syringes? Does that lead to bad luck? Well, if you pick them up,

510
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:26,760
you would be picking up the fractal end of a train of used syringes and condoms where somebody else

511
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,380
already had the fun and you were picking it up. So I wouldn't do it. I'm going to stop today.

512
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:39,840
But you see, the problem is if you search too assiduously for more slack when there's only a

513
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,600
little bit, that can start subtracting slack. It crosses over the line into neurotic behavior.

514
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,280
Once while walking by a Mexican beauty parlor near my apartment, I saw a $20 bill in the gutter.

515
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,200
And of course, I picked it up. But ever since then, I have been physically unable to pass that

516
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,280
gutter without looking, without stopping. So that is somewhat neurotic. And yet,

517
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,760
what are you going to do? Because whoever is foolish enough to drop that money one time,

518
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,420
who...

519
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:09,820
Slept too much.

520
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:16,580
...habituates that area, well, he might come back and drop another one. So it's logical to look there.

521
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:23,500
Keep going to that same place. I once found a $500 in cash in a grocery cart.

522
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,040
Holy cow, that's true.

523
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,760
Better than I've ever done.

524
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,620
And there was no wallet. There was no anything. I took it in my hand and I said,

525
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,900
Is this blonde anybody?

526
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,600
I can top you.

527
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,360
Nobody responded.

528
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,060
I can top you.

529
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,820
What was yours, Lloyd?

530
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,520
Top me, Lloyd.

531
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,620
$2,000.

532
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:39,860
$2,000.

533
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,220
Wrapped up in the banker thing.

534
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,020
The wrapper.

535
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:51,120
The paper wrapper. Middle of the street. I screeched to a stop. I dove on it. I dove back in my car.

536
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,940
Squealed away. And that's how Cookie Mongoloid went to Japan last year.

537
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,360
So you didn't have to be in the paper as one of those chuckleheads who finds a ton of money that fell off an armored truck

538
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,580
and then returned it because he was so honest.

539
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,700
That's the way a lot of action movies start.

540
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,880
Scene like that.

541
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,380
Finding the thousands.

542
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:09,980
Thousands of dollars.

543
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,800
Yes, that's the problem.

544
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,160
A few months later, Cookie Mongoloid was walking through the streets of Tokyo.

545
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,480
When you find that large jumbo mayonnaise jar full of cocaine or that suitcase full of money,

546
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,840
often somebody else is looking for it.

547
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,400
So you do have to take that into consideration.

548
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,320
I guess the best I ever did in this regard was once I went to a Burning Man Heat the Street fair

549
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,480
and I noticed there was a 20 lying on the grass near my shoes.

550
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,040
And then there was a whole bunch of them spread out, which I picked up.

551
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,620
A little bit more than a hundred bucks though.

552
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,760
I never found two grand.

553
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,360
That would be exceptionally favored.

554
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,320
Don't tell anyone.

555
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:56,320
I convince everyone that I went to Japan on my own hard sweat and labor and the labor of my blistered hands.

556
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,200
As you did.

557
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,320
Of course, this is all metaphorical language, not to be taken literally or seriously.

558
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:09,020
But if anybody finds $2,000 laying around in town during the next few years,

559
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,020


560
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,100
I did lose a big bunch of money.

561
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,860
So send that through subgenius.com if you find it.

562
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,900
If you want to be honest, you know, if you want to be able to live with yourself,

563
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,380
if you find that money or if you inherit that money even.

564
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,420
What title would that grant me in the subgenius church?

565
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,800
Supreme Sucker.

566
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,340
Bob's favorite.

567
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,380
Like a remora.

568
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,780
You know, now the evidence is back in the studio.

569
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,280
We are all together now.

570
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,580
Puzzling Evidence is back.

571
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,720
Yes, friends.

572
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,900
Puzzling Evidence, the host of that wild and wacky show, the Puzzling Evidence Show at KBMA.

573
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,660
Don't want my name in the Hall of Fame.

574
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,240
I just want a big fat pile of money.

575
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,720
Give me that almighty dollar for that lettuce.

576
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,500
Hear me holler.

577
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,280
Give me buckets for the ducats.

578
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,760
Let me walk around in water.

579
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,560
In Mazuba, El Dinero.

580
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,900
Want to be a billionaire.

581
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,600
Give me money, money, money, money, money.

582
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,620
And send it to.

583
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,120
That's the stuff.

584
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,240
A post office box.

585
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,520
One eight one four one seven Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

586
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,600
Four four one one eight.

587
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,800
That's post office box.

588
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,760
One eight one four one seven Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

589
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,220
Four four one one eight.

590
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,820
Thank you.

591
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,260
Great job.

592
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,640
Get me a suit.

593
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,320
It's made out of loot.

594
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,400
Bulls of radio.

595
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,560
We can say all the dirty words we want and ask for money without being cashiered by the authorities.

596
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,460
Get gold in touch.

597
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,580
That's what I mean.

598
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,960
He's my mood.

599
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,500
I'm I in a job changing out the haircuts and all the barber shops.

600
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,740
He's my mood.

601
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,100
I'm I in a job.

602
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,360
And he knows what he likes.

603
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:56,140
He doesn't like his women to wear a dirty socks because it doesn't make for a very friendly

604
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,460
fuck.

605
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,620
He's my mood.

606
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,880
I'm I in a job.

607
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,260
And he knows what he likes.

608
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,560
He knows what he likes.

609
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:03,920
He's my mood.

610
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,460
I'm I in a job changing out the haircuts and all the barber shops.

611
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,620
Keeping a 50s style alive.

612
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,900
But all the other stuff has to go.

613
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,000
It was a little barber who lived down the way.

614
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,080
I want to give a mohawk to make a bit more pay.

615
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,740
But when he gave the haircut,

616
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,400
he had his perm revoked and his shop was smashed.

617
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,100
His arms chopped up and all because I'm my mood.

618
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,480
I'm I in a job.

619
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,780
And he knows what he likes.

620
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,560
He's my mood.

621
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,900
I'm I in a job.

622
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,900
And he doesn't want you to work all the eyebrows out.

623
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,040
And he wants you to keep them growing all out.

624
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,260
He's a very, very, very strict man.

625
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,360
And he is the president of Iran.

626
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,400
He wants you to keep up to the rules of my mood.

627
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,800
I'm I in a job.

628
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,800
He doesn't want you to keep up to the rules of my mood.

629
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:00,800


630
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,660
He likes my mood.

631
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,220
I'm I in a job.

632
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,220
He's changing out the haircuts and all the barber shops.

633
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,380
He's my mood.

634
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,560
I'm I in a job.

635
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,680
And he knows what he likes.

636
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,140
He doesn't like a Pepsi.

637
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,640
He doesn't like the Coke.

638
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,680
He only have a refresco or a root of beer float.

639
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,900
But it has to be, has to be under Lenny and Flag.

640
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,060
To get into who known he's sag.

641
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,420
Now in Arabic.

642
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,020
My man.

643
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,080
In the muck.

644
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,840
My friend.

645
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,700
I'm in a job.

646
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,840
I'm I in a job.

647
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:39,840


648
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:39,840


649
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:39,840


650
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:39,840


651
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,160
And I'm here.

652
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,600
And I'm in the album.

653
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,020
And he knows what he likes.

654
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,320
And he knows what he doesn't like.

655
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,340
And he doesn't like this song.

656
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,460
And if you sing the song in this country,

657
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,700
he will have to come and get you and kill you.

658
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,160
over again. He's Mamoud

659
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,740
Aminajad.

660
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,720
And he's a very nice, nice man.

661
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,860
That cute song, friends, was by

662
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,480
The Cosmix,

663
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,700

What's in Bob's head?

681

That research we heard was by

682
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,560
New Monet, read off by

683
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,840
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

684

685
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,060
the good Atomic Books in Baltimore.

686
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,040
The Bob collages in this show

687
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,300

and the Hour of Slack Porkchops

689
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,440

and from Priestess Bysace.

699
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,260
Do you hear me, little bobbies?

700
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,120
You tell us what to do

701
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,100
and we'll follow orders.

702
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,420
Those two can eat us all, we'll snark.

703
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,160
Sure thing, it'll be a pleasure.

704
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,780
A pleasure?

705
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,160
Yeah.

706
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,400
Well, I guess so.

707
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,620
But I'm gonna make up for it.

708
00:32:59,640 --> 00:32:59,920
Good.

709
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,880
So, now, some of you are hipsters

710
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,640
and art bugs.

711
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,460
You're going, oh, well,

712
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,980
luckily for me,

713
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,880
I don't work for the conspiracy.

714
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,900
I'm free.

715
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,580
I can forget about the conspiracy.

716
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,200
But they never forget about you, my friends.

717
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,340
No, sir, they've got your name and number.

718
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,900
You may even think they don't.

719
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,800
And yet, believe me, they do.

720
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,240
Because here's the worst part

721
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,800
of the conspiracy.

722
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,020
It's not really us versus them.

723
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,300
It's really just us.

724
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,980
The conspiracy is that ugly thing inside you

725
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,220
that makes you be shitty for no reason

726
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,840
or lazy in the wrong times

727
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,200
or overactive in the wrong.

728
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,980
It's just what fucks everything up.

729
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,200
And we, the first step in not being a dumbass

730
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,120
is to admit that you're a dumbass.

731
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,780
Hence, the Church of the Goddamn Son,

732
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:55,780


733
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:55,780


734
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:55,780


735
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:55,780


736
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:55,780


737
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,480
the God of the Subgenius.

738
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,160
We actually don't know everything.

739
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,660
But we do know that we haven't been getting enough slack.

740
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,280
Slack is what we want,

741
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,780
and slack is what we're going to get.

742
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,380
And the great thing about it is it's free.

743
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,720
It really is something for nothing.

744
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,920
As that robot said on the subgenius chat line,

745
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,860
slack will get you through times of no slack.

746
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,540
It's that simple.

747
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,760
A subgenius chat line is a subgenius chat line.

748
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:25,760


749
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:25,760


750
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,280
This is what we call self-amusing personalities.

751
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,980
They're not easily bored because even if they're stuck in a jail cell

752
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,560
with nothing to look at but their hand,

753
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,660
they'll figure out a whole story to go behind the lines

754
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,940
in their goddamn hands.

755
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,200
And when they get out of jail, they make fortune

756
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,580
as a fortune teller.

757
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,740
I just came up with that one.

758
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,560
That's kind of a good line.

759
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,840
The important thing, though, friends, is that Bob Dobbs, sure,

760
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,880
he's your personal savior tonight,

761
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,660
but he created the beautiful concept

762
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,300
of the short duration personal savior, or short-durper sad.

763
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,780
We live in a society full of planned obsolescence.

764
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,940
Every computer you buy is programmed to break down

765
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,140
the day after the warranty runs out.

766
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,140
Same with Bob. Sooner or later, and believe me,

767
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,620
I've been doing this 26 years.

768
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,420
I've seen it happen a million times.

769
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,700
Sooner or later, as much as you may love Bob,

770
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:24,940
you might be Bob tonight.

771
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,740
And as Bobbed up as you might, you might turn into one of those,

772
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,020
what we call Bobbies, the poor subgeniuses who just chant,

773
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,180
Bob, slap, Bob, slap all day long.

774
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,520
Hey, nothing wrong with that.

775
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,820
I did that for my first five years in Dobbs Town.

776
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,900
That's how I got my job.

777
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,400
But ultimately, you're going to get tired of it

778
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,160
and want to move away.

779
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,120
You'll find some other short duration personal savior.

780
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,680
It might be your loved one, if you

781
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,840
happen to be lucky enough to find such a thing, a true Yeti

782
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,040
mate.

783
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,300
It might just be your favorite TV show,

784
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,180
your favorite comic book, or porno star.

785
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,300
It could be anything.

786
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,120
It could be the bubble gum you're chewing right at this moment.

787
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:09,080
You know, one thing Bob advised was don't just eat, for instance.

788
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,800
Don't just eat that hamburger.

789
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,520
Eat the hell out of it!

790
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,720
And friends, you know, it's a quest for the perfect hamburger.

791
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,200
We've said that many times.

792
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,020
I'm going to let you all in on a secret.

793
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,240
Every hamburger.

794
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,180
What's the perfect hamburger?

795
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,920
If you eat the hell out of it.

796
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,820
That's kind of a Zen thing, you know?

797
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,320
Mint makes you think.

798
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,720
Don't do it!

799
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Don't do it, friends!

800
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,880
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

801
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,480
That just clutters it all up.

802
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,260
It didn't make any sense.

803
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,660
No religion makes sense.

804
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,520
Wouldn't be worth a hoot if it made sense.

805
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,340
Friends, it's slack.

806
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,400
That's the great thing about slack.

807
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,960
It doesn't have to make sense.

808
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,240
Make sense always make sense.

809
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,580
Who are you trying to impress anyway?

810
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,560
If you don't want to drink that dude's lighter fluid, I would recommend you head to the back

811
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,780
and get yourself something to drink.

812
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,520
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Princess Piesys.

813
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,320
You've seen me up here earlier tonight, and I have a little tale to tell you.

814
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,480
Stisting went through subgenius 101 and told you the basics of being a subgenius, and I'm

815
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,720
actually going to share with you church secrets.

816
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,840
Yes!

817
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,940
I'm going to describe te spoiled subgenius 101.

818
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:22,940


819
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:32,020
you the stages of being a subgenius. There are several. The first stage of being a subgenius

820
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:41,260
is the meh stage. Which is meh. Why should I send 30 bucks to some smiling dude with

821
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:47,440
a pipe? Why do I want to do that? That's 30 bucks. You know what I could get for 30 bucks?

822
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:58,380
Half an egg! The second stage is the jump. In the jump stage you say, you know what?

823
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:08,080
Why not send some smiling guy and a pipe 30 bucks? What the hell? The next phase, my friends,

824
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:16,580
is the Bobby phase. I'm Bobby. The Bobby phase kind of goes like this. You go to your first

825
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,120
X day.

826
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,180
You've been listening to an hour of Slack. You've been watching the DVDs. You've bought

827
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:27,020
CDs. You've gone to the website. You've hung out in the chat room. You've been on Slack.

828
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:35,540
You have a hero. I've done that twice. There's this subgenius hero you have. They're on stage.

829
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:43,240
Oh my god. You get to see them in person and live. It's the most awesome thing ever. You're

830
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,100
like, wow. I got to see them. They're real. They're in the real world. They're real. They're

831
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,900
in person. This is so real and profound. As they get off the stage after their rant

832
00:38:52,900 --> 00:39:01,520
and they walk down the steps and they're walking away, you say, hey, hey, hey, hi. I have every

833
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,020
single one of the hour of Slacks you've been on. I have every single DVD that you're on.

834
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,840
I have the recordings of what you did last X day. I have a little bit of everything you've

835
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:17,080
ever done. I just wanted to know if you wanted to come to my camp. I have a little bit of

836
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:23,660
music. I have some Budweiser. We're two roads back. There's a lot of mosquitoes, but I have

837
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,020
bug spray. We're going to play some D&D. Do you want to come?

838
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,240
Yes! Dungeons & Dragons!

839
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,020
Oh, you're busy?

840
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,460
Oh, fuck yeah.

841
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,480
You're going to Doc Croft's camp?

842
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,340
Fuck yeah.

843
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,720
Oh, okay. All right. Well, if you want to, you can come by later. I'll be there all night.

844
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,620
Oh, you don't think you'll have time?

845
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,600
No.

846
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,660
Oh, okay.

847
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,860
Oh, no.

848
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:56,640
All right. Well, I'll see you around then. And you go home from X day and you're disappointed

849
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,220
and you're heartbroken because you're a hero. You're a hero.

850
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:00,680
Huh?

851
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,540
Turns you down. And you think about it and you're like, you know what? They looked at

852
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:11,700
me like I had a third horn coming out of my head. They looked at me like I was some freak.

853
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:17,080
I'm not a freak. You know what? They're just elitists. They're in the hierarchy. They're

854
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,080


855
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,460
elitists. And they're just stuck up. And you know what? Screw them. You know what?

856
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:30,440
They're just hussies and dopeheads and hippies and kooks. And forget them, man, because I'm

857
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:39,420
special and damn it, I'm important. And screw them. And you spend a year soaking in this

858
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,820
hate and you go on Usenet and you post about how your hero, your ex-hero is just nothing

859
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:52,720
but a kook and a crack and your ex-hero is nothing of import. And you know what? You

860
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,000
have a bottle of scotch that's worth more than this dude. You know what? He is nothing.

861
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:05,020
He is worth nothing. He is nothing and he's a hack and he can't play music and he can't

862
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:11,700
rant and he's horrible. And damn it, you know what? You can do better. Damn it, you can't.

863
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,800
You'll show him because you're going to go to X day and you're going to get a little

864
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,120
bit on stage and you're going to rant and you're going to show him that elitist, hierarchy

865
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,100
bastard. You're going to show him that you're better than he is because you're going to

866
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:31,620
get up and rant. And you do. And you go to X day and you get on stage and you rant and

867
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,420
you rant your heart out with all that hate that you feel for that bastard who screwed

868
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:44,560
you over, who looked at you like you were the lowest of the low. And everyone loves it.

869
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,060
And you're redeemed. And everyone's excited about it and they come up to you and say,

870
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:55,340
wow, that was a great rant. What's your name? Who are you? Wow, that was fabulous. And Stang

871
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,460
puts you on hours of slack and people are exchanging copies of your rants on Usenet

872
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:06,020
and you're on the top of the world. And then so you're like, well, okay, I'll do it again

873
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:14,840
next X day. And next X day comes and you rant again. And it's great and everyone claps and

874
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:22,260
as you walk off the stage, this kid comes up to you and he's staring at you and he's

875
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:30,240
almost drooling on himself and he's shaking and he says, dude, I have every hour of slack

876
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:37,240
that you're on. I bought every DVD that you were on. I've got the DVD of last X day. Your

877
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,700
stuff is the best ever. Oh my God, you're so great. We're camped about two roads back.

878
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,820
And yes, I'm not saying that you're the best, but I'm saying that you're the best. And you're

879
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,320
like, oh, yeah, there's some mosquitoes, but we've got bug spray and I've got some Budweiser

880
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:56,480
and we're going to play D&D. And you say, well, really, I appreciate the offer and everything,

881
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,680
but I'm going to Doc Croft's camp. And then after that, I'll be sort of milling around

882
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,920
with some friends I haven't seen in a while. And I just don't think I'll make it all the

883
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,740
way to the other end of the campground to see you. And I'm really sorry, but it was

884
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,820
nice meeting you. And you scurry away because that guy is really creepy. And I'm like,

885
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:20,420
Oh, my God, you're the best. And you go home and you look at all the slack. And there's

886
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,580
these people saying these horrible things about you. They're talking about how you're

887
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:31,320
elitist and you're stuck up and they're calling you a slut and a hussy and they're awful and

888
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:41,000
mean to you. And then you realize you're a member of the hierarchy. Bob's speaking through

889
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,520
me. Yeah. Where have we heard that one before?

890
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,440
A common delusion.

891
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,240
That are just falling down.

892
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,360
And couldn't get up.

893
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,000
Do you feel foaming at the mouth?

894
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,860
Fomenting your mouth.

895
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,520
We're fomenting hoof and mouth.

896
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,720
All you can hear is just like the word Bob reverberating in your head.

897
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,680
The word Bob and the word Bob and only the word Bob.

898
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,960
And the weird Bob resonating in your head.

899
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,960
Kill the people in Omaha?

900
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Philo is showing me the listeners on the Internet. I can see this map of the planet.

901
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,200
Yeah, go to hybrid.

902
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,240
It shows all seven listeners.

903
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,580
Look how grotesque they are. They scarcely look like human beings.

904
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:24,100
There's Sven of Shining Path of Least Resistance. There's Lily Jing in the middle of Mongolia.

905
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,160
Shining Path, send me your email so I can come visit you in Osaka.

906
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,600
There's some poor devil in Brock.

907
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,280
I believe that is the devil.

908
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:36,560
And if you go to hybrid, you can go right down to their house and see which end of the house the radio connection is.

909
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,820
Yes, I guess he could never come.

910
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,760
But there are more doctors than listeners, face it.

911
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,100
Yeah. Well, unfortunately that's always been true in some shows.

912
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,680
Well, no, that's how we like liberate the audience, man.

913
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,700
It's like we would sit, we'd start off on stage with our doctor music.

914
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,560
Then we'd like relinquish our like instruments to the audience.

915
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,260
And that was like the way we were cool.

916
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,780
But now there's like this global coolness deficit.

917
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,200
Except in Antarctica.

918
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,420
Yeah, there's like the global coolness is diminishing.

919
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,720
In Antarctica especially.

920
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,060
Well, there's still cool there.

921
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,760
There's coolness in Antarctica.

922
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,340
Yeah, there's still some cool people there.

923
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,660
Yeah, the laptop does. It's pretty cool there.

924
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,000
Man, if we don't do something about global coolness, like there's just not going to be any coolness left.

925
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,400
That's right.

926
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:37,240
It's going to be like a totally uncool, globally uncool world.

927
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,120
Well, just don't lose your coolness, man.

928
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,500
I mean, dude.

929
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:41,620
Dude?

930
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,080
Dude.

931
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,300
Tide.

932
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,760
Don't call me dude.

933
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,020
Yeah, I mean Tide.

934
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:45,600
What?

935
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,500
Bob's speaker's up through a terrible bunch of swags.

936
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,860
It's not cool, Tide.

937
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,900
We have a methane crisis right now.

938
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,580
It's like majorly bum-stacious.

939
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,060


940
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,460
And Bob also speakers through a...

941
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,560
My god, babe.

942
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,280
It's behind, Tide.

943
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:57,680
Yeah.

944
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,820
Bob's speaker through small crevices and crannies in walls between grandpas and crannies.

945
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,120
Yeah, exactly.

946
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,480
Yeah, can you do that?

947
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,100
Oh, anyway, then all of a sudden he's moving now, all of a sudden.

948
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,440
Okay, I just moved it.

949
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,140
Yep.

950
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,560
And now it's all different again.

951
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:19,320
Now Dr. Drummond can operate that mind control machine while blithering.

952
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,240
That's what I wanted to do was control some more minds here before the show goes away.

953
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,380
He's been sitting on the computer spying on the listeners using Google Earth.

954
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:26,940
Yeah, I know.

955
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,240
The internet listeners.

956
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,560
Yeah, we have exactly seven of them and they're equally spread across the globe.

957
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,620
No, there's actually a lot more than seven.

958
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,060
Yeah, those are just the little places downloading the show.

959
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,380
He was looking down the chute of the back porch chimney.

960
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:40,600
There's probably about 40 of them.

961
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,180
There's a chute of the back porch chimney of one of the listeners.

962
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:42,980
Where was that?

963
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,260
Where was that?

964
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:44,780
Where was that?

965
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,500
You were just looking.

966
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,720
You were saying that they were in the back of the house.

967
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,200
Anywhere except Santa Cruz.

968
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,700
Listener in New York, you were in the back of your house according to Google Earth.

969
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,100
Hey, what time does the eye frock come in?

970
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,620
That's where the connection comes in.

971
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,220
And it's not where the target, I mean the listener is.

972
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,160
It's not where the target, I mean the listener is.

973
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,260
It's where the connection comes into the house.

974
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:03,940
Going down, down, down.

975
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,080
So be careful about the thermal sighting.

976
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,020
Oh, I see.

977
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:07,920
Go to the eye frock.

978
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,520
Yeah, switch it over to the eye frock.

979
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,580
Yeah, I want to go to the eye frock.

980
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:10,840
I want to go to the eye frock.

981
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,260
I want a thermal eye frock, you from the east.

982
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,720
The thermal view is actually off of Eastern Parkway and Kingston Avenue in New York City

983
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,360
near the Thoracic Hospital.

984
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,780
I want chicken fried frock.

985
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,760
You know, have you ever done a lot of subgenius stalking on the internet?

986
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,920
Yes, I do a lot of subgenius stalking.

987
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,020
Well, it goes on all the time.

988
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,100
A very safe way to stalk.

989
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,040
Yeah, you can stalk from afar without causing any kind of legal problems.

990
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,940
Yeah, but the subgenius stalking market isn't always going down.

991
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,520
It's a legal problem.

992
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,320
And since Google Earth has done that detailed treatment of San Francisco, I've been able

993
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,580
to stalk you guys.

994
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,480
I'm stalking this listener right now.

995
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,440
There was a shot.

996
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:55,360
If you type in Dr. Howell's address, you can be looking right at his front door.

997
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,520
I did that once.

998
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,720
And he was standing there.

999
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,420
And he had just walked in to his house.

1000
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,480
Coincidence or conspiracy?

1001
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,760
There was like a thermal ghost image of Dr. Howell going into the door.

1002
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,800
Because they told my ghost.

1003
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,120
And I'm going to start again.

1004
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,660
Lettering by Becky Wilson.

1005
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,140
Right now, I'm zooming in on this listener.

1006
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,700
And I can see the back of the house.

1007
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,940
Didn't Becky Wilson marry Ted Schultz?

1008
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,660
I'm afraid to tell you, that's not the house.

1009
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,980
That's as close as I can get.

1010
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,760
He became a formidable insect specialist.

1011
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,300
I just can't remember anything from yesterday.

1012
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,920
Becky Wilson married Ted Schultz?

1013
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,580
But you know, the mind plays strange tricks.

1014
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,300
Look at those houses.

1015
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,000
I'm sure you thought so.

1016
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,860
Sometimes.

1017
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,400
I said you saw.

1018
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,300
The supposedly paranoid person feels they're being watched somehow, as if by some eye in

1019
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:45,740
the sky.

1020
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:55,260
And yet, in fact, Dr. Philodrumon is watching you right now through satellite views of gargle

1021
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:55,720
earth.

1022
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:03,200
If you've ever felt that vast and cool intelligence is remote from yours, we're studying you from

1023
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,920
miles away.

1024
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,360
It's not that vast, nor that cool.

1025
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:13,760
But it is a form of intelligence known as Dr. Philodrumon, stalking you, the listener.

1026
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:21,500
Yes, just as you listen to us, we can see you through the Google Earth spy eye.

1027
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,760
But can you see?

1028
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,960
You can look through Google Earth and at the station.

1029
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,160
And if you felt secure before, you will never feel secure again.

1030
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,080
We are watching you.

1031
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,920
And the camera can see down to your under-lens.

1032
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,260
And we're going to report on everything.

1033
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:37,340
And we're going to report on everything.

1034
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,780
We're going to report on everything you do.

1035
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,900
But can't they see us by the same token?

1036
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:41,760
No, just your underwear.

1037
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,580
They see us 25 years ago.

1038
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,340
We're young and free and jumping around like crazy.

1039
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,680
Okay, now, what's a Google Earth spy eye?

1040
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,060
We were never that young.

1041
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,800
Listen to those without a screen.

1042
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,900
I've seen those pictures and they've all been faked.

1043
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,960
We were not that young.

1044
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:03,020
Somebody got into my archives and cleverly replaced all my old photos with photos of

1045
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,840
handsome young actors playing us.

1046
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,340
It's a hard thing to do.

1047
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,340


1048
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,340


1049
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,340


1050
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,340


1051
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,340


1052
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,340


1053
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,340


1054
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,980
It's a hard day's night of the living days.

1055
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,660
I've seen those pictures and those are not us.

1056
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,500
I was there and I don't remember that.

1057
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,660
That's how it goes.

1058
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,400
If you remember it, then I wasn't you.

1059
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,380
It was like that band, The Monkees.

1060
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,740
It was completely faked.

1061
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,600
Our entire past histories were faked.

1062
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,080
Now I don't know if all our listeners need to hear our personal private...

1063
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,080


1064
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:36,560
This show always has a reputation for exposing the real secrets of the various churches,

1065
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,240
and that's one of them.

1066
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:37,320
That's right.

1067
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:37,320


1068
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:37,320


1069
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:37,320


1070
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:37,320


1071
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:37,320


1072
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:37,580
But we're not that young folks.

1073
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,620
We don't exist.

1074
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,500
You're listening to nothing.

1075
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,560
We never did exist.

1076
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,960
We've kidded ourselves on that score.

1077
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,300
We never were anything but recordings.

1078
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,520
You're really harsh in my mellow, man.

1079
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,380
We still are.

1080
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,100
But we're good recordings.

1081
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:57,920
But imagine our shock to find out all of the photos were completely faked.

1082
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,560
And in fact, even the radio and audio recordings were faked.

1083
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,140
Yeah, but we don't owe any money.

1084
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:03,400
They were from that database.

1085
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,400
We've never had a DMV record.

1086
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,180
Look, you can see the oil spills.

1087
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:07,300
All of that.

1088
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,660
I had the DTs, I'll admit it, but I'm fine now.

1089
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,540
You can see the people on the bottom of the ocean out here.

1090
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,780
Yes, it's not a pleasant sight.

1091
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,440
I was able to find where Skull Island used to be on Google Earth.

1092
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,940
Those are pearls that were his eyes.

1093
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,760
Southwest of Sumatra.

1094
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,400
Really?

1095
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:28,700
Yes.

1096
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,880
You can see the latitude and longitude in that shot where Denim shows the map.

1097
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,100
Did you notice that?

1098
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:35,680
Yeah.

1099
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,260
Show it.

1100
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,200
In the lower right-hand corner.

1101
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,920
And you can go there on Google Earth and see the spot where Skull Island sank beneath

1102
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,360
there.

1103
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,020
There it is.

1104
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,020
I'm on Skull Island right now.

1105
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:46,300
There's nobody listening to the show.

1106
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:46,820
I'm sinking.

1107
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,880
Philo is looking at something labeled Skull Island, but Skull Island, as we know, sank

1108
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,100
in the forest.

1109
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,120
Northern Territory, Australia.

1110
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,480
Well, I thought that was propaganda.

1111
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,360
Skull Island, Northern Territory, Australia.

1112
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,920
They said that so nobody would go there and disturb its delicate ecosystem.

1113
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,140
Dang.

1114
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:00,380
Wow.

1115
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,060
Okay, thanks.

1116
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,380
Cool.

1117
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,340
That is so cool.

1118
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,520
Isn't that cool?

1119
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,240
That is so cool.

1120
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,780
So there's a Skull Island site.

1121
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,080
I'm going to zoom down on Skull Island.

1122
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,960
You can go there and...

1123
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,240
Yeah.

1124
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,100
In Northern Territory, Australia.

1125
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,940
I'm sorry, but we don't have imagery at this zoom level for this region.

1126
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,360
Try zooming out for a broader look.

1127
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,740
Maybe we can just have a moment of silence for this background.

1128
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,820
I'm looking at some broads, eh?

1129
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,300
Oh, yeah.

1130
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,400
I'm looking at broads now.

1131
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,020
I've just got an explanation on how that...

1132
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:25,260
All right, all right.

1133
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,440
Boys, boys, please.

1134
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,720
So what would Fighting Father O'Donovan think?

1135
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,280
Wow.

1136
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,420
That looks good.

1137
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,120
It's a...

1138
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,520
Time for a nooner.

1139
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,480
Look, we're right near Watson Island and the North Island.

1140
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,240
Needle, needle.

1141
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,220
Is that like a river?

1142
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,220
It's not going to...

1143
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:38,840
I'm on the show.

1144
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,360
You know, Darwin found eight separate species of grebes here.

1145
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,660
It runs like a river.

1146
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,220
Putting together the puzzle of...

1147
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,400
Through the gullies and gutters of Haldimand.

1148
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,340
This was the voyage of the schnauzer.

1149
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,260
Sergeant Ernie Schnauzer.

1150
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,640
Top of the morning to you.

1151
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,080
And young Chucko.

1152
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,200
And Lieutenant Morphy.

1153
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:06,200


1154
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:07,940
And the

1155
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,680
And their great buddy, God.

1156
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,200
On thy belly shall thou go.

1157
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,860
Yes, God is the mo of the universe.

1158
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,960
I sometimes feel like a mo in a sea of curlews.

1159
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,440
The sun's always shining.

1160
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,940
The flowers are always growing.

1161
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,920
But most subgeniuses are Larry.

1162
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,100
A stone's brand in this ocean of stimpies.

1163
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:28,880
Because this is...

1164
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,060
What?

1165
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:29,880
A religion.

1166
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,540
There it is.

1167
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,560
And everything's fine.

1168
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,680
I'm still feeling...

1169
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:32,960
I'm fine.

1170
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,800
Are you fine?

1171
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,740
I am fine.

1172
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,220
Yes, you are.

1173
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:36,220


1174
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:36,220


1175
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:36,220


1176
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:36,220


1177
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:36,220


1178
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:36,720
Are you fine?

1179
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,620
Yeah, I'm fine.

1180
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,500
I'm okay.

1181
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:38,680
You're okay.

1182
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,860
You're just merely exerting our God-given right to perpetrating illicit rumors and false

1183
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,020
trance.

1184
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,020


1185
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,520
I mean that your God-given right to perpetrate rumors and false trance...

1186
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,140
It's my God-given right to lie on the air.

1187
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,260
You lie like a lumpy lump.

1188
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:54,740
This is a photograph.

1189
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,560
What do these mean?

1190
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:56,640
Pornographs.

1191
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,780
Oh, let me see those.

1192
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:03,560
It's my God-given right to kill your family and take their money and jewelry.

1193
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,000
All in good time, my boy.

1194
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,200
I'm sorry.

1195
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,200


1196
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,200


1197
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,200


1198
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,200


1199
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,200


1200
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,200


1201
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,200


1202
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,200


1203
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,920
It's within my slack.

1204
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,940
It's within my slack.

1205
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,760
We must...

1206
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,740
If I want to like...

1207
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,700
Oyster down the road of life.

1208
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,400
...kill somebody, that would be within my slack, right, Bob?

1209
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,800
Just his way.

1210
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,040
It's your God-given right to be an oyster.

1211
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:29,640
Yes, you, yes, you can lie on the air once you learn slack levitation.

1212
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:36,180
You can rise above it all effortlessly while laying prone and snoring.

1213
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,940
You can be boring poetically with your eyes closed.

1214
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:48,540
So wake up and join the Church of the Subgenius if you care and dare.

1215
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:55,020
That's subgenius.com on the wet or on the dry.

1216
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:01,720
Post Office Box 181417.

1217
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,040
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1218
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,280
44118.

1219
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,360
And now, thanks to Dr. Sinister's show, I'm going to go away.

1220
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,180
Reverend Sanger, I had one question for you before you go about the hour of slack.

1221
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,200
Yes, the hour of slack, yes.

1222
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:28,780
Yeah, last week it was show 1,000 and something, and this week it was show 1,100

1223
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,420
and something.

1224
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,460
Oh, on WCSB, they're plight all out of order for special...

1225
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,020
Oh, yeah.

1226
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,020


1227
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,020


1228
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,020


1229
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,020


1230
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,020


1231
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,020


1232
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,020


1233
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,020


1234
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,020


1235
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,060
...difficult to explain reasons.

1236
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,360
Mainly because we'll suddenly do a live show in the midst of a whole bunch of recorded

1237
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:51,440
shows and the numbering seems odd in WCSB land, but the other stations which are not

1238
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,800
lucky enough to have it produced right there in their studios, they generally probably

1239
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,920
play them in order.

1240
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:04,140
And they appear on the internet in ordure, framed in a sort of a...

1241
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,040
...a...

1242
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,220
...a frame of ordure.

1243
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,600
...a red mahogany.

1244
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,600
...on subgenius.com.

1245
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,020
Okay, thank you for cleaning that up.

1246
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:20,360
In fact, you can hear what we're saying right now all over again on WCSB.org.

1247
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,100
.org.

1248
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,220
But you can't in...

1249
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,120
.org.

1250
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,500
...Seybu, Samoa, Fiji, or Saipan.

1251
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,240
I can't believe we've still got...

1252
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,660
Actually, you know, I take that back.

1253
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,740
I thought we had 35 listeners.

1254
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,020
I thought we had 35 listeners.

1255
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1256
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1257
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1258
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1259
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1260
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1261
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1262
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1263
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1264
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1265
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1266
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,020


1267
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,280
...and we only have 35 listeners.

1268
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,300
But most of them are all the same IP address.

1269
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,300
Oh...

1270
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:48,220
Now at the KPFA station, they can look at a Google Earth map that has a little pinpoint

1271
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,920
icon showing where each of their internet listeners are.

1272
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,620
Well it shows where they're...

1273
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,240
...and they can spy on them from above through Google Earth.

1274
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,080
Well, it only shows where the server is located.

1275
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:00,840
That they're...

1276
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,920
...or the, you know, their ISP is located.

1277
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:02,940
Right.

1278
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,460
We wasted a couple of missiles before somebody told me that.

1279
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,620
Yeah.

1280
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:10,440
They went, man, the guy's probably not even in the back.

1281
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,440
Sometimes it's not even in the same city.

1282
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,760
Sometimes it's not even in the same city.

1283
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,840
Never actually blamed the missile company where the fault really lied.

1284
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:26,020
Yeah, they can watch their listeners from Google satellites with the thermal vision.

1285
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,180
They can see right through the roof.

1286
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:28,980
Nice.

1287
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:36,640
And with the right kind of digital radios, you know, we can hear the listeners if they had anything to say.

1288
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:46,100
But if they red dot your house too much, it means your microwaves, probably your more expensive brain control equipment is not going to work,

1289
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,980
especially during the summertime or in the approaching holidays.

1290
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,520
That's why I don't have cable TV or any TV.

1291
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:57,580
I don't let the TV television in my house because it doesn't matter if they're watching you.

1292
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,820
It's whether you're watching it.

1293
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,100
Exactly.

1294
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:04,300
Yeah, you can't have any co-ops nearby or else you're viewed.

1295
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:05,620
Right.

1296
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,660
It's bad enough that we're listening to the radio.

1297
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,080
But this is radio we make for ourselves by calling in to 216-

1298
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:12,500
No, Valfy.

1299
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,500
The S-5.

1300
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,900
Contributing to the conversation.

1301
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,460
You gave me an ear infection.

1302
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,340
Oh, yeah.

1303
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:22,340
That's better than some of the infections I've given some listeners just over the airwaves, you know.

1304
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:28,380
Well, maybe Stang actually did also get one of those little red sip slips explaining.

1305
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:34,200
What to do and who you have to speak to if you find a used condom in your ear canal.

1306
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,260
The Black Museum.

1307
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,420
A repository.

1308
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,540
The Black Museum.

1309
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,480
Not very pretty to look in.

1310
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,240
Here we are.

1311
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:41,760
Here we are.

1312
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,440
A bathtub.

1313
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,940
Yes, a bathtub.

1314
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:44,680
It's ugly.

1315
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,460
You got everything straight, Rod?

1316
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:46,760
Rod?

1317
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,060
Yeah.

1318
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:47,680
All set.

1319
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,160
Let's go.

1320
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:48,840
Here we go.

1321
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,000
Rod, let's do it.

1322
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:50,320
Right.

1323
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:50,960
No!

1324
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,640
And Detective Sergeant Wood.

1325
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,820
Not very much of anything, have we, Sergeant?

1326
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,100
Yeah, well, let's hear it, Wilson.

1327
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:58,800
How do you do?

1328
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,000
How do you do, Wilson?

1329
00:58:59,180 --> 00:58:59,580
Sit down.

1330
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,780
Yeah, well, let's hear it, Wilson.

1331
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:01,860
Yeah, go on, Wilson.

1332
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,420
You're certain of this, Wilson?

1333
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:03,800
Oh, yes.

1334
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:04,980
Very good, Wilson.

1335
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:05,760
Up and down.

1336
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,240
In and out.

1337
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:06,640
In and out.

1338
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,280
Oh, Pop might know something, Inspector.

1339
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,020
You, Pop?

1340
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,400
That's me.

1341
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,320
Who are you?

1342
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,200
Sergeant Wood.

1343
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:11,520
Yes?

1344
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,160
Every nook and cranny, Inspector.

1345
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,240
It may be interesting, if nothing else.

1346
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:15,760
Maybe.

1347
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,500
Maybe not.

1348
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,480
I don't remember.

1349
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,620
I don't remember.

1350
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:19,720
I don't remember.

1351
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:20,840
I don't remember.

1352
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,140
I don't remember, Sergeant Wood.

1353
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,720
Another pint of ale, please.

1354
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,460
Oh, well, so it goes, I will say.

1355
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,960
Another couple of pints, please, miss.

1356
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,720
I don't know nobody.

1357
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,200
I don't know nothing.

1358
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,020
You'll get off easily.

1359
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:31,640
I never did.

1360
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,320
I can't say it.

1361
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:32,780
I can't.

1362
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,400
But they do.

1363
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,800
We don't have to believe anything.

1364
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,360
You got her.

1365
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,580
Got her.

1366
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:37,600
Got her.

1367
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,800
Post-war disease of violence.

1368
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,120
And now, until we meet next time in the same place.

1369
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,060
Bye.

1370
00:59:59,060 --> 00:59:59,380
Bye.

1371
00:59:59,380 --> 00:59:59,740
Bye.

1372
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,400
Bye.

1373
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:00,800
Bye.
