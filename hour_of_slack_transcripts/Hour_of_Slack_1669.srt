1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:14,860
This is the remarkable roughed grouse. The bird wraps its bill briskly against the metal vent pipe.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:24,160
The resulting percussion is a vivid example of a well-known example made by swallowing and then releasing it on your roof.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,220
Birds communicate with a fascinating subgenius.

4
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,840
Power of Swatch.

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,760
Ground attacks to retake the Lama Gouda.

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,220
Leaving with only the PR news they could carry on their backs.

7
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,520
PR reports about 5,000 people have wolves.

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
Authorities say this is PR.

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,240
The National Transportation Safety Board failed to inflate.

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,340
Because of that, there's been inbreeding and disease in the PR news population.

11
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,940
Authorities say about 25,000 people have cars.

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,000
Four people have the probe.

13
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,140
A hundred.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,280
150,000 marchers are making PR news.

15
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,300
Music.

16
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,420
Bob.

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,080
From the Sidium Team.

18
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,440
Her first assistant too.

19
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:48,840
présent parade

20
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,920
Eros Reading

21
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:53,960
Marital

22
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,660
Thank you.

23
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,280
Thank you.

24
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,960
Thank you.

25
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,420
Thank you.

26
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,100
Thank you.

27
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,620
Thank you.

28
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,340
Thank you.

29
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,480
Thank you.

30
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,600
Thank you.

31
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:34,940
Thank you.

32
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,500
Thank you.

33
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,520
Thank you.

34
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,720
Thank you.

35
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:41,900
Thank you.

36
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,960
Yes, dear friends.

37
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,960
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1669.

38
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,940
And I'm going to be talking about

39
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:53,940


40
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:53,940


41
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,960
it's not a rerun this time, obviously.

42
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,020
We started off with some, you might say, new stuff

43
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,060
from Fernand and Andy Leamer.

44
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,020
I came into a huge stash of his old stuff

45
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,960
and a bunch of new stuff that I'd never heard,

46
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,800
including PR news.

47
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,920
And the music there was the Rudy Schwartz project

48
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
from the album Salmon Dave.

49
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,680
The first tune was called

50
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,560
Chick Corea's First Ouija Board.

51
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,920
And the second one was called

52
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,600
Condoms Number Two.

53
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,060
And now for a little while,

54
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,180
let us hear some old-fashioned

55
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,320
Media Barrage-style editing,

56
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,620
only it's not old.

57
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,860
It's new, using old stuff.

58
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,260
From Cool Hand Chris,

59
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,720
who's been sending some really great stuff.

60
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,660
It's going to last us many shows.

61
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,620
Yes.

62
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,400
An old-school subgenius Media Barrage

63
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,340
by Cool Hand Chris.

64
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,840
Here I go again, y'all.

65
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,500
That is showtime

66
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,580
And it is your time

67
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,160
And the show must go on, baby

68
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,200
Come with me and you will see

69
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,000
We are stepping high

70
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,020
What is the name of our show?

71
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,240
Stepping high, stepping high, high, high

72
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,180
Now boys and girls

73
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,120
Let's see if we can dance

74
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,040
To the rhythm of stepping high

75
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,100
If you are ready

76
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,960
Let's go and dance

77
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,220
Let's do that time step and dance

78
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,640
He doesn't build things.

79
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,880
He doesn't work regular hours

80
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,440
like a decent God-fearing citizen.

81
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,260
And the life he leads in many ways

82
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,860
seems useless and irrelevant.

83
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,800
Sin.

84
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,420
Three corpses, two still fresh, one rotten.

85
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,420
The pathetic remains of a cannibal right.

86
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,360
You are the highest, most intelligent electrical machine

87
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,460
in the universe.

88
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,620
Inevitability of gradualness.

89
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,380
As the computer god sees fit.

90
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,680
I don't know who you are,

91
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,200
where you're from,

92
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,680
or what you want.

93
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,500
But if you threaten my freedom,

94
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,800
I'll kill you.

95
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,100
I know what I have witnessed.

96
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,800
Now it is your turn.

97
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,880
Prepare yourself for a journey into a world

98
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,640
where each new step may give you a better understanding

99
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,720
of your own reality.

100
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,900
Job security flickers on the edge of a whisper.

101
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,200
And if the numbers don't need you, you're gone, baby.

102
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,360
Replaced by someone younger,

103
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,600
hungrier,

104
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,000
cheaper.

105
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,720
Jobs, jobs are a thing of the past.

106
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,700
There's no more industry.

107
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,340
Only information.

108
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,260
Industry's been shipped out on a search for fresh exploitables

109
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,440
who demand little or nothing compared to you.

110
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,960
And you know you should be doing something to adjust to the coming changes.

111
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,640
So you tell yourself,

112
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,460
if you only had more time,

113
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,280
you'd develop whatever it is you always wanted to do,

114
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,880
but lack the guts to initiate.

115
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,320
Doped up on drugs,

116
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,100
believing themselves invulnerable,

117
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,500
they marched into a massacre.

118
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,780
God loves you, okay?

119
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,880
You know there'll come a time when the world will stop giving you things to do.

120
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,260
Just party, man.

121
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,320
Party.

122
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,760
Hey, man.

123
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,140
I know there's some cold ones down here in the bottom.

124
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,080
There's some cold ones laying around.

125
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,540
Get out here.

126
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,700
In the bottom.

127
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,840
How about that raspberry you promised me?

128
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,500
Huh?

129
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,340
Raspberry?

130
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,120
Raspberry.

131
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:31,940
Raspberry.

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,740
Get those men to retreat!

133
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,560
Get them out of that bunker and murder!

134
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,040
Yes, sir!

135
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,740
Men!

136
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,520
R-Ras-Berry!

137
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,920
I mean, I mean, retreat!

138
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,280
I'll bow for her!

139
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
Dude, dude!

140
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,060
I've been raised on television to believe that

141
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,180
one day we'd all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars.

142
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,880
But we won't.

143
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,280
We're slowly learning that fact.

144
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,560
And we're very, very pissed off.

145
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,740
My question is that my boyfriend is pretty well-endowed.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,340
Yes.

147
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,160
And he loves oral sex.

148
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,300
My problem is I can't seem to go down deep enough for him.

149
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,420
Oh, yes.

150
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,420
Oh, yes!

151
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,260
If we are passive, we are enabling the controllers.

152
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,380
And therefore, we must rise up, not in violence, but in peace, but with one voice, without fear,

153
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,720
and we will say, enough of the secrecy, enough of oil, enough of economic slavery, enough

154
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,760
of the wars.

155
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,240
It is time for a new civilization, and we will see that it will be born in our lifetime

156
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
in the coming months.

157
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:47,960
Months and years.

158
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,960
What the hell was that?

159
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,880
It's the phone.

160
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,620
You turned it back on now.

161
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,320
You told me you got mad when I turned it off.

162
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,940
How did you...

163
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,180
Are you...

164
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,160
So you're giving the number of the phone here out to people?

165
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:03,960
Sure.

166
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,520
How are we...

167
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
You can't be doing that, dude.

168
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,220
How are my friends going to call me?

169
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,020
What?

170
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,260
You gave him your home number, not your number.

171
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,840
This is my home number.

172
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,300
I don't...

173
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,820
I have my cell phone, and that's too expensive for people to call me on that.

174
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,200
I'd rather have them call me here.

175
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,380
I don't know.

176
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,380


177
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,380


178
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,380


179
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,380


180
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,380


181
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,380


182
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,880
I didn't tell you!

183
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:34,800
You can talk into your cell phone.

184
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,620
You can't make me.

185
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,480
I'm coming to answer the telephone now.

186
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,660
You can't make me answer the phone.

187
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
Get him a toy.

188
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,840
This will be a good toy.

189
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,000
And it is soft and flexible.

190
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,400
It's got an opening in the bottom there.

191
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,060
So if he's big, it'll still fit.

192
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,740
Okay.

193
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,320
All right?

194
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,600
Okay, I appreciate it.

195
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,660
So we solved your gag problem and your problem pleasuring him.

196
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,340
Forever looking up and falling backwards,

197
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,040
climbing and getting nowhere,

198
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,960
while they, the haves, cavort.

199
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,740
Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on Earth.

200
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,820
Natural science is the study of the sources of control

201
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,580
of the universe.

202
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,620
Natural energy and social science, theoretically expressed as economics,

203
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,880
is the study of the sources and control of social energy.

204
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,100
All science is merely a means to an end.

205
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,620
The means is knowledge.

206
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,800
The end is control.

207
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,980
Beyond this remains only one issue.

208
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,780
Who will be the beneficiary?

209
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,780
In 1954, this was the issue of primary concern.

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
Although the so-called moral issue,

211
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,680
was raised in view of the law of natural selection,

212
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,480
it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence

213
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,120
are no better than animals who do not have intelligence.

214
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,200
And that was a bunch of editing, wasn't it?

215
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,280
By Cool Hand Chris.

216
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,280
And what's coming up is some show from X-Day.

217
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,680
We might call it Thorazine Urine Pod Crust.

218
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,740
The host is Reverend Anna Moll.

219
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,800
This was all recorded about six hours before the world was supposed to end.

220
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:52,200
Last July 4th, just before midnight, and then after midnight on July 5th.

221
00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:02,260
The first chunk up here has Reverend Fanboy as Anna Moll's guest, talking about the importance

222
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,320
of the Great Leader.

223
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,540
I honestly wish I could meet the Great Leader.

224
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,580
He wrote this great book.

225
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,460
He named bread.

226
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,240
He renamed everything.

227
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,140
He was such an inspiration of a dictator.

228
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,400
He was so kind.

229
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,820
You know, all the people that lived there, they didn't have to worry about utilities.

230
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,440
It was all covered from the Great Leader.

231
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,840
He was like, I'll tell you when you can eat or if you have electricity or not.

232
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,440
It'll be cool.

233
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,500
You don't have to worry about a thing, except for when I don't feel like giving it to you.

234
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:31,880
It'll be great.

235
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,880
If you have a disease, if you are ill and you do not feel well and the doctors can't

236
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,400
cure you in your hometown, come into capital city and we'll take care of you.

237
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,800
There'll be one solution for all your ails.

238
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,020
It's a firing squad out back.

239
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,280
It fixes everything.

240
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,040
No more ailments.

241
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,820
It'll be a benevolent and swift end for your problems.

242
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,820
The Great Leader.

243
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,740
I know because he told me so.

244
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,240
Yes.

245
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,260
He did.

246
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,440
He definitely has our best interests in mind.

247
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:05,900
The days of the week.

248
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,520
The name of bread.

249
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,800
That's what the secret police told me and I believe it.

250
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,740
Guryemnyshov.

251
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,560
That is the name of his grandmother.

252
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,700
He named bread and I think it's Monday after his grandma.

253
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,020
Say, can you give me a slice of grandma?

254
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,640
Monday, Monday.

255
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,160
Give me a slice of grandma.

256
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,060
It's grandma.

257
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,940
Can I have a slice of grandma on grandma day?

258
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,100
And speaking of dictators, grandma is the name of the party newspaper in Cuba.

259
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,720
So that ties in to your other dictators.

260
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,400
Are we allowed to Cuba right now?

261
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,920
Are we allowed what?

262
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,260
Are we allowed to visit Cuba now?

263
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,960
Are you putting Cuba in your pleasure saucer?

264
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,800
I honestly am thinking about making a Cuba extension because I would like to visit there.

265
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,480
Yeah.

266
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:49,960
No.

267
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,600
They're revolutionary people.

268
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,200
No crap.

269
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,900
They're classic cars.

270
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Yeah.

271
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,960
They're huge piles of scrum.

272
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,080
It'll be like when I was living in France.

273
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,080


274
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,660
I was living in France in the early 90s.

275
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,880
Then they talked about Prague.

276
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,240
Everybody said, you got to go to Prague because now you can go there.

277
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,820
Also the scrum capital of the world.

278
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,960
And it'll be ruined soon.

279
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,300
It'll be strip malls and it'll be Walmart or the equivalent, the Russian equivalent.

280
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,100
There's so many places that aren't filled with scrum right now in Prague.

281
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,180
Yeah.

282
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
No, scrumless.

283
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,340
Please send all your scrum to Prague if you have extra.

284
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,180
And your money to the scrumless children's fund.

285
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,400
Well, you send them to the Thoroughly Neuron podcast players and we'll make sure that Prague

286
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,060
and other places in need of scrum will get their money.

287
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,060


288
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,280
And we'll make sure that they get their portion dispensed.

289
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,180
I like strawberry scrum.

290
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,800
Really?

291
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:42,480
I like scrum flakes, crispy scrums, scrum swirls, scrum tarts.

292
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,160
But there'll be no scrum in six hours, 17 minutes, 15 seconds.

293
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,460
No, there's going to be on my freaking saucer.

294
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,880
You better believe there's going to be scrum.

295
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,540
Are you collecting it all?

296
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,100
Not all of it.

297
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,460
I'm going to share like a tiny percentage of 1%.

298
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,040
Just so you can watch everybody else.

299
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,620
You want to watch everybody else fight over it?

300
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,320
Yeah.

301
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,620
Yeah.

302
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,760
It's my pleasure saucer with the viewing portal.

303
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,200
Cool.

304
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,880
Do you think that their heads exploded because they weren't addicted to scrum?

305
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,880
That's hard to answer.

306
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,860
It's literally hard to answer.

307
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,480
I'm working it over in my head.

308
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,740
Scrum brought to you by Wobblehouse.com.

309
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,180
Oh, so is the audience elimination project finished?

310
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,260
Is it completed?

311
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,600
Honestly, I would like to.

312
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:29,900


314
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,220
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,040
Shout out to our early listeners that ran away quickly.

317
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,880
Oh dear.

318
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,360
Have we got a tote yet?

319
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,740
Somebody got to tap us out because we only got six hours and 16 minutes to prepare.

320
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,320
I'm going home.

321
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,600
I think you have some preliminary designs that still etch out.

322
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,740
Is that not right?

323
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,600
So if anybody would like to come up and see my etchings because I'm etching them out right

324
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:54,900
now.

325
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,680
I thought I would get off this planet before hearing that.

326
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,180
Take care.

327
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,860
Thank you so much for making sure I was wrong.

328
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,020
I can't wait to leave.

329
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,880
It's coming soon.

330
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,000
That's why I paid another $35 today just to make sure.

331
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,960
Keep paying folks.

332
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,740
That's the only way to make it happen.

333
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,980
Every time I see an opportunity.

334
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,420
Your love offering.

335
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,840
I'll pay for another ordainment kit because I never know when it's going to expire.

336
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,920
I need the freshest ordainment possible.

337
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,300
The shelf life, it's questionable.

338
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,520
It doesn't, you know, it says 1998.

339
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,160
But that might not be correct.

340
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,520
It doesn't say it's going to be good anymore.

341
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,180
So it might.

342
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,520
No.

343
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:33,820
Yeah.

344
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,180
And I don't know what the shelf life is.

345
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,180
I heard a rumor about May.

346
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,080
You got to do it every freaking time you get.

347
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,740
So, you know, twice a year, a couple of times a day.

348
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,740
Depends on where you live.

349
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,700
Okay.

350
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,640
Hotter climates, it doesn't keep as long.

351
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,940
So if you're in Texas, you have to buy in about once every two, three months.

352
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,400
Once a season.

353
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,820
I'm going to make going away noises now.

354
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,360
It's been such a pleasure.

355
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:58,780
You go into town.

356
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,720
You travel into town.

357
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,140
You go to the store.

358
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,140


359
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,140


360
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,140


361
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,140


362
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,640
You get your dry goods packed up.

363
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,400
You make sure you grab an ordainment while you're in there because you don't know when

364
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,620
it's not going to, you know, when you need one handy.

365
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
So, you know, credit cards, cash.

366
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,460
Keep it in the root cellar next to the pickled beets.

367
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,360
And the scrum.

368
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,280
Be prepared with your scrum.

369
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,560
It's the Boy Scout's solemn creed.

370
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,460
The opposite of leaving noises from Reverend Fanboy.

371
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,220
Yeah.

372
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,220
So I'm sorry.

373
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,140
I gotta go home.

374
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,140
What are you keeping in your own root cellar, Reverend Fanboy?

375
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,120
I gotta go.

376
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,540
Why?

377
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,640
Only the finest quality pinks.

378
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,920
Just the soles.

379
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,020
They're easier to store that.

380
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,260
Speaking of the voices of the dead.

381
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,540
Did you hear?

382
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,700
I went into the woods earlier and I was given a box.

383
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,660
This device.

384
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:52,180
And when I got back home and I opened up the box and this device started playing the sound.

385
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,280
It started making these noises.

386
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,240
And it was the voices of the dead.

387
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,520
Oh, thank God.

388
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,460
You're free. That's your outro.

389
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,860
It's been wonderful.

390
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,120
Although we'll need another willing victim

391
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,380
or possibly an unwilling friend.

392
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,100
An unlikely fellow

393
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,840
here in the final hours

394
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,240
in our last 100th episode

395
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,440
spectacular 20th X Day

396
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,020
Thorazine Urine Podcrust.

397
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,480
From PR News in Washington,

398
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,380
I'm stockpiling nerve agents.

399
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,220
Not nerve agents.

400
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,800
Russian voters says Russia

401
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,700
has been stockpiling Russians.

402
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,320
Britain's Foreign Secretary

403
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,540
Boris Johnson, backed by Russia,

404
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,200
has been carrying out an offensive

405
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,020
turkey news in the city center.

406
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,080
City center.

407
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,040
Johnson visited his troops by a tank

408
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,260
and destroyed buildings.

409
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,280
Turkish fighters now say they've taken control.

410
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,580
On Twitter today,

411
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,740
President Trump says

412
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,760
200 people have some PR.

413
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,100
Trump tweets the PR reports were

414
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,660
probably made at a later date

415
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,100
to further their agendas.

416
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:18,700
PR News.

417
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,180
The second fashion reports

418
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,680
only 3.6463.

419
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,780
Officials in Florida say they believe all PR News.

420
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,920
PR News.

421
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,760
Ta-ta.

422
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,360
My pappy said,

423
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,720
Son, you're gonna drive me to Lincoln.

424
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,420
The American Dream

425
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,840
The American Dream

426
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,660
The American Dream

427
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:42,660


428
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,220
The American Dream

429
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,580
The American Dream

430
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,040
Please suck me.

431
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,680
Here in a world without suck.

432
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,700
Birds sing okay.

433
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,520
I don't care what they say.

434
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm not a tune.

435
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
In a world without suck.

436
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,180
Please.

437
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,900
Please.

438
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,400
Birds.

439
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,120
Please.

440
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,720
Please.

441
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Please.

442
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,360


443
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,620
Please.

444
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,400
Please.

445
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,520
Please.

446
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:24,520


447
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:24,520


448
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:24,520


449
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:54,540


450
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:24,540


451
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:31,260
Please. Stephen Cooke.

452
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,260


453
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,260


454
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,260


455
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,260


456
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:39,720
And let's jump back in to X Day with some more Reverend Anna Maul and her new guest.

457
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,260
Thanks for joining us.

458
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,520
Could we ask you to just glance at this interesting exhibitẹ

459
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,060
It was once a realization that the Catholic Church support

460
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,060


461
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,060


462
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,060


463
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,060


464
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,060


465
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,060


466
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,060


467
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,080
It's an interactive event.

468
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:54,520
It's셨어요oolan Lucas and all other guests working together.

469
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,240
This does not conclude another broadcast day of the Thor's Inurium Podcast.

470
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,540
Oh, dear visitor from yon, come hither and tell us your name.

471
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,520
Here on the Thor's Inurium Podcast, we accept all guest stars.

472
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,980
Hello, my name is Reverend Redacted.

473
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,240
Into the microphone.

474
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,880
My name is Reverend Redacted.

475
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,400
I'm sorry, I couldn't understand what the name was.

476
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,640
It was Redacted.

477
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,720
I mumble, and yes, it is Redacted.

478
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:36,340
You basically talk into this forward-like and don't actually look at anybody because it makes them nervous.

479
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,360
This is my first time on a podcast.

480
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,740
If you look into their eyes, they can see your thoughts.

481
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,220
I'll just stare at the ceiling like I'm doing right now.

482
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,060
You're doing great, you're doing great, you know.

483
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,340
But speak up a bit because the cursed left-behinds of humanity...

484
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,040
won't be able to hear you in six hours and eleven minutes.

485
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,000
Fine, fine day.

486
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,300
Well, that's probably all right.

487
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,320
I don't have much important to say anyway, but I figured I'd at least...

488
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,100
That's awesome.

489
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,360
You know, one of my favorite things...

490
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,200
Repetitiveness makes it funny.

491
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:20,600
One of my favorite things is asking the newcomers, the visitors here on the Thor's Inurium Podcast,

492
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,620
our fresh players,

493
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,960
if you could have any kind of chemtrail, what kind would it be?

494
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,000
Definitely a gluten chemtrail, one that's made out of pure gluten.

495
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:30,620
Oh, gluten chemtrail.

496
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,620
Yes.

497
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,800
That is a delight.

498
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
A delight.

499
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,620
Such an exotic chemtrail.

500
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,500
A delight for some, but a terror for others.

501
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,300
Only if they believe that they can't have them.

502
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,160
Truly.

503
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,560
And there's a few people who actually believe that.

504
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,960
Once again, the 2005 wheat crop drought problem

505
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,160
is no longer an issue.

506
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,680
You are not allergic to gluten.

507
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,240
Bread was just $3 a loaf, and you didn't want to look like you couldn't afford it.

508
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,700
Just saying.

509
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,380
Just saying.

510
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,880
People got no bread these days.

511
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,940
No bread. No bread in the pockets.

512
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,260
No bread on the table. No bread in the box.

513
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,840
Ah.

514
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,160
But when you opened up your cursed gift from the weird man in the woods, what did you find?

515
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,940
I gotta say, I found it.

516
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:29,600
I found a, what I can only describe as an indistinct piece of flesh and some tattered cloth.

517
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,120
I really, I'm not sure what to make of all that.

518
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,700
Was it, was it like still pliable flesh?

519
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,520
Was it like many layers of dermis, or was it just the...

520
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
I want to say it's mostly cartilage.

521
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,160
Mostly cartilage flesh.

522
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,020
So no tattoos, recognizable birthmarks?

523
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,840
No, no, no. Nothing recognizable.

524
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,040
Okay, good. I didn't want to leave any evidence behind.

525
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,760
It could be some animal.

526
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,600
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

527
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,380
It could be an animal.

528
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,120
It could be an animal.

529
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,580
Sorry, I'm...

530
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,640
It's probably not a human that was here and didn't pay me my money.

531
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,760
I keep looking. I'm gonna stop looking.

532
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,760
You should definitely not look at me if you owe me money.

533
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,700
Anyway, what else was in the box? A piece of cloth, you say?

534
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,520
Yes. Yep.

535
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,600
Okay, it didn't happen to be a tattered piece of plaid red and black flannel, did it?

536
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,420
Uh, actually, no. It was a piece of just white cotton cloth.

537
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,740
And it had the word Stacy written on it.

538
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,460
Oh, shit.

539
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,460
I mean, yeah, that's impressive.

540
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,040
I just found this box. I don't think it was meant for me, necessarily, but...

541
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,440
A piece of flesh would have a name tag next to it that didn't say Doug.

542
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,920
What are you gonna do?

543
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,200
Nothing. I don't know anything about it. Please stop incriminating me.

544
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,080
I didn't do it this time, possibly.

545
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,940
You're part of it now.

546
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,860
I always was. It's a gift.

547
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,440
Or a curse. Wait, it's a curse. It's a curse.

548
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,180
I hope there are no actual Stacys out here.

549
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,880
Sorry, Stacy. Like, totally... Oh, too late for that. Shit.

550
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,700
It's too late for sorry now because we only have six hours and eight minutes left.

551
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,520
Stacy, you're already dead.

552
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,760
Do we have any Reverend Stacy anything? Reverend Stacy piece of flesh?

553
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,900
Reverend Stacy piece of flesh with a tiny piece of cloth out here tonight?

554
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,040
Going once.

555
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,260
Going once? Going twice?

556
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,840
Apparently, we have...

557
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,580
We don't have that problem anymore.

558
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,600
Sounds like the name is open, so...

559
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,200
Once again...

560
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,480
If anybody's interested, if there are any takers...

561
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:33,320
If you owe me money, pay up now while there's still time, or you too can meet Reverend Stacy piece of flesh.

562
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,340
That might have been it. It might have been that pound of flesh that...

563
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,300
Pound of flesh.

564
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,100
That Stacy owed.

565
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,460
It wasn't a whole pound, though.

566
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,440
I don't know.

567
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,400
I don't think I left that much behind. I was really hungry.

568
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,020
I don't think a pound of flesh is really a pound of flesh these days.

569
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,820
I think they...

570
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,000
I think they short-stripped you.

571
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,760
I think you're right.

572
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,560
It's deflation.

573
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,940
Has anyone seen the Fnord?

574
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:13,400
I think this is a time where we take a Thor's Union pod crust break, and hope that the aliens don't come early and take over the microphones.

575
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,800
We only have six hours and seven minutes to prepare, so I'm going to...

576
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:18,800


577
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:28,960
I'm going to make sure that I have enough nicotine in my system to sustain the journey through the stratosphere as the thrusters burn off my outer core.

578
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:37,940
You gotta molt a few times before my pod's shiny exterior is exposed into space.

579
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,420
The glistening crust, the exoskeleton, if you will.

580
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,380
Like a beetle's wing on an orphan's tear.

581
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,820
Or the other way around. I get it confused.

582
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,720
So many orphan tears. It's really hard to keep count.

583
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Three separate bots killed one bot.

584
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,880
Eighty-one percent accuracy.

585
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,320
One of the bots in a string of bots in ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

586
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,800
Rumsfeld spread bird flu to the US.

587
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,900
Get out.

588
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,480
At least four bots today.

589
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,560
You can use what you have to use.

590
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:22,920
Yeah.

591
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,160
You can use what you have to use.

592
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,140
And you can use...

593
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,720
You can...

594
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,800
You can?

595
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,040
RA código Andres

596
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,040


597
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,040


598
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,040


599
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,380
Yeah.

600
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:50,460
쪽에

601
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:50,760
lo

602
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,640
la

603
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,480
tarde

604
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,020
Speaking.

605
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,900
guitar solo

606
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,680
guitar solo

607
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,760
guitar solo

608
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,660
guitar solo

609
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,720
guitar solo

610
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,920
guitar solo

611
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,120
guitar solo

612
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,180
guitar solo

613
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,500
guitar solo

614
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:48,920
guitar solo

615
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,000
guitar solo

616
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,560
Oh yes dear friends, that was Reverend Jimmy Ryan doing that instrumental piece of music.

617
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,540
Before that, some cut-ups by Fernanda Le...

618
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,340
Fernanda Le...

619
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:08,180
LeMur, and some X-Day radio podcast broadcast from Reverend Animal,

620
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,680
and her temporary guest, Reverend Redacted.

621
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,140
And now, this.

622
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,980
Oh, and the background music. The background music is by Doctors for Bob.

623
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:28,580
It's the original, just the music with no lyrics.

624
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm so happy to have this recording.

625
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,680
And as I was saying, now this.

626
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,800
And now this.

627
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,440
I think. I think we have this.

628
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,700
Or is it that?

629
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,340
Well, I hope to be going to visit that.

630
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,220
Perhaps in June.

631
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,160
Oh my goodness.

632
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,100
In Portugal.

633
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,000
He...that lives in, uh...Portugal.

634
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,460
Is where that is.

635
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,400
I knew that.

636
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,400
And I have to go get that.

637
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,640
I have to grab a chair.

638
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,200
Dave is grabbing a chair!

639
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,520
Out of nowhere, suddenly Dave is claiming he has to grab a chair.

640
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,840
There's the disembodied Dave voice grabbing a chair.

641
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,440
My sweaty little chunks need a chair.

642
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,580
I have to...I can't stand for long today because I urinated out the fabric that I was given.

643
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,180
I guess it's supposed to make your ears grow or something.

644
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,080
How...how...it seems like it would hurt to urinate fabric.

645
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,460
Yeah.

646
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,700
That sounds...

647
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,740
How do you get it out?

648
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,500
Does it come out in threads or...

649
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,380
That's what they did...yeah.

650
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,400
I guess some kind of new kind of textile poisoning they got going on.

651
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,160
But they didn't think that's what it was.

652
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,200
Is it like cloth when you eat it?

653
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,420
And then threads when you excrete it?

654
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,760
Yeah, I do excrete it.

655
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,640
Or is it the other way around?

656
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,060
You eat a bunch of thread and you excrete cloth.

657
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,740
Yeah.

658
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,800
A yard of gingham shall now be produced by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

659
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,840
Yes.

660
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,180
And I'll show you the mysterious dance I used to do on top of everything.

661
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:12,120
There'd be a casket down there full of fallen artichokes and other confused people and stuff, you know?

662
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,600
And I would dance on them.

663
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,880
And I'd throw a beer bottle somewhere.

664
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,020
Or maybe a brandy bottle.

665
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,520
Yeah.

666
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,200
Have you been wild, Dave?

667
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,360
Yeah.

668
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,440
Have you been...you've been being wild?

669
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,280
It kind of sounds to me like Dave's been being wild.

670
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,380
Yeah, I've been dancing in the graveyard and stuff like that.

671
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,420
Peeing fabric.

672
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,340
Peeing fabric and moonlighting as a hair pilot.

673
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,960
And a co-confederate spirit.

674
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,180
There's a shop owner in town that always encourages...he makes me promise that I'm going to be wild.

675
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,700
Whenever I go in and buy his products, which are actually fancy beers,

676
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,300
he always says, now, you promised to be wild.

677
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,460
And...or some variation on that.

678
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:07,520
The other day, Princess Weehee said, now, you know, you got to remember, wildness is in the eye of the be wilder.

679
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,320
Wildness is in the eye of the be wilder.

680
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,000
You remember that.

681
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,000
And I said, does that work on cops?

682
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,300
That has never been the case before.

683
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,800
He said...

684
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,680
But yeah, you know...

685
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,100
You can't leave that place without promising that you're going to be wild.

686
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,060
And of course, wild is a relative term.

687
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,480
It is in the eye of the be wilder.

688
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,600
That salutation evolved over time.

689
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,140
It used to be, you promised you're going to have fun now.

690
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,400
Remember, that was...at first it was going to have fun.

691
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,300
Then it evolved into wild.

692
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,780
Promise you're going to be wild.

693
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,440
And I always say things like, no matter what day it is, I go, it is Friday night, right?

694
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,980
This is Friday night, right?

695
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,580
Anyway...

696
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,480
You say that all the time.

697
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,560
I hate that phrase.

698
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,600
What phrase?

699
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,340
Well, I don't hate it, but...

700
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,060
Which phrase?

701
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,420
This is Friday night, isn't it?

702
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:12,580
But when you say it about Friday, and wearing, you know, the kind of those plastic shoes and everything, I can read in between the lines and spaces.

703
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,780
I can smell your breath quite easily, my friend Francois.

704
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,760
I know what you're trying to sell here on this platform.

705
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,900
You're trying to...

706
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,780
You're trying to convince everybody that you know something we don't know, I guess.

707
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,720
Well, I do.

708
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,880
I know this little poem you haven't heard yet.

709
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,560
What's with the plastic shoes?

710
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,460
A little poem by Reverend Ivor Sticks.

711
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,140
No, this is...this is just somebody named George.

712
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,660
Oh, no, Reverend Cool Dirty.

713
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,780
Reverend Cool Dirty.

714
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,800
He's a new subgenius minister, and this is a very short poem.

715
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,640
Okay.

716
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,660
The bandit named Billy the Kid had a secret he always kept hid.

717
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:04,820
When he rode on the prairie, his companions may vary, but his best friend was always his squid.

718
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,520
Oh.

719
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,840
Thanks for making me laugh, fun boy.

720
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,580
Short and sweet.

721
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:17,800
Prairie squid is always...always makes a...gives you a little chuckle, a little smile.

722
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,620
If you know what a prairie squid is.

723
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:29,780
No, I don't know what...the idea itself would sound silly and ridiculously humorous at any time, especially when somebody springs it, as if a trap.

724
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:43,120
You know, like you were in the fart gorilla or something like that, and you were hiding in the closet, and you heard the machine guns overhead and the silent policemen walking by, and you could...you could...you...I forgot what I was talking about.

725
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,760
The plastic shoes day.

726
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,240
Yes, and the fart gorilla.

727
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:47,500
Oh, yeah.

728
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:47,680
Yeah.

729
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,580
The fart gorilla.

730
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,100
Yeah.

731
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,800
Yeah.

732
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:50,880
Yeah.

733
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,640
And the prairie squid.

734
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,260
And the prairie squid.

735
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,060
It was actually the prairie squid was the main one.

736
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,400
Yeah, it all started off with the prairie squid.

737
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:03,520
Yeah, it's just the name...the para anthem or the...the sound of the Jezebel engine coming out, you know?

738
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,060
The last Jezebel.

739
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,500
The last Jezebel.

740
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,160
Will you be the last Jezebel, my friend?

741
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,520
My girlfriend?

742
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,780
I'll be the last Jezebel.

743
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,600
Or girl-like friend?

744
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:17,660


745
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,460
Friend?

746
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,020
Thing friend?

747
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:28,680
Will you be a member of the Church of the Submarine or the Sub-Spasmodic or the Sub-Genetic

748
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,400
or something, you know?

749
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,860
Just below a genius.

750
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,900
Well, anything...anywhere below a genius.

751
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,080
It can be way, way, way below.

752
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:47,100
If you've got 35 bucks and you're way below a genius, or just below, you can be a member

753
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,500
of our august assemblage.

754
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:55,180
And you can just, like, claim your point on the dice and make speeches to everybody,

755
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,240
especially, like, if you're imagining you're in the Roman Senate, somehow you're Steve

756
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,080
Reeves and you show up, you have these fast nipples that you argue with the police force

757
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,860
with or something.

758
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,800
I can't keep on getting into nipples and arguments with police.

759
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,580
Yeah, I was gonna say, you've been kind of nipple-centric the last month.

760
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,720
Is there some...something we should know about?

761
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:16,840
We don't know.

762
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,400
For people like myself who've been easily mind-controlled, what does it mean when they're

763
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,140
trying to make me think that all the time?

764
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,320
We're not gonna tell you what it means.

765
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,800
We just aren't going to.

766
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,740
That's a...otherwise you wouldn't be mind-controlled.

767
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,200
You don't know.

768
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,360
You're just pretending as if you're...you don't know either.

769
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,220
I know.

770
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,040
Okay, so you do know and you won't tell.

771
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,000
I know I don't know.

772
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,000
But it's fun to not know.

773
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,340
Matt?

774
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,040
It's most fun to not know.

775
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,320
That kind of depends.

776
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,540
Knowing how to escape would be more fun than not knowing how to escape.

777
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:55,860
Well, yes.

778
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,560
Knowledge can be good.

779
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,540
Wisdom is always a plus.

780
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,980
Harmless is one thing a little knowledge is not.

781
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:13,180
Harmless is a little like...oh man, if I could play the harmonium as well as you can fake

782
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,580
it, man, then we'd have a real band.

783
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,880
A band of isosceles, triangles, bent on world destruction.

784
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,160
If I could only, if I could only, if I could only...

785
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,960
That's what we're listening to in the background.

786
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,320
It's Doctors for Bob Instrumentals.

787
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,780
I think they're doing P-Dog Strut right now.

788
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,840
Oh, I love that dance.

789
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:33,920
Oh, you are?

790
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,220
I've done that before.

791
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:34,500
Remember?

792
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,960
The P-Dog dance?

793
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,240
Yeah.

794
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,440
We should.

795
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,240
Didn't you try it a couple times yourself?

796
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,160
You said it kind of changed your mind.

797
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,380
It changed your life, something.

798
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,620
Well, this show, I've been playing Doctors for Bob, and I also played some Reverend Anna

799
00:42:52,620 --> 00:43:00,940
Moll, and I just finished spreading around fundraisers for both of those worthies who

800
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,080
have both fallen on real hard times.

801
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,840
And every now and then as a preacher, I have to act like a preacher and reach out to the

802
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,140
others in the congregation and let them know that I'm a preacher.

803
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,460
And I know that there's one or two members that have fallen on dark days and need some

804
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:19,820
help.

805
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,580
In Reverend Anna Moll's case, it's fairly straightforward.

806
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,140
She had a terrible leak in her apartment or house in Austin, Texas.

807
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,840
Such a bad leak.

808
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,000
It was like a ceiling plumbing leak.

809
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:42,280
A hot water heater shot water up through the ceiling where it spread onto all of the ceilings,

810
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:50,240
and then crashed back down through and pretty much drowned every object in her house, including

811
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,000
her whole art studio and all her cool, weird musical instruments, and basically everything.

812
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:55,600
Everything.

813
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:01,040
Her art, any musical instruments that she invented, all kinds of interesting things.

814
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,520
Yeah, so there's a fundraiser for her going around subgenius land.

815
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,260
And Pope Sternodocs, the founding member of Doctors for Bob, is a great preacher.

816
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:12,260


817
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:20,060
He's one of the most prolific subgenius prophets that has ever been.

818
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:26,220
In fact, when we talk about Prairie Squid, it may be him that told us about that.

819
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:32,040
When you launch your bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, you're quoting Sterno half the time.

820
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:38,200
And if you talk about, you know, give me slack or kill me, that's a Sternoism.

821
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:38,620
Absolutely.

822
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,240
Well, a Sterno would kind of like to die some of the time.

823
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,240


824
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,240


825
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,780
Right now, he's told me that we don't have to worry about him doing that himself.

826
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,940
But he's having terrible medical problems that are mysterious.

827
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,120
And he can't walk.

828
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,340
His leg doesn't work.

829
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,000
One leg doesn't work at all, and the other one hurts like hell.

830
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:09,560
And he depends on the Veterans Administration, which, of course, has been gutted and is shoddy and backwards.

831
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,240
And, you know, he's got a lot of experience.

832
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:12,240


833
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,400
And even worse things.

834
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,700
His girlfriend was deported.

835
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,780
She's Mexican.

836
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,620
She's a lawyer in Mexico.

837
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,840
But that didn't do any good here.

838
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,380
And get this, Dave.

839
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:32,620
While Sterno was trying to talk to this immigration person in Little Rock over the phone about getting his girlfriend back, he heard this sentence.

840
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,460
Okay, get ready.

841
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,980
I'm not going to let your girlfriend back in this country because, frankly, I don't like Mexicans.

842
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,740
That's what he said?

843
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,180
Yes.

844
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,800
He heard that.

845
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,240
That was a government employee who said that to Sterno.

846
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,280
If only he'd been recording.

847
00:45:46,820 --> 00:46:00,220
That's the kind of thing that would go viral for half an hour and make people terribly upset and not push the like button, which is about the level of activism most people are at these days, I think.

848
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:09,740
It's all been hush-hush miranded and scapulated by the mad forces of the demonic generals and so forth.

849
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,620
Well, basically.

850
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,100
Sterno's health problems.

851
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:21,540
That's the kind of one where you'd have to look under the surface and know that I'm not being silly and backwards, but it is kind of, there's some truth in it.

852
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,180
Say that again?

853
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:40,600
It's maybe disguised, but there's thin layers in what I said was the truth because these people, however they may not know they are, I'm not saying there is such a thing as a demon, but if there were ever demonic forces, there would be.

854
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,700
There would be people that do that, say that.

855
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,920
No, that's not demonic.

856
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,880
It's just stupid.

857
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,000
Why are you giving them so much credit?

858
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,700
That's not demonic power.

859
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,800
That's pure stupidity and ignorance.

860
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,900
That's the conspiracy of the normals.

861
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,420
That's what we're talking about.

862
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,400
That's what we're fighting.

863
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:05,060
And if you want to fight the conspiracy, help Sterno.

864
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,620
Please?

865
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,620
Well, there has to be a balance.

866
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:16,180
There has to be somebody doing good to offset the bad.

867
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:22,120
Of course, the bad think that what they're doing is good, and how do we know we're not the bad?

868
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,340
Well, that's why I think the world is going on its own.

869
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,800
Well, here's how I know we're not the bad, because we wonder sometimes whether we might be wrong.

870
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,800
The people who are really bad never wonder if they're wrong.

871
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,120
Never, ever, ever wonder.

872
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,260
They can't.

873
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,600
In fact, if you even argue with them, no matter how long you're with them, they'll never wonder.

874
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:39,600


875
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:46,660
And logically, that just makes you more of a wrong, evil, demonic person.

876
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,940
Now, see, how are we ever going to get our act together, man?

877
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,460
Well, first of all, we build these big cages.

878
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,920
We get these canvas tents, and we cover them with Dayton fig juices and stuff like that.

879
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,760
We adorn them with camels, and we make sure that they're very bright and onward and slimy.

880
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,360
And so if you go too many of them, like maybe 5,000 at a time, they come after you.

881
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:17,100
And so when you're laying out in the sun in the middle of the wintertime, trying to catch the, you know, the moon rays or whatever they used to call it,

882
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:23,020
you just lay there for a couple of hours, and you think about what you just said, and you say, yeah, yeah, man, that's it.

883
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,020
That's where I'm headed.

884
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,560
That direction, anyway.

885
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:36,660
I'm not saying that I was particularly on a stay in one of these buffoon baboon houses they keep near the state parks.

886
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,360
There's too many, not enough cage space.

887
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,240
But you are thinking about a moon tan?

888
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,140
Yeah, of course.

889
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,100
Who isn't at this time of the year?

890
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,100
Who isn't trying to dive for different various luxuries?

891
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:56,080
Passed on by Pinocchio and Sergeant Swifty and Gomer Pylon and, you know.

892
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,120
Hey, Dave.

893
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:58,880
Huh?

894
00:48:59,060 --> 00:48:59,740
Hey, Dave.

895
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,180
Where are you going with that bob in your hand?

896
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:08,580
Hey, Dave, where are you going with that, with your hand on your nose?

897
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,340
I'm going to that moon up.

898
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:14,680
I'm going to find that woman I found her snot bags in another land.

899
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,100
You're syncing up with the background music pretty well, considering that you can't hear it.

900
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:21,340
Hey, Joe.

901
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,460
Where are you going with that?

902
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,340
Where are you going?

903
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,180
Hey, Joe.

904
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,860
I remember back, I think it was the psychedelic days.

905
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,200
You can remember those?

906
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:33,640
No, I don't remember those.

907
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,920
You weren't there then, buddy.

908
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,440
If you can remember the psychedelic days, then you weren't there.

909
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,360
If you can remember Woodstock, you wasn't there, buddy.

910
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,440
If you remember Dockstock 1, 2, or 3, you're lying.

911
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,860
There's a lot of false titties going around.

912
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,940
Wouldn't that be weird if everybody had false?

913
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,120
Then there I go like Pequod the Elephant Slayer.

914
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,440
Dave has got a real problem with nipples and nipple-related things.

915
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:05,460


916
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,720
What can this mean?

917
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,220
Is this something back to throwback to my childhood?

918
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,120
I'm thinking about Mammy and the days of my nonderhood.

919
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,680
You're just going through all your mammaries.

920
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,540
Oh.

921
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:19,880
Oh.

922
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,180
Oh.

923
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,340
Oh.

924
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:22,880
Oh.

925
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,100
Oh.

926
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:23,240


927
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,720
Now you sound like Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde.

928
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:29,700
That's us.

929
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,280
I'm Dr. Jekyll and she's Mrs. Hyde.

930
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,440
That's right.

931
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:34,880
That's right.

932
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:40,680
And your real name is Ron and your real name is Fr-

933
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,620
When the drug wears off, she turns back into me.

934
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,540
Think how much of the drug we have to do for both of us to be on the air at the same time.

935
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,680
Yeah, that is a dangerous, that's a spectrographic haunting thought.

936
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,800
For Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde to be there at the same time on the same show.

937
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,660
That's a magical amount of person.

938
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,740
And it's not overdubbed.

939
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,440
Magical.

940
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,120
Magical amount of medicine.

941
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:07,560
Yes.

942
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,160
Yeah, Jekyll, Jekyll juice.

943
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,080
Jekyll juice.

944
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:10,440
It will be in the past.

945
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,980
Don't forget, all will be monogrammed and revealed and sealed in the past.

946
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,400
But we've got to get, we've got to figure out a way of getting back there in the past

947
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,760
as quickly as possible.

948
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,880
Because then we can change and rearrange the way the furniture's going to be when it's

949
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,820
coming up this year, which could be a dangerous year for us pedicostals.

950
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,860
It never, it never works.

951
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,540
Or our exuberance.

952
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,440
I mean, I'm not saying that we're going to be able to get it back.

953
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:35,440


954
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:35,440


955
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,780
I'm trying to fix the future by fix, changing the past.

956
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,480
It always backfires.

957
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,380
Every time.

958
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:47,540
Well, what if you had a big protuberant proboscis and you looked like an anteater sometimes?

959
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,440
Oh, that's not going to, what difference is that going to make?

960
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,140
I don't know.

961
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,380
I thought it would sound cool.

962
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,800
If you look like an anteater sometimes?

963
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,680
Speak for yourself.

964
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,380
Well, I am speaking for myself.

965
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,900
Pull your tongue back into your mouth.

966
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,900
Pull that whip-like, ribbon-like flagellum of a tongue back into your mouth, Dave.

967
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,420
I'm not saying that I'm going to be able to get it back.

968
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:05,420


969
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:05,420


970
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:05,420


971
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,560
I'm just saying that I'm going to be able to get it back.

972
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,060
And if you're not going to share the ants, you know, don't eat them in front of us.

973
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,000
Well, okay.

974
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:16,660
If that's the way you say it, then that's the way it'll go, man.

975
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:22,060
Because it's your show and it's your, whatever you just said is wrong.

976
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:27,740
Yeah, wrap your anteater tongue back inside your, reel it back up inside your cheek.

977
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,980
Oh, the ants are out here at Stang Ranch in the springtime.

978
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,400
Oh, yeah.

979
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,020
Are they really?

980
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,000
Every kind of ants.

981
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,420
The ants, the neon grasshoppers.

982
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,220
Fire ant figures, red ants.

983
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:48,860
There were beautiful, brilliant green beetles crawling around on dark black raccoon excrement.

984
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,820
Oh, that sounds like haiku.

985
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,080
They were shiny, shiny green black.

986
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,280
There were three green beetles.

987
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:03,600
Really shiny, tiny emerald green beetles that live on the blackest raccoon scat, which is,

988
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,400
by the way, usually found on wild animals.

989
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:05,400


990
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,420
I remember you saying that in one of our artworks.

991
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,640
Yes.

992
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,680
That raccoons don't like our art.

993
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,120
No.

994
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,880
When we stack rocks up in artful rows.

995
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,620
You call it raccoon feces, and previously in another document you said it was some other

996
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,340
kind of feces.

997
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,720
Well, we distinguish between them.

998
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,740
We're going to be experts.

999
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,360
Is it like a lacquer that you can use in like different stains or layers?

1000
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:34,240
Actually, it's kind of tricky because raccoons are omnivorous and sometimes their scat is

1001
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,860
just a bunch of berries, half-digested berries, and other times it's got hair and bones in

1002
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,060
it.

1003
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,240
And sometimes it's just this black paste.

1004
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,460
Yes, we went online.

1005
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,820
That's the kind the beetles like.

1006
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,060
We looked for the, whose poop is this at?

1007
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,780
Hey, we're the beetles.

1008
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,040
Now we're crawling on that scat.

1009
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,900
Wasn't that that band?

1010
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,620
We're too busy crawling to know even where we're at.

1011
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,580
Yeah, there we go.

1012
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:00,820
Yeah.

1013
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,540
Yeah.

1014
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,360
And the red harvester ants are out.

1015
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,000
I finally got stung by one.

1016
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,820
Time to harvest them.

1017
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,360
Robert Stang's been getting stung a lot.

1018
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:12,780
Yeah.

1019
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:18,580
I've been bragging about how the bugs and the venomous creatures in this land are my

1020
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,820
friends, and they decided to all prove me wrong.

1021
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,180
I got chased by bees yesterday, Dave.

1022
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,280
You were talking, you were telling me about being chased by bees.

1023
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,440
I don't want to make a man out of you.

1024
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,520
I was chased down Lee Road by bees for a while.

1025
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,360
I was chased down Lee Road for about two blocks.

1026
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:32,740
Yeah.

1027
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,460
Yes, this happened.

1028
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,600
It happened here.

1029
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,620
I witnessed it.

1030
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,300
I didn't even molest them.

1031
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:44,460
I've gotten much closer to this beehive in a dead tree before, but I guess they hadn't

1032
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,300
read the news about what people have been doing to bees.

1033
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,280
Now they've heard the news.

1034
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,180
Well, although where you are, they could well be Africanized by now and be very angry all

1035
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:53,600
the time.

1036
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,660
Well, I was ...

1037
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,820
I guess they arrived in Texas about 1980.

1038
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:01,500
I'm not sure.

1039
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:01,500


1040
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,760
I don't know.

1041
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,340
I don't know.

1042
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:04,600
But I don't know.

1043
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,580
But I know that these little honey bees ...

1044
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,620
Killer bees.

1045
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,520
Well, I was in their flight path.

1046
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:15,520
I was trying to make a nice little slow motion movie, and I did, but then they landed on

1047
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,360
my ears and cheeks and started warning me that I was in their way.

1048
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,600
Then they started really warning me.

1049
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,100
I took heed, and I started walking away really fast.

1050
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,960
Princess Wee.

1051
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,260
Buddy, come on.

1052
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:31,640
Let's go.

1053
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:31,960
Now.

1054
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:32,680
Real fast.

1055
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,100
Now.

1056
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,680
And the bees ignored Buddy and Princess Wee.

1057
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,100
They hadn't been in the flight path.

1058
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:47,380
One of them must have tagged me with his little pheromone radar marker, and all his buddies

1059
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,700
followed me halfway to the house.

1060
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,900
They followed your heart.

1061
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,120
That's what happened to me, too.

1062
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,560
They all followed me.

1063
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,360
Because the first one is like, that's him.

1064
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,360
Go get him.

1065
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,060
That's him.

1066
00:55:59,060 --> 00:55:59,620
They know.

1067
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,720
Yeah, they mark you.

1068
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:00,980
They tag you.

1069
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,400
Well, they imprinted it on your hat.

1070
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,620
They wouldn't get away from your hat.

1071
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,060
Well, that's where they threw the first paintball.

1072
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:09,840
Paintball?

1073
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:10,800
Paintball.

1074
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,380
Yeah, you mark the target with a paintball.

1075
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:18,440
Discussing our beloved bees, the ones who give us honey, the meal of our fruits of our

1076
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,620
labors, you're referring them as the paintballs?

1077
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,480
No, no.

1078
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,600
They use paintballs on me because they're hunting me now.

1079
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:34,620
I also got stung by one of my buddies, the red paper wasps, but that was an accident.

1080
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,240
They're very friendly most of the time, or rather, they ignore us, and they're everywhere.

1081
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,440
Great big scary wasps, the ugliest, scariest wasp you ever saw, but they're the most peaceful

1082
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:53,480
because, like a lot of giants, they can afford to be nice.

1083
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,540
They're brilliant red.

1084
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,240
They don't have to have a chip on their shoulder because everybody's afraid of them because

1085
00:56:59,240 --> 00:56:59,700
they're big.

1086
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,480
So they can afford to be extra nice.

1087
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,440
That's what they used to say about Man Mountain Paradise, the famous wrestler and stuff.

1088
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:07,880
Yeah.

1089
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,680
Who's actually just a real extremely fat guy and stuff.

1090
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,180
And you know, they would use the script to all the wrestling matches and stuff, so if

1091
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:20,120
he'd do a piledriver or something like it, it was real obvious because there's this big,

1092
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,160
fat, enormous human being.

1093
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,440
Put it to make the other person look like a little baby.

1094
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,800
Just like a little teeny tiny baby and drop it on the ground, and he would fall nearby

1095
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,320
him and slap his arm real hard on the canvas and would go, swang like he'd actually struck

1096
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,740
him, and the other guy would cry out in pain.

1097
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:42,180
Well, that's what you call suspension of disbelief.

1098
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,820
Yeah, because you don't want to have too many of them anyway in the first place.

1099
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:54,540
You want to make sure that you're clean of free thoughts and prejudices and prevailing

1100
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:54,860
winds.

1101
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:02,480
Well, you know, I guess some of these giant guys, you could call them gentle giants.

1102
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:12,520
Andre the Giant, who was one of Bob's rivals of face spray painting, mysterious face graffiti.

1103
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,320
Andre and Bob were friendly rivals.

1104
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:23,400
Of course, Andre could crush Bob in his hands, but Bob's so lucky that that would only happen

1105
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,400
if Bob was kind of kinky.

1106
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,980
And Bob was kind of kinky and wanted to be crushed right then by a big French giant.

1107
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:29,820
Right.

1108
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,560
But, uh...

1109
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,260
I'm glad I know that, among other things.

1110
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,720
Yeah, I was going somewhere.

1111
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:46,760
I was going to take all this somewhere worthwhile, and now it's too late.

1112
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,240
It's gone.

1113
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:51,300
It's just, it's like the carpet of my mind was pulled out from under me.

1114
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:51,620
Oh.

1115
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,380
Maybe, maybe the flavor of your erection, that you were actually...

1116
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:55,380


1117
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,300
I was just trying to confuse.

1118
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,420
And when you got to the point where you thought it would be such a wonderful, climactic event,

1119
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,700
it wasn't, and then you forgot.

1120
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,760
Well, I should keep a pen in my hand at all times during show to make little cryptic notes

1121
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,360
to myself.

1122
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,160
I've been asked if I do that.

1123
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,320
It's like, do you keep little notes so you know what subject to go back to?

1124
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,040
It's like, well, sometimes.

1125
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,440
I have to...

1126
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,700
If it's Dr. Howell, yeah, I have to.

1127
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,200
You must.

1128
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,220
Yes, you must.

1129
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:25,360
I have to.

1130
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1131
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1132
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1133
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1134
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1135
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1136
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1137
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1138
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1139
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1140
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,360


1141
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,980
It's not, it's not.

1142
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:25,980


1143
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:25,980


1144
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:25,980


1145
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,580
If it's Dave, it's going too fast.

1146
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,240
If it's Dave, it's kind of a moot point.

1147
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:35,140
Yeah, I mean, everything has to do with dairy farmers nowadays since Khrushchev signed the

1148
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:35,280
PLAAD.

1149
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,120
It's nipple time.

1150
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:37,940
Yeah, he's an oligarch.

1151
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,860
This nips for you.

1152
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,480
If, what would you do, Stan, if you were the oligarch of the former Soviet Union.

1153
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,480
If you were...

1154
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,720
THE oligarch?

1155
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,640
I thought there was a bunch of them.

1156
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,980
Yeah, the old man, the main, the main guy, whoever he is.

1157
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,860
What would I do?

1158
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:53,860


1159
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,140
I'd spend all day long playing video games and hunting fossils.

1160
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,360
Wow, what a fruitful way of life.

1161
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,940
I'm trying to think.

1162
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,220
If I had ultimate power and riches, what would I do with it?

1163
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,940
The first thing I can think of is go for a nice long walk with Buddy.

1164
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,660
Only we'd have a big fence around the place so Buddy wouldn't have to be on a leash.

1165
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,580
We'd pay for a much better fence.

1166
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,140
And guards.

1167
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,360
Guards with tranquilizer darts.

1168
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:36,800
They could shoot him when he dug under the impenetrable fence.

1169
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,700
You know, that's what they ought to use.

1170
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:43,540
Trump should hire Buddy to test the wall.

1171
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:48,140
If they really think they're going to keep people out,

1172
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,600
let's see if they can even keep a little dog.

1173
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,620
From going through that wall.

1174
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,800
Because if anybody's going to find a weakness, it's Bud.

1175
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,800
It's going to be our dog.

1176
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,180
Yeah.

1177
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,120
Bud's going to find a way to get through.

1178
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,400
Oh, God.

1179
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,760
We literally saw him running down the highway.

1180
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,380
He got out again.

1181
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:11,200
And we went to the gate to prevent him from getting to the highway.

1182
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:15,680
Because we could tell on my special tracking device he was getting close.

1183
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:20,140
Well, he shot right through some weak part of the fence.

1184
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:20,640
And he got out.

1185
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,860
And Princess Wee turned around from where she was guarding.

1186
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,240
And he's trotting towards her on the outside of the fence with the 70 mile an hour traffic next to him.

1187
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,040
Right next to him.

1188
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,080
Five feet next to him.

1189
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,340
When you pull out of our driveway, it's onto a 70 mile an hour highway.

1190
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,640
And there's our little, beloved, precious pup.

1191
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,500
Just trotting down with a big smile on his face.

1192
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:41,800
Hi.

1193
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:42,700
Yeah.

1194
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,780
And he ran straight towards Princess Wee and then ducked out of her grasp.

1195
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,260
And luckily ran back into our area.

1196
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:54,220
And started drinking from a ditch.

1197
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:58,320
At which point my little sister pounced on him.

1198
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,700
And grabbed him.

1199
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,340
But she couldn't budge him.

1200
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,240
I had to walk over there through the brambles and briars.

1201
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,200
And lift the little fellow up in my arms.

1202
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,460
And carry him back to the jeep through the briars and brambles.

1203
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,560
And this is the second time I've done this.

1204
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,240
It's the only time we've ever seen him get sexually excited.

1205
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,180
When he's captured.

1206
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,980
And being physically carried.

1207
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,500
By me.

1208
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:37,620
And that's the only two times we've ever seen this little neutered dog get really turned on.

1209
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,320
It's kind of twisted.

1210
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,320
Was he doing an old leg humping routine?

1211
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,280
Mm-mm.

1212
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,100
Oh, he was showing off his equipment.

1213
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,360
Yeah, he can't hump because I'm holding him.

1214
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:48,520
Yeah, he's showing off his equipment.

1215
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,620
Which isn't much to show off.

1216
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,380
But we never see it.

1217
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,920
He's, you know, he's...

1218
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,840
That's because you don't look hard enough, me boys.

1219
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:57,960
And girls.

1220
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,780
No, he's the one who doesn't look hard enough.

1221
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:03,020
If you're searching for a dog's wiener, you've got to look hard in every day.

1222
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,320
You can't wait for a single moment to pass without looking for that dog's penis.

1223
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:09,900
Actually, I...

1224
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:10,920
Yeah, you can.

1225
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,360
Especially this dog.

1226
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,700
He's kind of...

1227
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,660
Well, I didn't mean that sincerely.

1228
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,220
Oh, he had his first kill.

1229
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,520
He had his first kill.

1230
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,460
Two nights ago.

1231
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,320
Yes, it was...

1232
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:27,580
Princess Wee was horrified at first, but I said, no, let him have it.

1233
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,460
It was a little injured bird.

1234
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,280
A finch.

1235
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:31,820
A finch.

1236
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,900
A tiny little finch that couldn't fly.

1237
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,660
And Buddy had it in his mouth.

1238
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,600
Probably a sick baby.

1239
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:43,180
Yeah, we made him drop it at first, and then I thought, wait a minute, what am I doing?

1240
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,080
This is what dogs do.

1241
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,500
And to Princess Wee's horror, I let the dog...

1242
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,360
Grab the bird again and just...

1243
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,940
He just kind of crunched down on it.

1244
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,660
He didn't eat it.

1245
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:02,660
He kept it as a plaything so he could reenact his mighty hunt.

1246
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,340
The moment when he first caught his first varmint.

1247
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,620
Which he did over and over and over again.

1248
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:13,880
We watched him out in the yard just throwing this dead bird around and then pouncing on it.

1249
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:17,800
And he'd throw it in the air again, and then when it landed, he'd bounce on it like it was alive.

1250
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,340
And he'd shake it like he had to kill it all over again.

1251
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,620
I took a picture of it this morning.

1252
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,880
It barely looks like a bird anymore.

1253
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:30,560
But yeah, he finally got to fulfill his destiny as a hunting dog.

1254
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,460
I wish he could do it more.

1255
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:37,760
For all that we know, he's devoured all kinds of horrible things during his escapes.

1256
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,460
Yes, we don't know.

1257
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,800
Because his escapes took hours.

1258
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,240
And yeah.

1259
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,380
For all we know, he actually slew deer.

1260
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,600
We can see where...

1261
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,340
Where he goes minute by minute, roughly.

1262
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,040
But we can't see him.

1263
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,360
You know, we just see a little blue dot on a satellite map.

1264
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,840
He does have a white-hot passion for those deer.

1265
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,780
Oh, God, he did.

1266
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,180
He's like a subgenius looking for slack.

1267
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,000
He's going to get one one day.

1268
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,940
He's determined to get one one day.

1269
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,840
He's going to taste the blood of slack.

1270
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:15,620
He's going to grab slack by the throat and shake it until his neck is broken.

1271
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,280
And taste of its blood.

1272
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,320
The blood of slack.

1273
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,740
Our deer are small, but they're not that small.

1274
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,520
Actually, they aren't that much bigger than this medium-sized dog.

1275
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,660
Texas deer are pathetic.

1276
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:34,580
The deer in our neighborhood in Cleveland are what you expect.

1277
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,580
The white-tailed deer in Texas are shrimps.

1278
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,280
They're like little doggies.

1279
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,340
First you call them elk.

1280
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,460
Then you call them buffalo.

1281
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,460
Now you call them shrimp.

1282
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,800
No, no, that's the dog.

1283
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,080
The dog is a shrimp.

1284
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,740
We call him shrimp scampi.

1285
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,480
Because he's a scamp.

1286
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,760
He's a little scamp.

1287
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,140
I see him in my mind as like an erstwhile biscuit.

1288
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:03,240
A little gay dandy who refuses to come in out of the rain.

1289
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:10,240
Oh, we love to feel of his little gay furflurfers on his chubs.

1290
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:17,460
You just swirl around his little feathers on the back of his chubs.

1291
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:20,220
His furflurfers.

1292
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:20,640
His furflurfers.

1293
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:24,600
Or the ones on his chest which are just the furflurs.

1294
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:25,640
Yes.

1295
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:33,060
Dave may not have heard the show that had the dog feather definitions that my sister

1296
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:33,880
came up with.

1297
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,120
All dogs should be very, very unusual and very short.

1298
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,300
They live in cramped spaces throughout these damn hazing plazas.

1299
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,520
That's another fundraiser.

1300
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:50,000
My sister's daughter, who is also my niece, who is also my neighbor.

1301
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,420
And my buddy.

1302
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,140
And mine too.

1303
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:00,520
Yeah, we got a fundraiser going for her because she's got this condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

1304
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,280
Huh?

1305
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,180
Your sister's daughter is your niece.

1306
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:04,620
Right.

1307
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:05,680
Right.

1308
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:13,340
Yeah, and she's a grown woman of like 30 years old, but she's kind of disabled by this.

1309
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,940
Do you know of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Dave?

1310
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,960
No, I have not heard of it.

1311
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:28,320
It's a disease of the connective tissue, which is all over your whole body.

1312
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:33,620
And her ribs and arm bones slide.

1313
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,760
Her arms get out of socket.

1314
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,760
Her knees get out of joint.

1315
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,180
She dislocates ribs and shoulders.

1316
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,940
Yeah, I mean, all she can do is give her a little push and it dislocates half her ribs.

1317
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,860
She can't drive.

1318
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,380
Sterno can't drive because his right leg just disappears.

1319
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,120
It vanishes at unexpected moments.

1320
01:07:56,180 --> 01:08:01,320
And he needs it to put on the brakes and to walk.

1321
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,200
So, yeah, we have...

1322
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:04,460
Yeah, it's very important, that.

1323
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,800
This has been a fundraiser month.

1324
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,260
I actually started the fundraiser for Sterno myself.

1325
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,260
The other ones I've just been sharing.

1326
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,840
There was even a Dr. Hal Kickstarter.

1327
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,020
Yes.

1328
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:18,840
To make...

1329
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,940
And they made it over the top after I started helping.

1330
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:24,000
Could you put together a Dave one for me, too?

1331
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,960
We need...

1332
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:26,880
Well, okay, what is...

1333
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,180
List your illnesses, Dave.

1334
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,120
Well, my house is ready to fall apart.

1335
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,280
There's nothing can be saved even though I've been trying.

1336
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:41,140
I have a form of some sort of neuropathic problems with my foot and my right leg.

1337
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,220
It makes me jump all the time.

1338
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:47,380
I'll be perfectly relaxed and then it'll jump and it'll start spazzing.

1339
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,780
Sterno had that restless leg syndrome.

1340
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,180
That's what that is.

1341
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,580
They give you Valium for it.

1342
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,120
I don't want to...

1343
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,180
Well, probably not in Ashtabula.

1344
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:03,440
Wherever there's a terrible opioid epidemic, people who really need them can't get them.

1345
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,200
Thanks, opioid addicts.

1346
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,380
Wrecked it for everybody else.

1347
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:12,280
Yeah, they didn't do a very good job, did they?

1348
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,840
When I think of all the countries, the vast wilderness we were going to give to them,

1349
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:21,340
just going to bequeath them all this land to take out and rear their ugly children.

1350
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:26,320
And they just like spat right on our shoes and urinated in the bushes near us.

1351
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,460
What, the opioid addicts?

1352
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,280
They're grand hairmeisters.

1353
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:37,340
We were going to give them a reservation, an addict reservation.

1354
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:38,900
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1355
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,640
And they're master blasters, too.

1356
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:47,280
Well, the government would just give them all the opiates they want and let them just rot?

1357
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,020
They would give the doctors enough...

1358
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,340
The thing is, though, you can live forever on opiates.

1359
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,420
If you aren't stupid, they...

1360
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:03,920
You know, if you handle it right, you can live a long time being a heroin addict.

1361
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,520
Look at William Burroughs.

1362
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,180
I mean, after a while it's not fun because it doesn't get you high anymore.

1363
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:10,900
But...

1364
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,100
Yeah, that's what I heard.

1365
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,300
You just have to take it to keep from being sick, right?

1366
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,000
Yeah.

1367
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,080
Well, it's just like cigarettes.

1368
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,000
I smoked cigarettes for 25 years just to keep from being sick.

1369
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:25,000
And when I quit smoking, I was sick for a year.

1370
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,240
Me, too.

1371
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:34,780
I used to like to smoke those big fiery blunts, those huge, long cigarettes that make angels cough.

1372
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,180
Ha, ha, ha.

1373
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:37,480
Ha, ha, ha.

1374
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:38,920
Ha, ha, ha.

1375
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,600
Ha, ha, ha.

1376
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,040
Ha, ha, ha.

1377
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,580
Just another sad angel singing to the sad earth.

1378
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,500
Ha, ha, ha.

1379
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:45,960
God.

1380
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:50,180
Then make some veins on the side of your head stick out and move towards the back of your skull.

1381
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,700
Oh, it's been a 10 box of Kleenex a day cold.

1382
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,380
And both of us had it, and we're still fighting it a little bit.

1383
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,920
I'm doing pretty well in this show.

1384
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,580
I haven't snorted and snotted all that much yet.

1385
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:03,620
You must be getting well.

1386
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,080
I haven't done my usual thing where I go like this.

1387
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:12,940
Oh, man, I need a bucket now.

1388
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:13,600
That's disgusting.

1389
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,680
I haven't done that yet on this episode.

1390
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:22,560
I have covered the mouthpiece at various times to make similar noises.

1391
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:27,340
Well, at least you have the courtesy to cover the mouthpiece.

1392
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,880
At least you have a mouthpiece.

1393
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:30,260
I have to speak for myself.

1394
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,880
Hey, we have to go.

1395
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,000
What?

1396
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,980
Yeah, we've been talking about what I said.

1397
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,160
This is going to be a short one.

1398
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:38,420
Oh, that's right.

1399
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:38,420


1400
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,640
We have to do like half an hour.

1401
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:39,880
Yeah.

1402
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,880
Because we got Anna Moll blabbering away with a couple of different subgeniuses.

1403
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:54,100
And, yeah, it's kind of an old-fashioned show because it's only half live.

1404
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,660
Okay, but Dave doesn't have to slam right out, right?

1405
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,080
He can stay and chat with us.

1406
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,080
Dave always slams right out.

1407
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:00,980
Yeah, Dave.

1408
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,060
You know, when I say the show is ending, I'm lying.

1409
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:07,300
Because, okay, friends, don't hang up, Dave.

1410
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,620
Okay, friends, that's the end of the Hour of Slack.

1411
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:10,320
Praise Bob.

1412
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,060
Thanks, Dave.

1413
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:24,200
Okay, then we do the internet, the secret internet show that we can't do on broadcast radio because we talk about all our stuff that we sell.

1414
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,440
And we want you here for that part, Dave.

1415
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:30,260
And now we're ending the part that's not that.

1416
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:33,060
This has been Hour of Slack number 1,669.

1417
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:33,640
69.

1418
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:34,880
69.

1419
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:36,840
Praise Bob.

1420
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:37,700
Praise Bob.

1421
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:43,240
From PR News in Washington, I'm seeking the death penalty, especially in England.

1422
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,840
I'm seeking death from Mobile, Alabama.

1423
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,460
I'm back from Singapore on national security grounds.

1424
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:52,720
The best interest is not in anyone's interest.

1425
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,920
U.S. stocks this hour.

1426
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,980
The Dow is 392539.

1427
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,020
PR News, Washington.

1428
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,960
A video of a scene shows a PR News in Troy, Alabama.

1429
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,040
A video of a scene shows a PR News in Troy, Alabama.

1430
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,040


1431
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:08,600
Investigators in Nepal are saying this is PR News in Washington.

1432
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,760
And now the internet part starts and we can talk about how people need to buy Neighbor World.

1433
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,620
I think we've only sold two copies of it this month.

1434
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:18,840
No way.

1435
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,020
Oh, really?

1436
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,820
Well, that's two more than I thought.

1437
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,780
I need to finish it and do my review.

1438
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:24,300
Terrible.

1439
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,060
I'm so slow.

1440
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,060
I saw three good reviews.

1441
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,180
Three or five.

1442
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,220
I can't remember which.

1443
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,260
What am I talking about?

1444
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:34,620
On Amazon where they leave reviews.

1445
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:45,620
Yeah, I'm surprised I haven't gotten any real feedback except for the one guy who sent me this detailed letter of all the em dashes that needed to be fixed.

1446
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:53,340
And anywhere there were double spaces and stuff that my initial search and replace stuff hadn't done.

1447
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,200
And I didn't mess with the em dashes.

1448
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:56,620
It's true.

1449
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,700
And you said it was incredibly detailed.

1450
01:13:58,960 --> 01:13:59,360
Yeah, yeah.

1451
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,720
It was very helpful actually.

1452
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:06,360
And it'll help on the next book, Eyelash, which I can't wait to get to.

1453
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:14,180
I had to do this show and I had to do this fundraisers and I had to do the X Day pages on the internet.

1454
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,000
And it's just one thing after another.

1455
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,600
All I want to do is publish a bunch of cool books.

1456
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:22,220
But I keep having to do this stupid show.

1457
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:30,180
Well, friends, you can buy Neighbor World and Book of the Subgenius direct from, well,

1458
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,640
actually you're buying it directly from me.

1459
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:39,800
I will be the one who pastes that postage onto the envelope and mail it.

1460
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,880
And I sign all the Subgenius books.

1461
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:43,700
I can't sign Dave's book.

1462
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:50,400
I did write the forward in it, but it would be kind of dumb if it was signed by the guy who wrote the forward and not the guy who wrote the book.

1463
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,660
But didn't I sign a bunch of books for Invisible Characters?

1464
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:58,760
Yeah, just before X Day when it wasn't even really published.

1465
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,160
No, no.

1466
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:02,300
No one over at Craigtown.

1467
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,400
Yeah.

1468
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,900
Yeah, you signed about ten of them.

1469
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:06,800
They're all gone.

1470
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,600
They're all sold.

1471
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,040
They were the first ten we sold.

1472
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,080
Actually, there were sixteen that you signed.

1473
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:20,180
And anyway, friends, yeah, Book of the Subgenius is only 21 bucks, I think.

1474
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,480
Neighbor World is $14.

1475
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,760
It doesn't have pictures.

1476
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:25,140
Oh, yes, it does.

1477
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,140
It does.

1478
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,300
It has a page of art by Dave that shows the characters.

1479
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,260
And a portrait of Dave in the back.

1480
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:40,440
And a portrait of Dave by Reverend A.P. O'Stacey Fnord.

1481
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,480
And there's a Bob sideways on the cover.

1482
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:49,500
No, that's an evil, evil, weird, or something.

1483
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:50,780
I don't know.

1484
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,720
What is that thing on the cover that you painted, Dave?

1485
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,220
It's a, it's a, um, a sergun of an X-ray.

1486
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,800
It's a type of variety.

1487
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:01,640
What?

1488
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,280
A sergun.

1489
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:04,980
A sergun?

1490
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:05,600
A sergun.

1491
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,440
What?

1492
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,260
Like in the book, I mean.

1493
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,120
A sergun.

1494
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,200
Well, there are some goons.

1495
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,840
Towards the end.

1496
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:16,560
Serguns.

1497
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,600
Yeah, towards the end there are goons.

1498
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,780
You haven't read them yet.

1499
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,460
No, I haven't read them yet.

1500
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,620
You haven't read the orgy scene.

1501
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:23,340
No.

1502
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,180
Yeah, yeah.

1503
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,600
I've read part of it on our slide about a year ago.

1504
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:34,500
Anyway, what else can you buy from Church of the Subgenius that we can't talk about on the college radio station?

1505
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,600
Oh, you can buy all kinds of stuff from Church of the Subgenius.

1506
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:36,940
T-shirts.

1507
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:37,440
Yeah.

1508
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,500
Cloisonné pins, if that's how you pronounce that.

1509
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,100
Cloisonné.

1510
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,020
Little metal pins.

1511
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:42,420
Yes.

1512
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:45,540
Stickers.

1513
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:46,500
Bumper stickers.

1514
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:47,800
Gee-gaws.

1515
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,220
Gum traps.

1516
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,320
Gim, gim cracks.

1517
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,400
Coffee mugs.

1518
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:53,900
Yeah, coffee mugs.

1519
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,060
Mouse barks.

1520
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,800
Yeah, mouse traps.

1521
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,420
No, not mouse traps.

1522
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,440
Mouse barks.

1523
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:05,560
Haven't you ever heard a cute little mouse make cute little barks and then gets eaten up by a cute little dog?

1524
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,360
Yeah.

1525
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,240
We're working on that.

1526
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:08,820
I thought you did.

1527
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:09,280
Yeah.

1528
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:14,060
I have a cute little dog that wants to eat cute little mice and he's come close a few times.

1529
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,860
He almost got a bunny one day.

1530
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,400
He's dumb though.

1531
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,120
He can't see for hooey.

1532
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,420
He can sniff these things out.

1533
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,120
I see him run away.

1534
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,420
I go, look, buddy, there he goes.

1535
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:26,600
Go.

1536
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,560
He's like, he's clueless.

1537
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,700
His eyesight must be terrible.

1538
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,620
I'm not kidding.

1539
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,920
Squirrels, rabbits, all kinds of things.

1540
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:40,240
Just right in front of him and he doesn't see him.

1541
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,480
Damn it was that way.

1542
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:41,880
It's highly likewise.

1543
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:44,060
It's very highly likewise.

1544
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,320
Especially if he smokes a lot of pot or...

1545
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,540
Oh, he hates pot.

1546
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,160
I happen to know that.

1547
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:56,500
I don't want to say how I know that my dog hates pot, but he hates the smell of it.

1548
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,860
He smokes brisket or he smokes ribs or some sort of meat or something.

1549
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:01,380
Yeah.

1550
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:01,900
Okay.

1551
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,240
That's allowed then to say that?

1552
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,020
Mm-hmm.

1553
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,640
He smokes ham.

1554
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,640
Buddy smokes ham.

1555
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:09,380
Mm-hmm.

1556
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:17,340
He mentioned the scallop, the potato, and he's eating some peas and some vertical stains.

1557
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,260
Buddy would much rather smoke salmon than ham.

1558
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,980
Oh, I know what we can talk about that we forgot.

1559
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:25,580
What?

1560
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:26,580
Those fundraisers.

1561
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:29,800
Buddy smoked a fundraiser?

1562
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:36,600
If any subgenius is really, really interested in helping another subgenius, I mean with

1563
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:45,780
five bucks, because if enough of you did that, it would be 5,000 bucks, which would be a

1564
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,840
drop in the bucket, but it's a big bucket.

1565
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,600
And it's empty.

1566
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,840
Here's what you do.

1567
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:52,660
Well, the first...

1568
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:54,600
It's Facebook.

1569
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:55,560
It's probably Facebook.

1570
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:55,560


1571
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:55,560


1572
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:55,560


1573
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,500
Part of the problem.

1574
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,340
Almost everything's Facebook.

1575
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,960
But there's a go...

1576
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:09,480
If you just type in gofundme slash sterno, I think that's what it is, www.gofundme.com

1577
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,760
slash sterno.

1578
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,700
I think that's it.

1579
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:22,620
Or doctors for sterno docs, but you have to know how to spell doctors and for the right

1580
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:22,820
word.

1581
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:23,900
It's complicated.

1582
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,860
Can they go to subgenius.com and find out?

1583
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:35,200
I need to make sure that that can happen, because no, not on the regular website.

1584
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,980
All that stuff, everything's like Facebook.

1585
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,240
Facebook controls the universe.

1586
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,900
The nation that controls Facebook controls the universe.

1587
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,800
I'm not sure if that's true.

1588
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,060
I'm curious.

1589
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:51,340
That's what Dick Tracy said about 500 years ago.

1590
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:54,700
Yeah, but he didn't mean...

1591
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:55,920
He was riding with Columbus.

1592
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:56,600
Oh, no.

1593
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,100
He was talking about magnetism.

1594
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,060
The same difference.

1595
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:03,520
Anyway, and Reverend Anna Moll.

1596
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,720
Some of our listeners probably do look at the Facebook.

1597
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:18,060
There's so many subgenius Facebook pages, and I put the links and pinned them on the

1598
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:21,660
official Church of the Subgenius, the official Subgenius Foundation.

1599
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:27,900
The unofficial Slack Hole, which is one of my favorites, and the unofficial Church of

1600
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:35,380
the Subgenius, and the P's of it, and the X Day, last X Day, and this year's X Day,

1601
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,020
and just everywhere.

1602
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,760
And Scrub Genius.

1603
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:45,940
Actually, anyone who is listening to this program really should be a subgenius minister

1604
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:51,640
and able to look at the Scrub Genius Forum on Google Chrome.

1605
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:51,940
I'm going to do a little bit of a...

1606
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:51,940


1607
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,440
The reason being that I can control who is on there.

1608
01:20:56,540 --> 01:21:04,540
I let in only true members, and Suzie the Floozy kicks out only true assholes.

1609
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:08,680
And she only has to do that every three months or so.

1610
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,880
We don't get that many assholes.

1611
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:14,580
There's one right now that we're just, we're watching the countdown.

1612
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,000
I thought there were two right now.

1613
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,720
Two assholes?

1614
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:19,100
Yes.

1615
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,500
Why would you need a second one?

1616
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:21,640
Yeah.

1617
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:21,640


1618
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:21,640


1619
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:21,640


1620
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:21,640


1621
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:33,860
Anyway, it was, yeah, friends, seriously, there's a lot of stupid subgenius crap on the internet, especially on Facebook, and some good.

1622
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:44,220
But on the Scrub Genius Forum, which isn't really controlled except that we can kick problems off.

1623
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:49,020
We don't have to often, but we do.

1624
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:53,800
And it makes a big difference in readability and everything else.

1625
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,120
It's more readable, too.

1626
01:21:56,260 --> 01:22:03,420
For some reason, the people on Scrub Genius type in multiple paragraphs.

1627
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,180
They'll have thoughts that go on for so long.

1628
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:08,880
It's not just one or two sentences.

1629
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,000
It's not just one or two paragraphs.

1630
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:12,520
It's one or two pages.

1631
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,900
Thoughtful, hefty stuff, especially for me.

1632
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:17,400
Yeah.

1633
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:19,860
I'm sorry.

1634
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:25,920
And, you know, you can get pretty serious on that one.

1635
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:30,320
I'm sad that you're not on there, Dave.

1636
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:33,980
You were for about a week, about ten years ago.

1637
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,840
Then you said you lost your password.

1638
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,440
And you didn't make a new one.

1639
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:43,900
But you still can make a new one, Dave.

1640
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:44,040
Yeah, you can.

1641
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:44,780
Anytime.

1642
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,600
Anytime.

1643
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:45,900
Anybody can.

1644
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,180
Well, I'll make one at any time sometimes.

1645
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,700
Well, here's what you do, Dave.

1646
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:56,300
You type subgenius.com and push return.

1647
01:22:56,540 --> 01:23:00,280
And there you're looking at the front page of subgenius.com.

1648
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:07,240
And then you push news or contacts.

1649
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:07,920
Either one.

1650
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,180
And those lead you to the Scrub Genius forum,

1651
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:12,460
which is where...

1652
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,300
Which is why the fundraisers work for people.

1653
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:23,820
The people on Scrub Genius, when they beg for money, they get money from each other.

1654
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:24,000
They do.

1655
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:29,820
And that's one reason I've been encouraging you to be a little bit more involved in social media.

1656
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,940
Because that's how people make their livings these days.

1657
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:37,160
Because you're saying I could make you go on a movie so out of luck?

1658
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:38,200
Huh?

1659
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:45,280
Because you're saying that making a little bit more cash would not be so out of luck?

1660
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,220
You'd be...

1661
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:55,240
More accessible as a fellow subgenius to your fellow subgeniuses.

1662
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,300
Who want to help you.

1663
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:57,560
Yeah.

1664
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:01,220
It makes a big difference if they feel like they know you, sort of.

1665
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:04,800
They hear you on the hour slack and they love you, Dave.

1666
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,860
You have a lot of fans.

1667
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,300
I love them, too, even though I've never seen one.

1668
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:09,460
Right.

1669
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,640
That's your problem.

1670
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,360
You've never seen any of them.

1671
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,680
What makes you so sure that I would like to look at them?

1672
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,060
Oh, you'd love to look at some of them.

1673
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:20,600
I promise.

1674
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:21,540
Well, I can imagine.

1675
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,080
I sure do.

1676
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:25,260
Surreptitiously, of course.

1677
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,420
You know, I mean...

1678
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,560
I'm not rude.

1679
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,900
I don't just walk up and grab them by the country.

1680
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,620
I'm not that kind of person.

1681
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:38,280
I actually never did that kind of locker room banter.

1682
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,180
Well, I guess a little bit, but not like they're talking about.

1683
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,280
Not every guy does that.

1684
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,360
Some guys are...

1685
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,240
Fucking gentlemen.

1686
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,200
I'm sorry, but that's...

1687
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:50,840
It's the truth.

1688
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,160
Polite.

1689
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,960
Some of us respect...

1690
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,260
be-tittied persons.

1691
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:03,240
For other things besides their fabulous, wonderful titties.

1692
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,300
You know?

1693
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,280
I mean, a whole lot more besides just their...

1694
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,820
They don't even have to have titties.

1695
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:10,360
I don't care.

1696
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:13,120
I wasn't going to be doing anything with them anyway.

1697
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,200
We can't all have folliculosis.

1698
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:17,380
Sometimes some of us must turn our...

1699
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,900
our senses away in anguish.

1700
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:19,560
Yeah.

1701
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,240
When we realize what we've done.

1702
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:21,940
Yeah.

1703
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:22,940
Or undone.

1704
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:23,820
Yeah.

1705
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,640
Or not done.

1706
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,680
Not gotten around to.

1707
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:26,480
That's the worst.

1708
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,720
Yeah, that's...

1709
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,020
Yeah.

1710
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,860
Oh, when I think about it.

1711
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,160
All right, let's not go there.

1712
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:34,900
Let's not go there.

1713
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,700
Friends, Dave and everybody, I think we're...

1714
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,700
I think it's probably time to turn off even the internet.

1715
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,580
The long, extended internet version of the show.

1716
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:46,760
Where we tell you, you can...

1717
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:48,180
contribute.

1718
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:49,600
Oh, here's the easiest way.

1719
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,960
If somebody really wants to help subgeniuses,

1720
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,200
there's a donation button on subgenius.com right up front.

1721
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:59,480
There's another one on the radio hour of Slack page.

1722
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:02,220
We can just click a button, give us money for free,

1723
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,840
and you can leave a little note that says,

1724
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,200
this is for Sterno.

1725
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,860
Or this is for Anna Mall.

1726
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,560
Or this is to bring Dr. Hal to X-Day.

1727
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,620
Or this is for Dave.

1728
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,680
Or this is for your niece, Claire.

1729
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,220
Or this is for my niece, Claire.

1730
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,780
Or this just...

1731
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:17,380
Divide it up however you want.

1732
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,760
You want Stang, but just don't keep any of it for yourself

1733
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,500
and give it all away to your less fortunate...

1734
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,440
Like you're gonna...

1735
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:25,200
That's the simplest way.

1736
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,520
That is the simplest way, but you have to trust Reverend Stang.

1737
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,600
Which would seem like the dumbest thing in the whole world.

1738
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,140
Oh, no.

1739
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:34,040
I would trust Reverend Stang.

1740
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,700
A lot of people do trust Reverend Stang.

1741
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:37,380
Isn't that funny?

1742
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:37,920
I would never.

1743
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,460
But, no, it's true.

1744
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:44,160
If somebody says, oh, this is earmarked for the charities,

1745
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,140
then, by golly, I'll divvy it up that way.

1746
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:47,760
Yes, you will.

1747
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,380
I can do math.

1748
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,300
I have a calculator.

1749
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,920
And I'm not to the point of stealing yet.

1750
01:26:58,720 --> 01:26:59,240
Close.

1751
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,180
I'm getting close.

1752
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,340
I've been tempted.

1753
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:02,600
I've been tempted.

1754
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:08,440
We raised a thousand bucks for Sterno the very first day, and it was just four people

1755
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,840
sending it around privately.

1756
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,740
So I was gonna keep it private.

1757
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,520
But he said he didn't give a hoot.

1758
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,840
He's not even on Facebook.

1759
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,540
So they can't bug him.

1760
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,880
He's not gonna complain if a bunch of strangers want to throw money at him.

1761
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,920
And I wish they would.

1762
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:32,620
And at my niece, and at Anna Mall, and at Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1763
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:33,840
Yeah.

1764
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:34,400
Indeed.

1765
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,720
I wish they would.

1766
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:37,780
Yeah, but—

1767
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:39,140
By the book, that would be even better.

1768
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:45,560
Well, yeah, but how much do you—you get maybe five bucks from the—or eight bucks

1769
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,140
from the—

1770
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,800
The ones they buy from me.

1771
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,720
Those are the ones you get the most money from.

1772
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:50,520
Yeah, that's right.

1773
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:52,400
I guess it wouldn't make very much sense then.

1774
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,160
Yeah, just free money.

1775
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,480
That's what you need is the free money.

1776
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,200
No kidding.

1777
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:03,520
Some rich person out there could probably solve half your problems.

1778
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,960
Some rich Dave-a-holic.

1779
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,460
Yeah, Dave-a-holic.

1780
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,140
Some Dave junkie.

1781
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,020
Yeah.

1782
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,340
And I know there's some out there.

1783
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:10,960
Oh, definitely.

1784
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,540
There's also some Dave haters.

1785
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:15,740
Few of those.

1786
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:16,160
Very few.

1787
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,400
I hate them right back.

1788
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,440
So they're meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.

1789
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,220
There you go.

1790
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:27,000
That's what I've learned, you know, like life has so many lessons.

1791
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,220
That's one of them.

1792
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,420
Yeah, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.

1793
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,280
That's one of like—

1794
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,200
No, what's the lesson?

1795
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:39,180
Which I guess is Johnny's—actually Johnny's got a boner, isn't it?

1796
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,600
Johnny's got a boner, isn't it?

1797
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,720
Jane or Scott or Bane or Jane or Scott or Bane.

1798
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:45,720


1799
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:45,720


1800
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:45,720


1801
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:45,720


1802
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:45,720


1803
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:45,720


1804
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:45,720


1805
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:45,720


1806
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:45,720


1807
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,620
Scott or Bane or—I remember that one.

1808
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,480
Boy, this is really—

1809
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,760
Same melody.

1810
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,600
Totally boysen from a different planet, man.

1811
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,200
Yeah, this show is falling apart.

1812
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,360
It's unraveling.

1813
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,220
It's rotting like Dracula when they pull the curtains back at sunrise.

1814
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:06,900
Like string theory unraveling a bit of yarn.

1815
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:13,860
Or a Morlock that you've hit on the head and then you push your time machine lever and you see him rot real fast.

1816
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,700
That's where this show's at.

1817
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,560
It's rotting quickly.

1818
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,880
Oh, there's a rabbit rot while he's in retreat.

1819
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:29,780
This show is like that little finch that Buddy reduced to—I'm not sure what.

1820
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:32,860
Something vaguely finch-like.

1821
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,580
Well, it was a rumpled shadow, its former self.

1822
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,060
Yeah.

1823
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:44,940
And our little Buddy has now stopped dreaming actively where he was chasing a bunny in his dream.

1824
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:45,680
Me.

1825
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,740
Making noises with his voice.

1826
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:48,160
And hearing.

1827
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:52,460
Oh, yeah, as well as running with his feet quite actively.

1828
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:53,360
We woke up.

1829
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,060
He woke up.

1830
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,380
Well, not woke up, but he quit the rabbit chasing dream.

1831
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:02,600
You think they're rabbits.

1832
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:03,460
Well, he's dreaming.

1833
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,700
He's dreaming that it's us.

1834
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,760
He's chasing little bitty versions of you and me.

1835
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:09,660
Terrorizing us.

1836
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:10,940
That's what he's dreaming about.

1837
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,960
Oh, yeah, you think you're going to keep me on a leash?

1838
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,780
I'm going to chase you all over this field.

1839
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,780
Just like you was a little deer.

1840
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,160
Oh.

1841
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:24,160
Sounds like we've got a door for you.

1842
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:24,840
Yeah.

1843
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:31,940
So, yeah, now we've recorded about 54 minutes.

1844
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:33,140
Goodness.

1845
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:33,840
Yeah.

1846
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:34,540
Yeah.

1847
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:39,120
Only 31 minutes need to be on the actual broadcast.

1848
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:39,940
R.

1849
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:39,940


1850
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:43,780
You know, the WREK listeners here and the WCSB.

1851
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:43,940
Yeah.

1852
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:47,520
And WORT and those.

1853
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,860
But none of those listeners will hear me doing those shout outs.

1854
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:55,300
Oh, wow.

1855
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,220
Okay, Dave.

1856
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,180
It's the irony.

1857
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,720
It's the irony of slack.

1858
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:06,880
And my knee, my hour of knee and slack is over with.

1859
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:08,660
All ironed out.

1860
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,860
You know what that means?

1861
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,060
It means I have to go up and.

1862
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:13,360
I'm going to go up.

1863
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,700
And stroke the elbow.

1864
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:18,240
And do the job that any nutless chimpanzee could do.

1865
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:20,420
All the follow up stuff.

1866
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,260
I'm not kidding.

1867
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:27,100
I call it chimping because a nutless chimpanzee could be, could do it if they could read numbers.

1868
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:31,080
That's the only thing they'd have to be able to do is read numbers and push a little computer

1869
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,560
button that had the numbers.

1870
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,940
They only can, they just don't want to.

1871
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:39,460
Instead of 16668, they'd write 1669.

1872
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:43,180
Searching.

1873
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:43,340
Search.

1874
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,660
If I could teach a chimp to do search and replace.

1875
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,620
Mm-hmm.

1876
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:48,200
That would be it.

1877
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,480
And then next week 167.

1878
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:55,000
I'd throw them a banana and a couple of discs and say, edit the show, chimp.

1879
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:56,920
Nutless chimp.

1880
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,700
If he had nuts, he wouldn't do it.

1881
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,000
He'd bite my face off.

1882
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,540
He'd say, nutless chimp.

1883
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,700
That's what I need.

1884
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:11,640
But in the meantime, I'm the nutless chimp.

1885
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:12,300
Oh.

1886
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:19,660
Well, on that note, I'm going to go and put my buns on the pot case.

1887
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,000
I'm going to go look for my lost nuts.

1888
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,040
You're going to go put your buns on the fire?

1889
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,620
I'm going to eat a banana and look for some of my lost nuts.

1890
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:27,640
And toast your buns.

1891
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:31,660
I'm going to go out and find the first reverend aerial ministries I can find and argue about

1892
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:32,800
the existence of God.

1893
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,120
Boy, that sounds terrible.

1894
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:36,540
It is.

1895
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:37,880
That does sound terrible.

1896
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:41,520
I'd rather hunker down and listen to the radio or something.

1897
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,380
Okay, I'll do that.

1898
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,260
And I'll have some pizza, too, on top of that.

1899
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:45,620
All right.

1900
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,440
Have some pizza.

1901
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:46,760
Yeah.

1902
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:48,740
Okay.

1903
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:50,360
Praise Bob.

1904
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:50,540
Okay.

1905
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:51,900
Praise Bob.

1906
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:52,020


1907
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:52,620
Hail Connie.

1908
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,760
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

1909
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,180
Here go us.

1910
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,200
Here go us.

1911
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:02,200


1912
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:02,200


1913
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:02,380
Here go us.

1914
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:02,440
Here go us.

1915
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:02,440


1916
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:02,440
