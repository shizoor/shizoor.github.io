1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
I completely forgot! I did tell her though. We've been fluffing it and fluffing, but I don't know if they really came out fluffy enough.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,720
Well, I really don't know if I want Mr. Dobbs to look at a house like this. It's such a mess and clutter.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,820
My, my, my, what is this? I don't even know what it is. And it's all smelly.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,420
You weren't supposed to see that. You weren't supposed to see that. Here, let me just put it away.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,940
You know, you're going to have to stop this. You're really getting me hot.

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,680
Holy cow!

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
To fly in the face of age.

8
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:11,120
I hate this place! I hate the face! I need a razor! I need some more! God damn it, I need some more pills!

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,740
I need big pills! I need pills the size of Los Angeles!

10
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:26,800
Stop the song! Stop the song! Stop the song! Stop music! Don't make music!

11
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,700
Hey!

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,020
Hey!

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
I want to cry.

14
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,160
That is really, really, really sad, yes.

15
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,600
Listen, you can hear them again.

16
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,880
There they are.

17
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,240
And they're about to call me on it. Thousands of them.

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,980
Oh my God!

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,760
I don't think we can run away from this. We better...

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,160
They're coming!

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,700
You pretend like you just started playing along with them because...

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,040
Yeah, just play along.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,340
Oh!

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:52,920


25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,800
Oh!

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:54,940
Oh!

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,800
Oh, gosh.

28
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:12,420
Welcome to the Subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack sponsored by the church of the Subgenius.

29
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,220
I...

30
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,260
I just want the flag!

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,920
Those of you who would wish an audience for degraded mystic Bob must please sign in

32
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,020
and take a number.

33
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,520
Life is better than

34
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,980
on the other side.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,220
You know, you're going to have to stop this.

36
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,980
You're really getting me hot.

37
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,740
Holy cow!

38
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,100
Holy cow!

39
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,600
The Church of the Subgenius.

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,900
P.O. Box 140306.

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,460
Dallas, Texas.

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,940
7-5-214.

43
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,100
If you join, I'll let you spank my bottom.

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,720
If you join, I'll let you spank my bottom.

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,800
Come on, Jose, let's go.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,640
We'll sit in the anteroom together.

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,720
Now spread your knees.

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,900
That's right, spread them.

49
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,820
Spread your knees.

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,000
Everyone in the room spread your knees

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,760
as far apart as you can.

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,060
That's right, you too, father.

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,820
You too, sister.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,480
Everyone spread your knees.

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,260
That's right.

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,560
Now when the knees reach all the back,

57
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,820
be waiting, that's right,

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,560
behind the back of your buttocks.

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
When that's happening,

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,800
you've reached a perforated form

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,440
we call the extunction-unction format.

62
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,880
Okay, now everyone ready?

63
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,480
And stand up

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,900
and breathe out through the air.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,400
Keep breathing through the ears.

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,360
This way to the pleasure-ships.

67
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,120
That's right.

68
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,140
Keep breathing through the ears

69
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,900
as we step towards the crowd.

70
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,900
Keep breathing through the ears.

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,040
Open the third nostril.

72
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,740
You're only here.

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,480
And we notice a short trans-luminescence

74
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,620
around the shorty pie and the new cakes.

75
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,640
Some uprising in the kidney stew.

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,840
Some of you may be startled by the shape of the ship.

77
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,460
Of course, made as it is out of plywood and pieces of...

78
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,580
Well, you don't want to say the word because right now we're having a problem with rat feces.

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,640
But as you're on level seven, you won't notice the difference.

80
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,720
And there won't be any caustic or toxic shock to any of the...

81
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,940
You, you there with the nervous syndrome.

82
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,000
Put your hands down.

83
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,200
I can't.

84
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,700
I can't.

85
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,460
They're stuck up there.

86
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,540
I just can't move them down.

87
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,300
I'm too nervous.

88
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,380
I'm too upset.

89
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,100
I'm so worried about seeing the bomb.

90
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,540
What's the matter with her?

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,640
Oh, no, no, no.

92
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,780
I can't deal with that right now.

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,480
I don't go on until two o'clock.

94
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,000
I ain't got nothing to do with this.

95
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,660
Just tell her to keep on breathing through her ears and focus on her third nostril, man.

96
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,160
I got coffee to drink.

97
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,720
It's so scary.

98
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,840
It's all so scary.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,400
Linda.

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,000
Hi.

101
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,880
Hi.

102
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,580
Hi.

103
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,700
Hi.

104
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,140
Do not be fooled by the blatant subgenius propaganda that you may have heard on this radio station.

105
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,480
Just because Jesus works in their mail order department does not mean that they are Christians.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,960
They smoke unnatural herbs from Tibet.

107
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,300
They kidnap children and...

108
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,460
brainwash them into slaves for aliens.

109
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,860
They make it rain frogs.

110
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,340
Only through prayer, fasting, and chastity can we hope to overcome their sex vibrations.

111
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,260
Don't worry.

112
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,320
We'll do all the fasting and praying.

113
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,680
But you must not have sex until the subgeni are destroyed.

114
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:20,760
Because they can make your unborn child into a subgenius creature through their unnatural rituals.

115
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,360
The pipe of...

116
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,120
The pipe of Bob alone is enough to cause one thousand unnatural births.

117
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,700
We must kill Bob and make sure he stays dead this time around.

118
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,260
You must help us kill Bob forever.

119
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,760
Send one dollar to Ban Organized Blasphemy, B.O.B.

120
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:52,000
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75.

121
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:52,360
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75.

122
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,360


123
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,360


124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,600
214.

125
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,380
A murmur of faith from the heart of the Bible Belt.

126
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,040
Amen.

127
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,480
Thank you very much.

128
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,480
When I'm with you, pussycat, who needs grass?

129
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,620
Marijuana.

130
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,060
Reef.

131
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,020
Cashy's choice.

132
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,780
Buckle pot.

133
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,180
Grab.

134
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,180
Mary Jane's.

135
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,820
Kind.

136
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,460
Chronic.

137
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:11,920
Bud.

138
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,480
The rest.

139
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,560
You just passed the high times test.

140
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,300
This is concrete.

141
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,680
John made a sin.

142
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,960
John told a lie.

143
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,180
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

144
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,340
Amen.

145
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:22,360
Amen.

146
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,400
The Lord's a-talking to me now.

147
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,600
He's a-saying, a liar is an abomination before mine eyes.

148
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,540
Speak, boy.

149
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,160
Where's it hit?

150
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,140
Speak.

151
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,700
Speak or I'll cut your throat and leave you to drip like a hog hung up in butchering

152
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:42,940
time.

153
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,000
I was just wondering.

154
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,340
I was thinking about my big blossoms the other day and I wanted to go out in search

155
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,340


156
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,340


157
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,340


158
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,340


159
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,340


160
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,280
to go wander around in the maze.

161
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,260
You remember the

162
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,100
Bob maze we did with the

163
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,300
gigantic pipe?

164
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,440
Oh, that was so much fun!

165
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,280
Look, you can see it from the air. It's like a crop

166
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,140
circle. Oh, and it's so

167
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,360
craftily woven right above

168
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,060
the eyelids. Look, it's saying

169
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,040
something to it.

170
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes, it's saying...

171
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,320
It's saying

172
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,600
help me.

173
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,760
It's saying

174
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,160
help me.

175
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,280
And friends, I know

176
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,420
exactly how it feels

177
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,300
because the crazy

178
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,560
women just finally let me

179
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,300
out of the closet.

180
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,380
I'm feeling like my

181
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,320
brain is divvied up between

182
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,360
four or five

183
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,560
cities all at the same time

184
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,420
and not any one

185
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,400
section is any too

186
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,120
smart in any

187
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,000
given town.

188
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,480
So I'm trying

189
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,800
to gather together what

190
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
wits I might have left

191
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,380
here in Dallas.

192
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,160
But man, it's all jumbled together.

193
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,360
The radio shows from Cleveland

194
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,320
and the crazy

195
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,180
women took the

196
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,020
deed to the church off to

197
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,060
Boston with them.

198
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,740
And everybody in

199
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,020
all those places was packed into

200
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,100
one little Austin

201
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,220
room the other day.

202
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,880
And that was fun, man.

203
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,680
That was time.

204
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,300
That was time control.

205
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,600
I left the hind part

206
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,540
of one of my lobes behind

207
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,480
the couch at Paco's

208
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,920
house.

209
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Well, friends, we just got back from

210
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,580
the Austin devival

211
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,380
and everybody scored

212
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,480
last Saturday night.

213
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,320
Jesus married a

214
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,900
13-year-old boy.

215
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,380
Steve Jackson shoved a

216
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,600
beer bottle up somebody's butt

217
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,060
and kicked it till it broke.

218
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,600
Dr. Legume got to use my little

219
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,780
dog pudding as a way to get me out of here.

220
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
And Dr. G.

221
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,400
Gordon Gordon got a heart attack.

222
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,860
And then he shoved a beer bottle up

223
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,660
Death's butt and kicked

224
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,620
it until it broke.

225
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,620
And Reverend Ed Strange got a

226
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,700
free plane ride just for being such

227
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,720
a purdy man. And I got

228
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,060
poisoned by

229
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,080
Reverend Friday Jones

230
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,140
who got the church.

231
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,180
Yes,

232
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,680
she was the one who locked me in

233
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,840
the closet and took over the subgenius

234
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,240
foundation.

235
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,420
Which was great. It was a great vacation,

236
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,480
folks. It was wonderful.

237
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,540
The Austin show was great.

238
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,520
The Crystal Methodist

239
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,820
not only miraculously

240
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,320
got through to the

241
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,600
Christian radio talk show

242
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,780
repeatedly and got on the air

243
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,760
in Portland and on the speakers

244
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,720
in Austin, but so did a whole lot of

245
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,280
subgeniuses around the country.

246
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,080
Oh, and Satan's

247
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,420
cheerleaders were there.

248
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,540
Friends, it was a stone-fire

249
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,080
blast.

250
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,820
It was a real heart-plugger.

251
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,020
Who?

252
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,220
Friends, this is

253
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,980
the, uh,

254
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,200
this is the Crystal Methodist,

255
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,520
friends, their new CD,

256
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,080
New World Odor.

257
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,240
Wicked.

258
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,760
Every human being

259
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,380
by nature is wicked.

260
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,300
Oh,

261
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,660
oh,

262
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,140


263
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,320
oh,

264
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,740
oh,

265
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,540
oh,

266
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:34,900
oh,

267
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:35,860
oh,

268
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,620
oh,

269
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,060
oh,

270
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,080
So this is coming like a freight train.

271
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,420
We have to look at gun control.

272
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,960
They're moving rapidly to disarm the American people.

273
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,580
You've never had a country disarmed.

274
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,380
But it's gone into dictatorship like Russia, Red China, Cuba, Nazi Germany,

275
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,700
without first disarming them and taking their guns away.

276
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,480
And the gun control laws today are almost identical to the Nazi gun control laws.

277
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:23,020
As a matter of fact, I've written in recent months about the parallels between America and Nazi Germany.

278
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,100
The parallels are incredible.

279
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,580
The Nazis had a preoccupation with death.

280
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,540
They were big-time abortion, big-time euthanasia,

281
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,480
killing of crippled people and people they didn't think were worthy.

282
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,000
And, of course, same thing in America today.

283
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,800
The Nazis had an occultic dimension behind the Third Reich.

284
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,660
The Third Reich was essentially that the leaders, including Hitler, were Satanists.

285
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,240
They were Satanists.

286
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,760
They were worshippers.

287
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,440
And you find the same occultic dimension behind this whole plunge towards a new world order.

288
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,760
In our country today, they were animal rights and environmental freaks.

289
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,760
Back during the days of Hitler, just as we have become in this country,

290
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,880
they blew off their constitution, their traditional heritage.

291
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,800
They passed gun laws against their people.

292
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,640
They passed tens of thousands of laws, rules, and regulations

293
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,680
which made every German a potential criminal.

294
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,560
And, of course, the same thing is here today.

295
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,460
The parallels between Nazi Germany...

296
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,080
and the 1930s in America today are absolutely incredible

297
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,480
for anybody who would like to look at them.

298
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,980
All of this needs to be seen in context of the larger move

299
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,900
this is not happening by accident,

300
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,080
the larger move of the whole world towards what is called the new world order.

301
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,100
Ladies and gentlemen, every year thousands of landmines are abandoned by people

302
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,060
who just don't care enough to give their landmine the sort of love and attention it needs.

303
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,080
Under the mistaken belief that the landmine can take care of itself,

304
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,700
these poor explosives are left in deserted war zones and along interstate highways.

305
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,420
Most of them die of starvation.

306
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,980
Others are eaten by predatory wild hand grenades.

307
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,680
Those few that survive are ragged, pitifully hair-triggered creatures

308
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,860
who explode only in self-defense

309
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,900
and are often labeled bad

310
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,240
by media figures and the uninformed.

311
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,160
Please, we ask you, from the bottoms of our hearts,

312
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,560
with our hands laid on Princess Diana's freshly flayed skull,

313
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,260
take your landmines to a landmine adoption center

314
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,860
if you can't care for them anymore,

315
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,000
inquire about free landmine spaying,

316
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,220
and if your heart is big enough,

317
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,020
take a landmine into your own house

318
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,700
and make it a home.

319
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,260
Thank you.

The world order, or odor,

324
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,220
from their CD,

325
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,500
New World Odor,

326
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:55,740
is from Goidebaudgean P.O. Box 11877,

327
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,220
Chicago, 60611

328
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,440
For information,

329
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,720
we have also heard

330
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
little bits and pieces of,

331
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,180
well actually, there was some Frank Marino

332
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,560
from obscure psychedelic band Mahogany Rush.

333
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,760
Some of the guitar effects there in the background.

334
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,540
And drumming and spouting, dear friends,

335
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,820
from Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

336
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,840
recorded off of the Internet in several of these cases.

337
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,980
From WCSB in Cleveland,

338
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,520
which does indeed broadcast on the Internet in audioactive,

339
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,940
which was good enough for me to tape it off the air

340
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,960
and play it back and whip it around there

341
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,920
hearing a tape of a tape of a tape of a tape of a tape.

342
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,460
With Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

343
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,520
and special guest Crazy Woman, Princess We Are Doe.

344
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,700
Don't know, I'll have to check with her, ma'am.

345
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,580
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

346
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,620
I wanted the best prop for Mr. Dobbs.

347
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,800
You know he is a stickler for the stickler.

348
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,400
The church air is here, though.

349
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,340
Ma'am, we have gotten the church air.

350
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,040
It's all secured.

351
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,800
The church airs?

352
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,260
I didn't order an organ player.

353
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,600
We've already got someone playing with his organ over there.

354
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,980
Ma'am, you know Mr. Dobbs always wants the church air.

355
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,940
Well, all right, then.

356
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,440
I suppose we'll have to have it.

357
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,440
But what about the buffet?

358
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,080
The buffet?

359
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,940
The shrimp.

360
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,020
They're all smelling.

361
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,700
Oh, yes.

362
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,020
Well, we've been smothering the shrimp.

363
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,300
But, you know, the shrimp...

364
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,620
Damn, these aren't even...

365
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,660
These are dead prairie squids.

366
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,480
Ma'am...

367
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,180
Ma'am, they were supposed to be the best shrimp.

368
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,620
The buffo's ready.

369
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,220
Anybody ready to lick the buffo?

370
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,160
And get all fluffed up?

371
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,080
The celebration's all started without me.

372
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,120
I'm just...

373
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,880
Buffy.

374
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,160
Buffy, that's enough.

375
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,800
I'll have another little teeny lick.

376
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,420
Look at those.

377
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,640
Look at that fine, healthy...

378
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,020
Look at these fine, healthy toads.

379
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,600
Wow, these are prize-winning giants.

380
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,440
Oh, my.

381
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,200
Giant toads.

382
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,440
Get off my toad.

383
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,500
Sonoran Desert toads.

384
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,460
That's my toad.

385
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

386
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,180
we have spared no expenses at all

387
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,560
to raise the finest buffo for...

388
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,380
Look at that little one.

389
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,860
He's got human legs.

390
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,100
They're gene splice.

391
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,700
They're specially treated

392
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,480
to create the finest in Tock.

393
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,520
Now, see these toxins secreting from the warts

394
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,580
on the back of the little toad.

395
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,680
That's it, Princess Wee.

396
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,820
Oh, shit.

397
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,760
See how princess we are, though,

398
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,560
is scraping and sucking the...

399
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,520
The sour.

400
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,860
...the toxin droplets off of the pores,

401
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,100
the rather large pores on the back of the toad.

402
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,600
Be careful.

403
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,900
Now, some of those aren't pores.

404
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,000
Those are egg sacs.

405
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,880
You don't want baby buffoes growing in your stomach.

406
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,660
Oh, wait a minute.

407
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,160
You look real close at them.

408
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,800
Look at them.

409
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,340
Put your glasses up to me.

410
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,240
Look, man.

411
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,560
There's thousands of little severed heads

412
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,600
that are on top of each.

413
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:10,900
What?

414
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,040
What?

415
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,180


416
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,360
What?

417
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,420
What?

418
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,460
What?

419
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:11,460


420
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:11,460


421
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:11,620
What?

422
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:11,740
What?

423
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:11,820
What?

424
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,520
That's not a scale.

425
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,500
They're little tiny micro-heads.

426
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:14,960
Screaming.

427
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,880
Look, they're screaming.

428
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,780
That's right.

429
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,300
If you look at the back of one of those kind of toads

430
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,760
close enough under a microscope,

431
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,680
you'll see that the tiny droplets of toxin

432
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,820
that get you high

433
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,640
are actually composed of tiny one-celled heads.

434
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,160
One-celled golfer heads.

435
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,040
The brain, or so to speak,

436
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,220
is the nucleus,

437
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,720
and the skin forms the outer shell

438
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,060
or epidermis or scaly rind.

439
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,280
You go ahead and peel it.

440
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,580
Dave, don't eat it yet.

441
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,880
Peel it before you eat it.

442
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,200
It's on drugs.

443
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,240
It's on drugs.

444
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,820
You have to track the shell.

445
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,960
Please forgive this milk.

446
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,960
Right in my throat and right in my fillings.

447
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,260
Mmm.

448
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,620
Yum.

449
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,760
And those are...

450
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,020
As the tiny dandruff pill pie becomes engorged,

451
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,620
the rest of the organism waits for the sperm

452
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,760
to impregnate the whole lip.

453
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,980
Would you like some E. coli with your sperm, sir?

454
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,680
Mmm.

455
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,160
I'm not using my own...

456
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,080
And parmesan cheese?

457
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,200
That is some really tasty frog smegma.

458
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,200
Mmm. Yum!

459
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,360
Would you like parmesan cheese with your...

460
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,000
Dump a lot on there.

462
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,760
Put a lot of cheese on there.

463
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,120
You got pepper, too?

464
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,920
Dump a lot of pepper on there.

465
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,080
This is my last snack.

466
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,980
I'll have you know once I finish this.

467
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Whatever the hell it is, I'm checking out.

468
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,160
Buffo glandulars?

469
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,040
Have a little snack.

470
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,040


471
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,040


472
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,040


473
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,800
This is not what it is.

474
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,660
And how long you guys been serving up this crap down here?

475
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,740
Oh, this is...

476
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,560
Oh, not more than ten years.

477
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,700
This is relatively fresh for fossilized food, sir.

478
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,920
What's the lady of the house say about it?

479
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,580
I noticed she was, like, going into some weird hysterics

480
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,040
and her face was changing colors.

481
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,320
I don't know if she was eating the same stuff as me.

482
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,020
Oh, no, we were having a birthday party back there.

483
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,400
It's just...

484
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,140
It's a custom on our planet.

485
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,780
All right, all right.

486
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,220
Okay, just load it up real good.

487
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,240
But I want to know about it.

488
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,700
Am I going to have any, like, side after?

489
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,500
Mix or something?

490
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,340
No, no, no, no.

491
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,600
That is just our custom.

492
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,900
That's what we do on our planet.

493
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,540
We hurt each other and then we cry.

494
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,300
It's a custom.

495
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,200
It's just our custom.

496
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,680
Yeah, we do that at home, too.

497
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,140
No.

498
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,120
No, no.

499
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,000
No.

500
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,000
No.

501
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,000
No, go on.

502
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,300
No.

503
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,060
Don't tell me no.

504
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,460
No.

505
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,040
Don't tell me no.

506
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,400
Stop it.

507
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:26,840
Stop it.

508
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,200
Get back.

509
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,540
Back of there.

510
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,060
No.

511
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:28,780
No.

512
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,180
No.

513
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,560
Stop it.

514
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,000
Stop it.

515
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,340
No.

516
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:35,960
Weird.

517
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,200


518
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,220
Weird.

519
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,420
Weird.

520
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,620
Weird.

521
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,420
Weird.

522
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,560
Weird.

523
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:40,940
Weird.

524
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:40,940


525
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:40,940


526
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,240
Weird.

527
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,600
Psychedelic stuff.

528
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,200
Friends, I like weird psychedelic stuff because that's what was the most bad when I was in

529
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,840
high school.

530
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,960
I mean, I'll admit it.

531
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:59,040
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave there and Princess Wee and Chaz on Einstein's Secret Radio certainly

532
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,860
were weird old psychedelic youngsters that night.

533
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,040
Indeed.

534
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,800
And sure, it might sound kind of terrible today, but it also sounds kind of crazy.

535
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,980
And I think it's a little bit crazy because ancient psychedelic music from them the day

536
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,680
was.

537
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,440
It was, friends.

538
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,980
And, uh, yes.

539
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,340
This is a band called Lothar and the Hand People.

540
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,620
We're going to feature them tonight.

541
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,620
Sex and violence.

542
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,720
Sex and violence.

543
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,660
Sex and violence.

544
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,180
Psychology.

545
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,900
Muscle like

546
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,300
six, six, six.

547
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,100
Sex and violence.

548
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,740
Sex and violence.

549
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,180
Of sex and violence. Sex and violence.

550
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,300
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, violence.

551
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,740
Pretty horrible, isn't it, friends?

552
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:41,640
Well, at the same time, you know, the fact that this dates from 1966 should make you understand that indeed this at the time was what you might call totally rebellious.

553
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,160
Like real hardcore punk rap or something might be today.

554
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,980
But, you know, electric guitar special effects had just been invented and so had street LSD.

555
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:10,640
So when you combine all those elements at the time, you did get a certain fanaticism of weirdness in old mid-60s psychedelic music that I think still rings true today.

556
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:18,380
As exemplified in this beef heart like Lothar and the Hand People tune.

557
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,780
This is the end of the record.

558
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,940
The record has faded by this point.

559
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,800
I'm saying kids are little people.

560
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,700
Where are you over here?

561
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,820
Where is it?

562
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,140
Where are you over here?

563
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,180
Where is it?

564
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,100
Where you are?

565
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:24,740


566
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,640
Here's our little people.

567
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,340
And when I was a little person kid, I went to see my cousin Roberta at the far away and

568
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,400
exotic Cleveland Institute of Art.

569
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,300
And she played music from that album you just heard.

570
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,760
And I thought it was the coolest, coolest thing I'd ever heard.

571
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:52,580
Roberta or Bobby to her friends, she left the institute a week or two before graduation

572
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,140
to follow a guru.

573
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,720
And I thought, well, I'm going to go to school.

574
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,300
I'm going to go to school.

575
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,300


576
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,120
And I thought, well, I'm going to go to college.

577
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,460
And I thought, well, the rest is pretty strange history.

578
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,380
But she left me with.

579
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,980
I just wanted so bad to be her.

580
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,880
And I bought that album.

581
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,000
And I really tried hard to wear its grooves out.

582
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,560
It got lost at a party somewhere along the way.

583
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,520
And I've yearned to hear it for years.

584
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,440
And they finally rereleased it on CD 30 years later.

585
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,700
Anyway, I still think that Lothar and the Hand People are a little too much.

586
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:24,700


587
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:24,700


588
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:24,700


589
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:24,700


590
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,620
Lothar in the Hand People is one of the coolest things that happened in the 60s.

591
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,380
This is Princess We Are Doe, and Reverend Stang,

592
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:37,660
I think you ought to spin another Lothar tune so the kids can rock it good.

593
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,900
This is one of my favorites.

594
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,680
Lothar in the Hand

595
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,300
Oh yeah!

596
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,620
Machines, machines, they keep right on moving.

597
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,860
Machines, machines, they keep right on moving.

598
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:44,200
Well I've got to find a place to rest my head.

599
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,680
A machine he'd smile at me and say,

600
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,240
I'm gonna be all bad.

601
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,380
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

602
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,680
Oh yeah!

603
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:54,940
Oh yeah!

604
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,020
Oh yeah!

605
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,060
Oh yeah!

606
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,180
Oh yeah!

607
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:50,360
This right here, dear friends, is huge voodoo,

608
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,580
not ancient psychedelic music.

609
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,580
Huge voodoo with Bruce Grant and PK Jones.

610
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,760
Where do I stand without my body, huh?

611
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,840
Extremely interesting and extremely worthwhile artistic performances.

612
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,260
Here in the laboratories, we've wasted no time

613
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,680

614
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:54,680


615
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,080
The finest semen to impregnate your young ladies.

616
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,760
Icons of culture like the Reverend Ivan Stang

617
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,900
and their sperms have been cryogenically frozen

618
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,500
and await you for a minimum cost.

619
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,540
The depleted organs of Janer hyperglyphs

620
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,580
and others of...

621
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,020

00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,340


638
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,340


639
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,340


640
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,340


641
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,340


642
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,340


643
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,960
It brings out my testosterone.

644
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,520
Testify, brother, to your testosterone.

645
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,800
When I see that Friday Jones,

646
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,680
it pulls out my testosterone.

647
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,340
Testosterone.

648
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,840
No, that's not what you usually pull out, Reverend.

649
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,740
Um.

650
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,660
Wednesday night prayer service, please go worship Baal.

651
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,880
So you need to really get on fire for the Lord.

652
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,420
Rise.

653
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,200
And rise.

654
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,020
Taxi.

655
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,380
.

656
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,600
Empires and those civilizations, they-

657
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,460
As a woman, before you went into surgery.

658
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,980
I was really disgusted with myself.

659
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,760
At one time in my life, I weighed 260 pounds.

660
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,300
I-

661
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,900
I'm not gay anymore.

662
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,660
To become a girl, he tried to castrate himself.

663
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,300
Leave.

664
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,360
I am the true underground messiah.

665
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,620
When you come to my show, you're going to a war.

666
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,360
.

667
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,980
As soon as you turn your back,

668
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,220
everything in the universe snaps itself inside out

669
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,960
with a hideous sucking motion.

670
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,480
.

671
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,660
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible

672
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,500
is because it is only through the world

673
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,440
that you know the concept of impossibility.

674
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:55,840
.

675
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,240
You have been led to believe that everyone feels he or she

676
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,300
may be the only living consciousness.

677
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,320
But you are in fact the only one for whom this is true.

678
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,160
.

679
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,280
The fundamental structure of reality

680
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,020
is totally transformed every instant.

681
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,140
But it provides you with a phony memory

682
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,980
that it hasn't always been the way it is.

683
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,480
. Since you want some water getting water, justальной, water get over it.

684
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,480


685
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,480


686
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,480


687
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:31,020
are always at the exact center of an infinity there is no such thing as a movement location space or

688
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:39,100
time you are a row of electrochemical events taking place in your cerebrum

689
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:47,440
nothing has meaning in itself but everything can support any meaning if you could glimpse

690
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,800
for even a moment the real meaning of existence your brain would be neuroanatomically destroyed

691
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,000
you cannot conceive nothing for which you do not have a word

692
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,140
everyone's perception is radically unique it leads them to believe it is more or less

693
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,540
similar for everyone else you have always been listening to this tape

694
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,320
you can

695
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,160
not remember a time before you were born because there was no such time nor any other

696
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:31,460
it has always been this moment death could occur inexplicably any second

697
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,380
the oddness of the world exceeds the imagination by an infinity

698
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:46,940
it has produced this talking about it this talker this labeling of it this labeler the concept of

699
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,420
the blame

700
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:57,820
the concept of oddness the word oddness the concept of a word the word word the word concept

701
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:06,100
and the concept of a concept consciousness is not a continuous state but a momentary

702
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:13,320
surfacer for variable periods at random points your next awakening could be 20 years from now

703
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,420
nothing can be proven to be possible

704
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:17,420


705
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:17,420


706
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:26,480
be true. Because reality is composed of infinitesimally small moments, there is no such thing as an

707
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:34,260
event. The reason people are untrustworthy is because their cerebral processes are fundamentally

708
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:42,660
random ones. During the night, every ego in the world changes bodies, inheriting also

709
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:51,040
the memory. Old age is not a gradual, but a catastrophic process, and could strike at

710
00:34:51,040 --> 00:35:00,560
any moment. Dreams are the reality for which the real world is a dream. There has never

711
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,560
been a time in history when men have voluntarily used less than the greatest possible military

712
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,640
technology against their enemy, and allowed a great technology to fall into disuse and

713
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:23,540
ignorance. Therefore, there will be a full-scale nuclear holocaust. You are dreaming this moment.

714
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,260
The universe will continue to expand until there is not enough matter per unit space

715
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:39,520
to provide the gravity necessary for regeneration, and it will slowly die out. When you finish

716
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,380
listening to this, everything will be different.

717
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,040
You may not remember it from the way it was when you began, but again, your new memory

718
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:56,680
will conceal this from you. All events occur at random. The universe is one of an infinite

719
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,280
number of universes, the closest of which is undetectable, being a billion universe

720
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:09,520
lengths away. Only what you are experiencing right now exists.

721
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:20,420
Love is the feeling that another person is really yourself. You are about to make the

722
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,200
first conscious decision of your life.

723
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,940
Uh oh.

724
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,500
You in big trouble now, dear friends? You now have the power to change the world. You

725
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,540
are the power. What are you going to do with it, eh?

726
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:52,620
Well that was Pope M. Ho-Pep, innocent, the third, or Reverend Michael Pepe, and you are

727
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,920
listening to the Hour of Slack Radio Ministry here on KNON.

728
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:09,160
We built them to serve us. Machines, machines. We built them to serve us. But till the day

729
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:20,420
I'm buried in my grave. Yes, right until that day I know I'm gonna be a slave, a slave,

730
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,260
a slave, a slave.

731
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:36,060
Machines, machines. They keep right on grinning. Machines, machines. They keep right on grinning.

732
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,620
Yeah.

733
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,700
Bow, bow, bow, bow.

734
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,660
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

735
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,460
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

736
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,360
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

737
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,440
Bow, bow, bow, bow.

738
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,900
Bow, bow, bow, bow.

739
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,620
Bow, bow, bow, bow.

740
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,920
Bow, bow, bow, bow.

741
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:03,260
Yes, we built them to serve us. And these boys sure do make awesome use of them. We

742
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:08,320
are Doe here again, and if you just tuned in, that was one of my most favorite old bands.

743
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:16,420
Lothar and the hand people. Lothar is what the hand people call that theremin. The tall,

744
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:24,500
slender, silver, very, very sensitive rod that makes the grooviest, grooviest sounds

745
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:31,660
when hands enter its energy field. Toss in a couple of Moog synthesizers, Ampex tape

746
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,600
decks, a linear controller, and some pretty righteous guitar and keyboards and you're

747
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:44,100
beginning to understand this thing, this Lothar and the hand people thing that I love so much.

748
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:51,900
Reverend Stang will be sparking your eardrums with more Lothar throughout this show.

749
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,580
Bye bye love, bye bye happiness, bye bye happiness, bye bye happiness, bye bye happiness, bye bye

750
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:07,580


751
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,400
happiness.

752
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:21,020
Hello loneliness, I think I'm gonna cry, bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness,

753
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,180
I feel like I could die, bye bye my love, goodbye.

754
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:37,520
There goes my baby with someone new, she sure looks happy, I sure do.

755
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:37,580


756
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:37,580


757
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:44,360
She was my baby till he stepped in

758
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,480
Goodbye to romance that might have been

759
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:56,820
Bye-bye love, bye-bye happiness

760
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,980
And no loneliness, I think I'm gonna cry

761
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,560
Bye-bye love, bye-bye sweet caress

762
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,760
And no emptiness, I feel like I could die

763
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,300
Bye-bye my love, goodbye

764
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,860
I'm dying. By the time you see this, I'll be dead.

765
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,600
Kids, think about it before you sign that piece of paper.

766
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,460
Praise Bob.

767
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,800
Remember any defects from the sperm?

768
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,440
Some of the Reverend Ivan's stang are not considered negotiable.

769
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,060
Your attention, please.

770
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,360
The views expressed on this show are taken from the word of God.

771
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,460
They do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of this station,

772
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,380
their staff, management, or advertisers.

773
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,540
However,

774
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,660
they are beginning to come around.

775
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,160
Please,

776
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,180
the information given you on this broadcast could save your life.

777
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,660
Listen with care.

778
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,440
We will preserve and we will enlarge the American dream.

779
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,160
We will nourish and we will refresh the American spirit.

780
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,220
We will enhance the quality of life for all Americans.

781
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:39,180
And we will prove once again that in America, the voices of despair are ultimately stilled

782
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,600
by the clear fact of progress.

783
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:51,220
In closing, let me say simply that I'm growing terribly weary of America's noisy detractors.

784
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,680
Housewitz! Housewitz! Housewitz! Housewitz!

785
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,960
Subgenius is for sale.

786
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:01,960


787
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:01,960


788
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:01,960


789
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:01,960


790
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:01,960


791
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,500
They will not save your soul.

792
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,420
They will eat it.

793
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,420
They will not get you into heaven.

794
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,960
They will pitch you into hell and roast marshmallows over your smoking carcass.

795
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,460
Your money will be spent on Thailand pleasure houses and their vast weapon stashes.

796
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:24,400
While your children starve in the subgenius sweatshops printing out pamphlets and making bizarre ritual garb.

797
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,660
Not only do the subgenius turn their faces away from God, they actually moon him.

798
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,940
They worship God.

799
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:31,940


800
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,360
They worship whatever they want to.

801
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:39,860
They wear their shoes on the wrong feet and even go barefoot to imitate their Bigfoot fathers.

802
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,880
They like bad movies.

803
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,020
Truly their evil is never ending and infinite.

804
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,920
You must help us silence evil ones.

805
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,220
Send one dollar to Ban Organized Blasphemy.

806
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,060
B.O.B.

807
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,640
P.O. Box 140306.

808
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,500
Dallas, Texas.

809
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,280
75214.

810
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,460
A murmur of faith from the heart of the Bible Belt.

811
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,620
Oh.

812
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,480
Some pleasure.

813
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,300
Oh.

814
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,760
I kit off некотор

815
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,000
and from my

816
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,580
incestuous

817
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:45,360
But friends, you know, there's one thing that we've got that the all those other of

818
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,460
the Rival religious nuts don't have.

819
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,380
Sheer total unbridled hate.

820
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,500
Oh yes, cause we can at least admit it.

821
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,300
We're not gonna sit and try to pretend that we love you.

822
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,940
The jerk's T.V., each and everyone of us always wants the T.V. T.V. T Title.

823
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,340
Christians, they're really into loving their enemies.

824
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,440
I think we all know how that works.

825
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,660
Yeah, it could kind of make your brain kind of funny.

826
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:17,080
Especially when you start rubbing your cha-cha, you know, sometimes, you know, most of the time it's not the same.

827
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,240
That's really true.

828
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,740
Sometimes you make your cha-cha very dry.

829
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,780
That's right, boys and girls, Bob wants to rub your cha-cha.

830
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,360
That's right.

831
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,220
And your cha-cha can be anything you want.

832
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,640
You'll still love it.

833
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,400
Cha-cha-cha.

834
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,840
Cha-cha-cha.

835
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,840
It could be a fluffy thing.

836
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,780
It could be a very firm thing.

837
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,160
Bob's in love with you.

838
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,420
He wants to marry you.

839
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,000
He don't care if you're a boy or a girl or an animal or what.

840
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,780
He wants to marry you, baby.

841
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,280
He wants to give you a big, big kiss.

842
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,220
He loves you.

843
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,900
Come on over to Bob.

844
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,180
Bob's going to be loving on you, baby.

845
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,660
Oh, Bob wants to father your child.

846
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,120
He don't care if you're a man.

847
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,820
He don't care if you're a blue whale, a male blue whale.

848
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,500
He's in love with you.

849
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,200
He's a love god.

850
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,220
He's a love whale.

851
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,720
I got pictures of Bob.

852
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,900
Come on, girls.

853
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,500
You know you want him.

854
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,320
Come on.

855
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,880
Oh, yeah.

856
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,240
This is a sex cult, man.

857
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,340
Bob is a sex god.

858
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,660
You look like a bug of urges.

859
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,180
Come here.

860
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,340
He's a sex god.

861
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,220
Oh.

862
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,280
Oh, he's Bob the purveyor of a psychic holocaust.

863
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:44,380
Psychic holocaust, bug pornography, and Einstein's secret orchestra.

864
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,680
What do these have in common?

865
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:59,920
What links these otherwise disparate and discarnate disembodied spirits and ghosts, shades, pathetic

866
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,040
leftovers?

867
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,960
What have you found yet?

868
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,240
I dropped порядedylum of classify in elements within cause and pushed into a componiy that

869
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:17,240
in call incredible Fell Puisque немножко corri ruling in which those remains of Beneven

870
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:28,360
which were honor reinforcement to self as a mean of

871
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:28,520
하죠.

872
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,260
paljon.

873
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,600
For the last big leap.

874
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,100
The last Einstein secret orchestra.

875
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,860
It's huge, a creature so large that its own weight

876
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:42,220
could crush its bones if it left its hideous swamp.

877
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,020
Every step it took, molten lava would pour out of the hole

878
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,540
it left in the ground and so deep.

879
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,720
So heavy was this.

880
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,840
The Einstein secret orchestra source.

881
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,760
30 miles an hour, 90 feet of jump.

882
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:58,740
I'm sorry.

883
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,720
Holes flowing.

884
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,540
No one ever saw it, and no one ever had a treat.

885
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,020
And someone said it looked a lot like Mr. Greed.

886
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,840
Mr. Green.

887
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,700
A little bloody.

888
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,360
It looked like a Pachycephalosaurus

889
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,400
mixed with a cross within an Elasmosaurus,

890
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,100
crossed with a Pterodactyl, crossed

891
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,960
with a Brachyotherium, which is a giant mammal,

892
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,000
crossed with a trilobite.

893
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,820
Well, I know what the Pachycephalosaurus

894
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,040
is.

895
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,800
But the thing was miles tall.

896
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,100
Dunkelosteus, crossed with a Clevelandohioceendesis.

897
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,240
And a Dobson's swamp.

898
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,540
It's a swampus.

899
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,600
It lived in the swampus.

900
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,320
It was dripping with a malodorous fluid

901
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,180
that it made in its thorax.

902
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,300
But no one knew that it was really a pretty neat critter.

903
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,780
I mean, it billared young, and it took care of them

904
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,960
until they were teenagers.

905
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:54,760
That's right.

906
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,800
It raised its dead.

907
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,280
It raised its own young.

908
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,200
And it did not devour them until they were 18.

909
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,160
At which time it licked their necks, looking for the microcyclic

910
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,480
They threw them out of the house and instantly hunted them.

911
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,640
They called it an Einstein secret orchestrasis.

912
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,420
They called it the Mistress Einstein Secret Orchestrasis.

913
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,540
It was sort of a, what were the padram?

914
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,880
A double, a psychic double.

915
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:33,900
It was part mammal, part reptile, part fish, part dinosaur, part bird, part single-celled creature,

916
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:39,740
part plant cell, and part bacteria, and part virus.

917
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,520
Part cheesy, watery thing.

918
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,760
And half crazy.

919
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,700
Half sticky purple button.

920
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,140
Half crazy with its own philosophies.

921
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:54,240
It was half werewolf, and half dragon, and half tarantula, and half Frankenstein.

922
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,860
And half Frankenstein.

923
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,400
And it was scary.

924
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,120
And it didn't have a face.

925
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:57,840
And it didn't have a face.

926
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:57,860


927
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,740
It was so big and small that they shrank.

928
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,500
They didn't have a face.

929
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,880
Big, big perspirations.

930
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,440
It needs a billowing out of the body.

931
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,460
The most interesting thing was the cloaking device it used.

932
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,360
That's why it didn't have a face.

933
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,500
Is that that Floakon thing?

934
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:17,640
There were creatures that had built, that actually had a biological cloaking device.

935
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,980
The Einstein secret orchestra was so huge.

936
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,800
And large.

937
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:31,120
It required a series of sub-brains along its spinal cord and down in its toes because

938
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,460
it was such a great distance.

939
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,220
The microcephalo pod.

940
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,240
Walnut-sized brain.

941
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,000
The tiny head pod.

942
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:37,460
And its cranium.

943
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:45,800
So there was a series of, as Hal Robbins identified them, small primitive calculators, adding

944
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,580
machines, placed along the spine of the creature.

945
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,780
And each vertebrae of this animal was the size of a microcephalo pod.

946
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,060
And the size of the entire university here.

947
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:03,520
This was a big, as Chaz said, the Einstein secret orchestra with each footstep sunk all

948
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,580
the way to China.

949
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,020
And each one encased in a bubble of glass.

950
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,700
Those were the days of food.

951
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,660
I remember those days.

952
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,620
It's pretty place to see.

953
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,200
It was before this orb was even shaking.

954
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,140
It was so long ago.

955
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,660
It was before time.

956
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:22,700
Actually.

957
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,980
It was from the land before all time.

958
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,640
You mean there's an actual place that's before everything starts?

959
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,320
It is, yes.

960
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,160
You said land before time.

961
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,480
I assume you're talking about a place.

962
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:36,740
Yes, there was a place.

963
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,860
Before there was time, there were places.

964
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,040
But they didn't last very long.

965
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,840
They were instantaneous.

966
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,180
They were just flickered.

967
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,420
As they came into existence, they just came out of existence because they were just in

968
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:48,700
a house.

969
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,260
And they rode off.

970
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,680
They rode off into the airways.

971
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:58,020
Each one like a little bubble that pops, since forgotten and useless.

972
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,540
Just like we're going to do.

973
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,180
Just like us.

974
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,440
Just like the blank tape we thought we were recording everything on.

975
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,560
Which reminds me.

976
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,020
We were, actually.

977
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,640
But remember, if you want the Chalupas, you got an hour or two or at least...

978
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,140
I'm sorry.

979
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,380
I forgot what I was saying.

980
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,980
My name's Chaz.

981
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,980
This is ESO Radio down in the swamp.

982
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,160
I'm Barry White.

983
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,840
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

984
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,880
Prince as we are due.

985
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,540
Reverend Ivan Spang.

986
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,600
Linda Lovelace.

987
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,680
Linda Lovelace in the corner over there.

988
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,000
Linda Blair in the other corner.

989
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:31,560


990
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,160
How many Lindas do we have here?

991
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,400
There was Linda Knight here.

992
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,280
And Gary Kruper.

993
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,040
Gary Kruper.

994
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,460
Kruper.

995
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,780
Kruper.

996
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,320
Wiki Fromm as Benji.

997
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,820
Until next week, keep your hat on tight.

998
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,300
You're back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.

999
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:51,820
We'll see you next time.

1000
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1001
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1002
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1003
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1004
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1005
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1006
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1007
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1008
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1009
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1010
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:51,820


1011
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,800
Don't let Bob end up getting your scrotum for one of them death pouches.

1012
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,660
No scrotums were tortured in the production of this program.

1013
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:01,280
Hurry Bob.

1014
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,460
I almost twisted a little bit.

1015
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:03,760
Goodbye.

1016
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,120
We are now going off the air.

1017
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,640
Well, not completely, dear friends.

1018
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:21,060
You can stay on the air by writing for free information from Bob.

1019
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,360
Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

1020
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:38,320
At Post Office Box 140306.

1021
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:45,480
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1022
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:08,580
Also known as Slack at Subgenius.com.

1023
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,260
Have a great weekend, everyone.

1024
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,900
Have a great weekend, everyone.

1025
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,280
Have a great weekend.

1026
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,360
Bye.

1027
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:37,500
Bye.

1028
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,500
Bye.

1029
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,620
Bye.

1030
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,420
This is a villain tale to Mr. Chaz

1031
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,320
Here at the Church of the Useless Neck Brace Cathedral

1032
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,360
And tonight I hope you're all empowered

1033
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,960
By the orbiting skull crystals and testifiers

1034
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,160
Yes, yes, dear friend

1035
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,540
We're gonna tell you the truth

1036
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,760
We're gonna tell the truth and heal you

1037
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,660
If you're just feeling bad

1038
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,240
That's the only one you have

1039
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,880
I wanna take a breath of life

1040
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,300
I'll go out walking in the rain

1041
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,860
Watch the flowers go to bed

1042
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,440
That's the man inside my head

1043
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,520
I'm gonna tell you the truth

1044
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,060
Spirit never have to leave

1045
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,620
All you gotta do is believe

1046
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,220
The faith in God

1047
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,280
Ladies and gentlemen, I can heal you

1048
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,960
Who is licensed fully by the state of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey to heal you?

1049
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,860
None other than I and why myself

1050
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,920
So please step forward and let me let Cabotrol

1051
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,520
We're happy to help you

1052
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,200
Oh no, let me let me let Cabotrol on your head

1053
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,360
I can't heal you

1054
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,640
I have the power to heal you

1055
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,760
I'm all in you

1056
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,420
I'm all in you

1057
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,300
I'm all in you

1058
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,560
I'm all in you

1059
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,060
All you gotta do is breathe

1060
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,340
All you gotta do is breathe

1061
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,440
Your body's gonna stop the feel

1062
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,380
Your body's gonna stop the feel

1063
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,540
Finger drips and holy fire

1064
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,120
Finger drips and holy fire

1065
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,980
Everlasting sweet desire

1066
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,380
If you're mad at what the doctor said

1067
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,820
The evil man you steal away

1068
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,600
Immortality for two

1069
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,240
Miracles they come for you

1070
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,980
The faith in God

1071
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,880
Can I put my hands on you

1072
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,940
Can I put my hands on you

1073
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,340
Can I put my hands on you

1074
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,640
Yes friends, I'm not talking about hate

1075
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,660
No friends, I'm not talking about hate

1076
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,300
I'm talking about dinner date

1077
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,620
Yes let's eat

1078
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,780
Oh, the glory and the convenience of food

1079
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1080
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:20,640
A mighty hot dog is on the road, I forgot the rest, I'm trying.

1081
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,320
Wake up, hope and charity.

1082
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,440
Simple relativity.

1083
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,640
It can make you understand.

1084
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,180
All you gotta do is take his hand.

1085
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,760
Remember what someone said.

1086
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,300
Pass the man inside the head.

1087
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,800
Finger drift, simple name fire.

1088
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,220
Everlasting sweet desire.

1089
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,100
The faith in us.

1090
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,480
The faith in us.

1091
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,880
Can I put my hands on you?

1092
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,740
Can I?

1093
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,820
My hands on you.

1094
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,020
Now when you see the flash of light, don't run from cover.

1095
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,060
Drop your knees.

1096
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,560
Hey, that's right, that's right.

1097
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,820
That'll do you just fine.

1098
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,860
Nothing's gonna save you from the suborbital skull-drister and testy fire.

1099
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,180
Your balls are gonna be fine.

1100
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,900
There's no way out.

1101
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,080
Unless you, unless you look to me.

1102
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,120
Yes, that's right, you look to me.

1103
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,800
Because I can heal you.

1104
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,280
Can I put my hands on you?

1105
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,620
Can I?

1106
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:14,900
Was it from a having sex before this?

1107
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,140
It's not a fucking movie.

1108
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:15,580
No way.

1109
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:15,700
Maybe it's just when I life changed.

1110
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:15,700


1111
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,060
Bigbly.

1112
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:16,120


1113
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,620
Can I put my hands on you?

1114
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,040
Can I put my hands on you?

1115
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,680
Can I put my hands on you?

1116
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,120
I'm helping on the seat in the back of a car.

1117
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,780
I'm helping on the seat in the back of a car.

1118
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,640
I'm sitting on the seat and I haven't gone too far.

1119
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,460
Oh, Lord, please, Lord, please.

1120
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,500
Can I put my hands on you?

1121
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,920
Can I put my hands on you?

1122
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,440
Can I put my hands on you?

1123
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,960
Can I put my hands on you?

1124
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,540
Oh, Lord, please, Lord, please.

1125
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:01,340
Oh, Lord, please, Lord, please.

1126
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,580
Alex Harvey, remember him?

1127
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,640
He died. He died.

1128
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,480
He died.

1129
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,700
They found his decapitated head in the swamp.

1130
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,620
Yo, you're making my cha-cha.
