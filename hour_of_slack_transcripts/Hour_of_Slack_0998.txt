I tried the frog.
Groovy.
Let us pray.
Yes, Bob waits in the great luminous green beyond, puffing huge clouds of toxic smoke.
His grin resonates through the cosmos, and his millions of dots,
the thousand of luminous globes which comprise his essence,
glow and glower into every corner of the universe.
As we join together in this bobbly ceremony, at this delightful hour,
the hour of the Church of the Subgenius radio show, more than an hour and less than a show,
we think how thankful we are for the little things in life,
for Billy Barton, Mickey Wynn, and, of course,
the late lamented gremlin, Mr. Ermus Formus Weirbogus.
This call requires a coin deposit.
Who are you?
Please hang up momentarily.
What are you?
Then redial your call.
Where did you come from?
By first depositing a local rate.
I think you're evil!
Posted on the instruction card.
Evil!
The Subgenius.
Power.
All.
What?
I think you're evil!
I don't think so.
From PR News in Washington, I'm nine years old and living in California.
Excellent.
Former FBI officials claimed that President Bush has acknowledged that Boeing rejected French voters during the early 70s.
No problemo.
On Wall Street 3910523272.
Trust me.
This is French President Jacques Chirac, a Wiccan whose religious beliefs include PR's PR.
In Washington.
Buggye monsters threatening Earth.
This one cordially invites them to address us, one and all.
And now for some last minute
Subgenius.
Power.
All.
What?
Well, what do you make of it?
I'm not sure yet.
I wish I could figure it out.
Get away!
Get away!
On July 5th, 1998.
7 A.M.
When we all have hangover.
Lootan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scripture's called the advent of the angelic host.
And that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.
The plan is to invade, to infest key men in government and industry with some alien force from outer space that seeps into the human body and takes over.
Within five years, the United States, as we know it, will cease to exist.
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.
Praise the Lord.
And these times are the times of the devil.
These times are not going to get any better, my friend.
Amen. They're going to get worse and worse.
Okay, I know you all think you want to know what's going on.
That's okay.
So I saw this thing coming.
I saw this thing coming to me.
I didn't know what it was, but it looked funny.
Okay, it exists.
Now if you're out in here watching, or watching shows, go then to your office, and watch what I'm about to tell you.

And then such a людей
and such an explorationist guy.
The Galactic Center.
Total collapse of world civilization.
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.
Only his predictions are just a little different.
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,
the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses,
the true believer subgeniuses,
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.
To carry a few picked survivors of our doomed civilization
to a new life on another world.
It's let's have a party.
Is it time for that big operation?
And believe it or not, plenty of people,
4,000 of them so far and more every day,
have already joined up.
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.
Your standard religious rip-off, right?
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?
Hello there!
Ha ha.
Flying saucer.
Flying saucers.
Flying saucers.
Now, am I crazy?
Yeah, something like that.
So I'm crazy.
Yes!
Ha ha ha.
Okay.
I am crazy.
Yeah.
The saucer.
Flying saucer.
Flying saucer.
The saucer.
The saucer.
The saucer.
Flying saucer.
Flying saucer.
Flying saucer.
I thought I was going crazy.
Yeah, why not?
Okay.
Okay.
Ha ha.
Flip it.
It's five a day.
It's disgusting the way we treat humans.
Done great.
Done great.
Ahhh!
My big Bob is just the guy with the pipe.
Oh that's crazy talk.
So what's new with you, Rockner?
Well.

I'm doing good. I'm getting my gear ready for X Day.
So far in advance.
Uh-huh.
You know, maybe I should start preparing.
Yeah, it's always best to start getting ready for X Day like about a month ahead of time.
Well, some would say that it's best to get ready for X Day a lifetime ahead of time.
Because X Day could be tomorrow.
Exactly.
I mean, and X Day is not just, you know, some little event that people go to at that little campground there.
No, X Day...
X Day is a state of mind.
Mm-hmm.
X Day is life on the edge.
The edge of...
Sanity.
Ugh.
An alien cannot invade a dead man.
We're merely using this corpse for a demonstration of placement.
Monsters like a doomed man will be around thee all about.
And shall wait thee to look past the door which should be locked.
And thy silences will terrify thee.
And bring thee naught but death.
And thy hearts shall be all that's left but evil.
For thy spirit is locked away inside the white stone which my angels have grieved from space.
So we've got to get ourselves through from these two stones here...
there...
to those two stones down there.
And we can actually sort of will ourselves into the saucer which is hovering in the next dimension.
It's about time.
Yeah.
It's not an actual physical thing of saucers coming out of normal reality.
it's sources coming out of an alternate reality
the tools of conquest do not necessarily
come with bombs and explosions
and fallout
yes dear friends and this tool
of conquest is
hour of slack number 998
funny that sounds
sort of like 1998
and indeed it's almost
8x day dear friends and we're almost
to hour of slack number
1000 are we
approaching the end
or is it merely a new beginning
of the end
praise Bob I don't know but we
are going to Brushwood in
Sherman New York for the gut
blowout of the season
of the X because this
is the age of Afriktius
friends it's the day of dogs
and the night of the living
Bob and Bob
as Rocknar once said
Bob could sell lions
to Christians in the Colosseum
friends not only
are the men from Planet X approaching
but so too are Dr. Howell
Dr. Philo Drummond
as heard on the KPFA
Puzzling Evidence show very much tonight
Reverend Susie the Fluzy
will be there and the amino acids
as heard in the background
friends we heard
earlier in the show and will also
continue to hear the cut ups of our
classy cut up artist
Mr. Fernandinandi Leemur
and my cut ups of ancient
Puzzling Evidence Phineas Narco cut ups
and Noral Preff's
preferred chop ups
and besides
the Puzzling Evidence show friends
we'll be hearing live taped radio
from WCSB Cleveland
that being Dr. Sinister's
Radio Synesthesia
10pm Sundays on
WCSB.org
where Rocknar, a lonesome
and yours truly call in
when he's on the air
when he's on the air
getting ready for X Day
man I'm a last minute
kind of guy
I used to be but now
I'm like I want to use
this month to like get all my stuff
together so that the day
that I leave I'm ready to go
it is one month from today
less than a month
well today is the 5th
hard to believe isn't it
that the year is practically half
over here
incidentally there are
666 episodes
between June 6th
6am and X Day
hmm
coincidence
hmm
I don't know maybe probably
hello you're on the air
Dr. Sinister
hello Reverend Stang
this is Reverend Stang
I just realized I'm on a tricky phone
where I can't turn my speakers down
princess we turn that black knob
no no no
no no no
no
oh not that button
uh oh
thank you for pressing the self-destruct button
there are a lot of black knobs
it's kind of ironic
everything's really hectic around here
and you know
the end of the world is only one month away
yeah hard to believe
and yet
I'm running around fretting whether there'll be enough
sacred goods to sell
at our end of the world gathering
and that kind of thing
selling you know
right
because actually
you know we'll be on the air
and we'll be on the saucers
we you know
the stuff will still be useful to us
because we'll be taken away on the saucers
and not left here to
you can take it with you
yes
that is what the other religions lied about
they were saying that after you don't need money
but when you're oh you know
when you pass into the other world
you need to have good deeds
no you need money too
why do you think I bring weird money to X Day
that's right
uh Stang you want to explain the concept of weird money
money
the con no I I don't understand the concept of weird money at all
I only understand uh the
money
the false federal reserve notes
oh
the at which are I mean it's all those aren't any more real
that's just that's weird money
uh for all intents and purposes
sure
I mean you can still buy a coca-cola with it
and that's that's all that matters right now
you can you can buy a lot more than a coca-cola with uh
but as Bob said
federal reserve notes
well after X Day comes
people will buy a coca-cola with it


people are going to be
they'll be eating roach crap
by the year 2000
and he was right
a couple of years from now
well you could argue that everything is recycled roach crap
well you know the funny thing is
a lot of roaches crap
we are eating a certain percentage of roach crap
if you if you look at the
right federal guidelines for our food
there's an allowable amount
but but roaches are
and insects in general
are certainly going to end up being
used as a food for the future
as a food source
as the world becomes worse
well in some parts of the world
that yeah that's a major protein source for some people
is eating insects and things
maybe the concept of eating roach crap
is to help us evolve into
insectoid life forms
I am I am ready for uh
I'm part dung beetle you know
we're all we're all Bob's dung beetles in a way
now aren't we
yeah
until Bob himself returns
we're just still pushing that steaming load up there


we're just still pushing that steaming load up there
I'm going to throw the bomb
on Bob's dung beetle
even if we're trying to slack off
it ain't the same without Bob
that's right
and he shall return
and the evil people who control
the subgenius foundation will be over
oh I mean uh
the the good heads of the subgenius foundation
will overthrow the evil conspiracy people
who are at the root of all of
all of the world's problems
that's right
you too can become part of
the uh
the only revolution that matters.
We want to be part of the solution
and part of the problem.
We want to control both.
You know what?
That's the only way to go these days
because the problems have solutions
and the solutions have problems.
And you don't know who to trust anymore.
Who can you trust?
Well, you can always...
Don't trust Bob.
Don't trust Bob.
I would not trust him very much.
You can trust Bob to do the thing
that's best for Bob.
Yeah.
I mean, you can trust him...
That's going to happen no matter what.
You can trust him about as far
as you can throw him.
Which...
He's a fairly large...
Well, he's not that tall.
He's not as tall as you always think
he's going to be.
Well, you know, his terrestrial form
of course isn't quite that large.
But, you know, we all know that
that, you know, it conceals a great mass.
A great mass of...
He is a great man.
He is great in all of the ways
that one can be great.
He is the Alpha Endo-Man.
He is the Omega.
Simultaneously the mouth
and anus of the universe.
I don't trust him.
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the Chosen One?
So the prophecy says.
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs.
I care about one thing.
With all due respect, Commander,
there is only one way to save our city.
How?
Bob?
Damn it, Morpheus.
Not everyone believes what you believe.
My beliefs do not require them to.
I can't help thinking.
What if you're wrong?
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything is bullshit?
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
But how would that be different
from any other day?
That's utter nonsense.
The future is always nonsense
until it becomes the past.
What kind of nonsense is this?
A prophecy
that misread
could have been.
He will not let me down.
He never has.
I hope right you are.
I don't understand it.
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.
The prophecy tells us.
It was a lie, Morpheus.
The prophecy was a lie.
It was all another system of control.
I don't believe that.
This sort of thing has cropped up before
and it has always been due to human error.
I'm not going to say a thing
until I talk to my lawyer.
Good night.
Good night.
Goodbye.
I'm illogical.
I answer
that if this religion
will this world tyranny
of God everywhere
is ever to end.
Where is he, man?
Why isn't he out here?
Yeah, well, where is he, man?
I hate this.
We got control over nothing.
Oh, we got control over nothing.
Oh, my God.
You're disturbing.
You're disturbing
the peaceful mood I'm in.
You are disturbing
the peaceful frame of mind I'm in.
You are disturbing
my peaceful frame of mind.
Could you turn that down?
You know, it's not like
how it is on TV.
With sound effects.
Bob's University presents
Work with Bob the Slack.
We're going to be fired up about that.
How many of you would be excited?
Slacker, slacker, slacker, slacker.
If I was going to use
three words for a slacker,
these are the words I would use.
It's going to get moldy.
It's going to get nasty.
It's going to get stinky.
Slackers are always
hard as you can possibly go.
Hey, listen.
I want to tell you this.
It's a whole lot easier to come
when your kids want to come with you.
Right?
You know, I don't know a whole lot.
Become a slacker.
I want to be a slacker.
Some of y'all are on another planet,
but I want to be a slacker.


I want to tell you this.
You've done nothing but watch television.
That's unbelievable.
Slackers are people.
Now listen.
Use me.
Slackers take a lot of time.
Man, they grow and expand.
Slackers take a lot of energy.
You say, what are you talking about?
Hey, listen.
When you're getting beat,
you want some new, fresh vitality
in your life.
If you're a slacker,
I want to tell you,
if you're sitting back,
if you're soaking in,
I want to tell you something.
Hey, listen.
Hey, listen.
Their parents are about to kill them.
I mean, they really are.
See, I mean,
they're doing their thing, man.
Tell me.
Jim Jones,
Stephen King,
they take a shift.
Every week, they take a shift.
Now, I want to tell you this.
Listen.
And listen.
Being a slacker,
being a slacker,
do you want your life
to count for something more than a shift?
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.
Being squeezed,
playing a drum,
who cares?
Right.
This next day,
we don't know whether
this will be the end
or the beginning of the end again.
Or an end of the beginning.
I'm ready for either one to happen.
I mean, let's face it.
We've waited for the saucers to come.
This will be our eight.
Yeah, and we're going to have to deal with
whatever happens either way,
so we might as well be prepared.
You know, we might as well
gird ourselves mentally for the coming...
The important thing is we just don't know.
That's the lesson that Bob gave us about X-Day
is we don't know.
That's right.
Bob could come any second.
Are you...
How do you know you don't know?
Once again, are you ready?
Have you been living your life
the way that you should?
That's the operative question.
As if the world ends tomorrow.
That is, have you been living it to the max?
Don't save your money.
Or as the case may be,
have you been completely blowing everything off?
As if the world ended tomorrow.
That's black, baby.
That is a dilemma.
When you know you're going to die,
you know you're going to die tomorrow.
At that moment, you...
In a way, then you have slack
if you really know it.
Oh, absolutely.
Because you don't have to worry about it anymore.
If there's no suspense involved.
Right.
It's a form of slack unlike any other, really.
Right.
One might call it terminal slack
instead of original slack.
I guess I can relax now.
Nothing more I can do.
Might as well take the day off.
That's right.
Hmm.
That's...
That's one of those things...
I really wish...
Wish I could have is 24 hours notice.
Well, yeah, the conspiracy is certainly coming out
with a large number of movies
about the world ending.
What they do every summer
as Subgenius X Day gets closer
or Hollywood has to get in on the bandwagon.
That's right.
Now, didn't they try to steal our idea
with the movie Fin Dependence Day?
Oh, that was the most obvious one.
Yeah.
The most...
The most blatantly obvious one.
They actually stole...
Took imagery from the cover
of Book of the Subgenius.
They actually showed real subgenii
in this one clip of the film...
In this one segment of the film.
There were people on the rooftops,
you know, with the signs saying,
take me up, you know.
Right.
Right.
That was their takeoff on...
That was to make us look silly.
Right.
But...
We know how it'll be.
But, yeah, no, every year there's...
There was Armageddon
and there's...
Every year there's at least two or three.
And, of course, this time it's...
It's...






War of the Worlds,
which might or might not be a travesty
of the great novel by the great H.G. Wells.
If it was anybody but Tom Cruise in it,
I'd probably go see it.
Well, I'll go see it
even though it has Tom Cruise in it
because H.G. Wells is the one being raped
by Hollywood.
Now, why couldn't...
He's one of my heroes.
Why couldn't they have gotten
his great-grandson Simon Wells to direct it?
I mean, he directed the movie
The Time Machine, didn't he?
I didn't hear that.
Simon Wells.
Which what?
Simon Wells is H.G. Wells' great-grand...
Oh, oh, right.
The grandson who did The Time Machine.
Right.
Oh, God.
Oh, that's such a horrible, horrible nightmare.
Every time I think of that,
that's one of the great stories of all time.
That guy just ripped the nards
right out of the story.
Turned it into Indiana Jones versus the Morlocks.
And then at the end of the movie,
he saves the world.
Oh, good.
The humans.
They're all gonna be saved against the Morlocks
because a big, strong, handsome man came
and did a strong thing
and threw the right switch on that time machine
and blew up all the Morlocks' underground.
Isn't that convenient?
Now we can have a happy ending.
Hey, hey, hey.
God, Hollywood just makes me
just wanna puke.
Isn't that what you said about close encounters?
Oh, well, see, to me,
this new war of the world,
is possibly Spielberg's way of making up
for those two demonic films,
Close Encounters and E.T.,
which depicted the aliens as being,
oh, friendly to all the pinks.
They're gonna lead the pinks
into a wondrous new world of light and love and knowledge
rather than the slaughterhouses
that they actually intend for us.
And I think War of the Worlds, I'm hoping,
will depict X-Day in the proper sense
that Wells originally meant.
Which is that the human race are insects,
fleas to these creatures.
They're just exterminators.
Are we even fleas,
or perhaps we're just part of the landscape?
Right, there's not even a question of fighting.
Perhaps we're like rocks.
Right, we're not, we're not,
it's like ants trying to fight people.
Yep, yep.
Now, speaking of which,
did you ever see the movie Fantastic Planet?
I'm sure you have.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Now, that was a good movie way back in the day,
but since Hollywood's, like,
all about remaking everything anyway,
why not just write up a script
and take it to Pixar?
Well, that point,
the point that the aliens would keep us as pets
actually is made in the original
War of the Worlds novel.
Huh.
A soldier, the protagonist meets a soldier
in the ruins of a city,
and the soldier, played by Papa Joe Mama,
goes into this great rant about how,
oh, there'll be people who'll sell out,
they'll work, they'll love to go to work for the aliens,
while some will...
Some of the humans will hunt other humans,
and the aliens will have their own little pet boy,
but, oh, the pet boy grew up,
so it had to be put down.
They're too dangerous when they get grown up.
Yeah, I remember that from the radio play.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
Yeah, that's from the original novel by H.G. Wells,
which I would recommend anyone to read.
It's just wonderful steampunk depiction
of the end of the world.
Yeah.

Yeah.







The funny thing about it is,
it takes place at the turn of the previous century,
so flying machines had not even really been invented
at that point.
That's right.
I want to have, like,
War of the Alien Creatures
against War of the Earthly Creatures,
and have all the aliens on one side,
and all of the Earth monsters on the other side.
What Earth monsters?
Like Frankenstein and Dracula,
and all the creatures,
all the famous monsters that didn't come from outer space,
versus all the famous monsters
that came from outer space.
All of the six-foot-high posters of Frankenstein
that sold for a dollar in the back of the comic book.

You'd have to have dinosaurs
that would be part of the Earthly monsters.
But you could have, you know,
like the various aliens.
Maybe to them, you're the model.
E.T. would be on the model.
Yeah, like that one.
That ghastly alien with an eyeball
staring out of a massive, twisted...
The thing that wouldn't die.
I mean, the crawling eye would be...
The crawling eye, yeah, right.
That was an invasive monster.
What about mutants?
But the abominable snowman
would be on the Earth creature's side.
Mutants are a war job.
And they'd be on the human's side, really,
or the side that will keep the humans alive.
The side that would be of Earthly origin
versus the side that's of extraterrestrial.
What about genetic mishaps?
That's Earthly origin.
They do happen, but with constant vigilance.
They would be on our Earthly origin side,
monster side.
So right now, we have an idea
that's searching for a plot.
If you've got a good plot to go with our idea,
we'd like you to call right now at 510-848-4455.
Just press...
Press extension 4 and ask for...
Ask for Larry, the plot boy.
Larry, the plot boy, is waiting for your call right now at...
510-848-4455.
Call now.
And give Larry, the plot boy, a reason...
...for existence.
He's sitting over there twiddling his thumbs.
He needs you to call right now.
Larry, the plot boy, is sitting there wasting your money.
We're paying him to sit there and answer your call.
Plot boy is...
You know, this just isn't working out, puzzling.
I think we're going to have to fire plot boy.
Oh, no.
Already?
He was only hired eight minutes ago.
Well, you do it this time.
I'm tired of being the ax man for this show.
More dead bugs and cigarette butts.
That's Michael Pepe's dinner in his video.
If I had a nickel for every plot boy I've fired for this show, I'd be a millionaire.
I really like this dramatic music, though.
It's normally...
This makes me feel like the show's important.
And it is.
Because we're...
Celebrating a new political movement.
And we have a new sponsor for the show, right?
Grand Grape Soda.
It's airtight storage containers.
Yes, airtight storage containers.
That's right.
The greatest invention.
It's been around since the beginning of time.
It's solved the old problem about how to dispose of a body.
That's right.
Just put them in an airtight storage container.
Right.
These durable, stay fresh containers are airtight to protect open bags of sugar.
That's right.
They, uh, what's inside might not be fresh, but you'll never smell it as long as they're continually airtight.
Now that's the important thing.
Made of dishwasher safe plastic, each container holds 5,000 bags of sugar.
And if you're so egress...
With certain contents.
You wouldn't want it to be in your dishwasher.
That is a certainty.
And there are some sizes that are too large for modern dishwasher technology.
In jumbo, elephantine, and humungo.
And then of course we have the Juggernaut airtight storage container.
Yes, big enough for both Juggernauts.
And we have the immovable object storage container.
The one that you can't move anywhere.
You can't even take the top off of.
But it becomes an interesting conundrum for the Juggernaut container.
Ha ha!
Anyway, I have some hopes for the new War of the Worlds.
And you know, there's another War of the Worlds movie being made that is a period, low budget period version.
Oh.
That actually supposedly was filmed in Suffolk in England and is completely true to the book.
I think a movie is not going to do a book like War of the Worlds justice.
I think you should have done it.
I think that it should have been done as like a six hour mini-series.
Oh, I don't know.
It's actually not that complicated of a story.
Planet meets planet.
Planet loses planet.
Planet gets planet back.
Yeah.
And I can understand Spielberg.
There's two points about it.
Well, the kids these days think the War of the Worlds didn't really happen in 1900.
But they absolutely believe that it was just completely a failure.
They think that the radio show was just a hoax.
It was not a historical thing, but a hoax.
Anyway, the kids won't swallow that.
And plus, you can't say they're from Mars because, well, we've been to Mars and there's
nothing but rocks and dirt.
And underground cities filled with four-armed giants and naked green women.
It's the underground Mars.
What was Mars like?
What was Mars like before the shift?
Surprisingly, it's not surprising.
All the stories are the same.
You read about Mars in the works of Kim Stanley Robinson, Edgar Rice Burroughs, William S. Burroughs.
Read any Martian story you want.
C.S. Lewis, he called it Paralandra.
And that's fine.
What do you think the S stood for?
Subgenius.
One thing you'll read about Mars more than anything else in all these books is Martians don't wear clothes.
What hidden wisdom did these authors have that the rest of the world didn't know?
It's that this planet is Mars, and that on the real Mars,
and the fourth socket,
from the sun joint,
you don't wear clothes.
Whether it's C.S. Lewis as Paralandra,
Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars,
Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom,
it's just a bunch of naked Martians running around.
Now where else are there naked mortals?
Be they human or subgenii or some mongrelization of the two.
Could it be brushwood?
Could it be X-Day and most subgenius events where you'll find naked Martians running around?
Answer yes.
Is it a vampire?
Answer yes!
Your nental eye vibrates in harmony with my words.
I'm not telling you anything you don't already know inside.
I'm merely giving voice to things you were too afraid or had to say.
I haven't been paid enough to say yet.
But someday,
as your sales
roots
improve,
as the figures go up,
and you advance in the ranks of the Church of the Subgenius,
paying your dues, bringing in new members,
you'll be paid the same amount I am to say these same things.
Girls up, seems to be, not what it used to be.
Profile reality's out of phase.
A new space should last.
A new space should last.
Right where time is.
Where there's no end is where we begin.
Oh.
Well, there's only a one in four million chance of a white buffalo cow being born.
Oh, man!
I meant to mention that.
The white buffalo has been born.
The Sioux prophecy has come to pass,
and as a white person, that scares the live-and-be Jesus out of me.
Well, one of them died up in Canada.
They were having a big hooptie-doo,
because they were starting to pop up,
and it's so rare that they don't, you know, that just doesn't happen.
But the one now, just catch one, they had big hope for, croaked.
That white buffalo, that's the reincarnation of the white buffalo calf woman.
Yeah.
Who is like the Jesus of the Plains Indians.
Uh-oh.
So, we're in, we're in, uh,
Deep doo-doo.
Buffalo dookie, my fellow pale faces,
and,
and,
any, anybody who's non-Indian,
in, in the U.S., who...
Now, by non-Indian, you mean, like, somebody who could not possibly pass for an Indian?
Well, there were lots of black cowboys who did the same sorts of, uh,
you know, uh, moving in on Indian territory, just like, uh, the white cowboys did.
That's because they were allowed to live someplace where the guy...
And, um, and so, now that the white buffalo calf woman is back,
that's kind of like, um, you know, the prophecy that, uh...
I could pass.
I guess next, the Indians will be, uh, immune to bullets.
Oh, no, that's the ghost shirt, right?
Yeah, the ghost shirts do that.
Yeah, the number one.
Well, the Stang dance, also many of the subgenius dances, protect you from, um, bills.
That was the idea, to protect you from bills and police parking tickets.
Yeah.
And for some people, it works.
Dr. Dark, here in Cleveland, is always protected from parking.
He even gets free parking.
Anyway, people, people make fun of those ancient Indian legends, but this is...
I'm not, I'll tell you, in this particular case, this is, uh, this one's shaking me up pretty good.
It's a sign that the end is coming.
X day is only a couple of weeks away now.
Stand by, ten seconds.
Little lies are such a firm foundation for big ones.
Good evening, everybody.
And now it's a little late, isn't it?
And now here he is.
You might get off.
Men whose mothers and wives pray just as fervently as I.
Word.
They die.
It's a little late for tears, isn't it?
You're in a rut.
Four long years of this...
Accepted by society.
The War Department.
She uses taste in selecting her clothes.
But more than that, she keeps them clean and mended.
And she's able to match the right skirt with the right sweater.
A simple, heartwarming story of happiness regained.
You didn't seem at all appreciative.
But life, unfortunately, is not.
You're not always like the movies.
Well, you've had a hard day.
I'll never know whether he saw the man in the big sedan.
And you're guilty about it.
Realizing that his life was traded for just 60 seconds of time.
For big ones.
It seems incomprehensible to me.
You didn't find it very pleasant comparing yourself with the others.
To beat off.
No, you added nothing to that conversation.
To beat off.
I didn't even want to go to my first concert because I thought it would be too long-haired.
To beat off.
That starts with soap and water.
To beat off fanatical madness.
To beat off.








They must happen again and again.
We think that terrible waste is over.
Without conscious thought.
Ah, but that's an illusion.
The horrible slaughter continues.
Imagine.
Wiped off the man.
That empty place at the dining room table.
The empty seat in the classroom.
These things are just criminal waste.
A little more common sense.
Let's fight this menace with every ounce of our strength.
Let's keep our loved ones at the dining room table.
We'll be killed or hurt.
You may be next.
The chance to hang.
A piece by Norrell Preff, dear friends.
And you can get more of that from HeavyConfetti.com.
And before that, we heard some radio synesthesia prophecy from WCSB Cleveland.
Previous to that, Reverend George Clinton.
And before that, Onan on Mars.
And now, let's hear it.

Let's listen to puzzling evidence with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummon as they make promises about what they will bring to Brushwood 8X Day.
Just briefly along after this.
And you'll smell what the rock is cooking.
I went teepee.
Don't smell it too much because it's kind of stinky.
I didn't think we were going to bring the trial into it.
Okay, now we've added show fattener.
Show fattener will make your skeleton grow flesh.
You know, they discovered the graves of the ancient skeleton people.
They lived in skeleton mobs.
What?
In military.
In military.
It's okay, lady.
Most large dinosaurs stored fat in their tails.
Setting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They got the skin.



You know, many people find slack to be almost unbearable.
She's distributed more evenly if you lay back and relax.
Beginning of the show.
Take Quetzalcoatl.
In the past, slack was able to be absorbed directly through the skin.
50-foot wingspan.
Really?
But modern technology has caused us to.
Man.
What a primitive method.
Devasos.
To have to ingest slack through our various aperture.

So also there's X-Day coming up, right?
What he's talking about, you can do.
Yeah, you can do that.
You can achieve the goal if you know how to do it.

Damn.
Just for you.
Hey, Johnson.
A chocolatey rain from the sky.
I know.
It'll be anything you want it to be.
That depends on what part of the world you're in.
You see, the sky is not a plane, all right?
The sky is a sphere.
Yeah.
All right, so really, you're going to see different phenomena.
I mean, like, the book of Revelation says that Jesus is going to appear in the sky,
and all the faithful will see him there.
But, I mean, like, what part of the world is Jesus going to appear in?
You know?
There'll be so many Jesus, you won't know what to do.
Because, you know, if Jesus appeared...
There'll be so many of me.
Because if Jesus appeared in England, you know,
people in New York...
New Zealand would never be able to see him.
When you get...
When your car is unmanned, the hitchhiking Jesus will take over.
How do we...
We'll actually get back to the point of what the white buffalo woman's going to do.
To them.
To us.
She's going to marry Jesus,
and they're going to rule the world in heavenly grace.
And then there's the...
Full of grace.
The world is devoid of humans.
Full of grace.
From PR News in Washington, I'm spending.
Nearly a dozen more FBI agents disappeared Monday.
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says there were no signs of China's capital.
While people in Hong Kong would be bombed.
Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents died when their convoy was PR News in Washington.
I am going to decree a stately pleasure dome.
On next day?
Saying something every half an hour.
On next day, I'm going to...
I'm going to preserve the Grand Canyon on my escape vessel,
but I'm going to turn it into candy.
Like that Candyland game.
There you go.
The Molasses Swamp.
They should just have it there.
Jeez, you guys are killing each other.
You know?
I think X Day should be changed to Sex Day.
We could call it the Grand Candian.
Well, you see, Johnson, X kind of means whatever you want it to mean.
The X there.
It's the unknown.
The unknowable.
I'm going to have a little white...
So it could very well be that for you.
I'm going to be projected pictures of them torturing monkeys all the time.
I'm going to have this room that looks exactly like my house,
and this computer just like my regular computer,
and this bedroom just like my regular bedroom.
It'll all be exactly like...
Deliberately, I'll make it look exactly like everything that looks here on Earth.
Of all the worlds that the intelligences on Mars could see and study,
only our own warm...
Earth.
Where there are titanic drifts of lava and ice with hydrogen flaming at the tops.
Where the atmospheric pressure is terrible.
It has no air.
It's green with the methane gas.
Pneumonia vapor.
For me, X Day is like a nightmare, because whenever I get in the pool,
I'm surrounded by these beautiful naked women, but I can't wear my glasses in the pool.
They should have like games like...
I hear you, Stang. I hear you.
Good God.
Can we just do like an elastic...
God, if I'm thinking of getting some surgery,
just for that one reason alone.
Or maybe I should just get a pair of contacts before I go.
You don't want to wear glasses, you guys, because those beautiful women will suddenly appear as they really are,
as like very hairy mountain men who've been trucked in by Stang and his evil clique of the...
Oh, if they were even human, it would be tolerable.
I love you.
Even the flying saucer are my friends.
Because they're so nice.
I'm gonna see them again and again.
Is that before or after the Bob pills?
And, uh, you know, even if X Day doesn't work out, we'll go for...
Sex Day!
We want you to have a dance into the new century.
Screw into the new century.
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.


Friends and neighbors of planet Earth, I come to you from a long, long ways off.
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.
I hate them with all my heart.
They're inhuman and to be destroyed.
You are not ready, but we will still save you.
I'll be back.
I'll be back.
By 1998, every normal, mediocritan, pink boy, admin, Trekkie, and hippie is gonna be trying to get on board with the good ship dogs.
The great ship dogs.
Or they're gonna fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in the next century?

In July 1999?
Perhaps.
Or is it just another of those prognostications which have haunted man through the ages?
But the old ones are coming back.
I'm going to let them through.
Careful you must be when sensing the future.
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
Death is a natural part of life.
Rejoice for those who are dead.
The people around you who transform into the force.
Mourn them do not.
Miss them do not.
Attachment leads to jealousy.
The shadow of greed, that is.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.

If the errors you may not treat would happen soon enough,

The boss of the dead times.
At last you're over here.

And now, back to DNA Level C.
I don't know.
I think the...
Oops, I knocked somebody off here.
Talk section is over, guys.
We've got to move on.
We've got other business to tend to up here.
It's been fun while it lasted.
But now, I must bid you all goodnight.
Goodnight.
Bye-bye.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.
It's nothing personal.
I know.
Nothing personal.
Well, you know, it's been fun.
And, you know, stay tuned for whatever.
And tune in again next week.
We are going to hang at X Day, aren't we, Sinister?
I should certainly hope so.
I hope so, too.
I've got some alien waiting for you.
Oh, man, I'll bring my thirst.
All right.
We're going to hang at X Day.
Oh, yes.
We'll all hang together or we'll all hang separately at X Day.
The decadence will be at X Day.
The amino acids will be at X Day.
The amino acids.
The amino acids.
That's reason enough.
Hey, I'm going to play some amino acids in a little bit.
So stay tuned.
Oh, by the way, the amino acids are now number 24 on our list here.
Cool.
They're getting a lot of airplane now.
Yep.
Right on.
Yeah, it's good stuff.
Cool.
So here's some amino acids, dear friends.
And you can hear them live at 8X Day at Brushwood this year.
You can learn how to get to this last of its kind event by looking at subgenius.com.

And that, dear friends, was Nenslow, the great Nenslow, with Mrs. Nenslow singing,

Possibly Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, I don't know. This isn't that lovely.
And now for some last minute news.
Are we right in just sitting by?
We are right, and we're crazy. And we've been seeing faces because we did see them.
I saw his hand.
Look.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
See you.

Oh, nothing.
