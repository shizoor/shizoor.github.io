00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
You have offended my family, and you have offended the Shaolin Temple.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,580
Order! Order!

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,660
We've reached the verdict.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,640
We have, Your Honor.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,760
The verdict will take it.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,260
The defendant will rise.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,100
We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of the crime of first degree...

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,580
Hey, look, do you still believe in an old baloney?

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,140
Shut up!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,460
I still believe.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,960
Praise Bob, friends, and welcome to Hour of Slack number 1098,

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,960
which will certainly be the greatest and most bobbed up show ever

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,140
due to the greatest contributors ever.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,000
We have many new artists and songs and sounds never heard before

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,840
on this or any other airwave.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,840
But first...

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,660
Norrell Preff wants to express his gratitude.

I'm so incredibly fast

46
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,140
Time to feel like an outcast

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,540
So I give G.R.

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
a dozen chance

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,280
Send a dollar to the church

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,180
My life was changed

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,560
and that's a fact

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,740
One of these

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,100

61
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,780

63
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,000

Everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface.

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday afternoon.

Come aboard to the world.

115

1974 is the hour when Mr. John Sinclair, leader of the white militants out of Ann Arbor, Michigan,

127

now in prison for selling marijuana and heroin,

128
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,320
says we are going to have open sexual intercourse on every street corner of America

129
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,420
where thousands and thousands can watch.

130

Full of filthy four-letter words.

145
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,400
Oh, yeah.

146
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,060
This is the White Panther statement that they are going to have open sex on every street

147
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,860
corner anyone can watch in the next five years.

148

Deadline 1974.

149
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:51,160
And they say our main means of producing all this immorality is

150
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,680
is

151
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,940
rock music commonly called rock and roll.

152

Our program is cultural revolution through a total assault on the culture which makes

157
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,960
use of every tool, every energy, every media we can get our collective hands on.

158
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,620
For the first time in America, there is a generation of visionary, maniac, white mother

159
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,260
country dope fiend rock and roll freaks who are ready to get down and kick out the jam.

Oh, yeah.

161
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,300
May I say something, young man, young lady?

162
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,740
If you love Jesus Christ, go home and smash.

163
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,040
Go home and smash.

164
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,820
Get rid of those crummy records.

165
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,480
Get rid of the Beatles and the Hermans, Hermans and the rest of that crowd.

166
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,700
I feel like the rockinest music that's ever come out of a pit of hell is rock and roll.

167
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,180
Mark, turn around.

168
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,760
I want to get this beast on.

169
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,100
Let's just wrap it up and throw you over the bed right across our shoulder here in the

170
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,140
big recording studio.

171
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:06,060
1974 is the hour when Mr. John Sinclair, leader of the white militants out of Ann Arbor, Michigan,

now in prison.

173
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:17,320
The president for selling marijuana and heroin says we are going to have open sexual intercourse

Oh, yeah.

176
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,760
I say we're going to be a story.

177
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,500
Do me, Mr. Preacher Man.

178
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,920
Do me, Mr. Preacher Man.

Hey, Preacher Man.

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,980
Nobody hit me like that.

183
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,200
L shadows back.

184
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,200


185
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,560
Be defensive both ways you could, Mr. Preacher Man.

186
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,800
Hey, Preacher Man.

187
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,020
Who do you hate?

188
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,020

Our program is Cultural Revolution.

216
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,980
Through a total assault on the culture,

217
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,300
it makes use of every tool, every energy,

218
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,960
every media we can get our collective hands on.

219
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,120
For the first time in America,

220
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,880
there is a generation of visionary,

221
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,540

226
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,900

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,620
From their new CD, Stung,

228
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,700
from which we will be playing two songs per show

229
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,900
until they're used up.

230
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,060

237
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,940
And there are yet two more new Bobish song-like recordings.

238
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,040
This here one is from the good Gord Fines.

239
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,680
Scratchin' Bob.

240
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,360
Bob.

241
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,620
What are you doing, Bob?

242
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,460
You can't do that, Bob.

243
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,040
What?

244
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


245
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


246
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


247
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


248
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


249
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


250
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


251
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


252
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


253
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


254
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


255
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


256
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


257
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


258
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


259
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


260
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


261
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


262
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


263
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


264
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


265
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


266
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


267
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


268
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


269
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,040


270
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,020
What are you doing, Bob?

271
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,280
Step away from the console, please, Bob.

272
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,840
Bob, you're starting to blow my mind.

273
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,560
Bob.

274
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,600
What are you doing, Bob?

275
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,420
Damn, your science is too tight.

276
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,620
Wow, Bob.

277
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,640
You really know how to cut a groove.

278
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,080
Look at him go.

279
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,480
He's like a Bob Octopus.

280
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,260
A Bob-tacopus, if you will.

281
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,760
Bob.

282
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,100
Bob.

283
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,400
Bob.

284
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


285
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


286
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


287
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


288
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


289
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


290
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


291
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


292
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


293
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


294
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


295
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


296
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


297
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,400


298
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,360
Bob.

299
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,200
You yourself are very in possession of that.

300
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,420
To the outro, y'all, please, it's great having four rad i- info spark.

301

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:54,560

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,480
No-one's gonna hire you to change.

304
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,940
You don't want to end up 복 Don't figure it out, you Beef叉 tha-bag.

305
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,940
Love Don't Ever Change

312
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,460
Don't Ever Change

313
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:30,620
Don't Ever Change

314
00:18:38,820 --> 00:19:00,660
Don't Ever Change

315
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:30,920
Don't Ever Change

316
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,960
Don't Ever Change

317
00:19:32,940 --> 00:20:00,920
Don't Ever Change

318
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,140
Don't You Need

319
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,720
Don't You Need

320
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,840
When Do You Have

321
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:22,960
Me

322
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,100
Don't Detest

323
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,140
The Dream

324
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,720
And Don't Say

325
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:24,720


326
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,220
How I really

327
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,920
Don't You Need

328
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,940
by secret forces.

329
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,880
Are alien space monsters

330
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,000
bringing your start

331
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,340
to the new world?

332
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,740
Do people think you're strange?

333
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,480
Do you?

334
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,780
Then you may be

335
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,500
on the right track.

336
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,880
Are you abnormal?

337
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,840
Then you are probably

338
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,440
better than most people.

339
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,340
Yes, and your kind

340
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,060
shall join on.

341
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,020
Having a course

342
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,800
will give you

343
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,220
a life, girl.

344
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,800
What do we want?

345
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,780
Slack.

346
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,840
A subgenius must have slack.

347
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,460
Casting out a false

348
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,120
prophet

349
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,320
is out of time to control.

350
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,880
But then they can

351
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,300
make a joke.

352
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,300
Wonderful freedom

353
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,160
and containment

354
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,100
with Gunther.

355
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,440
You'd hate to know

356
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,960
what you really feel.

357
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,740
Think.

358
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,800
Bop-bop.

359
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,700
Bop-bop.

360
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,720
The subgenius

361
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,460
must have slack.

362
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,160
Bop-bop.

363
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
The children's

364
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,020
subgenius

365
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,500
could save your sanity.

366
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,660
But Gunther, they can't

367
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,460
make a joke.

368
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,740
Look, if you are

369
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,080
what they call different,

370
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
if you think we're

371
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,280
Andrew and Rudolph

372
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,040
ages,

373
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,260
if you think you know

374
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,380
someone that's more

375
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,680
of a sense of humor,

376
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,700
if you think we're

377
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,660
inherently bogus

378
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,260
or the typical

379
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,080
condescending

380
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,720
to jealousy

381
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,380
and talking to

382
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,760
your other one else,

383
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,860
if you can have

384
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,360
this with a

385
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,940
donation,

386
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,700
then the church

387
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,400
and subgenius

388
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,020
could save

389
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,080
your sanity.

390
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,640
You'd hate to know

391
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,140
what you really

392
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,800
think.

393
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,940
Feeling like

394
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,520
there's just

395
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,040
enough to do.

396
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,460
You're not

397
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,460


398
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,460


399
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,380
You may have

400
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,780
to have

401
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,100
already

402
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
the information

403
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,640
disease.

404
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,360
You see

405
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,000
the reason

406
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,900
against monsters.

407
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,720
The church

408
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,440
and subgenius

409
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,060
recognize

410
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,880
the programming.

411
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,020
Look to the

412
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,600
high and

413
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:45,920
critical

414
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,600
rules of the

415
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,760
church and subgenius

416
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,000
for pan-culture

417
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,060
reprogramming

418
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,180
and synchronization.

419
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,220
Perfect

420
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,600
your

421
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,540
subliminal

422
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:54,940
vision.

423
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,580
In addition,

424
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,020
you'll have

425
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,440
to be

426
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:56,840
really

427
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,520
good at

428
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,160
community.

429
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,560
Think of

430
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,160
the

431
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,480
status

432
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,060
seek

433
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,420
including

434
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:02,540
matriarchy.

435
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,000
The diseases

436
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,820
and the

437
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,360
state

438
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,380
of

439
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,380


440
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,380


441
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,440
people

442
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,020
are

443
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,300
also

444
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,400
achieved

445
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,400


446
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,400


447
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,400


448
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,860
corruption

449
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:06,860


450
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,200
the

451
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,780
world

452
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:07,780


453
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,360
The

454
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,620
locals

455
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:13,640
say

456
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:13,660
they

457
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:13,680
care

458
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:13,920
so

459
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,860
If

460
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,940
the

461
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:22,940


462
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:22,940


463
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:22,940


464
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:22,940


465
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:25,860
is

466
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,440
mühr

467
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,320
the

468
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,320


469
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,360
who

470
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,700
we

471
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,980
love."

472
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Do you think it's strange?

473
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,820
Do you?

474
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,560
Then you may be on the right track.

475
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,660
Baborian Chants by Norrell Preff

476
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,260
and the Altered Boys Chorale.

477
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,140
You might say, ah, yes, so holy, friends.

478
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,960
But you know, it ain't all Norrellian holiness.

479
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,580
Some of it is Lemurish unholiness.

480
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,560
So listen.

481
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,900
Have Bob Will Dob's Head

482
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,040
Starring Bob's

483
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,660
Oh, Bob.

484
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,280
Bob.

485
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,300
Bob.

486
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,420
Bob.

487
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,620
Oh, oh.

488
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:26,800
Yes.

489
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,700
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

490
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,040
What's the matter?

491
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,400
Oh, Bob.

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Oh.

493
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,360
Oh, thank you.

494
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,700
That's my man named Bob.

495
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,760
Oh, oh.

496
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,740
He wants to see me.

497
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,860
No way.

498
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,980
Oh, Bob.

499
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,360
No, no.

500
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

501
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,940
Bob, Bob.

502
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,020
Bob, Bob.

503
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,360
Well, anyway.

504
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,440
Save yourself work.

505
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,280
Save yourself money.

506
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,160
Get new.

507
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:56,980
Repelant.

508
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,540
Subconius.

509
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:57,860
All.

510
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,340
Offslug.

511
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,920
No change at all in the container.

512
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,220
Ah, but what a wonderful difference inside.

513
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,060
In fact, repellant.

514
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,200
All.

515
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,700
Offslug.

516
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,580
Now lasts up to four times longer.

517
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,640
No need for frequent money.

518
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,720
And Lord, I ask now for your chronic heart cysts.

519
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,600
That's right.

520
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,980
You just felt something new.

521
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,780
You just felt some egg-shaped nodule right now in Jesus' knee.

522
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,800
Whoa.

523
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,980
There's somebody else.

524
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,600
You have some kind of a growth.

525
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,500
It's a flower tumor.

526
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,080
But it's causing you pain because it's shutting off your husband's heart.

527
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,720
And you're not going to have to wonder if it's your husband because when you see him next,

528
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,360
he's going to be a cauliflower-shaped man.

529
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,880
God is dissolving your husband for you.

530
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,120
You're not going to have that thing anymore.

531
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,160
You don't have to look at surgical options.

532
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,680
There's somebody else.

533
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,260
You've had a stroke and you have things that you're interested in.

534
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:53,880
Mm-hmm.

535
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,960
Oh, there's someone who had a broken heart.

536
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,220
There's a nose.

537
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,760
God is just dissolving that away right now and be gone from this body.

538
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,060
Leave it now.

539
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,480
Your hands are going to be burning.

540
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,420
You're going to have total stinging again.

541
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,900
Lord, we thank you for all our diseases.

542
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,380
And Lord, we just want to have uninterrupted pain and irritated nerves right now in Jesus' knee.

543
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,000
Mm-hmm.

544
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,180
72737575.

545
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,580
You can go to my website at sex.com.

546
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,720
Okay.

547
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,240
Thanks.

548
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,380
Okay.

549
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:25,980


550
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,860
Bye-bye.

Bye.

Bye.

Bye.

00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:44,980


560
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:44,980


561
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:44,980


562
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,280
Bye.

563
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,280


564
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,280


565
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,060
Bye.

566
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,720
Thank you.

567

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

575

Thank you.

Thank you.

577

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

582

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

589
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,400


590
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Thank you.

591
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,220
Thank you.

592
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,240
Thank you.

593
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:11,480
Thank you.

594
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,060
Thank you.

595
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,320
Thank you.

596
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,720
Thank you.

597
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,120
Thank you.

598
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,400
Thank you.

599
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:16,600
Thank you.

600
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,100
Thank you.

601
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,540
Thank you.

602
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,600
Thank you.

603
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,740
You never have to visit a doctor or grow older.

604
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,160
There's no risk or obligation.

606
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,060
We can get life without a medical exam.

607
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,220
Call now.

608
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,080
Bring that dinner.

609
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,320
What makes any of you think I'm going to beat you up?

610
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,300
Okay, okay, that's it.

611
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,740
You're done.

612
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,780
Okay, okay, that's it.

613
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,220
You're done.

614
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,200
I am sick.

615
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,540
I am sick.

616
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,800
Diarrhea.

617
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,260
This is pretty obvious to me.

618
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,520
It's pretty obvious to everybody out here.

619
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,260
Steal the entire show.

620
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,840
Hi there.

621
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,340
I'm watching this and I'm thinking,

622
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,300
thinking, thinking,

623
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,460
isn't enough enough?

624
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,380
No, no.

625
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,400
Spongebob.

626
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:04,980
No pants.

627
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,520
Wow.

628
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,420
Hi there.

629
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,160
No.

630
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,580
It's a party.

631
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,680
I think, I think head.

632
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,980
Clinically speaking,

633
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,160
clinically speaking,

634
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,200
they're mentally retarded.

635
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,740
We put an interesting spin on it.

636
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,980
We put an interesting spin on it.

637
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,620
We're going to maintain.

638
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,880
No health, no health.

639
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,740
No全 Nein

640
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:42,740


641
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:42,740


642
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,960
I'm gonna pick it up.

643
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm at a really high rate of health like I've ever haderi in the past.

644
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,580
I think I've done a pretty good job with That's the case.

645
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,340
Luckily we're not happily 아니야

646
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,420
I need a powdered vaccine.

647
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,020
All right.

648
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,300
It'll be okeye.

649
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,580
Speaker 3 robe and A,

650
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:00,580


651
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:00,560
Max bones,

652
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:11,260
like this by Just John from just-john.com. Before that, some Nor-El-Pref, but now,

653
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:20,040
by the miracle of soundboard tapes, let's go into last year's Starwood Festival De-Vival,

654
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,700
where yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, was preaching to the neo-pagans and the topless

655
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:32,040
hipples of 2006. You won't be able to see the video projections, however.

656
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:43,880
The Babacato by Mark Mothersbaugh. That's lovely. Turn that up just a second so we can

657
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,280
hear the religiousness of it.

658
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,520
Friends, my name is Reverend Ivan Stang.

659
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:05,580
And, oh, thank you, thank you. I am not Bob, nor Spock. Now, as some of you may have gathered,

660
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:12,500
this is all about Bob. That's this, the guy with the pipe. Can I hear a praise Bob?

661
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:22,820
That's a wonderful praise, Bob. God, I love Starwood. I love preaching to the unsaved.

662
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,460
And I know that most of you are,

663
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,140
and I'm going to say it because I don't have your 30 bucks for subgenius ordainment yet.

664
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:37,260
You can be ordained in the Church of the Subgenius for only $30. In fact, that fact is how I pay my

665
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:44,540
mortgage. People love to be ordained until rest. It is as legal an ordainment as any other one on

666
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:51,500
the planet. Believe it or not, you can, with that little card in your pocket, you can perform

667
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,680
legal marriages. Of course, the money is not...

668
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:02,620
It's not in the marriages, it's in the divorces. We can't make you a lawyer for $30. Boy, we'd

669
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:11,680
be selling a lot of those. Now, what we do, they call this a workshop, oddly enough. It

670
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:20,260
would be more accurately called a slack shop. Because that's what it's all about. Bob and

671
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,680
slack. And if that was all there was in the world, Bob and slack, there would be no job.

672
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,260
There wouldn't be any problem. So unfortunately, there's also the conspiracy. Those are the three

673
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,700
things that I'm going to tell you about tonight. Bob, slack, and the conspiracy. And if you,

674
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,620
at the end of it, feel like you understand any of those three things, you are wrong.

675
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:50,440
Bob is not about understanding Bob. I guess there are some religious types of people,

676
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,720
of rival cults here and there, who feel...

677
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:10,880
I think there are some religious types of people who feel that Bob is a good God, who is such a wimp, frankly, that he apparently needs the help of illiterate little old ladies and numbskulls to get his job done. And it always is a he.

678
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:19,080
Although I guess there's a lot of goddess worshippers here, too, but you run into the same problem. You will not...

679
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:25,660
You know, most of these gods and personal saviors, they're not...

680
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:25,660


681
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:25,660


682
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:25,660


683
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:25,660


684
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:25,660


685
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,000
You kind of get the feeling they're breathing down your neck, you know?

686
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,140
They're watching you. They're all...

687
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,380
They're constantly in the back of your mind. You know that big overlord is going,

688
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,120
Did you pray to me recently?

689
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,780
Because that's important to some of them, you know? They get insecure.

690
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,220
What happens, by the way, if you don't pray?

691
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:54,200
Is it like Tinkerbell? Do these gods just dry up and die if you don't clap and believe?

692
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,140
If only.

693
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:05,400
Anyway, friends, Bob isn't like that. Bob is an industrial personal savior.

694
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:11,540
He is what we call a short-duration personal savior, or a short-durper-sav in the Tibetan.

695
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,680
That means, you know, well, let's look at the way things are made these days.

696
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,440
Planned obsolescence. And that works with personal saviors, too.

697
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,880
Bob is not going to provide you with slack.

698
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,020
The joke will not last forever.

699
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,260
There's such a thing as a joke being told too many times.

700
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,600
When that happens, you can move on to any other god.

701
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,120
Bob himself is not concerned about that.

702
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,940
Once he's got your 30 bucks.

703
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,200
And you can get slack without Bob.

704
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,100
It's just that the $30 ordainment pack expedites the process by about 25 years.

705
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,860
But even then, friends, I don't know if I should...

706
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:54,860


707
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:54,860


708
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:54,860


709
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:03,600
You know, I mean, if I was a proper religious fanatic, I'd say that the only way you can get slack is through Bob.

710
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:09,740
And in fact, God damn it, I am a proper religious fanatic, and the only way to get slack is through Bob!

711
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,660
Now, lucky for you, you decide what that slack is.

712
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,640
And that's what it is.

713
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,120
London is getting quick and comfortable.

714
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,100
Busier.

715
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,380
Nearer.

716
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,760
Healthy and pleasant.

717
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,020
Right on time.

718
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,080
Efficiency and comfort.

719
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,100
Special safety.

720
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,460
Good service.

721
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,560
Far away from London, people are kindlier.

722
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,900
And seem to know when they are with friends.

723
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,380
This is PR.

724
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,120
PR in Washington serves the military dictatorship that's ruled for decades.

725
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,640
PR comes.

726
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,960
PR comes from the Supreme Peace Subjecting Supportful Foundation.

727
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,020
Online at SupremePeaceSubjectingPieceFoundation.org.

728
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,760
From the Get Send Kingdom Health Lead Foundation.

729
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,680
Committed to helping Americans get the Kingdom Health Leads they need.

730
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,520
On the web at KingdomHealthLead.org.

731
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,160
And from the Bob Foundation.

732
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,100
Supporting research to improve Bob.

733
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,400
And thanking the PR Foundation and PR programming.

734
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,320
This is PR. PR. PR.

735
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,800
Rack.

736
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,320
From PR News in Washington.

737
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,480
Here's

738
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:15,040
In the meantime, Columbus business owners destroyed GreenleafyPrNews

739
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,260
in Columbus, Ohio.

740
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,300


741
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:22,300
In December, 2.5% after an even bigger 6.1% in November.

742
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,340
That was a moderate 2% jump by nine-tenths of 1%.

743
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,660
Analysts believe further increases or decreases are 1.7%.

744
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,500
For all of 2006, that's 1.1% for its slowest five years.

745
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,800
On Wall Street, 1245666, this is PR News.

746
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,440
A young Chinese journalist has been in China.

747
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,740
Lan Cheng, Shanxi Zhang, Datong, brain hemorrhage.

748
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,500
Local police told state media that bogus PR News has sent reporters to investigate as well.

749
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,440
Last week, Chinese rice wound up in China.

750
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,540
Unfortunately, they're probably, you know, lingering today.

751
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:07,200
However, Jarek says 300,000 homes and businesses are still without sectarian violence to spill over into PR News in Washington.

752
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,900
So again, it's basically, without going into any detail again here, sister problem.

753
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,420
And so basically, it's basically...

754
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,380
Basically means that if we know why I here, which basically defines the relationship between...

755
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,720
Basically, basically try to use it is basically...

756
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,500
So basically, we basically...

757
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:29,360
So basically, right here, we are like basically dealing with a whole bunch of sources of information that are genius.

758
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,600
And basically, you just basically...

759
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,240
How can we come up with, which is...

760
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,400
Oops.

761
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,900
It's basically like...

762
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,240
Basically, the bottom line is that using and then design a drug...

763
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,380
Basically, there is a lot of blue stuff in here.

764
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,420
But I've noticed...

765
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,760
What you need to do is basically normalize them by basically...

766
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,600
Basically...

767
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,220
So basically...

768
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,840
So basically, you know, very hard.

769
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,420
It's very hard to...

770
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,000
Basically...

771
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,320
So basically, this is just...

772
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,660
Basically, the point here is...

773
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,000
Slack.

774
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,420
Oh, thanks to Norel Prep and Lemur for the items heard above.

775
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,740
And now, the Southlanders.

776
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,320
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

777
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,740
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

778
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,220
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

779
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,580
We're not yankee-Ich 왜�ng.

780
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:24,140


781
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:24,960
Grandma didn't want us on the cvert time.

782
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,740
Doctor, you...

783
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,700
I was disturbed before we came on scene.

784
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,940
And thein the program.

785
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:35,660
No, don't say that.

786
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:41,440
I feel like doing the topic from Bolivia right now.

787
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:41,740


788
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:41,740


789
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:41,740


790
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,400
Well, she should be okay, I guess.

791
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,720
I am a mole and I live in a hole.

792
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,220
Yuck, yuck, quack, quack, five ball of roast.

793
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,420
You're the sleek chief, I dig the most.

794
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,240
I'm not a ram or a clam or a lamb.

795
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,400
I'm not a hog or a frog or a dog.

796
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,620
I'm not a bus or a hippo or a mouse.

797
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,900
I am a mole and I live in a hole.

798
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,020
Yuck, yuck, quack, quack, five ball of roast.

799
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,240
You're the sleek chief, I dig the most.

800
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,140
I'm not a ram or a clam or a lamb.

801
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,380
I'm not a hog or a frog or a dog.

802
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,760
I'm not a boss or a hippo or a mouse.

803
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,660
I am a mole and I live in a hole.

804
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,860
I am a mole and I live in a hole.

805
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,040
I am a mole and I live in a hole.

806
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,160
Here, then.

807
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,420
By which squeezes out Franz Kafka.

808
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,320
I'm serious.

809
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,660
Breakout, breakout, psychotics, psychotics, geniuses.

810
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,140
We're a product, we're a product.

811
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,220
I always worry.

812
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,300
You move out of fear.

813
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,480
You move out of fear.

814
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,600
Consistent, consistent, consistent, consistent.

815
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,200
And then...

816
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,820
Boring.

817
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,520
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

818
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,860
You're really addicted.

819
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,220
Once again, deeper drama.

820
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,320
What they do, what they do.

821
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,440
Superstitions.

822
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,300
That's difficult.

823
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

824
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,860
You know, it wears you out.

825
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,240
Feel the narcissist.

826
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,180
How do I look?

827
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:43,600
Okay.

828
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,680
Time and eternity.

829
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,900
If, if, if, if.

830
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,640
Ultimately we want to love you more.

831
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,000
Truly.

832
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,800
The odd, the odd, the odd, the odd, the odd, the odd.

833
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,080
If you enjoyed this audio program, fuck you.

834
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:52,980
Fuck, fuck, fuck you.

835
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,480
You, you, you.

836
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,540
Oh, gee, thanks, Bob You.

837
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,880
This audio program is Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

838
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:11,440
If you want to know more about our wonderful church, you can look at subgenius.com.

839
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:12,980
Uh, and...

840
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:19,600
This show is like a parasite that lives off other shows, healthier shows, until it sucks

841
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,620
the life out of them.

842
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:28,580
One such show is Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia from beautiful WCSB Cleveland.

843
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,900
And I believe we have a guest here already.

844
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,420
Reverend Stan, you with us?

845
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,380
Praise Dr. Sinister.

846
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,540
Oh, I thank you.

847
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,120
Thank you.

848
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,680
And praise Bob.

849
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,560
Nice music you're playing.

850
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,300
Thank you.

851
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:41,320
Thank you.

852
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:47,480
This, of course, is Dead Can Dance, and, um, the song is called Indus, and that's off the

853
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,740
album Spirit Chaser.

854
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,260
That's very somber.

855
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,580
Well, you know, it's, uh, it's been a somber week.

856
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:54,840
Yes.

857
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,820
You know, it's really funny.

858
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:00,700
Like last week I did my, uh, you know, last week in honor of, uh, April 20th, I played

859
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,020
a little song as a tribute to the Columbine, uh, thinking what happens, what happens the

860
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,680
next day, the very next day, the Columbine record is topped.

861
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,740
Well, yeah.

862
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,280
Well, that was fun.

863
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,280


864
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,780
I know what I didn't want to talk about, but I, but I was, what I was going to talk about

865
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:20,140
was the fact that I don't want to talk about it, but I know that we're going to talk about

866
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,320
it.

867
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,440
Well, we can, we can put it off for a while.

868
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:31,560
Well, you know, as, as Nenslow pointed out, 33 people get killed in car wrecks every 10

869
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,000
minutes.

870
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:32,880
Yeah.

871
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:38,200
You know, not even to mention what's been going on in, uh, in Baghdad the same week.

872
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:38,360
Sure.

873
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,420
There's much more spectac...

874
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,120
There's much more spectacular deaths in Baghdad every day.

875
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:50,040
And you don't, you don't get every single one of those, uh, spread across the media, but

876
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,160
that's the nature of the beast.

877
00:49:52,340 --> 00:50:00,960
It eats that stuff up and we end up soaking in that bad news.

878
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,020
Uh, it gets out of proportion.

879
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,560
Well, maybe you have some good news for us.

880
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,880
Yes, I do.

881
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,160
Um, I...

882
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,360
I got on my MySpace page...

883
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,140
Oh, you sold out.

884
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:18,560
Somebody proposed a business deal to me to make a company called Condom Mania.

885
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:23,660
They want to make, uh, D'oh, Bobhead and Conniehead condoms.

886
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,400
Well...

887
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,040
So there were...

888
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,600
Actually, they didn't mention the Connie condom, but that seems really obvious.

889
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,120
Yeah.

890
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,320
Um, so they're going to have the Connie-dom and the Bobdom condom.

891
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,880
Uh, where our...

892
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,140
I suppose we'll be around for a while.

893
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:38,140


894
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,700
I suppose we'll be around for a while.

895
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:38,700


896
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:38,700


897
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,320
What will they think of next?

898
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,680
I get a lot of these kind of things, though, and they don't always pan out.

899
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,180
Yeah.

900
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:50,000
It's somebody's big, big idea, and, uh, usually they're hitting up someone else who also owns

901
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,360
a, a head, a smiling head trademark.

902
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:57,520
Yeah, typically the, the disclaimer would be, I stand to make a profit from this, but

903
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,780
in, in this case it's only like, well, if I'm lucky, I'll make a profit.

904
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,900
Oh, oh, yeah, I guess so.

905
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,600
Uh...

906
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,760
It's, it's a, it's a cut through a world out there, you know?

907
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,140
Every, every, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day,

908
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:08,440
every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day,

909
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,780
there's always a dollar that you can squeeze out of somebody has already been allocated

910
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,020
to something else, you know?

911
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:19,740
Well, nonetheless, you can, if you, uh, press the issue and, and use skillful Dobbs-approved

912
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:25,400
sales techniques, or disapproved ones for that matter, you can squeeze that blood out

913
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,900
of a stone.

914
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,080
It's done all the time.

915
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:27,920
That's right.

916
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,720
The rules keep changing, so why bother at all?

917
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,540
There's so many people who have no money at all, and yet they keep buying things and buying

918
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:35,940
things.

919
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,940
There's all countries that do that, actually.

920
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,120
Yeah, that's right.

921
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:43,100
That right there is the miracle that our Lord has blessed us with in this country.

922
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:50,760
Truly a land of milk and honey where it is possible to spend more than you make.

923
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:56,820
Well, and Cleveland is paved with gold in the form of salt,

924
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,800
which was worth gold to people a long time ago.

925
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,360
The idea of that much salt just being used all over the streets.

926
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,360
You know what's really amazing to me?

927
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:07,500
It is.

928
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,040
What's really amazing to me is the fact that they have big rocks of salt,

929
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:17,880
and then in the grocery store you find that really fine salt.

930
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:23,060
And in order to get that fine, somebody literally had to go pound salt.

931
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,260
It's, you know...

932
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,940
It toughens the skin.

933
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,640
Hey, do you know anything about the salt mines of Cleveland?

934
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,840
Do they offer tours?

935
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:37,320
Because I bet that is a very surreal looking place down.

936
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,700
I do not know offhand if they offer tours or not.

937
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,440
I believe the Cargill Company actually operates that mine.

938
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,660
For listeners not in Cleveland, when people around here say,

939
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,120
hey, I've been down to the salt mines all week,

940
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,260
they might literally mean it because there's a huge salt mine underneath Lake Erie.

941
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,320
That's right.

942
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:05,220
And I've seen photographs of salt mines, and they look like Salvador Dali's nightmare.

943
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,340
It's amazing that the salt...

944
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,920
The salt has stayed underground.

945
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,720
So I don't know how deep underground is it because, you know,

946
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,660
you think if, you know, you've got this huge lake on top of it,

947
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,880
you think some of that water might trickle down in there,

948
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,060
and next thing you know you've got a salty lake instead of a fresh lake.

949
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,980
But that has not happened.

950
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,880
Well, it's the wonders of planetary geology.

951
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,040
Yeah.

952
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,080
I know people who are into geology, and they get hot and bothered.

953
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:35,880
They get all aroused over details of tectonics.

954
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,840
Bring me rocks.

955
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:37,820
Stones.

956
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,160
Yeah.

957
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,500
So I can study them.

958
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,760
Yeah, man.

959
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,820
I actually once knew a guy.

960
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,300
He was...

961
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:47,820
He had been to school to become a geologist, and he worked as a repo man.

962
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,160
He was the only repo geologist I've ever met.

963
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,940
There's a subgenius geologist, Reverend Prostata Kantata.

964
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:00,740
Ah, yes.

965
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,880
I remember meeting him at X-Day a couple years ago.

966
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,820
Yeah, he always seems to be able to get really good jobs,

967
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,680
because he knows a practical science,

968
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,860
which apparently such people are becoming few and far between in this day and age.

969
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,320
Well, you know, we don't need science.

970
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,800
We've got the Lord, you know.

971
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:27,500
Who needs science when you've got your basic instructions before leaving Earth?

972
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,580
You know, that's all you need to know.

973
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,480
As the old Onion headline went,

974
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:36,560
Creationist Museum Acquires 5,000-Year-Old Tyrannosaurus Rex Skeleton.

975
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,220
Yep.

976
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,780
That's, you know, it's amazing they can even date it to that.

977
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,180
Because after all, you know, we know that these scientific techniques are...

978
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,720
You can't really know anything through science.

979
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,600
I mean, forget for a moment the fact that this message is going out over the air,

980
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,200
you know, through radio waves, which were discovered by scientists.

981
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,620
Yeah, they weren't found by accident, exactly.

982
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,080
Yeah, the applications were invented by scientists.

983
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,020
You know, forget for a moment that the scientific method is what led us to...

984
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:06,800
to...

985
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,740
all the great, uh, achievements we have today.

986
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,960
You just can't trust science.

987
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,780
I feel like pollution, man.

988
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,500
And the dis- and the death of all species, man.

989
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,020
Yeah, see if those scientists were so smart, they would've seen that coming.

990
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:25,520
Major funding for this ass-cast is provided by the new TNA and the corporation for the new TNA.

991
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,080
Thank you.

992
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,300
Harry Reid spoke.

993
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,940
I believe myself.

994
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,560
Bag the man, Dad.

995
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,020
On the matter of whether the war is lost, I respectfully agree.

996
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,720
We have troops in harm's way.

997
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,560
Right or wrong?

998
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,020
Wrong.

999
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,720
I don't believe men and women who have volunteered.

1000
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,640
The bottom line is, I think at the end of the day, we will have the end of the day, yes or no.

1001
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,480
Are we just going through the motions with these words?

1002
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,460
We're going through the motions.

1003
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,300
I-I think...

1004
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,220
But it...

1005
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,560
More deaths coming out of, uh, Iraq.

1006
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,580
We need to get a good idea.

1007
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,280
Uh, the war is lost.

1008
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,760
B-b-failed leadership.

1009
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,640
Disastrous.

1010
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,440
Didn't really do it with a lot of knowledge.

1011
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,680
Uh, that's a great Bush administration slogan.

1012
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,960
We make our decisions without any knowledge of our decisions.

1013
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,180
Hatch his soul.

1014
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,820
I don't know anybody.

1015
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:08,620
We lost.

1016
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,620
The president's policies in Iraq, lost and continue to lose.

1017
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,740
The president is-is the White House.

1018
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,420
President Bush.

1019
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,020
George Bush.

1020
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,860
He's-he's all alone.

1021
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,000
Well, I'm thinking about the randomness of it.

1022
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,040
You know, there's great forces of evil.

1023
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:26,880
Satan hacked-he's someone who was mad, who was insane, and who knows the trivial reason that caused it, whether there was a virus that affected his brain.

1024
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,240
You know, there's great forces of evil.

1025
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,480
Satan hacked it through him.

1026
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,140
But it's the absurdity of it all.

1027
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,500
Some virus infects his brain.

1028
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,380
He becomes schizophrenic, whatever he was.

1029
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,700
Disturbing. I mean, are we this great, pitiable, helpless giant?

1030
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:46,420
You know, I-I-I just, I-I think that we lack will, we lack imagination, we lack commitment to do something about it.

1031
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,220
The-the-the-it's just-it's just unthinkable, unthinkable.

1032
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,140
I think people who want to kill, in this country with all these weapons, will find a way to kill and-

1033
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,980
Man's effort to understand programs on science.

1034
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:56,700
Aristotle.

1035
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:57,180
Aristotle.

1036
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:57,680
Aristotle.

1037
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,220
Aristotle.

1038
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,280
Here he is.

1039
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,280
Aristotle.

1040
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:00,980
You demand.

1041
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,120
Then we may summarize the.

1042
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,760
These senses bring us touching.

1043
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,120
Seeing.

1044
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:05,720
Hearing.

1045
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,500
Tasting.

1046
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:06,880
Smelling.

1047
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,480
Touching.

1048
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:07,920
Huh?

1049
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,320
Huh?

1050
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,140
Think about it.

1051
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,080
Aristotle was wrong with tongues.

1052
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:11,820
Tongues.

1053
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,140
Hey, wait a minute, doc.

1054
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,900
Well, so there they are.

1055
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,880
The familiar five.

1056
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,280
Let's see how touch does it.

1057
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:17,820
Okay.

1058
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,080
Now let's take the tip.

1059
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,000
Our friend here dispatches a sort of signal to headquarters.

1060
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,440
Luigi Galvani accidentally touched the big muscle.

1061
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,220
Seeing.

1062
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,100
Hearing.

1063
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,320
Tasting.

1064
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,040
Or smelling.

1065
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:30,520
Ford.

1066
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:30,840
Uh-huh.

1067
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,220
Ford.

1068
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:31,660
Uh-huh.

1069
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,860
Oh, here's a better view.

1070
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:33,760
Tongue.

1071
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,360
Here he is.

1072
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:34,740
Here he is.

1073
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,180
Problemalities in the future.

1074
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,580
Hold it.

1075
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,320
Hold it right there.

1076
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,500
Should be sweet.

1077
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,860
It's the key word, stimulus.

1078
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,160
Respond to a stimulus.

1079
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,340
Turn it on, Bill.

1080
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,440
Primitive brain.

1081
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,160
Taste all over their bodies.

1082
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,340
Organs develop.

1083
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,680
Vibrations.

1084
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,520
Here's a simplified view of the cock.

1085
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,460
It's lined with the thin basilar membrane which contains 24,000 hair-like cells.

1086
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,460
Impulses.

1087
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,000
Originating impulses.

1088
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,160
You've got a little piece of.

1089
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:00,900
How about that?

1090
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,140
Cock.

1091
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,140
Always alert.

1092
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,100
A bone.

1093
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,200
Molecules.

1094
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:04,940
A bone.

1095
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,020
Molecules.

1096
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,860
I'd like to introduce you to the big eye.

1097
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:08,620
Well, it's.

1098
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,800
Now let's look at something much more remarkable.

1099
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,460
Here it is.

1100
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,020
Pinhead.

1101
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:13,640
Pinhead.

1102
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,460
Colors dim and fade away.

1103
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,520
Major five.

1104
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,960
These are the free nerve endings of pain.

1105
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:19,620
Ha!

1106
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,140
Ha!

1107
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,540
Oh, yes, yes.

1108
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,520
That's very true.

1109
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,120
Really enormous pain.

1110
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,960
The man and boy are greatly distorted in size.

1111
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,780
It was impossible for most of these students to take it.

1112
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:31,940
Hallucinations.

1113
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,540
I see the whole thing.

1114
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,580
Determine the future of mankind.

1115
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,000
Entertainment.

1116
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:39,260


1117
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:39,260


1118
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,760
Listen, I want to make money off racial division.

1119
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,340
.

1120
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,200
I, I believe in evolution.

1121
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,140
.

1122
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,640
Handle-bility.

1123
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,660
Hey, you know what?

1124
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:00,860
.

1125
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,020
Just came out, right?

1126
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:02,640
Just came out.

1127
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,100
Don't you think?

1128
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:03,620
Mm-hmm.

1129
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:03,980
Mm-hmm.

1130
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,100
But there's nothing, but there's nothing.

1131
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:05,680
Porn-o!

1132
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,300
The eye came out, came out.

1133
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:07,980
Porn-o came out.

1134
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,040
Porn-o?

1135
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,560
And by the way, porn-o.

1136
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,280
It's little, it's tiny.

1137
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,260
It's two and a half inches.

1138
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,220
Oh, that is funny.

1139
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:13,660
.

1140
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,700
Which is still pretty good.

1141
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,180
.

1142
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,120
Okay, okay, okay.

1143
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,080
And thanks to Norell Prep for those last.

1144
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,320
Price Bob.

1145
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,740
And so ends the story of Clutch Cargo.

1146
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,860
And the friendly headhunters.

1147
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:42,400
Be sure to tune in for the next exciting adventure with Clutch Cargo and Company and the Arctic Prisoner.
