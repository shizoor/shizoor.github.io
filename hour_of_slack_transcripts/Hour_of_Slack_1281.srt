1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm being treated for dental problems.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,220
Cable subscribers are no longer seeing President Obama as a game Mexican bandit.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,540
Rescuers say they now know this is PR News.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
We are a bum bum.

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,040
Our finest gifts we bring are a bum bum.

6
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,060
To lay before the subgenius of our own.

7
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,420
The hangout for the homosexual.

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,960
It's filled with cornhole fun.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,060
There are those who believe that something mysterious lives in the south of England.

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,920
Wherever there are lake monsters, there are people just like this.

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,680
Locals, visitors, scientists and investigators yearning to become lake monsters.

12
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,660
There's one man who supports a lake monster.

13
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,780
I feel blessed.

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,320
So long.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,200
Have you noticed an upsurge in goth girls on the porno binaries news groups?

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,980
Oh boy, that sounds very, very...

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,720
Very, very, very, very, very, very, very...

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
Well, it's Halloween, children.

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,800
It's spooky time.

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,100
Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,840
Things are going to get weird, aren't they?

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,220
People act weird.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,040
It's special.

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,680
It's amateur hour for the weirdos of the world.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,540
A great little voice in the back of your head.

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,300
Welcome to it.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,140
Till next week.

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,060
Sit down.

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,680
For two hours, they see what my world is like 365 days a year.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,460
I thought I would be able to find my way home.

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,340
But now it seems that I'm just wandering in these pieces of chaos.

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,340
Is that like a space suit in your side someplace?

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,020
Maybe just your brain in a little jar or something like that?

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,760
Here it is straight.

35
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,680
One of the scientists in the last polar test claims he saw a monster.

36
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,280
Don't look at me like that.

37
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,420
These scientists claim that this monster, beast, whatever it is, it's a prehistoric thing.

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,880
And if you laugh, I'll bring you.

39
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,020
It's romping somewhere around the North Atlantic.

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,920
A monster.

41
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,520
How can she love a monster?

42
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,180
Let's get that through your head.

43
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,900
Are you dried up?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,380
Monster.

45
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,780
We've been hearing sexual stuff for years.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,340
You know, the five-day orgasm.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,840
It all happens without physical contact.

48
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,300
It's only the beginning.

49
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,580
Why should this reality be public domain?

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520
What's so great about it?

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Maybe they gave you some drugs.

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,080
Maybe none of this is real at all.

53
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,960
He's going into shock.

54
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,120
Yeah, this is the one thing you don't think about on the show.

55
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,000
Maybe this is not real at all.

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,300
Well, you lower down those plastic turkeys.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,820
You can't tell what's real and what isn't.

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,560
Lower yourselves.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,720
You're the caller's brain.

60
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,220
Okay, speak now.

61
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,340
Or forever hold the little pieces that are left on the floor of your shattered heart.

62
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,280
My pain.

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,980
On the surface.

64
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,340
In casual conversation.

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,200
Yes.

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,240
Their piano's all great.

67
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,260
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,120
It just seemed like normal guy.

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,900
Want to trade me the rest of it for the banana?

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,900
Sure, we can trade the whole show for a couple of bananas.

71
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,420
Absolutely.

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,340
We've done it before.

73
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,160
I'm giving you great input.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
Thanks for the input.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,340
Yeah.

76
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,300
We have to put it in somewhere.

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,700
Might as well be here.

78
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,320
Doctors taught me a lot about dealing with tension.

79
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,020
Yeah, here we go.

80
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,400
No, not tense, are you, doctor?

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,580
Much better.

82
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,040
Now I can see that you really are a doctor.

83
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,840
I got a good doctor.

84
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,100
I got a good doctor.

85
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,860
Hello, this is me, and I just want to say that the Stuck Genius Foundation is like.

86
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,360
We're in pain.

87
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,260
We're in pain.

88
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,940
I want to declare that we are subgenius, and we must have flack because we were here first.

89
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,820
We are new.

90
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,680
We are the subgenius new.

91
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:20,280
We were here first before these bland, normal, communist society humans came into existence,

92
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:28,040
whom have dominated and occupied here in the United States and the world.

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,980
We were here first.

94
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:29,980


95
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,340
And we have the right to do whatever we please.

96
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,760
And the UFOs are in the sky.

97
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,120
Now, these have been meaningless to you because you're not a monster fan geek.

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,920
You're a rock and roller or some writer type or something.

99
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,820
You're a girl.

100
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,560
You're a girl.

101
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,260
So you wouldn't know.

102
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,200
It wouldn't mean anything to you.

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,140
Because to you, a monster is just some fictitious creature of a madman's imagination.

104
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,020
Could a madman cough like I am coughing now?

105
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,320
Could a madman shriek like this?

106
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,360
Could a...

107
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,620
Slap the cuffs on him, Janie.

108
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,340
He's bleeding.

109
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,740
Huh?

110
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,560
I don't know.

111
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,460
I was just talking to myself.

112
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeah, me too, man.

113
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,720
I'm having trouble following anything tonight because the devil.

114
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,640
The devil is...

115
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,420
The devil has gotten in there because they let the devil come in.

116
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,280
At Halloween, they just open their hearts to the devil.

117
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,240
He's looking behind every dumpster.

118
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,760
What are you talking about?

119
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,820
I'm going to take on Jesus and I'm going to get so drunk I forget about Bob.

120
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,700
And I'm going to grow a single horn from my head and let the demons speak from my navel.

121
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,480
Actually, I wish I could get that excited about Halloween.

122
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,820
But, you know, it's a whole world Halloween special day.

123
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,960
You act like somebody you're not.

124
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,620
Like a Frankenstein?

125
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,360
You have a...

126
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
You say...

127
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,100
You pretend you're someone else.

128
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,960
You have a disguise all day.

129
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:00,960
What is the purpose?

130
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,160
You say you act crazy.

131
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:02,880
Oh, man.

132
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,920
On a special day.

133
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,700
Yeah, I understand.

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,240
Maybe for some people it is.

135
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,480
It just isn't the same when you do it.

136
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,280
You know, I used to love Halloween and yet now it's...

137
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,980
Now that I do it every day.

138
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,040
Oh, the first time I...

139
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,940
Now that every day is Halloween.

140
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,680
Popular culture may be as much a mirror of our society

141
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,220
as it is a perpetuator of our best and worst.

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,040
If so, how much responsibility do we take for creating our own monsters?

143
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,700
Dad, can we leave the door open in France?

144
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,860
Dad, can we leave the door open in France?

145
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,220
How's that?

146
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,040
I want to see an oil refinery explode.

147
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,620
Um, could you check the closet one more time?

148
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,780
I want to see a tornado hit a church on Sunday.

149
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,820
How's that?

150
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,100
I want to see some guy running through the Kmart

151
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,280
with an automatic weapon firing at the clerks.

152
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,940
Um, could you check the closet one more time?

153
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,640
I want to see thousands of people in the street killing policemen.

154
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,900
Um, could you check the closet one more time?

155
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,340
I want to hear about a nuclear meltdown.

156
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,720
I want to know the stock market dropped 2,000 points in one day.

157
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,400
I want to see people under pressure.

158
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,920
If anything, I...

159
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,020
I'm sure there's nothing under my bed.

160
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,860
Uh, no, no monsters here.

161
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,860
Uh, uh, no...

162
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,660
Nope, no monsters here.

163
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,240
Okay?

164
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,460
Okay.

165
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,700
Okay.

166
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,760
The ideology of the external threat is integral to the Western political culture.

167
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,040
The propaganda model operates so vigorously.

168
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,360
External threats have been ingrained into journalistic practices

169
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,920
to the point that even in periods of peace,

170
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,320
it is expected for journalists to frame issues

171
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,260
in terms of our guys versus the bad guys.

172
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,860
Do not invite strangers.

173
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,840
And so, once again, good triumphs over evil,

174
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,980
and the forces of light utterly stamp into a bloody pulp

175
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,040
the defeated forces of darkness and disorder.

176
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,340
So, you say you saw some sort of monster.

177
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,520
You say you saw this beast, creature, werewolf,

178
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,660
or whatever you want to call it.

179
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,880
But, you know, the human mind's a funny thing.

180
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,700
It plays tricks.

181
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,980
There are no monsters anymore.

182
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,300
We've proved that.

183
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,980
We put a man on the moon.

184
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,080
In any case, we can't give in to him.

185
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,720
One, eats food, magma of underground.

186
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,680
Two, shoot fleeting rays.

187
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,460
Slow down, I'm writing this down.

188
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Three, a gigantic angler.

189
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,480
The northern Pacific had a big damage.

190
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,020
Now, does this seem like an angler fish with a lantern hanging at the end of the sea?

191
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,100
I always wondered about that.

192
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,120
I think it says a gigantic angler.

193
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,380
I assume it means...

194
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,760
Ah.

195
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:22,800
...that.

196
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,020
That type of fish, yes.

197
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,100
It is a Japanese monster.

198
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,900
They are based on...

199
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,020
Some of them are based on marine organisms.

200
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,140
Let's not be racist.

201
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,940
We won't attribute any race to this.

202
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,940
Just look at it, man.

203
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,920
Look at the screen.

204
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,360
It's obviously a Japanese monster.

205
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,780
It's an Asian monster.

206
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,260
Let's just say Asian.

207
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,300
Well, there is a difference.

208
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,060
There is a difference between Hong Kong monsters like...

209
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,260
It's a Far East Asian.

210
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,760
Korean monsters like Yongari monster.

211
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
How about we say a Far East non...

212
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,940
And a North Peninsula Asian.

213
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,220
...ordinary Japanese monster like...

214
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,160
All right, all right.

215
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,800
We'll say it's an Asian island.

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,940
What's going on in L.A.?

217
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,420
Come on.

218
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,780
They come from Ozu Island.

219
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,120
It's not...

220
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,780
It's not...

221
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,500
It's not a mainland Asian.

222
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,980
It's not a mainland Asian.

223
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Long-star island.

224
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,820
They come from Monster Island, from happy Monster Island.

225
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,760
They're here from Monster Island.

226
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,560
Monster Island is their home.

227
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,080
Hup!

228
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,240
Some of you guys, I don't know.

229
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,000
It's going to be rough.

230
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,760
You're going to have to make...

231
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,380
You're going to have to make a deal with some of the squamous aliens that pass themselves off as sex goddesses.

232
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,280
But as Hal was saying last night, their pheromones are so strong, you won't care.

233
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,460
That's right.

234
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,680
They touched upon that in that movie Galaxy Quest.

235
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:45,680
The actor playing the actor who plays the Bones character fell in love with an alien woman on that.

236
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,720
And when he...

237
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,200
When she lost control and started squirting tentacles up out of her body,

238
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,740
that turned him on even more.

239
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,160
He was the subgenius of that movie.

240
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,180
Who was it that told me?

241
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
I think it was Doc Fropp.

242
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:04,920
He said,

243
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,320
I like my coffee like I like my women.

244
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,260
Anally.

245
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,560
It was one I wasn't expecting.

246
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,700
Who goes there, friend or enema?

247
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,000
He saved his guys in hell, right?

248
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,500
He was...

249
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,360
Bob Dobbs.

250
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,620
He was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time Magazine.

251
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,020
And I didn't know who he was.

252
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,400
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

253
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,420
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

254
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,920
Disciples.

255
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,920
Disciples.

256
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,760
Disclipples.

257
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,680
Yeah.

258
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,360
All right.

259
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,040
You know, it's funny.

260
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,760
I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

261
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,740
But you are so wrong, Pinkboy.

262
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,240
Jesus did in fact have three disciples named Dopey.

263
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,580
And one named Grumpy.

264
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,420
And one named Sneezy.

265
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,020
Yes, and here comes Grumpy.

266
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,140
And he's well named, too.

267
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,500
And better watch out for Sneezy or everything you know will be blown away.

268
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,180
Shallow, Pinkboy.

269
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,980
The most frozen and fearful of all the little dwarfs.

270
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,120
Shallow.

271
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,620
Shallow can hardly keep it together to do his whatever it is he, she, and his doing.

272
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,940
What is it doing?

273
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,940
It's making a chain of flowers.

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,620
No, it's meditating.

275
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,280
No, it's not making...

276
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,900
It's making the flowers, but it's meditating on higher purple.

277
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,920
That burning, elastic thing.

278
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,920
What is that?

279
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,960
It's...

280
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,520
Thinking of new ways to kill.

281
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,640
Ah...

282
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,800
It's one of the spandex...

283
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,480
Used to kill its victims.

284
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,600
Slack takes many forms, my friend.

285
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,980
Killing is one.

286
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,200
Dying is yet another for some.

287
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,360
who pray to die, others pray to kill.

288
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,960
Which are you, my friend?

289
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,860
Why don't you come into the bosom of Babel

290
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,820
or Connie, who has actually a better bosom.

291
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,620
Yes, a cripply bosom.

292
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,080
And learn all that you can know

293
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,880
about the forbidden sciences

294
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,820
and about occult incantations

295
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,460
that can lead you to mastery and power

296
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,420
over your own wallet and your own personal guardian demon.

297
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,860
I will wind the wand or the signet three times.

298
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,360
Take the alabaster pepperoni and put it near your nostrils.

299
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,360
The third nostril will expand and the magic door

300
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,580
is not so magic anymore.

301
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,300
Power and slack, I tell you.

302
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,860
Beyond your wildest imaginings.

303
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,080
Yeah, it is great old power.

304
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,040
Slack, it is called by my people.

305
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,360
We have yearned for slack.

306
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,820
For so many years.

307
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,080
The name we use is slug.

308
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,000
It sounds crude and simple to your people, I am sure.

309
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,280
But one of these days we will master slug

310
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,680
and climb from the slimy pits near the river

311
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,580
where we have been banged.

312
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,020
And we shall...

313
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,380
What are we going to do?

314
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,520
Look, there is the slack.

315
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,500
Now climbing up the banks of the slimy river.

316
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,720
Yes, it's...

317
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,920
It's slipping down on the muddy slope.

318
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,180
Hulking and looming.

319
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:15,760
Why?

320
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,260
You make us frat your ass.

321
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,940
Look at that slack.

322
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,900
Hulking.

323
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,100
That's majestically looming.

324
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,780
It's the grandest and greatest.

325
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,580
No, no, no, no, stay back.

326
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,340
No, no.

327
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,700
Yes, dear friends, slug.

328
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,460
I mean slack.

329
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,840
The hour of slug.

330
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,360
Slack is back.

331
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,840
And Princess Wee is here.

332
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,440
With alabaster pants.

333
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,800
Pepperoni.

334
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,860
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

335
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,260
Soon to come in.

336
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,840
What we've been hearing has been a lot of old subgenius radio

337
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,480
from WCSB in Cleveland with the late Chaz Smith,

338
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

339
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,980
yours truly, and Princess Wee,

340
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,580
from KPFA in Berkeley, California,

341
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,080
the Puzzling Evidence Show with Dr. Philo Drummond,

342
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,040
Puzzling Evidence, and Dr. Hal.

343
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,820
Hence the word Halloween.

344
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,880
And big Dr. Hal fans are Halloweenies.

345
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,440
Phineas Narco of National Cynical Network

346
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,580
did a collage about our own monsters and politics,

347
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,940
which is what this show will be about.

348
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,180
And we heard a collage by Fernand and Andy Lemur

349
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,400
at the beginning, and also PR News,

350
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,740
which he has some knowledge of.

351
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,920
Yes, friends.

352
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,960
Yes, it's a...

353
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,720
a special night tonight.

354
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,400
We don't usually do timely-type shows,

355
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,620
and so this might seem slightly dated to all the stations

356
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,220
besides WCSB Cleveland, where we are right now.

357
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,480
But we decided to come in and do a live show tonight

358
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,920
because, well, it's Halloween where we are now,

359
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,500
in time,

360
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,720
no matter when you actually hear this.

361
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,440
And Halloween is the perfect time to do a show,

362
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,800
and we're going to do a show about how the monsters

363
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,760
are coming to Maple Street,

364
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,480
and why you kids should get out there

365
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,960
and make the broken system that much harder to break further.

366
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,420
Yes, we're telling you...

367
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,780
we're suggesting.

368
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,720
We can't get direct call to action

369
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,740
on a community station like this,

370
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,260
but we can suggest that you think about the possibility of...

371
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,580
voting.

372
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,820
Um...

373
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,500
Also, Reverend Barack Obama is in town,

374
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,600
in Cleveland tonight,

375
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,440
or he won't be there tonight.

376
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,740
He was.

377
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,520
And we're hoping he'll call in.

378
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,440
Many people don't know that the President

379
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,800
is an ordained subgenius minister,

380
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,920
but even before he was elected,

381
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,200
I believe our friend Reverend Shane Smirker,

382
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,080
that rapscallion in Austria,

383
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,420
or Australia, one of those,

384
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,080
the one that they have to hang from,

385
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,360
he bought memberships for both

386
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,840
Reverend Barack Obama and Reverend...

387
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,580
Sarah Palin.

388
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,980
Although we never have...

389
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,440
we haven't heard from Miss Palin.

390
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,340
I hope this, uh...

391
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,520
I hope everything is working here.

392
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,280
Princess, well, you might help me keep an eye on these...

393
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,240
Oh, but of course!

394
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:31,940
But of course I'll keep an eye on that.

395
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,360
The blinky lights out here.

396
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,720
Of course, I'm looking for the green flashing light.

397
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,040
You can be the engineer.

398
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,840
That means that Dave is calling.

399
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,040
Well, or Barack.

400
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,720
Or Barack.

401
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,040
Barry may be calling in.

402
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,580
Could be.

403
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,860
Although, I doubt if he's gonna do it again this year.

404
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,700
Probably not.

405
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,380
You know, I mean, he's done it twice and...

406
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,000
He's a busy guy.

407
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,740
But, uh...

408
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,280
Yes, friends, we're doing a horror show

409
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,320
about what will happen if you cynical, jaded, disillusioned subgeniuses

410
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,760
don't get out and vote on Tuesday.

411
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,020
It's Tuesday.

412
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,860
Not yet, it's not Tuesday.

413
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,560
Well, it was Tuesday already last week.

414
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,480
Don't go down there and try to vote today.

415
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,560
Or you could try.

416
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,920
Although, I guess some people could.

417
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,420
Yeah, sure.

418
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:19,860
Why not?

419
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,800
Why not?

420
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,420
Why not?

421
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,860
Why not?

422
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,260
Why not?

423
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,240
But, you know, Princess, we told me that on...

424
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,040
What's that website that everybody does now instead of alt-slack?

425
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,980
Facebook, that's it.

426
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,800
They were...

427
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,920
She said the young...

428
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,220
Some of the subgeniuses were laughing at the election.

429
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,740
They were planning not to vote because they're cool and cynical and they seem to think the

430
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,040
system's broken.

431
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,400
Can you believe it?

432
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,680
Broken?

433
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,260
But I think it's only broken in places and could eventually be repaired, hopefully to

434
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,040
my exact specifications.

435
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,540
It's much like a child's smash toy moving along at a strange speed and banging against

436
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,040
walls and stopping every once in a while and then starting again.

437
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,140
It's broken, but it still does something.

438
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,960
That's better than having no toy at all.

439
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,720
Well, it's a sad thing when we have to think of our democracy as a system.

440
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:14,720


441
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,540
It's a toy, don't you think?

442
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,320
I've always...

443
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:24,160
You know, I would love to be in the position where I could use it as a toy and sling it

444
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,620
around and hit other kids with it.

445
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,480
Well, actually, I guess that's what some people get to do.

446
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,720
That kind of reminds me of the last...

447
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,260
The previous administration, which, by the way, was all my fault.

448
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm here to confess to you, Dave, and the listeners.

449
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,500
I was the reason that George Bush was elected.

450
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,320
I was so sure he'd lose that I wasted my vote on a third party candidate.

451
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,780
I didn't really like the third party candidate.

452
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,040
I just liked the idea of a third party.

453
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,000
I knew he wouldn't win.

454
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,880
I thought Gore would.

455
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,580
But, so see, that's what happened.

456
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,600
Gore lost the ability to steal the election by one vote.

457
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,140
And...

458
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,800
George got to steal the election by that one vote.

459
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,020
And that vote was mine.

460
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:23,660
So, kids, every time you don't vote, you're actually voting twice for somebody who wants

461
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,640
to kill you.

462
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,360
Think about it.

463
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,240
I...

464
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,880
Oh, what a hell prescription.

465
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,780
I thought of it and didn't like the idea.

466
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,660
Me either.

467
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,760
According to the Onion that I got in the mail, the Republicans are going to win at least

468
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,260
916 gubernatorial seats.

469
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,060
So we're toast.

470
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,120
Unless our race is...

471
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:50,300
Our Republican friends, like Mr. Sister, who lives down the street from us, unless they

472
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,800
stick up for us when Homeland Security comes for us, we're going to be declared obsolete.

473
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,560
Obsolete.

474
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:05,420
I had to beg, Mr. Sister, don't let the beggars come and Anne Frank me.

475
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,900
Please help me, Mr. Sister.

476
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,720
He said he would intervene.

477
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,620
What?

478
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,040


479
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,260
I have to go.

480
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,240
So...

481
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,300
So you're going to be a gentleman.

482
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:18,300


483
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,140
You know, he could know the place you hide in your basement.

484
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,740
Right.

485
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:27,820
I remember when I was younger man or person that as a way of showing our discontent, we

486
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,420
would often vote for Alfred E. Newman, which was our idea of none of the above at the time.

487
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,600
And he was narrowly defeated quite a few times.

488
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,920
Well, and in a way he ended up getting elected.

489
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,320
What?

490
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,260
What?

491
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:49,740
Well, Alfred E. Newman, or someone who very much like him, from Texas, or ostensibly from Texas.

492
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,460
Yeah, actually, he's from Australia.

493
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,340
They don't want you to know that Bush was really born in Australia.

494
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,020
Right. He was really in Australia.

495
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,440
I never saw his birth certificate.

496
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,160
Did you?

497
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:06,460
And he's also a religiously a Pangean hypocrite and a foreskin identuator.

498
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:13,020
And he's also been known to clasp strange objects to his bosom and cry in the middle of the night.

499
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,100
And I don't think that's the kind of man we wanted, but it's too late.

500
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:23,460
Well, I'm not going to blame everything on Bush because I don't, you know, that's what they say liberals do.

501
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:32,120
But actually, I blame everything on the conspiracy, which can take any form, my friend, either the good cop or the bad cop.

502
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,440
Now, some of my friends, they say, well, I'm not going to vote because that validates their good.

503
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,560
I'm going to vote because that validates their good cop, bad cop system.

504
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,920
And I used to think that way myself, but I'd rather have the good cop.

505
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,420
There's always going to be cops.

506
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Why not pick the one that doesn't hit you as hard?

507
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:44,780
Yeah.

508
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,200
That's right.

509
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,100
Or at least the cop you prefer.

510
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,580
He doesn't have to be better.

511
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,300
Some people like the bad cop.

512
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,200
Some people love to pay the conspiracy to take their money away and give it to rich people.

513
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,840
But that won't count.

514
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,960
They whine.

515
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,080
Maybe, maybe not.

516
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,820
Only one way to be sure it won't count, and that's to not vote.

517
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,320
Then you know for certain that your vote went to the worst guy.

518
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,740
Just think of all those foreign countries where your vote is totally worthless.

519
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,160
Although our vote may only be worth a farthing, at least it has some monetary value.

520
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,820
In some lands, a vote is merely an action ordained by the class in power to make them feel nice.

521
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,760
And they get to watch the evening news.

522
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Well, they also watch the noses.

523
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,920
The evening noose.

524
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,420
That's the hangings every day.

525
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:35,960
Noose.

526
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,440
Noose.

527
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:36,780
Noose.

528
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,580
They watch the evening noose to see when they...

529
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:45,300
Which is going to have your neck in it, buddy, if you don't get out there and protect yourself with that broken system.

530
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,920
Not you, Dave.

531
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,900
Well, no, I have no broken system.

532
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,920
I have no system.

533
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,360
Right.

534
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:59,100
But, you know, as we look far into the future, what kind of chance does a returning home war vet have for a better job and...

535
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,100
A new pair of shoes.

536
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,040
A returning home dead war vet have, and more shoes.

537
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:03,620
Yeah.

538
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,060
I did not...

539
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:12,060
Very much, I wouldn't assume, because the wars will never end, regardless of who we vote for.

540
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,680
Right.

541
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,220
Evidently.

542
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,380
The endemic poverty, which is getting worse, will never end, because that isn't part of it.

543
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,620
Well, I don't know.

544
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,060
That's not necessarily true.

545
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,780
You can't predict the future.

546
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,560
I quit...

547
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,280
Around the middle of 1998, for some reason, I quit making predictions myself.

548
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,980
But, you know...

549
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:46,580
You never know when some super genius is going to suddenly invent a great, you know, invention that will feed and clothe everybody.

550
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:54,600
In fact, we saw Twilight Zone last night about this guy who stumbles into a small town where they can't let him leave.

551
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:04,920
Because he stumbled upon their secret that years in the past, a super genius came to this town and gave him the gift of eternal energy and life and health.

552
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,960
And the...

553
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,580
Which could also be used to destroy the world.

554
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,740
So, they...

555
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:20,860
And he says, you people in this town can keep this wonderful stuff, but don't ever let it out, because the normals will use it to destroy the planet.

556
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:32,420
And, of course, our hero, who stumbles into all this, immediately tries to escape with the secrets, which would destroy the planet, proving them right.

557
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,920
And it just goes to show...

558
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,580
Whoever John Galt is, he's nowhere near as cool as J.R. Bob Dobbs.

559
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,440
Price Bob.

560
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,680
John Galt.

561
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,140
Yeah.

562
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
You know that Ayn Rand stuff?

563
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,280
The objectivist?

564
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,960
Well, I'm a subjectivist.

565
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,860
I'm the exact opposite of those heartless fools.

566
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:03,400
And I will do the exact opposite of whatever the John Galt or teabagger conspiracy tells me to do.

567
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,260
I'll do the opposite.

568
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,960
That's my reason for living.

569
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,340
Is to do the opposite of what the conspiracy tells me to do.

570
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,840
And I must agree with you.

571
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:23,980
I fashioned a crude form of life for myself, which in many ways is the opposite of the teabag idea of what things should be like.

572
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,020
And I'm quite proud of it right now.

573
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:36,040
Although there are some large blue stains on the floor that I think come from some sort of material imported to my house from a nearby area.

574
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,680
A military armaments factory.

575
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,140
I still maintain...

576
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,700
That thing you created is still alive?

577
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,060
No, I'm still maintaining a slow argumentative erection.

578
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,920
But the things are trying to live.

579
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,940
I can see they're, you know, they move every once in a while.

580
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,700
Oh, yeah.

581
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,840
There's some semblance of...

582
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,720
It's hard to kill anything.

583
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,040
Yeah, I've been jumping up and down on them.

584
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,880
I swear at them.

585
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,880
Anything mean.

586
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,040
It's real easy to kill.

587
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,960
You can't kill anything nice.

588
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,720
Yeah.

589
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,820
Dave is a killer?

590
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,220
It's hard to kill them.

591
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,840
A killer of nice things.

592
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,480
Well, they're easy.

593
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:12,800
For instance, your flowers.

594
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,440
Yeah, they're easy to kill.

595
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,820
Lions, they're very hard to kill.

596
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,440
People.

597
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,460
Not so easy.

598
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,000
Not as much as you'd wish.

599
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,660
First, you have to bite them real hard.

600
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,720
You don't have nearly as big of a mouth as a lion.

601
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,040
Your teeth aren't nearly as sharp.

602
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,920
So it is difficult for humans to...

603
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,000
Well...

604
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,920
Oh, in the movies, they just stick.

605
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,240
They stick a knife in somebody's gut,

606
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,160
just like it's easy, and they fall over.

607
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,040
But if you ever, God, ever actually try to stick a knife in somebody's gut,

608
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,300
you really have to push and twist.

609
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,800
I mean, it's messy.

610
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,560
It's just not like in the movies.

611
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,300
You know this from first hand or first foot?

612
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,260
You have actually twisted a knife.

613
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,360
Well, of course, I'm...

614
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,440
I've heard these, that sort of thing.

615
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,400
Charlie used to talk about them.

616
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,920
His girls used to talk about them.

617
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,160
Oh, God.

618
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,160
And he traveled.

619
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,820
Yeah.

620
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
That was back in the...

621
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,020
Back in the day, though.

622
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,920
Oh.

623
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,600
Dear listeners, I would like to dedicate this hour of slack

624
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,600
to a Potter Nostril whose birthday is the day

625
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,280
that we happen to be recording this hour of slack.

626
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,220
His birthday's every Halloween, isn't it?

627
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,800
Every Halloween.

628
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,340
What a coincidence.

629
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,620
It's always Halloween on his birthday.

630
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,100
Happy birthday, Potter Nostril.

631
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,180
Hello, Charlie.

632
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,700
Happy birthday to you.

633
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,580
Happy birthday, Potter Nostril.

634
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,180
Happy birthday to you.

635
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,700
Well, that's all he's going to get from us.

636
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,740
And also, my witchy friends are having Halloween together.

637
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,620
Now, look, we're not doing shout-outs on you.

638
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,400
We're shouting.

639
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,720
I'm shouting.

640
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,440
I've been shouting for minutes now in a row.

641
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,480
It's all shouting now.

642
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,440
My Halloween shouts.

643
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,960
Shout your mouth.

644
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,420
Many, many, many devious and dubious types

645
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,360
were born around this time of the year.

646
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,200
Yees.

647
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,780
To name a few, besides Potter Nostril,

648
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,820
Mephistopheles, the great, was born this time of the year.

649
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,040
Also, Tutankhamen, the invincible monster,

650
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,480
was dragged under a bus last Tuesday.

651
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,680
I don't know how that relates to...

652
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,340
Well, according to the research of Reverend Imgur,

653
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:51,900
Anne Frank died on the very moment that Henry Winkler,

654
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,000
who played the Fonz, was conceived.

655
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,840
Therefore, Henry Winkler, the Fonz,

656
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,700
was the reincarnation of Anne Frank.

657
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,280
But I think he died, didn't he?

658
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,780
Henry Winkler?

659
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,280
Yeah, so I don't know.

660
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,860
I don't know.

661
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,760
Maybe I have him mixed up with some other beloved dead actor

662
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,220
whose show I never watched even once.

663
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:13,920
He said proudly.

664
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,260
Maybe it was Patsy.

665
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,160
Wasn't that one of the names of one of the characters?

666
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,320
I don't know, Dave.

667
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,500
I'm not the guy to ask.

668
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,760
I think that there was a Patsy.

669
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,000
Now, if you want to ask me about Twilight Zones,

670
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,320
I can tell you who was the main star, the title, who wrote them.

671
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,540
Now, who was the original?

672
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,980
The one we saw last night was the first one we've ever seen

673
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,100
that wasn't...

674
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,440
Photographed by George T. Clemens.

675
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,800
Can you believe it?

676
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,580
I believe it because I've been witnessing it with you.

677
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,220
I never knew Mark Twain was a member of the Twilight Zone cast.

678
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,680
He was the director of photography for the Twilight Zone.

679
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,180
Yeah, after he quit writing, he became a director of photography.

680
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,720
Samuel Clemens was an actual photographer,

681
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,500
or cameraman for the crew then.

682
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,000
Right.

683
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,640
For every Twilight Zone up until...

684
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,120
That explains a lot about Huckleberry Finn stuff.

685
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,440
Well, yeah.

686
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,900
And, yeah, every Twilight Zone up until the fifth season.

687
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,760
That was photographed by that guy.

688
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,620
Yep.

689
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,920
I've gotten to where it's like as soon as the first bars of music hit,

690
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,000
I can tell you who composed the score.

691
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,260
Really?

692
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,820
Bernard Herrmann, Jerry Goldsmith, or who.

693
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,360
By the way, the music in the background tonight is by the great Hans Salter.

694
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,600
Hans J. Salter did most of the music for the Universal Monster Pictures

695
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,900
in the 30s and 40s.

696
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,600
Hans.

697
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,540
Let's have a Hans for Hans.

698
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,300
Hans J. Salter.

699
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,820
Some juicy clarinets there.

700
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,620
Ha.

701
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,180
Well, that was Igor on the clarinet.

702
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,460
They actually had the guy that Igor's character was based on

703
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,100
was a member of the orchestra.

704
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,080
Of course, he couldn't be in the movie because he was too ugly.

705
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,540
They had to have Bela Lugosi play him

706
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,480
because he was kind of a cute version of ugly.

707
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,240
But quite a humanly effort on his part

708
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,740
for doing all the stand-ins and all the double trills.

709
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,600
You know, that's a pretty hard instrument to play.

710
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,380
Mm-hmm.

711
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,160
Well, Princess Weep plays that instrument.

712
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,740
The flute.

713
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:06,920
Yes.

714
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,200
The flute is not the clarinet.

715
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,120
She's a flautist.

716
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
No, it's not a clarinet.

717
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:10,900
It's very different.

718
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,280
No, it's quite different.

719
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,980
One is a reed instrument.

720
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,520
And when Igor didn't really even play the...

721
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,680
He played a homemade flute made from a human bone.

722
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,680
A femur, I think.

723
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,900
It was either a human femur or a lemur femur.

724
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,960
But it would have been a very large lemur.

725
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,560
And he merrily missed high C.

726
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,660
Oh.

727
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,220
Fair enough.

728
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,420
Well, I don't know.

729
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,180
I'm trying to be glib on such an evening before an evening before

730
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,300
that is so romantic in this land.

731
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,140
Could possibly be a dangerous one.

732
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,920
A dangerous Tuesday for some of us.

733
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,900
Could we speculate, perhaps, on what might happen

734
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:01,440
if the Tea Partiest actually ascend to the throne of gesticulation?

735
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,560
Well, I don't know.

736
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,140
Let's see.

737
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,920
I'm on...

738
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,460
I'm not really worried.

739
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,440
What would they have against me?

740
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:14,020
Just because I'm known to commonly associate with...

741
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,300
I mean, at times, I've perhaps been real good friends with

742
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:26,740
pagans, Jews, Muslims, queers, or other types of homosexuals,

743
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,920
weirdos, the differently-sained, the differently-abled,

744
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,760
the differently-colored.

745
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,160
The differently-sained.

746
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,160


747
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,160


748
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,740
A lot of the differently-colored, actually.

749
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,900
I've never even been able to land on a...

750
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,140
It seems like everybody's different-colored.

751
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,280
Isn't that weird?

752
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,760
And parts of me are different.

753
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,420
That's what...

754
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,540
I wish I could all be one color, but I'm kind of spotty.

755
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,560
Yeah, in your case, I usually...

756
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,840
So, you know, Dave, yeah, and I know that you have been on record

757
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,020
as questioning the status quo.

758
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,500
Specifically under the Republican...

759
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,660
In fact, there's recordings of us making fun of Republicans and...

760
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,700
Oh, did you...

761
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,200
You heard about the protest...

762
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:24,520
There was like some Democrat protester was at a Rand Paul rally last week

763
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,840
and she dared to be sarcastic or had a sarcastic costume on.

764
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,040
She got kind of close to Rand Paul and Governor Rocknar,

765
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,940
the subgenius who happened to be standing there.

766
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,460
He was a volunteer at the time.

767
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:43,260
And the volunteer bag party bagged her and threw her on the ground

768
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,160
and kind of stood on her head.

769
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,920
Now, here's the funny thing about it.

770
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,520
Kind of stood on her head.

771
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,660
The guy that got in trouble for standing on her head

772
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:56,100
was wearing a Don't Tread On Me button.

773
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,740
Oh, that is ironic.

774
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,240
The boingboing.com pointed that out.

775
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,600
But yeah, if you blow up the picture, you can see he's got the little

776
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,780
Don't Tread On Me button.

777
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,580
And while he treads on someone who dared not even to interrupt,

778
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,160
but just to wear a sarcastic outfit and have a sarcastic sign.

779
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,000
So that's what you can look forward to, friends.

780
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,980
If you want a picture of the future,

781
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,840
imagine a face stomping on a human boot forever.

782
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,220
Saying don't...

783
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,860
Wearing a T-shirt saying don't stomp on my face.

784
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:27,620
Right.

785
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,020
Right.

786
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,200
The funny thing is we have Reverend Modemak brought a big

787
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,760
Don't Tread On Me flag to X Day.

788
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:34,920
Don't Tread On Me.

789
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:34,920


790
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,420
He did a great drill about five years ago.

791
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,020
Indeed he did.

792
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,000
We still have it.

793
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,300
And we have a wonderful photograph of a car driving over him

794
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,320
as he's wearing that flag.

795
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,400
It says don't tread on me.

796
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,920
And there's actual tire treads going across poor Modemak.

797
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,780
There you go.

798
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:58,220
You know, I noticed that those Rand Paul fans didn't stomp on

799
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,660
Rocknar's head because he's probably too big to knock to the ground.

800
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,040
Yes.

801
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,440
The person.

802
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,080
They've taken the whole crowd to pull him down.

803
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,220
The person's head who was being stomped on, I believe, was a woman.

804
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,540
Sort of a light-framed woman.

805
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:19,440
Well, she deserves it for daring to question the great Rand Paul

806
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,840
and all that he stands for.

807
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,620
What do they think this is, a democracy?

808
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,380
What do they think is going on here?

809
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,260
You know, this show alone, kids,

810
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,360
if you don't get out and...

811
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,440
and vote on Tuesday for somebody who's not going to kill us,

812
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,080
they'll probably kill us just because of this show that we're doing right now.

813
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,380
And Christine O'Donnell will turn you into a toad.

814
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,800
Oh, my God.

815
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,440
Can you imagine, speaking of Christine O'Donnell,

816
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,360
what if the so-called liberal press,

817
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,080
I mean, if the so-called conservative press

818
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,740
had gotten a hold of a liberal lady who had claimed to have dabbled

819
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,420
in the press, and she was going to kill her.

820
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,280
And the way the conservatives use the word dabble now is,

821
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,580
oh, everyone does that when they're 17.

822
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,160
They light a cat on fire and put a candle in their rumpus

823
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,460
and say some gibberish that sounds like the Necronomicon.

824
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,820
But in reality, had she been a flaming liberal,

825
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,380
she probably would have indeed been set afire

826
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,560
much in the way the witches were set afire

827
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,220
back in Middle Ages Europe.

828
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,540
That's because everyone knows that liberals all want women

829
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,300
to practice witchcraft and become lesbians and leave their husbands.

830
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,320
It's not because they care about the women.

831
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,840
It's because they hate America.

832
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,360
I've been told that over and over again by the liberal-controlled media,

833
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,400
that the liberals control the media and they hate America.

834
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,060
And I've been told what they think.

835
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,820
I've never told what anybody else thinks, only what liberals think.

836
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,500
And yet, I know tons of so-called liberals,

837
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,520
and I've never heard a single one of them bring up any of the stuff

838
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,400
that liberals think.

839
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,920
They're constantly being described as thinking.

840
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,800
So they must be thinking it real quietly.

841
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,400
Well, some liberal husbands do want their wives to practice witchcraft

842
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,920
and become part-time lesbians, you know, when they're around.

843
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,380
Yeah, if they can take pictures, sure.

844
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,700
Well, who wouldn't?

845
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,260
I mean, come on, boys.

846
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,360
The average liberal is no different than any other average Joe,

847
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,840
except for he hasn't been steeped in tea for three weeks.

848
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,420
He has ideas.

849
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,300
That fall on fallow ground here in this land.

850
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,360
People just don't...

851
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,100
Well, some don't get it.

852
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,340
Now, as I understand it, I've been told over and over again

853
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,340
that no liberal has ever been able to support himself or herself,

854
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,120
that they're all supported.

855
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,860
They're all either rich elites and or, at the same time,

856
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,640
ignorant welfare queens.

857
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,780
Yeah.

858
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,160
That's all there is, is rich elite welfare queens,

859
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:10,180
who only will show up at a Jon Stewart rally if they're paid to or if there's free food.

860
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,200
Well, they usually show up in Broham Cadillacs and that sort of thing.

861
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,320
That's what they're supposed to do.

862
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,380
The Cadillac has a TV antenna on top.

863
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,620
No, on welfare, but the Cadillac has a TV antenna on top.

864
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,820
They never had to work.

865
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,840
Nobody who ever voted for a Democrat ever has worked.

866
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,280
I've actually read that.

867
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,820
Several times a day for the last several weeks

868
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,960
because I'm dumb enough to continue to examine those comments

869
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,160
that people can leave after news stories on the Internet now.

870
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:53,180
Well, did you know that one of the very, very best criteria for becoming a president

871
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,840
is to have actually run a major corporation disguised as a small business?

872
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,080
Right, yeah.

873
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,160
That's the only experience anybody needs.

874
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,540
Right.

875
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,400
Well, you know, here's...

876
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,120
Here's the sad thing.

877
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,740
I'm probably what you'd call a bleeding-heart liberal.

878
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
That's what some people would call me.

879
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,180
I call myself a middle...

880
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,900
Exactly the middle of the road.

881
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,780
You can zero your meter on me.

882
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,720
But I'm actually...

883
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,420
I run a small business,

884
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,480
and we sell stuff that's manufactured here in Cleveland Bluffs, Ohio,

885
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,580
using mostly American...

886
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,020
American...

887
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,260
Made goods.

888
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,160
And...

889
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,020
And...

890
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,160
And I...

891
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,880
We didn't actually take handouts from anybody.

892
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,720
I've never been on the dole or unemployment or anything my whole life.

893
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,260
I've always had at least two jobs.

894
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,340
It's now un-American to buy American.

895
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,860
Real patriots buy foreign cars

896
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,940
because they don't want to shop with government motors.

897
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,440
I noticed that.

898
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,880
I'm taking in your voice there

899
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,420
because it is hard to tell what they want us to do.

900
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,240
I'm trying, though.

901
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,500
I personally am giving it my best.

902
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,420
I want to know what they want us to do

903
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,620
so I can do the exact opposite, like I said.

904
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,660
It's just a devilish thing about me.

905
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,620
You know, if everybody else is going to be a brown shirt

906
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,260
stomping down the street waving a flag,

907
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,500
then I'm probably going to be hiding in some Dutch person's cubbyhole.

908
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,660
Well, I'll probably...

909
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Hoping that they don't find out what non-religion I'm not.

910
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,400
I don't know.

911
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,500
I don't know if you remember a dream I told you I had one time.

912
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,020
I awoke to find myself surrounded by Nazis.

913
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,020
And suddenly, and I didn't want them to know that I wasn't one of them.

914
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,600
It was like the Nazi army.

915
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,660
It was like the SA or something like that.

916
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,540
And so I donned the stuff,

917
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,100
as much of the stuff as I could find.

918
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,440
The helmet and the coat and the boots were far too big for me.

919
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,420
So everybody was forced to start marching in line

920
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,280
and we were going to go.

921
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,480
We crushed the Stangs and the Subgenie

922
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,000
and all the other unwanted scum of society.

923
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,860
And I was elected to be in the crew

924
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,360
that was going to go out and do that.

925
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,860
And it just felt so weird wearing all those funny clothes that didn't fit.

926
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,920
And you thought this was a dream?

927
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,320
Oh, I had doubts about it, but I still thought it was a dream.

928
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,020
Submitted for your consideration.

929
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,180
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

930
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,260
Then you rescued the princess.

931
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,100
A hapless schlub.

932
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,180
Who thinks he's having a dream

933
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,200
about his country being taken over by Nazis.

934
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:44,440
But in fact, Dave has just crawled into a zigzag tunnel

935
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,100
that we like to call the Twilight Zone.

936
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,920
I'm sorry, I seem to do that every show, don't I?

937
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,760
Actually, at home I do it every hour.

938
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,420
But if you were a pea partyist,

939
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,720
you would cut away to a commercial.

940
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,540
I'm sorry, I'm a pea partyist.

941
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:07,540


942
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:07,540


943
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:07,540


944
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,620
So enamored of everyone.

945
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,520
If I had the right kind of talk show,

946
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,400
we'd be getting paid,

947
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,120
and we'd run commercials for buy gold

948
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,680
and all that stuff.

949
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,320
And frozen armatures and wasted money.

950
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,780
Golly.

951
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,720
Glenn Beck has an audience of millions,

952
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,560
and we only have an audience of ten.

953
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,400
But...

954
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,160
But on the other hand,

955
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,920
there's ten million drunken high school dropout rednecks

956
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,320
bitching about that black guy.

957
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,800
And he gets to be president!

958
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,540
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

959
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,240
And this is good.

960
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,300
So I hope they're...

961
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,060
You know, it's...

962
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,680
The poor guy's not...

963
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,700
I'll be really surprised if he can...

964
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,360
stand after the next two years.

965
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,020
But, um...

966
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:03,900
But...

967
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,600
Boy, it sure was fun to watch those people

968
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,020
squirm in impotent anger for the last couple of years.

969
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,640
The sheer blistering,

970
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,680
insecurity-based hatred of these guys,

971
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,820
who, you know,

972
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,860
they haven't even been able to make it to assistant manager

973
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,080
at the McDonald's without getting fired.

974
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,120
And hear this, this, this...

975
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,440
Well, I don't want to say it,

976
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,440
but he not only graduated from Harvard,

977
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,380
but became president.

978
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,720
That's just not fair!

979
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,980
No, it's not.

980
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:36,860
I've got to admit,

981
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,180
it's been a great couple of years so far,

982
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,000
watching that...

983
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,680
Just listening to the grinding of their teeth.

984
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,640
On the other hand, it gets kind of scary.

985
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,760
Because, you know, where we might have...

986
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,780
Where we might have been...

987
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,040
Where your average liberal back three years ago

988
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,860
might have been saying,

989
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,440
I think George Bush should be tried for treason.

990
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,440
What you hear now is,

991
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,680
Obama should be tried for treason,

992
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:03,880
and then...

993
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,680
And then executed for military treason!

994
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,600
It's amazing how many...

995
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,480
I wish y'all could have seen me when I did that.

996
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,000
I wish you could have seen him, too.

997
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,000
My veins were all over the place.

998
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,380
Every vein on his face has popped out.

999
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,440
His face is bright red right now.

1000
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,520
I was just imitating other people, though.

1001
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,520
I'm actually not a very angry guy anymore.

1002
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,000
Speaking of that,

1003
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,760
did you know that Glenn Beck

1004
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,900
has been...

1005
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,880
has been considered the same

1006
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,760
as many of the...

1007
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,480
the subgenius speakers

1008
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,980
when they give their rants?

1009
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,220
There was supposedly some famous preacher

1010
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,000
in the South in the 1920s.

1011
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,640
I forget his name.

1012
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,460
Perhaps you remember.

1013
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,660
And he actually initialized a speaking style

1014
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,180
which extols the audience

1015
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,880
to do things they wouldn't normally do

1016
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,700
just because he's foaming at the mouth.

1017
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,160
And Beck was...

1018
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,220
You can go point by point,

1019
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,640
and he uses that technique.

1020
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,180
It's an old tent-go-to-meeting type of...

1021
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,620
pounding on things voice.

1022
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,480
Right.

1023
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:06,960
Yeah.

1024
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,540
Yeah.

1025
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,100
It's a way to get people riled up,

1026
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,900
and it's real easy to get people riled up.

1027
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,200
They don't understand that rhetoric, do they?

1028
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,080
Especially if they're stupid.

1029
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,760
But that's okay.

1030
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,460
Can you believe our poor country

1031
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,220
is so drowned, did, in rhetoric

1032
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,680
that we jump like little weasels

1033
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,460
every time the fanny barks, you know?

1034
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,420
It's just too much to complain about.

1035
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,700
No, it's not.

1036
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,840
Let's keep complaining, man.

1037
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,340
I love it.

1038
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1039
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,320
I agree.

1040
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,160
It's free country.

1041
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,580
We're supposed to bitch and gripe all the time, right?

1042
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,060
Yeah, but we're not supposed to do anything about it.

1043
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,620
Right, right.

1044
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,220
Dare you actually do anything about it?

1045
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,500
Well, I wouldn't want to issue a call to arms at this point

1046
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,720
because there's too many people with their fingers on triggers.

1047
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,060
They don't care what they're going to shoot at,

1048
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,320
but they're going to shoot at something.

1049
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,260
One finger on the trigger

1050
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,540
and the other one in the derriere.

1051
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,920
You know, it was only 90 years ago

1052
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,500
that women got the vote.

1053
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,340
In America.

1054
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,140
Well, that's where...

1055
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,700
And these women...

1056
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,420
They never should have been allowed to learn to read.

1057
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,460
...that are not voting are just...

1058
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,200
If you would read that history of the suffragettes

1059
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,920
and see what those women went through,

1060
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,960
and the worst thing about it all was

1061
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,300
it actually was not a codified law.

1062
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,580
It was a cultural thing that women didn't vote.

1063
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,700
Right, they could have voted.

1064
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,380
It just wasn't done.

1065
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,440
They would have had to have been that first one

1066
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,940
to not go to the back of the bus.

1067
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,440
They would have turned the lady away at the polls,

1068
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,760
for being unladylike.

1069
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,420
And an officer without the recourse of law

1070
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,960
would have enjoined the fray

1071
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,500
to escort the lady out.

1072
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,340
What the hell of a kind of place is this?

1073
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,840
And just think of 100 years ago,

1074
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,240
he could be shot on sight

1075
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,440
just for being an Indian or an African American.

1076
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,660
And say, well, he got in my way.

1077
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,180
I was trying to pass on the left.

1078
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:53,840
Yeah.

1079
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,940
Yeah, it's hard to imagine, actually,

1080
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,000
the way things were not all that long ago

1081
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,940
and how easy it would be

1082
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,420
for it to all slide right down.

1083
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:03,420


1084
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,260
Right back to that.

1085
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,020
Look at the country of Iran.

1086
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,800
At different times,

1087
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,340
they've been the most civilized,

1088
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,600
free, freedom-loving,

1089
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,400
knowledgeable,

1090
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,920
scientifically advanced country in the world.

1091
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,780
Several times they've been that way.

1092
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,240
And then there's these in-between periods

1093
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,300
when it's the baggers take over.

1094
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,040
Mm-hmm.

1095
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,100
And that can happen anywhere.

1096
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,760
I've actually, Princess,

1097
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,960
we and I, in 2004,

1098
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,880
we were in Hamburg, Germany,

1099
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,540
and had to listen while young Germans said to us,

1100
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,580
we're kind of concerned about this fascism

1101
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,860
rising up in America.

1102
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,240
It is true.

1103
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,580
And they would know from the tales

1104
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,200
that grandfather told him.

1105
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,620
Well, German schools are actually

1106
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,620
probably a little better than all Americans.

1107
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,040
The worst German schools are probably better

1108
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,500
than most of the best American schools.

1109
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,260
They were listening to the news.

1110
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,040
And we call them gymnasiums.

1111
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,860
That shows how it's culturally illiterate.

1112
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,680
Yeah.

1113
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,220
Well,

1114
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,440
those who can't do, teach.

1115
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,300
Those who can't teach, teach gym.

1116
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,580
And those who can't teach gym,

1117
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,020
interview each other

1118
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,860
on podcasts.

1119
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,000
The media ditch is full of corpses again tonight.

1120
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,400
Yes, yes, yes.

1121
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,680
Yes, yes.

1122
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,080
I'm hoping you do this

1123
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,160
before the evening is over.

1124
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,420
I hope that all young,

1125
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,860
brave men and women,

1126
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:32,860


1127
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:32,860


1128
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,400
out there,

1129
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,240
between the ages of 25 and 93,

1130
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,180
expecting your next birthday

1131
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,180
to be much the same

1132
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,900
as it was their last birthday,

1133
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,440
to put on a new pair of pants,

1134
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,320
a new pair of shoes,

1135
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,060
perhaps a fedora,

1136
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,960
and stride out the door

1137
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,160
and hold their arms open wide

1138
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,180
and look up at the sky and scream,

1139
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:55,940
F...

1140
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:58,640
I...

1141
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,160
No.

1142
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,100
I forgot what I was saying.

1143
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,540
That's okay.

1144
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:02,920
Okay, Dave,

1145
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,460
because you know what I have in front of me?

1146
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,140
No.

1147
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,880
I have...

1148
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,960
No, I know you don't.

1149
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,280
I have in front of me

1150
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,640
something you posted on Scrub Genius

1151
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,480
earlier today or yesterday.

1152
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,540
Would you like me to read it

1153
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,620
in a lonesome cowboy, Dave?

1154
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,640
You mean you're reading it from the monitor

1155
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,520
from the computer at the studio.

1156
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,040
You don't have it in front of you.

1157
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,640
No, I do.

1158
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,900
I have it printed out.

1159
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,920
It doesn't spatially exist that way.

1160
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,960
No, I printed it out.

1161
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,660
Oh, yeah.

1162
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,720
Here, I'll do it in a lonesome cowboy, Dave voice.

1163
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,380
Talk the way you used to talk

1164
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,240
when you were from Texas.

1165
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,820
Why I will vote.

1166
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,340
Mostly because I can.

1167
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,900
Many sub-geni feel the system

1168
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,580
is so corrupted by corporate interests

1169
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,160
that any democratic procedure

1170
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,180
is doomed to failure.

1171
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,160
But as an individual with a fiery zeal

1172
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,740
for true democrazy,

1173
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,680
I implore you to ignore

1174
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,180
those correctly made assumptions.

1175
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,200
If there aren't more people at the polls

1176
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,400
than TP people,

1177
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,260
they will not have to falsely prove their case

1178
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,800
in a more semi-rigged way.

1179
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,900
So I will vote just to show

1180
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,980
those TP types

1181
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,120
that I don't like the world they want.

1182
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,180
Kind of like when Chancellor Hitler won.

1183
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,660
Lots of people voted

1184
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,360
just to make a personal statement.

1185
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,240
Please don't let Hitler win.

1186
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,040
Gulp.

1187
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,960
If Christine O'Donnell

1188
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,540
and all them other idiots win

1189
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,100
like the rigged polls predict,

1190
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,160
it will be easy.

1191
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,860
It will easily be as bad here

1192
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,600
as when Bush reigned.

1193
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,840
I know O'Donnell's behind,

1194
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,120
not carnally,

1195
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,640
but the others are not, see?

1196
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,300
That was by lonesome cowboy Dave.

1197
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:31,820
Well,

1198
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,500
our friend Sinfaltvis Ex Mortis replied,

1199
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,140
yeah, if everyone stops voting

1200
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,680
because the system is broken,

1201
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,780
I can't do the New York accent,

1202
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,460
then the only ones to win

1203
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,120
are the breakers of the system.

1204
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,800
It's all one big conspiracy

1205
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,000
to get you to stop voting,

1206
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,840
so rebel against the conspiracy

1207
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,940
and vote, damn it.

1208
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,680
I concurred.

1209
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,320
Yes, you concurred.

1210
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:55,800
You said,

1211
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,340
I remember when Gore lost,

1212
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,200
quote unquote,

1213
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,180
and then they finally announced it,

1214
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,720
though Gore,

1215
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,060
had conceded the count,

1216
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,040
which resumed after Scalia, Thomas, etc.,

1217
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,320
made their one-time-only deal,

1218
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,120
showed that Gore won Florida

1219
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,300
by a squeaky 15,000-some votes.

1220
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,280
On top of that,

1221
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,460
he'd actually won the national

1222
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,280
by a few mil.

1223
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,700
I would never have been much of a supporter

1224
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,700
of any politician, said Dave,

1225
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,280
except the screwjob to what it veiled

1226
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,800
has since become so obvious,

1227
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,460
and we're 10 years beyond that mind.

1228
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,360
And they wonder

1229
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,280
why some malcontents urinate their pants

1230
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,420
at the BMV in protest,

1231
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,220
and have the suits come with disinfectant?

1232
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,960
Does that make any more sense to you

1233
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,660
than now that you're hearing

1234
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,880
Lonesome Cowboy anyway?

1235
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,960
Then this anarchist said,

1236
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:43,840
well, I'm not going to vote

1237
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,880
because it's all wrecked.

1238
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,940
And Artemia Salinas said,

1239
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,000
my motto is,

1240
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,800
if subgeni are the only ones who vote,

1241
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,400
then subgeni will be the only ones

1242
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,500
who participate in elections

1243
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,460
from a voting standpoint.

1244
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,960
Which is kind of a circadian,

1245
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,240
secular statement saying sort of nothing.

1246
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,080
I like that.

1247
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,880
No, it's logical.

1248
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,880
Susie the floozy said,

1249
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,800
I'm only voting so I can get

1250
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,100
the free orange juice and donut

1251
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,940
and the $25 and being able to pick up a bundle,

1252
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,100
any bundle, out of the cop's evidence locker.

1253
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,040
I'm not accepting the free foot rub, though.

1254
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,800
That's twisted.

1255
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,760
Tater said,

1256
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,360
they had hamburgers and chips

1257
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,500
down in Lumley where Tater voted.

1258
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,040
And I said,

1259
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,240
I said,

1260
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,780
us said, actually,

1261
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,980
Princess We and Me,

1262
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,120
us spelled USA.

1263
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,440
We used to love voting

1264
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,720
in the old folks apartment building

1265
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,600
because the hot dogs the old ladies sold.

1266
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,140
But now we enjoy voteeing

1267
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,760
in the elementary school

1268
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,280
because we love the smell

1269
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,840
of elementary school paste

1270
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,680
and cafeteria hamburgers.

1271
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,620
And plus, the last time I voted,

1272
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,360
my guy won.

1273
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,760
It was the first time that happened

1274
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,540
in over a decade.

1275
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,560
So who knows?

1276
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,800
Maybe I'll hit the jackpot.

1277
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,760
Oh, God.

1278
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,360
And on top of that,

1279
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,220
it just reminds me,

1280
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,580
I've got jury duty coming up.

1281
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,940
And I'm not even going to fight it

1282
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,320
because I figure it's my civic duty

1283
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,020
because if I was the suspect,

1284
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,180
I'd sure as hell want somebody like me

1285
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:10,760
on the jury.

1286
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,980
So I'm going to go on and do it.

1287
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,900
To be honest, Reverend Stang,

1288
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,200
the last time we voted in our neighborhood

1289
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,440
in the new voting place,

1290
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,120
there was someone selling

1291
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,460
maybe burgers or hot dogs,

1292
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,060
but there was also someone

1293
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,000
who was selling falafel sandwiches

1294
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,600
complete with vegetables

1295
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,840
that she grew in her

1296
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,480
Cleveland Heights garden.

1297
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:29,980
Falafels?

1298
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,060
Homemade falafels?

1299
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,620
Homemade falafels.

1300
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,180
Communist Muslim Kenyan.

1301
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:34,980
Trader.

1302
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,820
That's Cleveland Heights.

1303
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,080
A communist Muslim Kenyan.

1304
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:39,880
Yeah.

1305
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,240
They were amazing.

1306
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,320
Communist Muslim kingdom.

1307
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,300
That would be...

1308
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,120
I think that would be

1309
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,700
a great TV situation ploy.

1310
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,580
Communist...

1311
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,560
What was it again?

1312
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,300
I missed the middle part.

1313
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,200
Communist Muslim Trader...

1314
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,480
Kenyan.

1315
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,540
Communist Muslim...

1316
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,440
Nazi...

1317
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,700
Nazi communist.

1318
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,200
I guess...

1319
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:00,980
I hear that a lot.

1320
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:01,900
That's kind of weird.

1321
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,720
I mean, Nazis were fascists.

1322
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,520
I mean, there's like,

1323
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,240
well, you're the National Socialist Party.

1324
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,260
It means they're socialists.

1325
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,260
Actually, it was accent on the national,

1326
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,400
not the...

1327
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,060
And when they said socialists,

1328
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,340
that's not what they meant.

1329
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,800
Well, it's odd of them

1330
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,200
to throw Muslims together

1331
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,840
with atheist communists as well.

1332
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,940
It doesn't make much sense

1333
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,700
that these people

1334
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,000
who are so infected

1335
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,260
with the hyperbole of a deity

1336
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,200
and these other people,

1337
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:30,200


1338
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,200
who are so disconnected

1339
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,040
from any idea of a deity,

1340
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,260
I think that, well,

1341
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:37,400
I...

1342
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,780
I don't know

1343
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,900
who they are.

1344
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,320
Who wanted to do that?

1345
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,640
It would be like

1346
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,760
endorsing negativist

1347
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,500
Sunday night bowlers

1348
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,400
who congeal with

1349
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,800
fractured...

1350
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,180
I don't know.

1351
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,180
You can't put those

1352
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,540
two opposite things together

1353
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,400
very well.

1354
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,980
I can't.

1355
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,780
I can't put any of it

1356
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,420
together anymore.

1357
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,500
I don't know.

1358
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,280
All I know is that

1359
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:10,860
you're listening to

1360
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,520

181417

1377
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,100
Cleveland Heights,

1378
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,780
Ohio,

1379
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,740
44118.

1380
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,780
And your lack of prayers

1381
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,020
will be answered.

1382
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,420
And if you don't

1383
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,460
pray at the polls,

1384
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,020
who knows what monsters

1385
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,140
from the id

1386
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,700
will rise up

1387
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,180
and die.

1388
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,280
We'll see you next time.

1389
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:01,280


1390
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,680
Booting and stomping

1391
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,340
in their shiny black boots,

1392
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,020
taking away your slack

1393
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,240
or forcing slack upon you

1394
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,780
that is not your slack,

1395
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,060
but their slack.

1396
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,100
Nyag hol.

1397
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,900
Nyag hol.

1398
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,000
Nyag hol.

1399
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,720
That's from the SIG HAL.

1400
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,500
Nyag hol.

1401
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,360
The horror.

1402
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,180
The horror.

1403
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,680
A drink of rancorous juices.

1404
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,960
So kids,

1405
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,280
vote for whoever you want to,

1406
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,520
but just go ahead

1407
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,640
and do something.

1408
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,860
Don't just do nothing,

1409
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,820
because if you do nothing,

1410
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,260
you don't really have the right

1411
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,600
to complain to me anymore.

1412
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,880
How many YouTubes,

1413
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,160
right,

1414
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,800
how many YouTubes

1415
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,480
do you think there already are

1416
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,320
showing needless

1417
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,360
hypocritic youth

1418
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:47,800
pyroflagellating,

1419
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,780
for example?

1420
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,640
And just think of yourself

1421
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,460
as one of those

1422
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:53,760
pyroflagellates,

1423
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,240
one of those people

1424
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,320
who have actually

1425
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,360
extended themselves

1426
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,880
and may lose a grip

1427
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,620
and actually lose a grip.

1428
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,060
And actually explode

1429
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,840
from the inwards out.

1430
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,040
And friends...

1431
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,980
Then you know you're doing

1432
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,520
the right thing for Bob.

1433
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,060
That's right.

1434
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,320
If you don't do it

1435
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,120
for your country,

1436
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,600
at least do it for Bob.

1437
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,500
And now,

1438
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,900
we must go off the air,

1439
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,800
because the time

1440
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,760
has come

1441
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,560
for us to go.

1442
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,860
The time is easy.

1443
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,740
Dave, I'm fading you out.

1444
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,040
I'm fading out slow.

1445
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,360
Yes, fading out slow.

1446
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,120
There he goes.

1447
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:22,760
Poor thing.

1448
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,400
Listen to that.

1449
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,060
Oh, there he goes.

1450
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:25,560
He's gone.

1451
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,140
And, uh,

1452
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,500
and I...

1453
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,020
Shh.

1454
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,700
I'll fade that out.

1455
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,820
Oh, my God.

1456
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,660
What happened?

1457
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:34,960
Uh, this.

last month,

1464
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,200
helping it to overtake Germany

1465
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,320

1477
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,300
national extremist attacks

1478
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:01,960
today.

1479
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,940
The attacks have been sparked

1480
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,960
by high courts

1481
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,940

1491
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,040

You say,

1501
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,220
you can't save money.

1502
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,720
It's easy as pie.

1503
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,280
Brown bag your lunch

1504
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,240
instead of going out.

1505
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,340
