1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,660
The Soul Genius Power of Slack

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,640
What foolishness.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,200
True.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,640
No.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,160
Yes.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,580
No.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,920
Yes.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,220
No.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,880
Without question.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,140
No.

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,460
Not to the soul.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,500
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Hour of Slack,

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,540
number 1,080, and I am your host and prayer partner,

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,360
Reverend Ivan Stang.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,120
This week, I got a couple of emails saying,

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,500
when are you going to start broadcasting Hour of Slack again?

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,520
I guess the ancient reruns that I've been using to save time

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,300
while working on the Subgenius History course with MaybeLogic.org

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,060
were so ancient that people didn't recognize any of the voices

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,400
and really didn't understand that those were hours of Slack

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,480
that were used to broadcast Hour of Slack.

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,380
They were hearing, it's just that they were hours of Slack

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,820
from like 1982, before there was an Hour of Slack.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,160
Friends, it was me and Philo and Dr. Howell and Puzzlin and so forth.

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,140
It's just that we were babies, like most of you are now,

26
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,960
in our early 20s.

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,360
I don't really believe that we were ever so young either.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,160
But tonight, we go back to being old, that is new.

29
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,380
This is...

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,200
Part of a five-hour epic live show we recorded on January 10th

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,460
at KPFA Studios in Berkeley

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,800
with over-the-edge host Izzy Isn't,

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,080
heard in the background here, of Negative Land,

34
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,880
and Puzzling Evidence host Doug Wellman of Wellman Headland.

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,680
These sound more like the Hour of Slack you're used to,

36
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,740
although they are not actually that.

37
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,740
Subgenius Doctors participating include Dr. Howell,

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,300
Puzzling Evidence, Philo Drummond,

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,900
yours truly,

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,800
Reverend John Shirley,

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,200
Gary Gabrofan,

42
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,180
Michael Pepe,

43
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,500
Princess We Are Go,

44
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,440
Chaos McBobcat Drummond,

45
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,480
Phineas Narco,

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,240
K-Rob,

47
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,400
somebody named Walter,

48
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,740
the uber-goober-booby-baby,

49
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,040
and Bishop Joey from the First Church of the Last Laugh.

50
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,280
Some of us got there late, friends,

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,800
so when this annual subgenius business meeting begins,

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,020
the only stockholders present are Izzy Isn't,

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,640
Puzzling Evidence,

54
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,640
Cyberpunk author, Reverend John Shirley,

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,820
Dr. Gary Gabrofan, Phineas Narco,

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,020
and Bishop Joey,

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,500
also known as Ed Holmes of the San Francisco Mime Troupe.

58
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:47,600
The music in the background right now is from the new Amino Acids album due out June 2007.

59
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,040
The Amino Acids album called Humanity Will Fall Like Pins.

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,280
You can look at the Amino Acids album, the Amino Acids album, and the Amino Acids album called Humanity Will Fall Like Pins.

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,280


62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,960
The Amino Acids album called Humanity Will Fall Like Pins.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,420
The Amino Acids album called Humanity Will Fall Like Pins.

64
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,420


65
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,840
I may not play all five hours of the five-hour show in order over the next five weeks,

66
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,120
but until my subgenius history courses over on the 25th,

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm still ball to the wall.

68
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,240
And so, onward, subgenius soldiers marching as to Walmart.

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,160
This is Operation Experiment.

70
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,840
These men arrived here on X-Day minus 60.

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,800
It has taken them the full two months to get ready.

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,200
Today is X-Day.

73
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,480
It is now H-hour minus 59 minutes.

74
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,680
There is less than an hour left.

75
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,140
There can be no margin for error.

76
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,300
There can be no second chance.

77
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,280
Well, good hello.

78
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,180
Hello, everyone.

79
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,980
This is not Barb Golden in Crack-A-Don, who is usually here the first Thursday of every month at midnight.

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,100
Ouch.

81
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,800
And it is I.

82
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,720
It is I, the over-the-edge guy.

83
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,860
Izzy isn't.

84
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,080
But it's not quite over the edge either.

85
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,160
It's a special unscheduled broadcast of over-the-edge,

86
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,720
and the subgenius, the Church of the Subgenius Foundation, Incorporated,

87
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,040
are all here, and we're all going to do five hours together, all together, right here.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,080
And that's what we're doing.

89
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,840
So it's not this and it's not that.

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,240
It's both.

91
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:16,220
To a place where men satisfy their bloodlust by hunting human quarry.

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,260
All right, gentlemen.

93
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,340
Ready for testing.

94
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,840
Put on your headphones and pick up a microphone.

95
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,260
Bob.

96
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,260
I love Bob.

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I love Bob.

98
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,720
I love Bob.

99
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,680
I love Bob.

100
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,980
That's Ed Holmes of the Church of the Subgenius.

101
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,600
Bob.

102
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:49,760
Bob.

103
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,040
Bob.

104
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,080
Bob.

105
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,220
Bob.

106
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,420
Bob.

107
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,420


108
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,420


109
00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:00,260
Now, I've decided unilaterally to name this show the title of this show,

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,360
The New Year's Revolution Show.

111
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,700
Now what does that mean?

112
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,520
That means we have to spin around in a Gregorian manner.

113
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,840
Well, according to my script, it will be explained later on.

114
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,460
Ok.

115
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:16,480
Ok.

116
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,240
I don't know what...

117
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,640
Where...

118
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,500
Where is Dr. Hal?

119
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,320
Dr. Hal, we buried him, I think, last week.

120
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,880
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like, we regret to inform you

121
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,960
that Dr. Hal has passed away almost a week ago today.

122
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,960
And he will no longer grace the big fat chairs of the subgenius.

123
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,240
Well, actually, we did bring him in because he wasn't smelling that bad

124
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,700
since it's been very cold outside lately.

125
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,840
So we got that cold snap.

126
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,580
Oh, I see him, yes.

127
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,360
Yeah, so we just propped him in the thing.

128
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,340
And because he's such a motor mouth...

129
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,020
I like that.

130
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,780
He's still talking.

131
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,560
He's still talking.

132
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,360
I like it.

133
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,640
We just have to push the microphone real close.

134
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,520
We're trying to get a microphone jacked just right into his jaw.

135
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,040
I like the glazed look.

136
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,460
Yeah.

137
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:16,880
Uh-huh.

138
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,340
So we can squeeze...

139
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,940
We can squeeze...

140
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,400
We can squeeze another show out of Dr. Hal.

141
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,940
His cooling carcass.

142
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,460
Just a few electrical shocks.

143
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,300
Apply a few electrical shocks,

144
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,660
and there'll be an automatic reaction, in his case, talking.

145
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,000
And Gabrofram is here with his jumper cables of love.

146
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,040
Meh!

147
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,360
Meh.

148
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,540
What happened to...

149
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,960
Where's Bug Girl?

150
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,520
Where's Bug Girl?

151
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,680
Where's Bug Girl?

152
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,820
Where's Bug Girl?

153
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,240
Where's Bug Girl?

154
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,220
Oh, no, Bug Girl is not coming, is she?

155
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,460
You'll see her in a bit.

156
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,220
Not until she sees you, Don.

157
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,820
Oh, that's so funny.

158
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:09,520
It's my understanding that Reverend Stang, the iconic sacred scribe of the Church of the

159
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,560
Subgenius, will be here.

160
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,640
He'll be here.

161
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,080
And even right now, he's listening.

162
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,620
He's frustrated.

163
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,680
And he's warm in his things.

164
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,800
He's trying to...

165
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,420
He's wishing he could be warm.

166
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
He's wishing.

167
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,280
He's...

168
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,860
You know, with Reverend Stang, a wish becomes reality.

169
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,160
Very easily, because he has so much slack.

170
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,180
He has three pairs at the cleaner.

171
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,900
He has so many slacks and so much slack in Cleveland.

172
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,620
Is he still in Cleveland?

173
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,220
Yes.

174
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,920
Oh, boy.

175
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,880
Why?

176
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,700
Why is anybody still in Cleveland?

177
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,160
I understand it's the most violent city in America.

178
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:54,940
Really?

179
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,680
Yeah.

180
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,160
But see, the reason is that the Reverend Stang is there.

181
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
He sucks all the slack from everybody else.

182
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,920
And there's an umbrella of peace around him.

183
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:15,700
But everybody else, in consequence, you know, stresses up and they begin to throttle one another.

184
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,380
Well, there it is.

185
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,620
He's a slack sucker.

186
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,460
He's a slack sucker.

187
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,400
He's a slack sucker.

188
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,580
He's a slack sucker.

189
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,640
He's a slack sucker.

190
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,740
Okay, well, so...

191
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,160
Okay, so...

192
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,500
So we're really funny now.

193
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:29,900
All right.

194
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:36,400
Okay, Bishop Joey's here, and he's answering any of your religious and or sexual questions.

195
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,520
So you can call in at 848.

196
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,220
That's all.

197
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,060
That's all the numbers we've got.

198
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,980
We had a big budget cut here at KPFA, so we had to lose four of our phone numbers.

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,100
So we're just down to 848.

200
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,220
Just dial 848.

201
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,160
And wait.

202
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,900
And John Shirley is here to answer any of your science fiction questions.

203
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,800
All right.

204
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,860
The sexual and religious questions have...

205
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,980
How big was Paul Anderson's pole?

206
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,360
It was still really a dick.

207
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,440
It's one of the mysteries.

208
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,860
Religion and sexuality have converged or have, you know, it has shown it.

209
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,720
It has dropped its pants this year because of Haggard, right?

210
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,860
And people like that.

211
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,480
Haggard?

212
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,620
So my question...

213
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,380
My question to you is...

214
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:18,720
Yes.

215
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,120
Yes.

216
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:28,540
You know, where is your particular theological domain with respect to this emerging explosion

217
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,920
of self-exposure sexually amongst the religious leaders of our country?

218
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,040
It's under my bed.

219
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,560
The domain is under my bed.

220
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,420
I feel there is no God.

221
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,060
You feel.

222
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, exactly.

223
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,780
I feel.

224
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,280
I feel.

225
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,540
But to feel is not enough to be...

226
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,400
To realize.

227
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:47,860
To feel.

228
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,400
Expressively, intellectually, and convincingly appropriate.

229
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,480
Feeling?

230
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,220
Feeling?

231
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,800
Feeling is...

232
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:04,460
Feelings are no longer shorthand for your expression of a religious and or sexual congress,

233
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,100
which is 110th time I've been going around.

234
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,360
Well, one of my samples says feeling is believing.

235
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,740
Feeling is believing.

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,260
Dr. Johnson said I refute it thus, and he kicked it.

237
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,360
He kicked the stone.

238
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:19,660
Thus.

239
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,900
And it hurt his foot.

240
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,760
And then he said, I believe, because that hurts.

241
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,940
That's too much of a coincidence for comfort, sir.

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,280
I know, but you can't expect anything less here on KPFA.

243
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,560
In your ear.

244
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,820
You're trying to go to bed.

245
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,880
You're trying to go to sleep.

246
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,140
And somebody's left the radio on.

247
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,360
And you reach for the dial, and it won't turn off.

248
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,320
And your radio's stuck.

249
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,040
And the clock is ticking.

250
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,420
And you're trying to get some sleep, because tomorrow you've got to get up and face another day.

251
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,600
At your grueling, grim, boring job.

252
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,180
But here you are, stuck listening to the radio.

253
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,340
Listening to us.

254
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,540
So, join us.

255
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,220
If it hurts, you believe.

256
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,920
Yes.

257
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,640
If it hurts, you believe.

258
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,580
If it hurts, you believe.

259
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,400
Believe.

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,680
Yes.

261
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,880
I have a sexual question.

262
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,100
I have a cat.

263
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,060
A female cat.

264
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,940
And she eats too much.

265
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,640
And the reason she eats too much is because she likes to fight all the other cats in the neighborhood.

266
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,880
Uh-huh.

267
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,200
Uh-huh.

268
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,060
Uh-huh.

269
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:25,780
And...

270
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,520
This is a sexual...

271
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,800
That's what worries me.

272
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,700
And...

273
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,620
And...

274
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,000
Here.

275
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,020
And...

276
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,940
He's listening to his delayed broadcast.

277
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,480
He wants to hear himself.

278
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,720
Oh, I see.

279
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,040
Okay.

280
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,360
Yeah, the whole station now, you know, is on a delay.

281
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,360
Didn't used to be, but it is now.

282
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,400
So we can't see him?

283
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,820
We can't see him.

284
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,240
And, uh...

285
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,760
We can't say beep or beep or beep or beep.

286
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,180
And, uh, she has a computer.

287
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,440
Or, beep or beep.

288
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,040
Or, beep.

289
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,300
Because we have a dump button, but I promise not to use it.

290
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,260
Oh, wow.

291
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,920
Oh, we did.

292
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,300
Yeah.

293
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,500
So when you call...

294
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,100
Yeah.

295
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,240
Listen to me, people.

296
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,800
When you call...

297
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,160
When...

298
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,540
Don't...

299
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,040
Don't listen to your radio.

300
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,440
Because...

301
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,780
Don't listen to your computer.

302
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,340
Don't listen to your radio.

303
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,340


304
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,920
Don't listen to your...

305
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,980
Listen to your telephone.

306
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,080
Listen to your telephone.

307
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,300
Because in your telephone's earpiece is the only real time...

308
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,340
Listen to me.

309
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,580
Listen to me.

310
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,300
That exists now.

311
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,260
Listen to me only.

312
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,400


313
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,620
Turn down your radio.

314
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,940
Turn down your computer.

315
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,280
Turn up your radio.

316
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,180
If you try to converse with us with those up...

317
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,080
Throw your computer out.

318
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,260
...you will sound drunk.

319
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,800
Throw it up!

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,920
Throw away your computer.

321
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,060
You will sound drunk if you attempt to follow the delayed broadcast while calling.

322
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,800
Drink heavily.

323
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,900
Thank you.

324
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,440
Please don't speak into the microphones.

325
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,000
That's too much of a voice.

326
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,300
Think into the microphones.

327
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,380
Oh, my God.

328
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,380


329
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,380


330
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,380


331
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,380


332
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,380


333
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,380


334
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,380


335
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,380


336
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,380


337
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,860
Only think into them.

338
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,560
We're gonna stink into the microphones.

339
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,140
These microphones are so sensitive that they feel insulted if you talk into them.

340
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,020
We're still...

341
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,020


342
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,200
Stinking into the microphone right now is Dr. Hal.

343
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,060
We're trying to get Dr. Hal jacked into the microphone.

344
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,440
I just want to get this over early.

345
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,460
You know, the stang and the hal.

346
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,960
Let's try to get the show out of the door by 1230.

347
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,540
And Phineas Narco's a tape.

348
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,060
He's loopy.

349
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,760
He's loopy.

350
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,860
Phineas is loopy.

351
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,240
Looped.

352
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,360
He's loopy.

353
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,240
He's loopy.

354
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,540
He's loopy.

355
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,240
He's loopy.

356
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,180
He's loopy.

357
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,360
He's loopy.

358
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:30,440
And that information is the number you can call to find out about this coming St. Stupid's

359
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,640
Day parade, number 29.

360
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,640
Yeah, that's coming right up.

361
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:32,960
That's right.

362
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,120
April 1st will be the 29th annual St. Stupid's Day parade starting at noon at the Poynty

363
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,080
building in San Francisco going up Columbus Avenue to either Washington Square Park or

364
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,240
Joe DiMaggio's bathroom.

365
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,860
So, get ready.

366
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,340
Put it in your calendar and be prepared to go.

367
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,340


368
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,220
We're going to march once again in honor of St. Stupid, a little known St. 442, 443,

369
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
513, and 747, the parking meters.

370
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,580
I bet you didn't know that.

371
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,640
You're not Catholic, are you?

372
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,440
I didn't think so.

373
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,960
That's April 1st.

374
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Is that April 1st?

375
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,220
I mean, is that when the parade is?

376
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,560
I thought it would be April 1st.

377
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,100
It could be April 1st.

378
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,520
I'm not sure.

379
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,960
Noon at the Poynty building.

380
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,180
So, if you want more information about that, go to ststupid.com.

381
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,800
That's S-A-I-N-T-S-T-U-P-I, S-T-U-P-I, whatever.

382
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,060
We know.

383
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,340
That's the way it is.

384
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,340


385
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,560
It's like a...

386
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,560


387
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,560


388
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,560


389
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,880
I don't know it, but you can't figure it out.

390
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,040
Google it.

391
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,300
Google it yourself.

392
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,440
Oh, yeah?

393
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,600
Well, Google this.

394
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,600
What?

395
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,660
What?

396
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,220
Let's Google this.

397
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,300
Google this.

398
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,720
What?

399
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,180
Google this.

400
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,340
Google this.

401
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,860
Let's Google this.

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,060
Google this.

403
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,980
Where even an innocent corpse can find no peace.

404
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,840
Google this.

405
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,940
Google this.

406
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,320
Of course, we'll keep searching.

407
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,320


408
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,320


409
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,320


410
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,320


411
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,320


412
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,320


413
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,320


414
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,320


415
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,580
And now the pretty part of the show.

416
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,160
That's so much better.

417
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,460
Now maybe you can get to sleep,

418
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,540
because we'll be playing some easy listening trance music

419
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,640
for you to get into your theta state.

420
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,400
That's right.

421
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,400
That's so soothing.

422
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,800
It's the face of the new fascism.

423
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,640
It's soothing fascism.

424
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,400
The soothing sounds of fascism tonight.

425
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,340
...deadly worldwide conspiratorial gangster computer god communism...

426
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:40,940
Try that number.

427
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,420
Data follows.

428
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,160
Distance, 486 miles.

429
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,980
Height, 50.2 miles.

430
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,160
Speed, 5 miles per second.

431
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,280
Something bad has happened.

432
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,060
Just showing me.

433
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,720
So you can't use all those recorded instructions on phone fidelity.

434
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,760
Those are all gone now.

435
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
Say good day.

436
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,180
That is correct.

437
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,040
You could technically still have phone fidelity.

438
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,560
Yeah.

439
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,180
I know.

440
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,640
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to use it.

441
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,040
You're not going to be able to use it.

442
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,620
The delay doesn't really affect that.

443
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,340
It's just that if you don't listen to your telephone, you won't hear yourself.

444
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,860
Take a six-pack of cans.

445
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,840
I'm holding a big bottle of liquor.

446
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,020
Estimated time of arrival at contact point, 1 minute 58 seconds.

447
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,740
.

448
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:31,740


449
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,380
.

450
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,260
.

451
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,780
.

452
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:37,860
.

453
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:37,900
.

454
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:37,920
.

455
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,020
.

456
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,060
.

457
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,080
.

458
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,080


459
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,080


460
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,140
.

461
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,140


462
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,140


463
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,140


464
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,140


465
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,140


466
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,160
.

467
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,160


468
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,160


469
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,160


470
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,280
.

471
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,280


472
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,280


473
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,280


474
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,280


475
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,440
.

476
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,760
.

477
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,140
.

478
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,140


479
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,100
.

480
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,100


481
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,100


482
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,100


483
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,100


484
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,100


485
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,760
.

486
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:11,820
.

487
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:11,920
.

488
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,100
.

489
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,180
.

490
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,240
.

491
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,320
.

492
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,320


493
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,320


494
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,620
I'm hearing his...

495
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,800
And co-creator of the Church of the Subgenius,

496
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Philo Drummond.

497
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,920
Check, check.

498
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,020
Dry old trumpet.

499
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,420
Dry old trumpet?

500
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,420
Dry old trumpet.

501
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,240
Dry old trumpet is his goyle.

502
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,680
He's a dry old trumpet.

503
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,900
He's been pump-dried for the last time, hopefully.

504
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
He's a crusty old trumpet.

505
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,800
He's a crusty old trumpet.

506
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,140
He's 90.

507
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,800
He's the Karl Rove of the Church of the Subgenius.

508
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,760
Drummond.

509
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
Now, one...

510
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,020
58 right.

511
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,180
Let fire control.

512
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,580
Fire control alerted, sir.

513
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,780
Two grains of sand fall out now and then.

514
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,220
Young Martin also says that he saw something worse.

515
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,120
La la la la.

516
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,020
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

517
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,280
21.

518
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,800
On a quiet summer day in Houston, Texas,

519
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,840
unbeknownst to the rest of the world,

520
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,040
a great scientific operation was performed.

521
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,920
A squid was eating dough in a polyethylene bag.

522
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,520
On that day, a human being was given a shape that would last forever.

523
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,620
A very repellent shape.

524
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,420
When may we expect you?

525
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,120
In 30 seconds.

526
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,560
A shape that would never age,

527
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,120
but decay.

528
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,160


529
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,640
Over and off.

530
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,400
And an event had taken place that is soon to affect all of humanity.

531
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,140
Something that he insists was his brother.

532
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,440
But we know that his brother is dead.

533
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,380
We also know that he is not lying in his coffin.

534
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,080
Someone in this village is practicing witchcraft.

535
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,020
The Reverend Stang will be here.

536
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,140
Have fun.

537
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,340
Faith.

538
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,600
You want to play it?

539
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,560
Yeah, this is not your usual camp followers meeting here.

540
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,420
Ed's going to try to play it now.

541
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
We've got the big wig himself here coming tonight.

542
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,740
Oh, he's doing really good.

543
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,780
Mr. Ivan Stang, owner and operator of the Subgenius Church Foundation of America.

544
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,160
But Ed and I will be gone by the time Stang gets here.

545
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,540
You guys were gone, gone, gone years ago.

546
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,060
Oh.

547
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,500
So why are we here?

548
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,040
Why did we drive all the way from our far-off homes and the nice warm beds?

549
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,600
Probably dating from the acid test.

550
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,140
For the New Year's Revolution show.

551
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,780
Oh, that's right.

552
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Come on, get into it.

553
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,800
What if I refuse to even participate in the New Year?

554
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,260
We have a whole new chance here.

555
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,420
I'm...

556
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,800
We have a...

557
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,920
You know, this is the last year.

558
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,400
You have to understand that...

559
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,700
It has been announced.

560
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,280
The Church of the Subgenius has announced that the end of the world will take place on Thursday, July 5th, 2007.

561
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,980
And in preparation for the fulfillment of this doomsday prophecy,

562
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,940
the Church is requesting that all of its members participate in a festival with rock concerts and blasphemous rituals

563
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,140
taking place in upstate New York during the final weekend before the arrival of the apocalypse.

564
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,760
Oh, they're always doing that.

565
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,820
They do that every year.

566
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,040
But, see, there are many other people who make predictions about the end of the world.

567
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,600
They give up too easily.

568
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,820
Huh.

569
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,140
They say the end of the...

570
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:53,280
There was a guy in 1986 or so who wrote a book explaining that the end of the world would come in 1988.

571
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,500
And he sold five million of them.

572
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,420
And it didn't come.

573
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,680
And so he wrote another book saying it would come in 1989.

574
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,340
He sold a lot of those, too.

575
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,540
He was that much persistent.

576
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,480
And then he gave up.

577
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,120
The Church of the Subgenius never gives up predicting the end of the world.

578
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,600
Even after the end of the world, the Subgenius will predict it.

579
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,740
Well, if you go to the edge of the universe and throw a rock, what do you hit?

580
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,100
So after the end of the world, you know, there's got to be another end, another end, and another end.

581
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,240
Well, there's the Gardall Shield.

582
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,840
First of all, no one ever accounts for the Gardall Shield.

583
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,640
And there's a novel by John Shirley called The Other End.

584
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,280
But I won't promote it this time.

585
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,100
The Other End?

586
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,040
The Other End.

587
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,060
What's that, the check?

588
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,800
It's my alternative.

589
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,240
Alternative?

590
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,620
Apocalypse.

591
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,000
What?

592
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,480
A novel of alternative apocalypse.

593
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,920
We're all here.

594
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,520
You know, every time I look for a John Shirley book at my local bookstore, I don't see one.

595
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,900
Well, you've got to look in the cheesy section, in the cheesy paperback section.

596
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,220
Or go to a better bookstore.

597
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,660
A better class of bookstore might help also.

598
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,400
I look for those books by Lloyd St. Alcorn.

599
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,240
I don't know if you remember those.

600
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,680
Oh, that's a name that resonates.

601
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,560
It resonates with cobwebs.

602
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:20,660
Dr. David Meyer, I believe, wrote several terrible books under the pen name of Lloyd St. Alcorn.

603
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,840
But it was slack because he got paid to write terrible books.

604
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,600
That's right.

605
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,580
But he got paid lousy money.

606
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,180
I get paid lousy money to write good books.

607
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,000
So he had more slack than me because he got paid the same money to write bad books, which is easier.

608
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,660
Edgar Wisenant made himself a nice packet of money with a book assuring him that he was going to be a good writer.

609
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,240
He was telling everyone that 1988 was the end of the world.

610
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,220
He had 88 reasons for his insurance.

611
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,960
And he sold 4 million copies to a gullible public.

612
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:57,360
And in 1989, he came out with a book in which he said he had made some mistakes, but it was going to end in 1989.

613
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,460
You know, that kind of persistence is admirable.

614
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,320
Elizabeth Clare Prophet said that 1990 was going to be the end of the year.

615
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:16,760
The Gulf War broke out and religious enthusiasts got on their phones to the radio stations saying that Armageddon would be in 1991.

616
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,400
Well, everybody I know died in 2007.

617
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,880
You're mixing up the past and the future again.

618
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:35,020
You know, Gary's problem is that he thinks that the future is the past because he lives outside of time.

619
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,300
Gary lives in the eternal.

620
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,300


621
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,680
He's got one foot in eternity and he keeps wobbling back and forth and he kind of gets them mixed up.

622
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,880
And he can see the future.

623
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,240
He thinks it's the past.

624
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,000
He spins around.

625
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,960
He doesn't know the difference.

626
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,400
But spending all this time in my own tent made out of my own skin, wouldn't you think that I would be in my own reality?

627
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,560
Too soon for what?

628
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:57,940
Absolutely.

629
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,820
You're spinning.

630
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:06,180
You're like an object being spun on a lathe and gradually ground down into a shape that can only be imagined.

631
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,400
I need more time.

632
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,880
Well, here I have a question for you, John.

633
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,580
This is more KPFA-like.

634
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,660
More time for what?

635
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,560
And I found this here on the floor of KPFA.

636
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,480
I can't believe it.

637
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,020
That's where all my cousins come from.

638
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:24,940
It says, what are the ties between immigrants from a Middle Eastern country and an African American born in South Carolina?

639
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,400
Is that a reference to Obama or something?

640
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,500
I have no idea.

641
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,360
The end of the world's coming and you're just talking about this stuff.

642
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,300
Trivial.

643
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,000
It's a mystery.

644
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,940
It's a side one cut to dawn.

645
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,800
Questions are bound on the floor here.

646
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,680
That's how desperate we are for questions from the great world.

647
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,580
We're scrabbling around on the floor like a crack addict.

648
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,180
Good.

649
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,580
You want questions?

650
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,320
You got questions.

651
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,940
Why can't you amend your revelation and move it up to early September?

652
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:59,520
Followers of Nostradamus claim that according to the French seer, the end of the world came in July 1999.

653
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,360
We're perfectly willing to adjust to circumstances.

654
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,120
Hey, can we have September 11th early this year?

655
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,960
The supreme moment of the universe has already happened.

656
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,920
That is a grim joke.

657
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:21,320
Jesus said this generation should not pass away until the fulfillment of his prediction of the end times was fulfilled.

658
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:29,060
And I don't know if anybody noticed 1,998 or so years ago that it didn't come about.

659
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,940
So all these people predict the end of the world.

660
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,840
It doesn't happen.

661
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,040
The church of the subgenius predicts it much more diligently than everybody else.

662
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:45,880
June 7, 1989 is when it really happened on the 1, 23, 45 AM universal time.

663
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

664
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,160
We lived through it.

665
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,320
I have it on tape.

666
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,080
It really happened.

667
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,660
Gary, your output in the amp is a bit high for that mic.

668
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,640
Okay.

669
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,400
That's because Ed's playing it now.

670
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,120
See, no hands and it's still loud.

671
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,520
I've got a list of end of the world predictions here.

672
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,000
Play something really loud.

673
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,480
Play something really loud.

674
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,360
St. Augustine said it was coming in the year 1,000.

675
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,160
That's it?

676
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,400
That's as loud as you'll ever get?

677
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,060
No, we can play as loud as you want.

678
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,220
That's pretty good there, I think.

679
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,160
Pretty good right there?

680
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,560
Yeah.

681
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,580
Yeah.

682
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:22,920
Yeah.

683
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,620
Okay.

684
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Go to it, Ed.

685
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,700
It's your turn.

686
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,260
Wow.

687
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,040
Wow.

688
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,100
Wow.

689
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,100


690
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,100


691
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,100


692
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
Here we go.

693
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Here we go.

694
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,300
We'll do it.

695
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,600
Damn, good guys.

696
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:43,600


697
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:43,600


698
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:43,600


699
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:43,600


700
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:43,600


701
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:47,860
We've got an GOD video sang by Ravel.

702
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:47,960
Now, watch it if you want a train reaction.

703
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,340
The song is called INSTAumatic on還有?

704
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,280
Come on, the views should spread all over.

705
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,160
Jungploy Company, followed by marché

706
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,520
tree and hit Isaac square in the capooter.

707
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,080
He did, and Isaac Newton predicted the end of the world for 1733.

708
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:19,660
If you would like to attempt to speak to the Subgenius Foundation Church of America, please

709
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,880
call us at...

710
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,740
Don't say hello when your phone stops ringing, you're on the air, and don't listen to your

711
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,500
radio, please.

712
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,280
In 1736, William Whiston of Cambridge announced that the end of the world was about to commence.

713
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,620
Panic-stricken Londoners headed for high places to escape the floods, he predicted.

714
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,520
None of them came.

715
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,760
Didn't anybody ask, how does he know?

716
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,960
Immanuel Swedenborg, who conversed frequently with angels, was certain that 1757 was the

717
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,220
date.

718
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,980
Oh, hey, that reminds me, we're supposed to have Swedenborg breads for dinner tonight.

719
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,180
We cut the pancreas out of philosophers and dip them in cornmeal.

720
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,480
They're delicious.

721
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,720
The thyroid is supposed to be especially delectable if you get a mathematician.

722
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,400
Nietzsche's is real bitter, though, you don't like bitter, you like Nietzsche.

723
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,700
Oh, everyone has their own little Nietzsche these days.

724
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:20,880
Yeah.

725
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,580
So if you want to join in on a frivolity and a clever wordplay, just dial...

726
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,340
...Mavus, Gerber.

727
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,580
Come on, you can do it.

728
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,360
I think that when they were trying to say a Freud to live and too young to die.

729
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:42,060
There are people around the world who really still believe that if you eat somebody's heart

730
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,800
who is courageous, you will be courageous.

731
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,920
So if you eat their brains...

732
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,780
Eat somebody prettier than you are.

733
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,440
Eat somebody smarter than you are.

734
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,420
Eat somebody stronger than you are.

735
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,780
Well, I've been nibbling a lot.

736
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,720
But eat somebody.

737
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,300
I've been nibbling a lot.

738
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:57,820
Whatever you do.

739
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,380
But eat somebody.

740
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,640
Are we allowed to say that on the air?

741
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,280
Eat somebody?

742
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,100
Yeah, if it's a song.

743
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,740
You gotta eat somebody on your bond.

744
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,500
You gotta eat somebody on your bond.

745
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,960
But not their lungs.

746
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,680
Got any recipes?

747
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,160
So cannibalism's coming back, we hear.

748
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,440
So if you got some recipes.

749
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,640
It will come back.

750
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,280
When the world famine comes, my friend, which I have been predicting, the American famine.

751
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,580
The great calling began.

752
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,660
Imagine a famine in the United States.

753
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,780
What would that be like?

754
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,700
Who would we eat first?

755
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,500
Well, we'd eat the Welsh rabbits made from Volkswagens.

756
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,520
There are people who've eaten cars.

757
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,400
There are, bit by bit, like chunk by chunk.

758
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,720
There was a guy who cut up a car and ate it.

759
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,700
It took him several years.

760
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,540
Did you ever see The Metal-Eating Bird?

761
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,740
The cartoon, The Metal-Eating Bird?

762
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,960
You've seen it, haven't you?

763
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,540
No.

764
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,300
No.

765
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,220
I don't watch television.

766
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,400
Well, Doug Wellman has seen The Metal-Eating Bird.

767
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,740
Oh, whip it out.

768
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,600
You got it on tape?

769
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,060
Whip it out.

770
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,580
Charles Russell, founder of a group later known as the Witnesses of Jehovah.

771
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,700
Does that sound familiar?

772
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,420
He said that Christ had returned invisibly in the year 1874.

773
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,020
There was no way of proving he was wrong.

774
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,260
But the girls all knew that somebody were staring at them.

775
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,220
They were staring at them in their gym locker room.

776
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,200
Yeah, when they went wee-wee.

777
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:29,840
That was Jesus.

778
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,800
The guy with the beard.

779
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:37,160
But, you know, in fact, somebody pointed out to me today that if Jesus is always watching you, we are Jesus's porn.

780
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,300
Oh, man.

781
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,720
That's right.

782
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,960
That's what's disturbing.

783
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,620
We're going to porn with Jesus Watchers.

784
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,520
Yes, and we're Bob's commercials.

785
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,680
Well, Russell, what is your definition of an actor?

786
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,720
That's what your relatives do.

787
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,040
So where are all the rest of all the important guests on this show?

788
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,880
I think it is something.

789
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,280
Look behind the...

790
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,480
The prop bush.

791
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,020
Yes.

792
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,420
Oh, they're just lazy.

793
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,680
They think five hours, no hurry, no hurry.

794
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,340
Little do they know how much of a hurry we're in here.

795
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,420
We've got to get five hours cranked out here in 20 minutes.

796
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,760
They've been verbally arrested, I suspect.

797
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,360
Hey, that's going to drive me home in a minute.

798
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,120
In a minute.

799
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,800
In a minute.

800
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,260
I'm just going to drop you off at Pescadero.

801
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,080
Because I'm going to be in Pescadero all weekend.

802
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,580
So if you can find Bishop Joey in Pescadero this weekend, you'll win the prize.

803
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,280
Are we strong?

804
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:26,900
We're strong.

805
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,060
All of us.

806
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,720
I'm just going to rent Bishop Joey and ride him on the beach out at San Gregorio myself.

807
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,160
Rent to Bishop Joey.

808
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,760
Yeah.

809
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,580
Jehovah's Witnesses predicted the end of the world for 1975.

810
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,920
When they come to your door and they're trying to convince you they've got some inside information.

811
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,200
1975.

812
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,000
Then again, 1984.

813
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,420
They said that was going to be the end of the world.

814
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,420
When they come to your house, ask them if they remember that.

815
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:03,560
And if you want an alternative apocalypse, go to www.signsofwitness.com.

816
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,920
Where is my website of alternative apocalypse?

817
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,220
Apocalypse?

818
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Apocalypse is related to apocalypse.

819
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,020
It's when you can't say apocalypse.

820
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,380
I've had a little experience with apuckerlips.

821
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,900
Well, apocalypse only happens back east.

822
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,500
Apocalypse now.

823
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,660
They have sodas here.

824
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,380
And they have pop.

825
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:26,980
Back there.

826
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,680
I pop my lips now.

827
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,800
Yeah.

828
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,840
Apuckerlips now.

829
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,120
Apuckerlips now.

830
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,660
This is a true thing.

831
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,780
Apocalypse.

832
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,040
In 1983, as the residents of Calcutta, a small town 30 miles north of Rome,

833
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,560
prepared for the apocalypse.

834
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:56,560


835
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,020
They were invited to their annual procession honoring a holy relic.

836
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,040
A shocking announcement from the parish priest put a damper on festivities.

837
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,180
The relic has vanished.

838
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,500
What was that relic?

839
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:11,360
The lopped off body parts of a certain messiah.

840
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,220
That is, it was the foreskin of Jesus.

841
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,600
It was alleged to be, I'm not making this up, the foreskin of Jesus supposedly found

842
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:26,060
in India in, no, in Calcutta, not Calcutta, in 1557.

843
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,060
And a series of miracles soon followed finding the holy foreskin.

844
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,900
A weak storm, it's perfumed, missed.

845
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,580
Well in fact it has not turned up and they, and the people of Calcutta claim that it was

846
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,660
stolen by the Vatican.

847
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,320
Holy foreskin.

848
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,000
Who didn't like the holy foreskin being out there in their church and they were embarrassed

849
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,300
by it.

850
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,120
They were afraid someone was going to clone it.

851
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:49,540
Okay.

852
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,580
There has been discussion of cloning the holy foreskin.

853
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,760
Holy foreskin.

854
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,520
Holy foreskin.

855
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:54,620
Holy foreskin.

856
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,040
Holy foreskin.

857
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,880
Holy foreskin.

858
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,740
Holy foreskin.

859
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:57,740


860
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:57,740


861
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:57,740


862
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,320
Here, I've got mine here in my wallet.

863
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,540
Let's try to clone it and see if it works for me.

864
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,420
I'm Jewish.

865
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,280
Lines of pilgrims stretched from the church doors beyond the walls of the fortress town

866
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,320
to see the holy foreskin.

867
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,740
I think we should stretch Bishop Joey's over this African drum head.

868
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,400
Oh.

869
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,980
Can you use it as a shower cap?

870
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,780
The Pope is using it.

871
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,040
It's a cap and it makes it that weird.

872
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,260
hat more snuggly on it.

873
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,060
Oh, the skateboarder's one.

874
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,160
There's an image to conjure for you,

875
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,000
ladies and gentlemen. If you can join

876
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,760
in here in the blasphemy, we got

877
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,900
Blasphemy 49 cents a pound. It's available

878
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,660
right now here on your radio, so call

879
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,420
and contribute

880
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,140
your blasphemy right here. Two famous

881
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,900
religious figures in America who were

882
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,960
anti-gay turned out to be gay

883
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,980
this year. Haggard and another guy, his name

884
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,040
I've forgotten. Merle?

885
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,080
Merle did not. Merle

886
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,720
is the last guy to turn out to be gay.

887
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,440
You're going to ruin my

888
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,700
reverence.

889
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,240
I'm down with gays,

890
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,340
but I don't want Merle to be gay.

891
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,760
Merle Haggard may not be gay.

892
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,300
Merle's into truckers, I hear.

893
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,820
Mother truckers.

894
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,320
What I want to know is,

895
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,960
when is the Bishop Joey going to

896
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,460
come out?

897
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,880
Bishop Joey did come out.

898
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,000
He came out last year and got

899
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,060
all wet, so he went back in.

900
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,060
This could be

901
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,460
winter for another six years.

902
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,420
Ladies and gentlemen, he has arrived.

903
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,000
There's no point in putting it off

904
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,020
anymore. He is

905
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,100
in the building. The Reverend

906
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,200
Stang? Yes, and he is about

907
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,000
to join us here on

908
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,120
the radio. The sacred

909
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,840
scribe of the Church of the

910
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,920
Subgenius has arrived. He is in the

911
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,940
building. Our exclusive New Year's

912
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,920
Revolution show.

913
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,160
The alternative apocalypse

914
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,940
won't be long

915
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,980
now. Of the Reverend Stang. Wait for the

916
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,880
next episode.

917
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,700
I washed

918
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,600
the bottom of my shoes every time I

919
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,400
kick Philo's butt.

920
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,960
Don't say

921
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,940
hello. When your

922
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,660
phone stops ringing, you're on the air.

923
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,520
Just go ahead.

924
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
That's our policy. And we're not

925
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,720
changing it now. I'm

926
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,480
hoping that Vice President

927
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,000
Cheney will show up tonight.

928
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,760
Right now he's in the bunker

929
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,560
changing into his thong.

930
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,120
A lot of people saw that thong

931
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,000
a couple years ago. Burning Man, Chick Cheney.

932
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,020
He showed up at the fashion

933
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,060
show at Burning Man a couple years ago.

934
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,820
And he was

935
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,660
conduced by

936
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,120
Dr. Hal, who was emceeing the fashion

937
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,960
show, to get

938
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,600
loose and party down.

939
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,100
And it wound up that Dick Cheney

940
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,500
was wearing a thong.

941
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,920
There were

942
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,100
40,000 people at the time at Burning Man.

943
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,060
Immediately, 20,000 people

944
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,980
left. And they took their

945
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,600
foreskins with them. And they took all their

946
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,400
foreskins with them.

947
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,200
Foreskin, cowcandy.

948
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,000
It isn't the one. You're still gonna get wet.

949
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,120
Kitty.

950
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,020
And baby.

951
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,740
I'm hoping this is it.

952
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,280
The sacred lily.

953
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,640
The sacred lily.

954
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,420
Uh-oh. Infant Philo's here now.

955
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,860
Maybe we could trade

956
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,300
infant Philo to the flying saucers

957
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,240
for a burrito.

958
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,060
A big burrito. One for me.

959
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,020
Not for all of us.

960
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,020
Clear the field.

961
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,040
We're monitoring Philo's child.

962
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,900
We're in constant contact with Philo's

963
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,220
child.

964
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,420
She's as good as on the

965
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,120
planet of the...

966
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,860
Farewell. I'm coming down right now.

967
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,300
Over and out.

968
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,060
See?

969
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,940
Play, double zombies.

970
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,600
Pretty soft.

971
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,980
The Reverend Ivan Stang is in the front.

972
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,280
He's fopping.

973
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,620
I don't know who has the fropp.

974
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,760
We better hand it over fast.

975
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,880
I'm fropless.

976
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,040
The energy.

977
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,740
The force packed in the rock itself.

978
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,700
Oh yeah. We should run home and get it.

979
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,580
We almost turned around and stopped.

980
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,940
Ha ha ha ha ha.

981
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,760
Ha ha ha ha ha.

982
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,380
Ha ha ha ha ha.

983
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,460
So 8484425

984
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,680
talked to a totally naked

985
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,340
Bishop Joey. That's right. Bishop Joey.

986
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,280
Oh my god, he is naked!

987
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,280
Seminal and secular head of the First Church of the Last Laugh

988
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,040
World's Fast-growing, Snack of Religion, 100% of his dog

989
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,740
religion, Light of Religion, One Holy Day a Year, and today is

990
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,060
an April 1st. He's here and he's naked.

991
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,460
And he's sitting right here and he can talk to you.

992
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,180
Somebody get a sanitary wipe

993
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,540
for that chair. No, it's okay.

994
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,740
It'll clean up really nice when we

995
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,220
hose down the studio at the end of the

996
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,300
show at 5 in the morning.

997
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,720
So talk to Bishop Joey now

998
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,060
before he is not talkable.

999
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,720
Any questions you have...

1000
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,960
What is he doing to the microphone?

1001
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,980
Oh, let me rub it.

1002
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,040
Let me rub it right here. I got a little itch. Oh, I got an itch.

1003
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,100
Let me scratch it right... Oh, does

1004
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,400
that feel good. So, talk to

1005
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,620
a totally naked Bishop Joey. That's right.

1006
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,240
And any question, any thing,

1007
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,640
any subject, I don't know.

1008
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,180
I got an answer for you.

1009
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,100
After careful study of the Bible,

1010
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,020
Reverend

1011
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,280
William Miller thought that

1012
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,960
the end was 1834.

1013
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,560
Tuesday.

1014
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,680
He changed his mind and decided it was 1836.

1015
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,260
Then he recalculated it and found that it

1016
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,080
was 1843 in the month of

1017
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,000
April. There used to be six to choose from.

1018
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,160
This was to prove one of the biggest events of the end time

1019
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,260
calendar. When April

1020
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,140
came and Miller set to work on a new

1021
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,120
date. Miller's brave

1022
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,300
new choice, March 21st,

1023
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,320
1844, for the end of the world.

1024
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,280
The Millerites waited in droves

1025
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,500
and high vantage points in special ascension

1026
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,080
robes for the expected

1027
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,140
end. Hysteria reigned.

1028
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,000
People sold up farms and homes.

1029
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,420
But still, frustratingly,

1030
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,000
the end did not come. They were not

1031
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,120
persistent. The Church of the Subgenius

1032
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,840
will not give up on the end of the world.

1033
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,420
Order your end of the world now.

1034
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:27,780
We will

1035
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,140
specially deliver it to you.

1036
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,620
That will be done.

1037
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,220
Personalized.

1038
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,500
I can take care of it.

1039
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,800
When would you like the end of the world?

1040
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,460
We'll deliver.

1041
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,480
It is closed society.

1042
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,420
45 caliber end of the world.

1043
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,500
Oh, it's magic.

1044
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,180
Everything we don't understand is magic.

1045
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:49,780
Hold on.

1046
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,120
I show Panteneve outbound

1047
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,180
at 1205 Zulu.

1048
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,260
Providence control wants to know where is he.

1049
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,540
Panteneve 262.

1050
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,240
Who's got him?

1051
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:01,400
Panteneve?

1052
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:01,760


1053
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,060
...

1054
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,720
...

1055
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,440
A prophet in Latvia predicted

1056
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,400
the end of the world for 1920.

1057
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,420
His followers believed with such fervor

1058
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,220
that they dug graves and waited

1059
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,860
beside them for the end.

1060
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,320
Some may still be there.

1061
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,500
The computer got to control you.

1062
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,560
...

1063
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,060
...

1064
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,600
...

1065
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,260
...

1066
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,620
...

1067
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,180
...

1068
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:31,980
...

1069
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,000
...

1070
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,000


1071
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,020
...

1072
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,040
...

1073
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,040


1074
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,040


1075
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
... ...

1076
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,560
...

1077
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,080
...

1078
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,420
...

1079
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,400
...

1080
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,480
...

1081
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,920
...

1082
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,040
...

1083
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,940
...

1084
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,000
...

1085
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,020
...

1086
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,340
...

1087
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:00,360
...

1088
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,540
Mine she has, and in my mind she was mine, too.

1089
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,020
No, she's...

1090
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,660
All those long legs.

1091
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,260
I'm tired of Humphrey Bogart scaring me, so...

1092
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,340
I have to take on Grace Jones, my alien lover.

1093
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
Grace Jones.

1094
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,580
Grace Jones.

1095
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:22,260
If he's your sweetheart's sweetheart, then the end of the world is nigh.

1096
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,200
Because there's no justice, my friend.

1097
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,980
I don't know about any of that, but I know who my lover is.

1098
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,880
And she's a wonderful priestess.

1099
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,820
She's a goddess.

1100
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,720
She's a teacher.

1101
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,520
She is just magical.

1102
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah, uh-huh.

1103
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,500
Well, she...

1104
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:39,860
Go ahead.

1105
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,100
You know, if you make of her a magical object and put her picture on the wall

1106
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:50,020
and prostrate yourself before it, she becomes magical for you.

1107
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,340
Well, she is actually on the wall, not a picture.

1108
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,640
She is actually hanging on the wall right now.

1109
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,040
Oh, dear.

1110
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
Just like in...

1111
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,780
In the police.

1112
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,160
In the police, no?

1113
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,540
Oops, sorry.

1114
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,660
Sounds uncomfortable anyway.

1115
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,080
You didn't thumbtack her to the wall, did you?

1116
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,860
She's skinny enough you could use thumbtacks.

1117
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,040
Oh, she's still alive.

1118
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,200
Yeah, but don't forget, she might actually be magic.

1119
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:18,340
Yeah, Grace Jones, you know, there is a kind of Aoife sort of vibe coming out of her.

1120
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,140
No, it's easy to say.

1121
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,600
I know why you're saying it, but she actually could be magic.

1122
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,360
You understand me?

1123
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,880
Well, she is.

1124
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,200
No, no, I know it's easy to say that.

1125
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,400
Right, I know, yeah.

1126
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,360
She's a macaroni and cheese for dinner, too.

1127
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:30,880
Yeah.

1128
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:38,600
There were, you know, many of the great performers, you know, were in fact shamanistic.

1129
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,700
Jim Morrison and Grace Jones sometimes.

1130
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,040
There were, she had her shamanistic moments.

1131
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,940
She is a shamanistic moment, just like my macaroni and cheese.

1132
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,780
You've got sacred macaroni and cheese.

1133
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,140
You're spending an evening at home with your family.

1134
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,380
Oh, I love it.

1135
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,960
Macaroni and cheese is the best.

1136
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,100
It's like my peyote, my personal peyote, but it's macaroni and cheese.

1137
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,420
Suddenly, without warning, the great product.

1138
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:07,920
Excuse me.

1139
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,880
Macaroni and cheese could be mind-altering, probably treated.

1140
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,780
Well, I believe it is mind-altering.

1141
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:22,720
And if you look close enough at anything, I don't think acid anymore.

1142
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,880
But when I was a teenager, about 19 years old, I occasionally did.

1143
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,660
And I remember looking at a pile of noodles.

1144
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,200
What are you saying?

1145
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,500
No, it was rice.

1146
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,220
A pile of rice.

1147
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,360
No, no, not you, him.

1148
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:34,880
A pile of rice.

1149
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,040
And it was, and it was, good Lord!

1150
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,880
A manifestation from the other side, the Reverend Stang.

1151
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,920
It's so good to see you.

1152
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,400
Did you say if you could explain one thing at a time, you'd get more out of it?

1153
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,300
Is that what you said?

1154
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,100
Are you sure?

1155
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,360
It's Don Hagenbrenner.

1156
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,360
Oh, wait, I can do it.

1157
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,080
John Sherlin.

1158
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,640
John Sherlin Brenner.

1159
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,360
Who's that?

1160
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:01,520
I think it's about time for another ginger ale, so I will meet you on the flip side at the zoo.

1161
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,560
Okay, okay.

1162
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,600
You want to drink that crap, go right ahead.

1163
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,180
Rice.

1164
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,420
I drink club soda.

1165
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,560
I hallucinated that it was an eternal plate of rice.

1166
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,580
That's what happened.

1167
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,140
The Reverend Stang is here.

1168
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,200
That feels so much better.

1169
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,980
Stang from Cleveland.

1170
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,340
He's just made himself, he just found another way to introduce himself.

1171
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,580
I'm going to give you slack with a belch.

1172
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,280
That wasn't me.

1173
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,620
We understand you've been sucking all the slack, Stang.

1174
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,460
Explain.

1175
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,560
We're trying to understand why Cleveland is such a violent place.

1176
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:42,360
And one theory is that you get so much slack, people there are stressed out and begin to kill each other.

1177
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:49,260
No, actually, the new subgenius headquarters is not in Cleveland at all, but in Cleveland Heights.

1178
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,360
The slack is rotten.

1179
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:55,140
Which sacrifices the slack of the rest of Cleveland.

1180
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,680
I live in Cleveland for its own extremely low crime rate.

1181
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,560
I live in a kind of a little enclosed fortress.

1182
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,880
The slacker mansion, we call it.

1183
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,360
So what, Texas is just on its own now, right?

1184
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:08,960
Sorry.

1185
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,580
Actually, when I go to Texas, I just came from there.

1186
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,320
The desolate flats of Texas.

1187
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,160
It rains.

1188
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,560
It rains if I visit Texas.

1189
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,040
When I leave.

1190
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,980
It stops raining.

1191
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,640
It didn't rain for a year.

1192
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,360
At least not in Stang County, unfortunately.

1193
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,500
Until we understand it.

1194
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,620
Some parts of Texas got the Katrina.

1195
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,260
That's right.

1196
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,280
What was this?

1197
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,240
Time check, everyone.

1198
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:51,540
So there was like a locus of global warming, a cell of global warming settled over the state after you left.

1199
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,660
Well, when we had to flee Texas.

1200
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:05,080
We placed a curse upon the benighted state of Texas that there would be no rain until such time as we returned.

1201
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,280
What kind of vehicle did you flee Texas in?

1202
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,240
I'm curious.

1203
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,480
United Airlines in this case.

1204
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,860
But he drove it on the freeway.

1205
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,300
That was the curious thing.

1206
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,160
You got to Cleveland without a car?

1207
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,120
People had to drive off the road to let the 747 drive by.

1208
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,500
He thought it was a car.

1209
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:23,940
No.

1210
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:29,860
When we fled Texas to Cleveland, we went in a series of covered wagons across the prairie.

1211
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,360
We faced many hardships, droughts, locusts, plagues.

1212
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,440
Those were the old steam wagons.

1213
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:36,840
Rednecks.

1214
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:37,900
Yeah.

1215
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,500
Well, no.

1216
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,780
We were the rednecks.

1217
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,420
All right.

1218
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:41,800
All right.

1219
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,620
It's all relative.

1220
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,040
Oh, it's a tale to make the Mormons cringe.

1221
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,500
The exodus from Texas.

1222
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,720
That kind of has what rhymes, kind of a ring to it.

1223
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,660
Exodus from Texas.

1224
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,920
Exodus from Texas.

1225
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,320
From Texas.

1226
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,080
Texas.

1227
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,160
Reverend Stang, I have a press release from the Church of the Subgenus.

1228
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,220
Can I ask you about this?

1229
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,400
I heard you reading that in the limo on the way here.

1230
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,380
And I thought to myself, that sounds like a Reverend Motormat press release.

1231
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,060
The church is inviting all of its members worldwide to gather together for the final

1232
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,480
hours in Sherman, New York from Thursday, 28th of July.

1233
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,080
Thursday, July 5th at a clothing optional outdoor campground.

1234
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,120
Very interested to read, the church has been engaged in a massive recruitment campaign

1235
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,880
to increase the numbers of its membership for the arrival of the exodus.

1236
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,900
It is seeking performers and producers from the adult entertainment industry.

1237
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,580
Yeah, that's right.

1238
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:50,860
We have a new adult film festival award ceremony that just started last year.

1239
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:51,880
It's...

1240
00:49:51,880 --> 00:50:01,120
And, you know, it's just a way to broaden the artistic reach of the church and also

1241
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,660
to get a certain amount of attention if you think about it, you know.

1242
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:13,300
And a lot of the saints of the church have been workers in the, shall we say, sex industry.

1243
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:20,760
Kitten Atividad, the great saint, Kitten Atividad, John Holmes and some of the other

1244
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,820
performers.

1245
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,080
Right.

1246
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,880
Saint Wad.

1247
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,560
The giants, you might say.

1248
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,680
Especially the plumbers.

1249
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,200
Yeah.

1250
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:33,460
I have a special place in my heart, a very large hole in my heart where the plumbers

1251
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:33,620
sit.

1252
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,480
Yeah, and it's still dripping through that hole, isn't it?

1253
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,480
Oh, yes.

1254
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,460
I feel the undisplended.

1255
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,460
I got some discharge.

1256
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,300
I'm a monster.

1257
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:47,900
So, July 5th, it's all coming to an end and it does every year, basically.

1258
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:48,740
Well, every year.

1259
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,380
We have a new apocalypse every year.

1260
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,860
And in my opinion, my opinion is that the apocalypse is coming to an end.

1261
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:51,860


1262
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:51,860


1263
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:51,860


1264
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:51,860


1265
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:51,860


1266
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:51,860


1267
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:51,860


1268
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,040
My theory is that other people who predict the end of the world, I read a list of them.

1269
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,840
You might have heard some of them.

1270
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,320
Yeah, we did.

1271
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,100
I heard that on the way in.

1272
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:03,000
Other people are not diligent enough about bringing about the end of the world and predicting

1273
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,780
the end of the world.

1274
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,100
And the church of the subgenius has to be praised for its persistence.

1275
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,400
It will not give up.

1276
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,780
Oh, our faith is absolute.

1277
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:18,960
The aliens, the exes, will arrive on July 5th, 1998, which obviously has not arrived

1278
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,240
yet.

1279
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,820
Bob said that date.

1280
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,180
Therefore, that date has not yet arrived.

1281
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,580
It was a typo.

1282
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,300
It was upside down.

1283
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:27,920
It's a typo.

1284
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,480
There's been this whole tampering with calendars, which is pretty obvious.

1285
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,820
I mean, come on.

1286
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,700
I noticed...

1287
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,620
We don't know what year this is.

1288
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,480
We don't even know what planet.

1289
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,620
The numbers seem to swim around when I look at them.

1290
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,680
When I look at my calendar, the numbers seem to wobble and swim.

1291
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,580
But then everything else is...

1292
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,220
Oh, everybody's sorry.

1293
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:49,220


1294
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,440
Oh, everybody's so sure that this is the year 2007.

1295
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,760
Oh, everybody's so sure this is planet Earth.

1296
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,160
Oh, yeah, it's planet Earth.

1297
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,100
No, it's not.

1298
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,260
It's not.

1299
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,080
You're right, Ivan.

1300
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,220
This is not planet Earth.

1301
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,200
It's just what we named it.

1302
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,200
That doesn't mean it is planet Earth.

1303
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,660
We don't know what the name of this planet is.

1304
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,420
Somebody's going to come and tell us the name one day.

1305
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,060
Oh, you mean...

1306
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,020
Our whole reality is...

1307
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:11,460
Sportnik?

1308
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,920
We named everything.

1309
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,240
Our reality is based on a house of cards, a teetering...

1310
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:18,880
Back in our favor.

1311
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,220
...editor.

1312
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,900
...physic, could fall any time because it's built on a bunch of hooey.

1313
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,760
Yes, I'll say it.

1314
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,300
Hooey.

1315
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,660
Hooey is what it's built...

1316
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:26,960
Hooey.

1317
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,000
...foundation of hooey.

1318
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,560
A bunch of hoo-ha.

1319
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,000
Look at that.

1320
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,640
Chicken just won.

1321
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,440
Who's playing...

1322
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:33,660
2007.

1323
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,240
Two and seven means...

1324
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,260
Who's playing that song way down low?

1325
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:36,960
...after we gather it's nine.

1326
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,940
Maybe it's the year nine.

1327
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,240
Hooey!

1328
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,620
Everybody be quiet a minute.

1329
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,100
Hang on.

1330
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:40,900
1998 is...

1331
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,400
This is a test.

1332
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,040
Hang on.

1333
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,180
Who is playing that song way down low?

1334
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,020
Who's playing that?

1335
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,600
Anybody here?

1336
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,040
No.

1337
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,960
Really?

1338
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:48,460
No.

1339
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,600
What the hell is that?

1340
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,540
I don't know.

1341
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,000
It's like some 70s power band.

1342
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,020
Wait, who would expect some kind of random weird noise in the background on this show?

1343
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,760
It's some kind of radio show going on under ours.

1344
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,340
It's a radio show.

1345
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,060
It sounds like...

1346
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,060
I heard some Phineas...

1347
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:04,580
It's country music.

1348
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,020
Could you just download Phineas Narco?

1349
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,340
Hooey!

1350
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,460
I heard that for a second.

1351
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:08,980
Hooey!

1352
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,900
It was a reference to Phineas Narco.

1353
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,420
Hooey!

1354
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:12,660
Hooey!

1355
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:12,860
Hooey!

1356
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,160
Hooey!

1357
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:13,340
Hooey!

1358
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,000
Hooey!

1359
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:14,060


1360
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,140
Hooey!

1361
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:23,960
Hooey!

1362
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,460
Hooey!

1363
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:25,820
Hooey!

1364
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:25,980


1365
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,420
Hooey!

1366
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,200
Hooey!

1367
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:27,460
Hooey!

1368
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1369
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1370
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1371
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1372
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1373
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1374
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1375
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1376
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1377
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1378
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,460


1379
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,720
No!

1380
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:28,840
You're not名ing me?

1381
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:28,840


1382
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,060
But I'm not...

1383
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,320
Let me prove it for you.

1384
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,720
You're not...

1385
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,200
I don't know who you are.

1386
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,300
You're not Phineas Narco.

1387
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,440
Okay, that's then you're correct.

1388
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:44,360
I'm not Phineas Narco...

1389
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:46,780
Right?

1390
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,560
It sounds like Judy Collins.

1391
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,420
How could that be happening?

1392
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,560
I think it's a ghost of a folk song show that was in this KPFA studio.

1393
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,200
Oh!

1394
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,220
It's puzzling evidence who just isn't even here.

1395
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,300
He just turned something on and left the room with this.

1396
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,320
I can't imagine something like that.

1397
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,920
Let him listen to this in the background, he said.

1398
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,820
What is he even playing this for?

1399
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:20,500
He's out fropinating and subjecting us to folk music.

1400
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,100
Folk music!

1401
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,100
All right, listen to that.

1402
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,020
Blessed silence there in folk music.

1403
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,280
It always feels better when you turn it off.

1404
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,540
Go ahead and do it.

1405
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,380
Okay.

1406
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,180
Trust me.

1407
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,020
Ow!

1408
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,200
I win.

1409
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,620
I win every time.

1410
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,280
Wet head.

1411
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,220
Towel off.

1412
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:37,660
No way.

1413
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:45,900
1-0-8-4-8-4-4-2-5.

1414
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,560
Is that what you heard?

1415
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:46,920
That's what this is?

1416
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,480
Maybe that's what year this is.

1417
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,380
What year is it?

1418
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,540
If it's not 2007, what year is it?

1419
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,460
If you missed that first number, this is it.

1420
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,560
5.

1421
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:57,740
That's it.

1422
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,140
It's the year 5.

1423
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:09,400
1-0-8-4-8-4-4-2-5.

1424
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,840
And tell us what time it is where you're at.

1425
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,260
And tell us where you're at.

1426
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,260
And tell us what they call where you're at.

1427
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,300
And if you're Chinese, it's a different year.

1428
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,540
That's not the real Francis Deck.

1429
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,540
That is an imposter deck.

1430
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:25,840
Oh, it's not?

1431
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,660
No, that's not the real deck.

1432
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:27,740
That's right.

1433
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,780
I read about this.

1434
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,800
A guy at a radio station remade his text.

1435
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,260
Right.

1436
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:32,580
Yeah.

1437
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:39,800
Yeah, the true Francis Deck would never have been able to enunciate those words so well.

1438
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,560
No, that's what I figured.

1439
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,460
It's probably better that it isn't.

1440
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,120
What about...

1441
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,320
Students in the...

1442
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:52,000
Maybe Logic University course in the subgenius history, the first 100 years...

1443
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,260
Yes, I have it right here.

1444
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,660
...are able to download the original Francis Deck texts.

1445
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,500
Did he ever read his own text?

1446
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,820
I don't know.

1447
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:06,900
But I did get a copy of the original things that he would staple onto telephone poles.

1448
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:07,420
Yeah.

1449
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,460
He was able to use every bit of a page like a true visionary always does.

1450
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,360
The corners, everything.

1451
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,440
Yeah, all the corners.

1452
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,500
He would type until the thing was full.

1453
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,820
And then put his final thoughts along the margins.

1454
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,040
Ah, ah.

1455
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,860
But what about this?

1456
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,340
What about the back?

1457
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,940
Well, we don't know.

1458
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,300
You didn't turn it over?

1459
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,360
You get a valuable document like that and you don't even turn it over?

1460
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,760
Well, we got Xeroxes and you can't tell which is page one or page two of a Francis Deck rant.

1461
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,340
There's two-sided Xeroxes now.

1462
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,320
Come on.

1463
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,520
Yeah, sure.

1464
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,840
Now, yeah, sure.

1465
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,200
This was in the day, man.

1466
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,480
Back in the past.

1467
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,040
What day?

1468
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,100
A thousand years ago.

1469
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,680
When the Church of the Subgenius was first inspired...

1470
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,680
When was he doing this?

1471
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,440
Early 80s?

1472
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,320
Is that right?

1473
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,660
Francis Deck?

1474
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:52,000
Yeah.

1475
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:56,940
I got my Xerox in the early 80s, yes.

1476
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,320
1982.

1477
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,020
That's him.

1478
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,240
Testing, testing.

1479
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:16,600
Now, the person reading the Deck text is J.R.

1480
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:16,760
Buck.

1481
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,540
Bob Dobbs.

1482
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:17,860
Of course.

1483
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,480
I knew that.

1484
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,460
Is this thing on?

1485
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:20,480
Yes.

1486
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,840
But listen, that guy in San Francisco, do you know the guy who's putting out the, what is it,

1487
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,020
the set of CDs called, from Monster God Computer, Communist Monster God Computer, something,

1488
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,880
that's his label, and he's putting out all these outtakes and bloopers and people freaking out.

1489
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,060
Gosh, what an idea.

1490
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,420
Celebrity bloopers.

1491
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,280
But his label is named the Mad Conspiracy Computer, whatever, Communist God thing.

1492
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,260
That's his label.

1493
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,760
So I wondered if it was the same guy.

1494
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,500
He's not going to die by any chance.

1495
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,280
Is Deck dead?

1496
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,220
Yes.

1497
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:49,920
Oh, good.

1498
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,900
Yes, and in fact, some lads from Dallas went and videotaped him on his deathbed in a cruel

1499
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,100
mockery of his condition.

1500
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,700
Wow, I'm glad somebody did.

1501
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,700
I'm not really aware of Deck.

1502
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,500
It's a pretty boring video.

1503
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,440
Do you have any tapes of him or something?

1504
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:06,980
That was him.

1505
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,680
That was him.

1506
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:07,920
That was him ranting.

1507
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,360
That was someone reading the rants of Francis Deck.

1508
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,620
This is his writing.

1509
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,080
Living dead Frankenstein slavery.

1510
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,480
This is his writing.

1511
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,940
He's not reading with someone pretending to be him.

1512
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,580
Well, if you listen to it, it applies today.

1513
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,100
Actually, he's right about that.

1514
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,860
He was like Nostradamus.

1515
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,900
It's quite amazing.

1516
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,840
Only a lot more specific.

1517
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:30,040
I mean, this is from the early 80s, and I'm still playing it, which shows you how relevant

1518
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,700
it still is after all this time.

1519
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,600
What if it had been 20 years later?

1520
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,340
Oh, not you, Gary.

1521
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:42,960
The man made inside out planets with nucleonic powered speeds much faster than the speed

1522
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,360
of light.

1523
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,760
Look up and see.

1524
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,460
The gangster computer guy.

1525
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,500
I've concocted new fake starry skies.

1526
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,300
The worldwide completely controlled deadly degenerative climate.

1527
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,040
It's like an anticipation of the Matrix concept.

1528
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:02,620
Well, Alex Jones certainly has some explaining to do with Mr. Francis Deck.

1529
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,060
He asked me.

1530
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,860
Alex Jones.

1531
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,780
Phony stars.

1532
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,640
Phony stars.

1533
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,700
He says that.

1534
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,680
I can say lots of things.

1535
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,520
Toonific.

1536
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,540
Parentheses.

1537
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,280
Parentheses.

1538
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:16,460
Parentheses.

1539
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:16,460


1540
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:16,460


1541
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:16,460


1542
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,280
Girl Tarot.

1543
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,320
Sing not branch.

1544
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:25,640
You have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, a 1080 episode, which

1545
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:31,640
happens to be from the puzzling evidence and over the edge shows reprinted from KPFA and

1546
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:31,860
Berkeley.

1547
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:37,500
Friends, if you want more information about the Church of the Subgenius, see subgenius.com.
