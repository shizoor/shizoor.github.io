1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,640
It was in the year of 1982 that spacemen first discovered the great galactic barrier.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,780
In the past ten years, rocket travel to the moon and the mirror planets had become commonplace.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,100
And yet, the explorers refused to admit defeat.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,420
It was on June the 2nd, 1987, that the rocket Starcloud made ready for takeoff.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,200
Now hear this! Now hear this!

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,440
The Self Genius! Our own self!

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,920
Don't bother me for a while, I'm busy!

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,860
Stupid idiot.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,420
We'll have to reintegrate the whole works!

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,300
Prepare to blast off.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,460
Four, three, zero.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,660
Fire up number one cyclotron.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,380
Number one ready.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
Fire up number two.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,300
Number two ready.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,840
I think that's rubbish.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,200
What do you think?

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,480
Oh, I think it's terrible.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,400
At least it won't be boring.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,940
God, this is weird.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,860
We'll do it anyway.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,000
Friends, welcome to the Starwood 39.5 Subgenius Devival.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,340
But before we get started,

24
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,500
I hope that we can all kind of bow our heads

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:35,300
and have a respectful, sober moment of sacred noise!

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,600
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Yes, friends, thanks for coming.

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,700
Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.

29
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,620
Said someone named Simone Wheel.

30
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,860
You're very generous to pay attention to me.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,220
I'm just assuming that you are.

32
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,580
Probably half of you smoking reefers and stuff.

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,480
I can't do this from my giant pulpit

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,580
because we left that in storage at Wisteria

35
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,380
with that shipping container that we share with our sister cult, Ace.

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,460
So it's just my desk.

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,860
But I've got the same video projection in the background.

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,520
We're...

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,700
We're in deepest rural north central Texas

40
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,120
on a goat ranch just outside of a really small,

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,140
weird Twin Peaks-like town called Glen Rose.

42
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,580
But I've been at Starwood.

43
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,640
I've actually been attending, like I do in regular Starwoods,

44
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,240
lurking in that my wife has had it on

45
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,140
right behind me on the other side of the room.

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,380
Princess Wee has been hosting things at Starwoods

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,820
and going to workshops and stuff.

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,760
So I've heard a whole bunch of those, a whole lot of it.

49
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,780
It's been kind of fun.

50
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,420
It's strangely realistic, isn't it?

51
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,960
We had that experience at the Virtual X Day.

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,820
It's like the standing around in the middle of the road talking

53
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,640
part of the festival, which is really, I think, everybody's favorite part.

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,060
Sitting around the campfires and talking.

55
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,860
I mean, the music shows and presentations are fun,

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,300
but really, I think what everybody's really paying for is,

57
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,060
is to see their friends.

58
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,420
And you can do that without the sweating and the ticks.

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,700
The Matrix isn't that bad, I guess.

60
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,220
You can still have that lobster dinner in the Matrix.

61
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,540
And it's great to be at the almost 40th Starwood,

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,240
the weirdest Starwood because of the lack of sweating and mud.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,720
Maybe some of you guys have mud.

64
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,680
We have the heat.

65
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,040
All I've got to do is open the window,

66
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,580
and it's going to be 103 degrees in here,

67
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,560
just like the real Starwood.

68
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,700
It's also, by the way, friends,

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,380
this is the 40th anniversary of the Church of the Subgenius beginning outreach,

70
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,360
the first public reveal of Church of the Subgenius.

71
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,360
We printed the first pamphlet in January of 1980.

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,660
So it's 40 years for Starwood, 40 years for Church of the Subgenius,

73
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,420
and I believe 40 years for Burning Man,

74
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,400
which also started at the same time as a weird little party.

75
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,080
God, when I was 10 years old,

76
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,460
I couldn't believe how long it took to get to be 10 years old.

77
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,420
And now I can't believe how quickly I reached 66.

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,700
In fact, it seems a little faster than the first 10 years.

79
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,080
And we're still doing X-Day.

80
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,660
This year we had to rupture in place, friends.

81
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,320
Our original plan was to have it on a cruise ship,

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,220
but we couldn't book one in time.

83
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,180
It would have been packed.

84
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,720
It would have been perfect.

85
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,400
The cruise ship X-Day.

86
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,720
What a concept.

87
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,540
But instead we provided a fully expense-paid trip to X-Day

88
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,220
right in your own home.

89
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,280
We let a thousand little X-Days bloom.

90
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,620
Because we know that if we,

91
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,700
we who joined the Church formally with that little $35 stipend,

92
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,160
that therefore the men from Planet X have our money.

93
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,420
We have our addresses.

94
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,640
I certainly have everybody's address.

95
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,000
So despite the COVID and everything,

96
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,760
we laughed till our lungs bled anyway.

97
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,940
Isn't that charming?

98
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,540
We even managed to have a big burning bob.

99
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,100
At X-Day's usually we don't have a giant bonfire like Starwood.

100
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,880
In fact, we don't really know the secret of fire.

101
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,160
We are reliant on the pagans to start.

102
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,220
But this time we had a full life-size,

103
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,680
very realistic Dobbs dummy nailed to a huge wooden icon

104
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,480
surrounded by little funny signs that were put together by Hypercube.

105
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,160
And explosions.

106
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,180
Man, when he set that thing on fire,

107
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,760
there were explosions and huge flames.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,660
And it wasn't until I saw his home movies the next day

109
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,440
that I realized it was a miniature set.

110
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,400
It was a skillfully done miniature using forced perspective to make it.

111
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,620
It fooled me.

112
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,520
Of course, I'm, you know, we didn't call it Church of the Genius.

113
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,340
Anyway, friends, Bob preaches Slack and he leads by example,

114
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,040
which is why he's not here.

115
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,640
And I'm the one who has to work.

116
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,080
But besides preaching Slack, he also provided warnings.

117
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,040
He's been warning us that all this was going to happen since 1953.

118
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,020
In fact, his most succinct and true prophecy was,

119
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,840
it's going to be a bummer, man.

120
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,460
Bob said in 1953, it's going to be a bummer, man.

121
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,240
Can anyone argue with that?

122
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,080
I mean, aside from the fact that everybody says, dude, I mean, bro, bro, whatever nowadays,

123
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,480
instead of man.

124
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,460
And in the interim, every year we thought it couldn't get any worse.

125
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,240
You know, Nixon.

126
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,380
Oh, God, couldn't get any worse than this.

127
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,360
Reagan, the Reagan years.

128
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,120
Most corrupt administration.

129
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,120
Almost everybody he hired went to jail.

130
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,080
Oh, God, couldn't get any worse than this.

131
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,280
Then Emperor Bush the first.

132
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,380
Then the other Bush.

133
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,060
And I'm like, oh, God.

134
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,660
Some people would have to gripe about poor old Carter and poor old Clinton and Obama.

135
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,300
Poor sad things.

136
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
But couldn't possibly get any.

137
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,200
And now in 2019, a whole lot of us, I heard this all the time last year.

138
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,560
Oh, man, this has been a horrible year.

139
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,160
It's because a lot of our friends died or had tragedies.

140
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,760
And we're going, 2020 is going to be so much better.

141
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,420
Oh, it's going to be great.

142
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,060
Can't possibly get any worse than this.

143
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,760
Now we're at the point where we can almost honestly say, oh, it can't get any worse than this.

144
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,800
I'm afraid old Bob's got a few things up his sleeve yet to come, friends.

145
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
You better be ready.

146
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:37,360
Just as the birds were the only dinosaurs to survive the Cretaceous extinction event,

147
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,020
it kind of figures that the survivors of our current extinction event,

148
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,520
the ones that will evolve into the next tool users,

149
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,280
screw up the world again,

150
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,100
would be buzzards.

151
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,540
The carrion eaters.

152
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,460
Vultures.

153
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,460
That's the next civilization.

154
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,960
The last humans, of course, will be morticians and grave diggers.

155
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,240
But the buzzards will still be around after them.

156
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,080
So, as Bob said for the first time last week,

157
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,400
it sucks to be born every minute.

158
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
As Bizarro Bob said,

159
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,020
all subgeniuses everywhere always get everything they want.

160
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,020
But that was Bizarro Bob.

161
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,560
Bizarro Bob hates slack.

162
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,180
So, yeah, the world's in horrible shape,

163
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,720
and everybody's scared as hell,

164
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,260
and it's in times like these that the Church of the Subgenius makes really pretty good money.

165
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,560
When we announced that our t-shirts could be used like that,

166
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,440
all of a sudden,

167
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,620
we ran out of t-shirts.

168
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,520
And then the t-shirt guy, Reverend Thaddeus,

169
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
started making bandanas.

170
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,900
He was able to make bandanas like that one.

171
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,880
And, oh, God, we just suddenly were rolling in it.

172
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,100
Isn't that ironic, you know?

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,780
They're flying off the shelves,

174
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,080
and we're saving like five to eight souls a day buying memberships.

175
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,440
But, as Bob also said in the pre-scriptures,

176
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,980
there will be a long and hard time of false slack for the masses.

177
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,540
Now, I got to thinking about Bob's prophecies,

178
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,760
and it's been a long time since I looked at the Dateline for Dominance in Book of the Subgenius.

179
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,800
And this morning I got it out,

180
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,520
because I used to think, well, these weren't very accurate.

181
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,120
It seemed we didn't have the years right,

182
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,420
and a lot of the things that we predicted didn't happen that we know of.

183
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:52,320
But, I was shocked to see just how accurate they are for this year.

184
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,380
These were all written down in 1981, okay, or 82,

185
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,060
when the first edition of Book of the Subgenius came out.

186
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,600
These are all predictions from that time.

187
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:14,280
Creationism and school prayer upheld in major court decision as legitimate science.

188
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,660
That seemed like science fiction back then, didn't it?

189
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,280
Highest unemployment rate in U.S. history under Prez clone.

190
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,400
False slack.

191
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,220
That's just the very beginning. It gets sweatier here.

192
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:38,000
President Watt commits racial slurs against Jews, blacks, other mutants.

193
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,500
Impeached.

194
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,420
President Watt.

195
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,800
Just only the name was wrong.

196
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,380
What the f*** happened there?

197
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,120
Econocataclysm worsens.

198
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,620
This one's a little late.

199
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,120
Black rogue subgenius runs for president.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,220
Embarrasses conspiracy.

201
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,640
I guess that one happened a while back.

202
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:06,380
Full frontal drugs and nudity featured in top detective TV shows.

203
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,920
That's been going on for years now.

204
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,100
But it all seemed impossible in the 80s.

205
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,680
Reagan Prez clone re-elected ends all aid to poor.

206
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,620
Mines harbors of non-American countries.

207
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:37,920
A pink black woman almost becomes vice president but is discredited when it's revealed that she posed nude for Penthouse.

208
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,860
Severe toxic waste crisis in U.S.

209
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,920
adds to decimation of citizen trust in government.

210
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:57,540
Prez clone uses pop fantasy movie catch phrases to describe insane space defense program.

211
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,020
We were ahead of our time, baby.

212
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,160
Well, Bob was.

213
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,660
America suffers massive economic collapse.

214
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,840
Although it is called a drug porn era.

215
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,420
Crackdown.

216
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:21,100
Prez clone conditions public with all-American He-Man characters in media.

217
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:30,840
Then bombs Mid-East City and thus squelches terrifying reports on acid rain growing ozone layer hole.

218
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,260
Well, this is actually kind of, some of this is old news.

219
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,800
It's all illustrated, you see.

220
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,160
Gotta keep it moving or the bobs will eat it.

221
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,960
Civilization literally falling apart.

222
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,900
That was predicted for 1988.

223
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,660
A third sex is added to the human race.

224
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,600
Boy, I guess we had no idea how many more there were than three.

225
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:07,720
American voters deliberately install all-powerful dictator as last hope for restoring order.

226
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,880
Plague created by recombinant DNA research.

Decimates 10% of world population.

228
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,140
Civilized people losing faith in modern medicine.

229
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,680
Traveling medicine shows hawking wonder drugs.

230
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,360
Miracle cures.

231
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,680
Psychic healing.

232
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,220
Replaced scientific medicine.

233
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,280
Synthetic food wars.

234
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,920
We didn't even know the term GMO back then.

235
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,660
Much less Wonder Burger or whatever it is.

236
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,560
The American dictator is now identified by the church as the anti-bob.

237
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,720
Bulletproof robots run most convenience stores.

238
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,920
Average human lifespan is now figured at 40 years.

239
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,820
If you average in the, or winning COVID rates, that may be true.

240
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,320
20% of US population now considered clinically insane.

241
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,060
Actually, it's more like 36%.

242
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,880
Ozone layer depleted.

243
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,720
Earth unshielded from harmful radiation.

244
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,800
Greenhouse effect begins to accelerate.

245
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,060
Average world temperature up 15 degrees.

246
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,700
Life on Earth stands a very good chance of being wiped out.

247
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,940
And that's just without X-Day.

248
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,780
Return of the 7-day work week and 14-hour work day.

249
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,140
Also known as work at home.

250
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,860
What we now call lunatic fringe kooks account for 43% of the US population.

251
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,180
Oh, okay, that caught up.

252
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,460
The Fifth Civil War.

253
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,620
Abnormals versus normals.

254
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,520
Glaciers start melting.

255
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,720
Drought, mutation, environmental problems, and pestilence.

256
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,260
Worse than already critical world famine.

257
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:10,200
Anti-bob now runs global congress, lording it over all aspects of ruined planet.

258
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,940
Terrorist tourism fad for the rich.

259
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,880
School teachers now regularly tortured in school by students.

260
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,460
Plague of mutant insects.

261
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,920
Murder wasps, anyone?

262
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,060
So, oh, drug abuse religions cropping up.

263
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,560
So there you go, friends.

264
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,400
It's all here in the book of the subgenius.

265
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,120
On sale at our swag table over there.

266
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,580
Just go see Princess Weir, Steve Siddic...

267
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,080
Oh, wait.

268
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,820
No, subgenius.com.

269
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,620
Our swag table.

270
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,980
It's air conditioned.

271
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,740
All right.

272
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,720
Now, I'll tell the story of how I infiltrated the profile movement.

273
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,800
And I'm kind of surprised they haven't copped that name yet.

274
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,400
I made that up.

275
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
I was thinking...

276
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,300
Well, it came in the course of this report, actually.

277
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:25,500
To infiltrate profile, all I had to do was move to this small rural Texas town and get on the local Facebook pages.

278
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,460
Which I really used to like.

279
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:37,140
At first, I mean, a couple of years ago, the Facebook page for Glen Rose, Texas was mostly,

280
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,440
Here's my dog.

281
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,280
He's lost.

282
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
If anybody sees him, can you return him?

283
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,500
Or pictures of dogs saying, hey, we found this dog on our property.

284
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,920
Whose dog is this?

285
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,080
It always had a happy ending.

286
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,820
The dog always got found.

287
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,080
I helped find a dog.

288
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,400
And menus of the little restaurants and things around here.

289
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,280
It was about the best place to get...

290
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,340
What was that explosion?

291
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,420
You couldn't...

292
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,460
They wouldn't tell you on the news or the radio.

293
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,520
You'd ask on Facebook.

294
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,860
Oh, it's just over there.

295
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,100
Oh, it's just over there.

296
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,580
The dirt factory there, they had a little accident.

297
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,200
It's okay.

298
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,100
This is a very, very, very conservative, pretty small town.

299
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,440
It is actually a tourist destination, but otherwise it's pretty out of the way.

300
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,100
Now, my Facebook friends are mostly...

301
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,700
I don't want to use that word again.

302
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,120
Well, liberals.

303
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,080
Or, you know, whatever.

304
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:45,140
Not exactly pro-fa or anti-fa either, necessarily.

305
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,920
Well, actually, that's just philosophy, right?

306
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,940
It's not really a...

307
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,920
Where's the anti-fa P.O. box?

308
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,720
Who's the Bob of anti-fa?

309
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,220
They don't even have a face like Anonymous does.

310
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,880
You know, at least Anonymous has a face.

311
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,800
We have a face.

312
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,460
You know, it's a face-based religion.

313
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,020
But then there's...

314
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:15,580
There's the local Facebook page, and that's where you get a window into the more provincial side.

315
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,320
You see, I'm trying to be polite.

316
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:26,480
I could say redneck, but my neck's about half red, and people think of that as an insulting term.

317
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,020
And maybe some rednecks feel it is, but I hear them say it all the time, you know.

318
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,660
But...

319
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,700
I'm trying to avoid certain terms.

320
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,280
Bunch of f**king pigs out there.

321
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,780
Normals.

322
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,920
Barbies and Kens.

323
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,140
Cage dwellers.

324
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,920
If I can use those words.

325
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,100
They're Bob's approved.

326
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:59,060
Anyway, a 15-year-old girl announced on the local Facebook page that she was going to host a BLM rally in this tiny little town.

327
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,460
The locals instantly went rabid.

328
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,900
Foaming at the mouth.

329
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,640
Jumping at the mouth.

330
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,100
Going up and down.

331
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,760
On Facebook.

332
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,640
This is the friendliest place.

333
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,820
You drive through town, stop at a convenience store.

334
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,120
A city person would be suspicious because everybody's so friendly.

335
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,840
And they'd be friendly, you know, if you're black, whatever, Asian.

336
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,340
As long as you're not wearing a hope and change button.

337
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,160
And even then, the worst thing that happened was they might grunt a little bit.

338
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,280
But they'd still help you change attire.

339
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,720
These same people.

340
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,640
When they heard there was going to be a BLM thing here.

341
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,540
Their first thing was, what's the point?

342
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,660
There's no black people here.

343
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,100
Actually, there's probably about five families.

344
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:48,740
But they literally threatened to show up with weapons and bikers.

345
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,600
You know, I'm going to call my biker friends.

346
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,320
We're going to have all our weapons down here.

347
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,120
We're going to stop the paid anti-fah hordes.

348
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,660
They're going to bus in from Dallas with bricks and firebombs.

349
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,580
Because the anti-fah pays people.

350
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:10,420
To come through to the small towns and destroy our good old American pie culture.

351
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:20,960
They really believe this because they see those badly photoshopped fake ads that they send to each other.

352
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,960
With the help, no doubt, of the Russians and Chinese.

353
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,340
And I've seen those badly photoshopped.

354
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,620
You know, $200 a day to come throw bricks in this small town.

355
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,560
You know, call this man.

356
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,500
This number, anti-fah.

357
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,800
Another one that was really popular that I saw on our local Facebook page was,

358
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,580
anti-fah to invade Sturgis Bike Rally.

359
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,020
They believed this!

360
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,560
Oh, and they got so, oh, you know, righteous indignation.

361
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,200
Let me say that.

362
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,720
Take two.

363
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,160
Righteous indignation is the marijuana of 2020.

364
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,240
Butthurt is a powerful drug.

365
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,180
I think Nikki Deathchick said that.

366
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,220
Ironic considering.

367
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:19,360
And the other thing is, the locals honestly were going,

368
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,360
There's no Democrats in Glen Rose?

369
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,860
That's not allowed.

370
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,680
There's actually at least 200.

371
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,020
And I've met some of them.

372
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,220
Quite a few of them.

373
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,140
Well, I went to that BLM rally.

374
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,120
Yeah, they, anyway, it scared the 15-year-old girl into calling it off.

375
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,180
There were so many bullies on Facebook doing, you know,

376
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,020
So you don't think cop lives matter?

377
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
You don't think white lives matter?

378
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,320
Why do you bring hate of your own kind to this nice little town?

379
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
We'll show you hate.

380
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,680
You know, and so the girl's parents,

381
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,900
dropped the whole thing, called it off.

382
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,520
The Greta Thunberg of Glen Rose, I called her.

383
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,280
I really admired that kid.

384
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,340
We ended up getting to meet her, too,

385
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,400
because somebody else decided to do the BLM thing anyway.

386
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,300
They got a permit for a Saturday in the town square.

387
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,720
And you can envision a really traditional old town square,

388
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,480
sort of like the one in Back to the Future, but smaller.

389
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,380
Oh, the pro-fa people were so certain

390
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,460
that every storefront window was going to be shattered

391
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,840
and the tourists would never come back here again

392
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,540
to see the Creationist Museum.

393
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,180
And everybody was going to get COVID

394
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,580
because of the Dallas people that were being bussed in.

395
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,960
Even though COVID is a hoax, it's just a media hoax,

396
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,780
to, you know, make the president,

397
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,020
the president, to make the president look dumb!

398
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,500
Ugh.

399
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,160
Oh, and what upset him almost the most was,

400
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,680
because of COVID, the public restrooms were going to be locked.

401
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,140
Oh, my God, you'd think they couldn't get a haircut.

402
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,760
As if anybody ever used the public restroom in the town square.

403
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,860
They viewed that as the real harbinger of a Democratic coup.

404
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,480
Locking the public restrooms.

405
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,800
Oh, and the bullies and vigilantes announced

406
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,020
that they were going to have a prayer meeting for policemen

407
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,840
the morning before this rally.

408
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,100
And I went down there to see that prayer meeting,

409
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,580
and there wasn't anybody there!

410
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,680
It was all, they didn't even bother, you know.

411
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,120
So, there was going to be a meeting in Glen Rose.

412
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,900
Now, there's been violence in small towns,

413
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,800
particularly, I'm thinking,

414
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,780
that little town in Ohio,

415
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,160
where people with guns showed up and actually attacked

416
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,900
teenagers and little old ladies,

417
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,740
while the cops stood by.

418
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,940
And so I thought, well,

419
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,240
just because of those Facebook bullies,

420
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,220
I want to go to this BLM thing.

421
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,780
Plus, I miss Cleveland.

422
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,860
Most of the people I dealt with on a daily basis were black,

423
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,900
and their lives mattered to me.

424
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,540
And for that matter,

425
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,120
if anybody benefited from, indirectly,

426
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,480
but I definitely benefited from slavery.

427
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,460
More so than a lot of people.

428
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,300
I had an uncle who was a senator of South Carolina.

429
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,820
Great, great, great uncle.

430
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,440
Who's not a very great, great uncle.

431
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,000
He was a senator of South Carolina

432
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,420
named Cotton Ed Smith.

433
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,880
It might have helped him.

434
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,980
It might have helped my dad get into Harvard.

435
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,020
So anyway, you know...

436
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,100
I'm sincere about that actually.

437
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,200
Although of course I came up with funny placards

438
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,260
I could take.

439
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,080
No human lives matter.

440
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,860
Smack lives matter.

441
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,400
Or I was gonna get put on makeup

442
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,180
to look like I'd been beaten to a pulp

443
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,640
and have a sign that said,

444
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,100
black and blue lives matter.

445
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,180
All of which I decided were in bad taste.

446
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,700
And the latter one,

447
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,920
Black and Blue Lives Matter, probably both the liberals and the conservatives

448
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,600
would gang up on me. They'd find one reason they could come together and

449
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,640
beat up the smarty pants. At least we got one thing in common. So I went to

450
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:49,760
the rally. Princess Wee went with me. It was anticlimactic, really. It was 75

451
00:26:49,760 --> 00:27:00,200
masked youths and very attractive ladies and lots of old people, including more

452
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,500
attractive ladies. And I get the impression sometimes that maybe

453
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,160
Democrats have a better diet. Although, to tell the truth, at this particular

454
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,620
Black Lives Matter meeting, I would venture to estimate that at least half

455
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,740
of them were Republican Christians. But real Christians. No, I'm saying

456
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,800
that's a little bit more than that. So, yeah, it's all these old folks and youths

457
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,140
holding signs. And, of course, across the street from the square there were small

458
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:38,240
groups of unmasked, occasionally hooting and snickering, good old boys with

459
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,280
holding Trump-Pence signs. The most disruptive thing that happened was some

460
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,840
guy in a big loud pickup truck, festooned with Trump-Pence banners, drove around

461
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,720
the town square and started to beat up the people. And I think that's the kind of

462
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:49,880
thing that happens when you're in the neighborhood, and you're sitting there

463
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:57,520
three times, honking. But we had, there were sheriff's deputies there and nothing

464
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,580
happened. Nothing really terrible happened. The busload of professional

465
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:09,100
anti-file looters must have had a flat. Or maybe they surrendered, chickened out,

466
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,800
ran away because all those conservatives promising that they were going to be

467
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,640
there with Second Amendment presence. That's what they call it, Second

468
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,700
Amendment presence. So, you know, for the safety of the people. And, you know, we had a lot of people there.

469
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:32,040
Who was over in på Fam mocée for a few minutes. But after we Adriana

470
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,500
faced attack. temperature and cranking it out of the

471
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,980
streets. And especially when someone had attacked bou flowers, was Goes down on the street,

472
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,800
replied caffeine free. Saying, there was this kind of disaster every day here with the

473
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,520
EPA. I don't know, Joe? Leo anzim Giant Okay, well, this is, God was going try. We had the reasonable

474
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,680
go up thereavez the answer. I asked every Wednesday on theando crate, Aside from the

475
00:28:49,680 --> 00:29:01,020
up several times, they had to import a black speaker from Arlington. But another

476
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:07,480
black guy showed up who didn't know that this rally was happening. He works at the

477
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,760
supermarket and I'd seen him, you know, nodded to him several times, joked around

478
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,440
with him a little bit, but he was just driving home through town and he

479
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,060
saw these white people standing in a town square holding Black Lives Matter

480
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:28,660
signs. And he grabbed the mic, he walked up and started talking. He didn't

481
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,140
grab the mic, he started just talking to everybody. He didn't realize that he had

482
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,280
accidentally started during the eight and a half minute silence. But that was

483
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,680
okay with me because I really wasn't looking forward to that anyway. I get

484
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,080
stiff. But he was just flabbergasted and gave a kind of an

485
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,420
interest in the rally.

486
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,340
And he was just flabbergasted and gave a kind of an interest in the rally. And he

487
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,340


488
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,340


489
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,820
afterwards, the profile people got on Facebook and lied and lied. Oh, there's

490
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:02,240
only a dozen people there. And none of them wore masks. Just, the truth never

491
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,340
really fits their childish agendas because the complex is not really as

492
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:17,420
simple as they are. I'm sorry. The complex is complex and some of us like

493
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:25,440
it that way. Now the other war that's going on in this town, well, the

494
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,380
profile people sounded, on Facebook, sounded really disappointed that the

495
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:40,940
promised Civil War never happened. And they never got to use their Second

496
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:47,400
Amendment presence. They tell each other that no Democrat has a gun. And I'm not

497
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:56,020
wrong. Anyone from Nexton runs a gun. And the colored sensitive person has the

498
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:11,340
gun. That's really cool. And someone else I know from rcs, his Grant

499
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:11,340


500
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:11,340


501
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
am.

502
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,940
Probably.

503
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,720
there you go. Now we've also got in this town people are really opposed to wearing masks.

504
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,760
They're finally starting to believe maybe the COVID's real although they keep having second-hand

505
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,880
reports of empty hospitals. It's like oh I keep the media media keep saying Texas hospitals they

506
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,440
don't even have an emergency room therefore I drive by the hospital and there wasn't even a car in the

507
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:49,720
parking lot. You know it's just the anecdotal crap that they teach each other and you know the

508
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:57,500
masks they honestly believe that the masks are just a tool to soften us up and get us obeying

509
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:07,840
the deep state world government child molesting rulers so that when Bill Gates starts selling his

510
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,720
vaccine we'll all

511
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:22,100
fall for it and be turned into autistic slaves you know or something. And the mask is the mark of the

512
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:31,480
beast. Mask of the beast. Frankly friends I think those folks got the mark of the beast on them when

513
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:40,520
they joined Facebook. And I'm going to read from a science fiction book that's

514
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,440
called The Fall of the

515
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,440


516
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,720
I hope is in fact science fiction.

517
00:32:48,600 --> 00:33:02,900
It's Fall by Neil Stevenson. The great Neil Stevenson. I'm so jealous of him I want to cut his fingers off so he can't write anymore.

518
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,200
Because he's so good.

519
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,420
Anyway this part of this book takes place in a real world world.

520
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:11,420


521
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:11,420


522
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:19,540
This really divided America. This divided into blue states which are really just big cities and Ameristan.

523
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:29,120
Ameristan starts about when you get to the first Walmart in your town. We don't even have a Walmart here.

524
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:37,480
And I'm going to read a few little excerpts from this because it gets into something about where the Internet might be going.

525
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,700
That is quite scary.

526
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,020
Look at this!

527
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,620
So characters...

528
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:54,820
They're talking about what happens when rural people have to get sick.

529
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,540
Uh you know they have to go to a big town like Iowa City

530
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,740
Where the big hospital is.

531
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,900
Like another country to them

532
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,640
But they have to go there when they get sick like to get a melanoma whacked off of whatever.

533
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,420
They can't afford Blue St leukosomal vaccine

534
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,300
hotel rooms or food, so they have to camp out on the periphery and cook over propane burners under

535
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:26,180
tarps. And somebody else says something about dentistry. Our friend Ted here has normal people

536
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:32,880
teeth because he's old and grew up before this part of the world got Facebooked. After that,

537
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,560
the people with education fled to places like Ames, Des Moines, Iowa City, which includes dentists.

538
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,740
A few mainline churches used to run charity dental clinics where you could get a bad tooth pulled

539
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:54,100
or whatever, but those are being chased away by these people, indicating the giant cross

540
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:02,820
outside town with people crucified on it. Do they ever cross the river? When they get desperate or

541
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:09,460
some meme convinces them it's a good idea, they follow these weird edit streams. No one

542
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,660
knows where they come from. I looked at one of them once. I thought it would be conspiracy theory

543
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:21,440
stuff, but it wasn't even coherent enough to be called that. Yeah, the whole point of a conspiracy

544
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,220
theory is that it offers a kind of false coherence. But what I saw didn't even rise to that standard.

545
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:36,820
Didn't even know about it. It was just plain weird. Algorithmically generated mishmash images,

546
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,440
sounds, no sense to it at all.

547
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,460
Just whatever worked, you know, in the sense of getting the viewer to watch a little more.

548
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,740
They use eye tracking so you don't even have to click. But every so often, whoever's behind

549
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:56,460
it, whoever generates the stream, assuming it's a human anywhere in that loop, will put

550
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:05,380
it into the minds of these people and then bad things can happen. And they try to cross

551
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,040
a bridge, but it's been all shot up.

552
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:14,080
The infrastructure is damaged real bad. Their fathers believed the people in the cities

553
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,720
actually gave a shit enough about them to want to come and take their guns and other

554
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,420
property. So they put money they didn't really have into stockpiling trillions of rounds

555
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,820
and hunkered down waiting for the elites to come confiscate their stuff. There's no use

556
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:36,680
for any of it. So they come here sometimes and vote with bullets. Just shooting at bridges.

557
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:48,460
Here's a really scary part about the nonsense internet that these rural people have lost

558
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,460
their minds to.

559
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,520
The guy says, bronze age Shepherds may have been one step above cavemen, but at least

560
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,800
they were reality based.

561
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Very much so and that goes on being more or less true for quite a while. Now theater and

562
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,800
later movies eventually got us into the realm of shared hallucinations.

563
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,080
but those are neatly boxed in space and time, and there's a ceremony to them.

564
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:23,020
He's basically saying it's only since wireless networks got fast enough to stream pictures to portable devices

565
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:33,660
that everything changed and enabled each individual to live 24-7 in their own personalized hallucination stream.

566
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:42,840
And if you're still tied to reality by family or some kind of regularizing influence in your life, like having a job,

567
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,460
then you've got a fighting chance.

568
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:55,420
But these people, each person out there is getting their own personalized stream of algorithmically generated alternate reality

569
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:01,460
that is locked in a feedback loop with their pulse, blink right, and so on.

570
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,180
You're not going to get very far.

571
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,480
You are trying to get one of these people to tear his attention away from that

572
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:14,700
so you can relate a story about some guy 2,000 years ago feeding a large number of people with a few loaves and fishes.

573
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,900
And, yeah, it's Fall by Neil Stevenson.

574
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:29,920
I'm watching that happen on my local small town Facebook page.

575
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,740
So, where's my...

576
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,880
What time is it?

577
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,160
Oh my gosh!

578
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,800
I'm going to wrap this stuff up.

579
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,360
It's not just right-wingers, of course.

580
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:48,120
I get lots of letters from wokies that consider me to be a sexist, fascist right-winger

581
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,660
because I didn't hate that one guy they hate as much as I was supposed to hate him.

582
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,280
So they hate me even more.

583
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,540
Pink Facebook subgeniuses who can't even spell Bob.

584
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:02,940
Bob Wright.

585
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:10,980
And, of course, they're shift-key challenged, so the quote marks are really onerous for them.

586
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,480
But subginos, we call them.

587
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,020
Subgenius in name only.

588
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,420
We thought the internet, the world brain, would make everyone...

589
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,300
It would be like free education for everybody.

590
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,920
And it is for some of us, but it also just makes dumb people dumber.

591
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,720
It's controversial.

592
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,460
Information bias.

593
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:42,780
Anyway, this is where I would normally mock the funny names of Starwood workshops

594
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,960
that could be taken two different ways, but there weren't any.

595
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,040
They were all pretty straightforward.

596
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:57,480
And I had more wonderful quotes that I could read.

597
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,280
I'm sure a lot of Starwood people have read good...

598
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,720
Good?

599
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:02,720


600
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:02,720


601
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:02,720


602
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,400
Good Omens by...

603
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,640
It's not working.

604
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,640
Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman wrote this book, Good Omens.

605
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,740
It has this wonderful bit about witches that's hilarious.

606
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:16,840
But...

607
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,900
And a wonderful thing about aliens.

608
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,540
In fact, I've got to do a little bit...

609
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,840
This is how the aliens see us.

610
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,700
This guy actually gets pulled over by...

611
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,220
A flying saucer.

612
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,760
An alien cop gets out with, like, cool hand Luke shades on.

613
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,540
And says, is this your planet, is it?

614
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,180
I've got to do this in kind of British accent.

615
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,180
Well, yes, I suppose it is.

616
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,820
Had it long, have we?

617
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,560
Oh, not personally.

618
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,780
I mean, as a species, about half a million years, I think.

619
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,060
Uh-huh.

620
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,820
Been letting the old acid rain build up a bit, have we?

621
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,440
We, sir.

622
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,640
Been letting ourselves go.

623
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,180
A bit with the old hydrocarbons, perhaps?

624
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,440
I'm sorry.

625
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,400
Could you tell me your planet's albedo, sir?

626
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,920
Uh, no.

627
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,480
I'm sorry to have to tell you, sir, that your polar ice caps are below regulation size for a planet of this category.

628
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,680
Oh, dear.

629
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,740
We'll overlook it on this occasion, sir.

630
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,960
Oh, I'll see to it.

631
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,320
I mean, I say I.

632
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,560
I think Antarctica belongs to everyone or something like that.

633
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,700
But the alien shook its head vaguely, turned around,

634
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,540
and waddled back.

635
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,400
To the saucer.

636
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,960
Thank you.

637
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,200
The small alien walked past the car.

638
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,120
CO2 level up 0.5%, it rasped,

639
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,860
giving him a meaningful look.

640
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:48,120
You do know that you could find yourself charged with being a dominant species

641
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,580
while under the influence of impulse-driven capitalism, don't you?

642
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,360
Then they fly away.

643
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,240
And I had an even better thing, but it's too long.

644
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,860
Some of the beach torn from rocks trproducts cannot be used in the ocean water,

645
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,820
because they both exist.

646
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,600
illa

647
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:21,220
fiction book and it's wonderful and and we're very very small fish in a really

648
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:26,560
big nasty pond but the descriptions of it are great but we'll just have to wait

649
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:35,560
for the next Starwood and I was ready to do a mass marriage I guess I still can

650
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:43,520
that's sort of sort of traditional I can't actually see all the couples but

651
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:51,700
we're all going to be married after this I'll shorten it down to and this

652
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:57,360
just a 24 hours so it's only gonna last until this time tomorrow do you insert

653
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,480
name here take this whatever it is insert name here to be your lawful

654
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,100
wedded whatever in short duration subgenius matrimony to have and to hold

655
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,300
in fact to do just about damn near anything you each year it agrees to do

656
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,140
for richer or poorer in sickness and kinkiness but for the next 24 hours

657
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,500
together.

658
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,100
For whatever sick and twisted but no less blessed reasons for the next say I

659
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:27,540
do I do I could hear some of them and then you get out the ring or the temple

660
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:33,440
of Devoe if you don't have a ring and do that and you must now all kiss each

661
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,160
other and if you don't you make a mockery of the sacred tradition of

662
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,340
marriage there.

663
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,480
That's done.

664
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:54,500
Oh two bits of news on my YouTube page friends I finally learned how to do

665
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:01,880
playlists and I made a Starwood playlist including the 1990 Starwood

666
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:11,320
it's really short but I surreptitiously took some videos there and yes there's a

667
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,320


668
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,320


669
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,320


670
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:11,600
krit Denise

671
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:41,240
enough coverage and you can't see it but sometimes when everybody's dead.

672
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,320


673
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,320


674
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,320


675
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,320


676
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:50,640
it'll be interesting. So, and it shouldn't be long, according to the news. Anyway, so we can do a quick Q&A now.

677
00:44:50,800 --> 00:45:04,280
For what, how long do we have, Princess? Ten minutes or so? This would be the first time that I can actually hear the questions without people translating.

678
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,560
Reverend Stein, how would you like to do that? Do you want all the microphones turned on at once, or do you just want...

679
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,640
No, we should do them one at a time. One at a time? Yeah, let people unmute themselves.

680
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:25,860
Yeah, well, yeah, that would be, maybe that would be a good idea, is to let people unmute themselves or raise a hand or something, their raise your hand button or some such.

681
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:37,520
Oh, the other news I was going to say, okay, my YouTube, just go to subgenius.com, it's easy to find, and you'll have to scroll for my Starwood playlist.

682
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,540
But just under the playlist, there's a Starwood.

683
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:47,020
There's a Starwood one, there's a subgenius one, and a kitty cat's one. Most people like the cat's one best.

684
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh, here's a question from McCartney and Jennifer.

685
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,740
Paul McCartney, I thought you were dead.

686
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,160
Second Amendment presence.

687
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,660
Does that mean they're bringing guns for Antifa?

688
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,180
Yes, Second Amendment presence.

689
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,040
Means guns.

690
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,540
And it's kind of a pointless threat.

691
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,600
In rural farm country, everybody's packing.

692
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,980
They always have been. It was always legal.

693
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:35,420
They recently, Texas legalized open carry, but only the most insecure numbskulls walk around with a six-gun showing.

694
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,780
It's just stupid on account of...

695
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,420
Everybody's got either a rifle on the back of their pickup.

696
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:51,780
My mom and my sister always had a handgun under the seat for shooting snakes, if nothing else.

697
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,220
But I mean, seriously.

698
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,700
So that's not surprising.

699
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,120
But yeah, that's a code.

700
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:03,800
Second Amendment presence, that's code for we're going to be there with our guns and scare you libtards.

701
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,860
Oops, I said it.

702
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,460
That was the word I wasn't going to use.

703
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,500
No, I really shouldn't.

704
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,440
That's...

705
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,420
But it's kind of...

706
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,500
I'm appropriating it from them.

707
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,880
You know, that's...

708
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,320
I've been called that name indirectly so many times.

709
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,060
It was kind of like, you know, I just appropriated it.

710
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:30,060
But then I kind of remembered, well, it still got tarred in it.

711
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,920
Penny Godwin, what is the best way to contact you?

712
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,180
Subgenius.com.

713
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:38,860
Contacts page.

714
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,420
It's got my phone number.

715
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,400
Where it says the office phone number, that's the one on my hip.

716
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,940
Nobody ever calls.

717
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,840
Except crazy people.

718
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:51,240
The best way is staying at Subgenius.com.

719
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,840
I've had that same email address for...

720
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,540
since the last century.

721
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,140
Staying at Subgenius.com.

722
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,640
Easy, quick.

723
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,120
I don't have to struggle to hear on the phone.

724
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,080
I'm kind of deaf, you see.

725
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,000
There's got to be more questions.

726
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,340
Princess Wee, you took your question writing page away.

727
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,160
My better half is on the other side of the room.

728
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,160
Actually, I could turn this background off.

729
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,440
It's not showing Bob anymore.

730
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,940
I could show our...

731
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,220
I could show Stang Ranch.

732
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,880
This is our cult compound.

733
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,380
Actually, that right there is just an old horse barn.

734
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,660
There's the cult compound.

735
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,300
Yeah.

736
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,740
There's the weird looking rocks.

737
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,660
That's actually in town.

738
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,000
That's actually in town.

739
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,140
That's not on our property.

740
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,360
So is that ruin there.

741
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,140
Then after that, it starts showing Stang Ranch.

742
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,160
There's the old buzzard's roost.

743
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,580
And the goat pasture.

744
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,920
And the Frankenstein's hay barn.

745
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,140
Yeah, your barn needs a little work.

746
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,020
That's our house.

747
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,000
What do you recommend is the best way to storm the gates?

748
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,260
What was that?

749
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,460
What's the best way to storm the gates?

750
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:18,880
We may have to all pile on Washington, D.C. and take down the wall.

751
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,040
You don't have to storm the gates.

752
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:26,580
You can come to see our destructionist evidence museum that I'm forming.

753
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:32,680
In fact, it showed one of our devil skeletons in the background on that slide show there.

754
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,980
We have a...

755
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:34,980


756
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:34,980


757
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:34,980


758
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,740
We have fossils.

759
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,020
There's a lot of fossils here.

760
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,380
It's dinosaur track country.

761
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,640
We actually have dinosaur tracks.

762
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,080
We also have very rare ghost dinosaur tracks.

763
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,920
The tracks of ghost dinosaurs.

764
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,980
We found the skeleton of two cave subgeniuses.

765
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,480
We call those Adam and Eve, although it's really Adam and Steve.

766
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:04,140
And we have an alien, a crashed gray alien that must have died.

767
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,700
Died in the Cretaceous period.

768
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,060
All of these things are about 100,000 years old.

769
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:09,840
So here's a dinosaur.

770
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,340
There's a dinosaur at Valley State Park is nearby.

771
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,140
And there really is a creationist museum.

772
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,500
And it is hilarious.

773
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,840
I was afraid to go to the creationist museum for so long like a vampire in church, you know.

774
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:29,420
But an atheist friend of ours convinced me to go.

775
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,780
And I'm...

776
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,140
It was well worth the $14.

777
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:33,780
I have...

778
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:38,760
I still just chuckle thinking about those fake mantras.

779
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,900
Who are you voting for?

780
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,220
Oh, that's a personal question.

781
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,920
Yvonne wants to know.

782
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,580
Well, I mean, my friend Vermin Supreme is listening.

783
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,440
So, you know, I mean, just what am I going to say?

784
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,360
I can't say.

785
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,540
I can't say.

786
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,960
Where is my Vermin Supreme pen?

787
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:00,620
That's right.

788
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,040
You can't show anything off here.

789
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:03,640
However.

790
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,040
If I decide that I'm throwing away a vote, I might change my mind.

791
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:15,080
I was the one guy that thought George W. Bush couldn't possibly get reelected.

792
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,760
So I voted third party.

793
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,840
So it was my fault.

794
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,320
Because he won by one vote.

795
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,580
Yeah, don't waste it, man.

796
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,000
2015.

797
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,560
I stood at Starwood and told y'all.

798
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,860
Don't be sure.

799
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,840
I'm sure that...

800
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,980
What's her name?

801
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,380
Is going to win.

802
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,300
I've been monitoring the right wing.

803
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,560
It's an unhealthy hobby.

804
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,020
I've been monitoring it my whole life.

805
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,440
I kind of grew up kind of in it.

806
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,660
And...

807
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:59,000
And I had a sinking feeling that we'd get a big surprise in the election.

808
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:00,980
2016.

809
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:03,540
I told you.

810
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,620
I tried to warn you.

811
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,560
There are people out there that never voted in their lives that voted in that election.

812
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,680
Most of them don't know how to read.

813
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,300
Didn't know what voting was.

814
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,260
But they got each other all worked up.

815
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,680
Yes, they did.

816
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,940
The Chinese and Russian stuff about the criminal Clintons didn't help either.

817
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,220
They probably all are criminals.

818
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,220
But they're not guilty of what they say they're guilty of.

819
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,500
They can get them from stuff they are guilty of.

820
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,820
Exactly.

821
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,580
So...

822
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,380
Yeah, those conspiracy theories.

823
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,540
Who are you voting for?

824
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:36,880
Brutal.

825
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,300
Bob!

826
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,760
Don't blame me!

827
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,720
I voted for Bob!

828
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,320
Actually, you can buy a button from our Cafe Press store.

829
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,060
It's the Don't Blame Me, I Voted for Bob button.

830
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,260
The problem is, if you did vote for Bob last time, I'm sorry.

831
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,600
I blame you.

832
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,480
I wouldn't do a thing like that.

833
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,380
We've got Vermin Supreme!

834
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,880
He's much more visible than Bob.

835
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,880
I was hoping that...

836
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:18,500
I was glad that we didn't need Vermin's help at crowd control when we had the small town BLM rally.

837
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:27,680
All the pictures in the background, by the way, are dream scoped pictures of the ranch and the family.

838
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,880
There's our devil skeleton.

839
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,480
That one's more recent.

840
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,980
That's a fairly recent devil skeleton.

841
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,160
It's not fossilized.

842
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,180
That's a fossil.

843
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,080
So, friends...

844
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,920
Am I supposed to go until 5.15?

845
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,500
Yeah, until 5.15.

846
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:51,080
Eric Schneider would like to know, what is the proper way to sacrifice our children by sending them to school in the fall as mandated?

847
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,780
What is the best way to sacrifice our children?

848
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,340
Yeah, what should they wear?

849
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,860
By sending them to school in the fall?

850
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,940
School in the fall, as mandated?

851
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,060
Well, I'm glad I don't have to worry about that personally.

852
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:17,360
But I certainly do indirectly, because I've got three grandsons in Dallas, which right now is a hot, you know, it's a real hot spot.

853
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:24,980
And my daughter announced on Facebook that the kids, her kids, will not be going back to school.

854
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,900
They're sad, because they love school.

855
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,680
But, um...

856
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,140
She's not going to do that.

857
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,240
I'm sure there's lots of...

858
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,080
I'm sure there's lots of...

859
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,640
God, that's a tough decision, man.

860
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,800
That's a really hard thing.

861
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,700
Hi, y'all.

862
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,520
Oh, I can put this on...

863
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,160
On a gallery view.

864
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,880
Oh, my God, I can see everybody now!

865
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,160
Whoa, it's just like being at Starwood!

866
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:53,780
Yay!

867
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

868
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,280
Ah!

869
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,000
Huh!

870
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,620
That's wonderful.

871
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,560
I think...

872
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,920
I see Tommy Amoeba.

873
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,180
It was actually over...

874
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,340
It's supposed to be over at 5, but Mandy wants to know that.

875
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:14,220
Mandy wants to know, are the subgeniuses organizing the Amish like the Republicans did?

876
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:21,720
Well, you know, that's actually not a bad idea, because if you think about it, if there was...

877
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,740
Or I should say, when there's some horrible, gigantic disaster,

878
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,960
and all the electronics are fried...

879
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,800
A solar flare could do that, actually.

880
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:39,840
There won't be anybody left after 25 years except for Amish and bikers.

881
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,180
And 25 years after that, there won't be any...

882
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,480
Everybody in America will be biker Amish.

883
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,160
So there you go.

884
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,920
We probably should recruit more Amish.

885
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,260
We did...

886
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,380
I didn't know one...

887
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,720
There is one Amish guy.

888
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,280
He's not just an Amish subgenius.

889
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,800
He's also a stand-up comic.

890
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,360
He's called the Amish...

891
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,300
The Amish Comic.

892
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,040
Uh...

893
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,740
He's real...

894
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,620
Strangely enough, he's really funny.

895
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,300
That's right.

896
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,560
We don't have Amish around here.

897
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,520
We have Mennonites.

898
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,200
My shed was built by Mennonites.

899
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:14,800
Hmm.

900
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,460
Sturdy, sturdy work.

901
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,160
Fine work.

902
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,580
And they get the best amphetamines, I hear.

903
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,800
So, uh...

904
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah.

905
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,980
Here we are in the Matrix.

906
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,420
It's not so bad.

907
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,600
Like I said, the main thing...

908
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,600
My favorite thing about Starwood is standing around chatting, you know.

909
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,200
To see people you don't see very often.

910
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,820
You never...

911
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:44,280
You don't get to know them well enough to dislike them at all.

912
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,140
Jeff McBride's show is starting now, so people are starting to take out...

913
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:48,480
Oh, okay.

914
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:48,780
Yeah.

915
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,420
Is he doing magic?

916
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500
Or just talking about it?

917
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,980
It has been magic.

918
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:53,980


919
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,400
Oh, okay.

920
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,620
I drove him to Starwood, uh...

921
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,500
Well, I guess the last time he was there.

922
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,260
All the way...

923
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,800
For some reason, he got flown into Cleveland or something like that.

924
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,140
It was a long trip.

925
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,880
So we got to chat a whole lot.

926
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:16,860
And for about an hour, he sat and did card things with his hands.

927
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:21,200
He said every day, no matter where he is, for a certain amount of time, he just does

928
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,180
this thing with his hands and a bunch of cards.

929
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:23,960
It's just a bunch of cards.

930
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:23,960


931
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:23,960


932
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:23,960


933
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,260
It's a blur.

934
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,280
You know, I could barely see what was going on.

935
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,100
Maybe he was having a conversation the whole time.

936
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,100
Yeah, you have to keep the muscle memory working and, uh...

937
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,440
Yeah, you keep your hands deck style.

938
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,600
It's pretty impressive to watch a magician do that.

939
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,740
Oh, you have to stay in practice?

940
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,360
Yeah.

941
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,200
That's why I'm having so much trouble masturbating now, I guess.

942
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:48,860
I'm just...

943
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,520
I'm not getting enough hours in.

944
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:52,520
Yeah.

945
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,400
If I did that for an hour every day, I'd be as good as Magnus at playing cards.

946
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,300
Dang.

947
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:58,860
There you go.

948
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,280
Thank you very much for your wisdom.

949
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,620
Oh, and how do I end these things?

950
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:06,960
Oh, yeah.

951
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,520
Repent.

952
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,260
Quit your job.

953
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:09,900
Slack off.

954
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,020
Praise Bob.

955
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,120
Question authority.

956
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,500
Or else.

957
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:20,160
And if they cannot see the humor of it, let them mount up upon themselves.

958
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,040
So y'all go see Magnus.

959
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:36,980
Thank you very much for coming and attending and being remarkably quiet the whole time.

960
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,440
That's really funny now.

961
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,540
You can have that when the mics are turned off.

962
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,160
Now I'm going to go do the other stuff that you do at Starwood when you're not working,

963
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,920
when you don't have to do a show in front of people.

964
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,500
When you're not on the show.

965
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:52,900
When you're not on camera.

966
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:53,800
Yeah.

967
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,480
Yeah, when you're not on camera.

968
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,420
And you know what that is?

969
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,420
Walk the dogs.

970
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,640
Praise Bob.

971
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,200
Dogs need walks.

972
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,960
Tell Magnus hello for me.

973
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,200
Ah-ooh-ga.

974
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,360
Ah-ooh-ga.

975
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,380
Mandy is licking you.
