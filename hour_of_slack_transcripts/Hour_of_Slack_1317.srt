1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
We the jury find the defendants guilty.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,020
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,700
No! No! Guilty!

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,640
I'm not me! I'm-

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,820
The Self Genius Power of Swag!

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,340
Click. Click.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,460
I saw Bob. I saw Bob's pants up.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,320
I know where he got it.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:52,160
Oh, yes dear friends. This is your host and prayer partner, Reverend Stang, and I'm driving from Wisteria Campground in Pomeroy, Ohio, to Athens, Ohio, to the post office to mail out the last two weeks' shows,

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,440
which happen to have both been recorded in Cleveland at WSJ.

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:08,040
And what's coming up is the third hour of that three-hour marathon, because it's gonna- probably.

12
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,800
I may include some Best of X Day footage. It's gonna take a while to edit that down.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,040
We recorded some wonderful stuff. X Day went very well.

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:27,440
We also recorded some horrible stuff. In fact, I would say two of the worst things that happened at X Day were the cover.

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,220
I mean, the cover versions of All Along the Watchtower and Mongoloid.

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,180
I probably won't play them, but I do know where to find them.

17
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:44,420
It's rather difficult, actually, to produce a show or even edit material from a campground,

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:56,300
because there's a lot else going on, and it's kind of- you know, why should I sit and edit tapes of last week's slack when I could be having fresh slack this week?

19
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:06,740
So, let us now cut back to the June 26th and 27th Dr. Sinister show.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,120
The sauces are coming.

21
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,340
The sauces are coming. The sauces are coming.

22
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,400
Hot sauces are coming.

23
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,660
Hot sausage what?

24
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,240
Mmm.

25
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,440
Sausage.

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,960
It's gonna be a sausage party here.

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,280
Sausage.

28
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,160
Big old biscuits on the side.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,620
Oh, no.

30
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:28,640
No.

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,960
Not a sausage party.

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,040
Not another sausage fest.

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,200
I can't remember the last time there were actually two females speaking on the air on this program.

34
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,920
Yeah, how does that become a sausage fest?

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,220
It feels like a long time.

36
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,240
I'm sorry, it's force of habit. It's force of habit describing this program as such.

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,460
You put it in the hot.

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,720
But, you know, I do enjoy a good bratwurst.

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,200
Don't you think?

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,860
And, uh...

41
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,860
What really happened?

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,660
Well, I just, you know, something compelled me.

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,220
Something always compelled you.

44
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,100
What do you think it compels you, darling?

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,980
The power of Connie compels you?

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
But I don't, I don't know if it, I don't know what it was.

47
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,960
But, you know, if you want it to be a sausage party, I can, you know, go away.

48
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,740
No, no, no.

49
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,360
No, no, no.

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,560
No, no, no.

51
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:06,580


52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:06,620
No.

53
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:06,620


54
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,300
Please, no.

55
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,600
That's what I was saying.

56
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,440
That's ridiculous.

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,200
I never want my sausage ground.

58
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,320
That's just what it's usually like up here.

59
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,260
...under such circumstances.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,880
And I don't think anybody in the livable sense of the world, their right mind would.

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,560
Provided they had the sausage to get ground or grinded.

62
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,500
Well, uh, it asks...

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,180
Ask not how the sausage is made.

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,760
But ask who makes it.

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,960
Unless you live in Anthony Sowell's neighborhood.

66
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,140
Screaming, the sausages are coming, the sausages are coming.

67
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,400
Have you seen the sausage?

68
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,160
That's the best part about...

69
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,340
What about sausages and sausage?

70
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,720
Dr. Hell, are you familiar with the story of Anthony Sowell, Cleveland's serial killer?

71
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,840
No, you should tell me.

72
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,780
Yeah, it's this guy who lived in a pretty rough neighborhood on the east side of Cleveland,

73
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,320
just a few doors down from a sausage-making shop.

74
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,440
And, you know, for years and years, there was this awful smell coming from the neighborhood,

75
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,460
and people just assumed it was the sausage factory.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,760
But no, in fact, he had like a dozen corpses, you know,

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,980
both buried in his backyard and stuffed into the crawl spaces in his attic.

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,880
Quite a Victorian story, eh?

79
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,320
And where did the sausages come in?

80
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,260
He was just a couple doors down from a sausage factory,

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,220
and people just assumed that was the source of the smell.

82
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,520
Ah.

83
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,740
But I wonder, you know, didn't they teach him in serial killer school

84
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,280
that you don't bury the body?

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,540
You don't bury the body, you just have to bury the body.

86
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:24,540


87
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,220
It's on your own property.

88
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,080
Right.

89
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,620
No, they never do.

90
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,340
Living that close to a sausage plant was probably one of his biggest,

91
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,360
probably his plan just didn't work out as long as he had hoped it would.

92
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,080
Well, how would, you know, who was the cat in the Victorian times

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,920
who actually had, they made a Broadway play out of it

94
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,180
where he, you know, was some mad jack dude who killed people

95
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,260
and then sold them as sausage, his bangers in very old age.

96
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,300
I remember the film, The Mad Butcher.

97
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,800
Sweeney Todd?

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,720
That was Sweeney Todd, the demon butcher of Fleet Street.

99
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,800
What?

100
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,980
Sweeney Todd.

101
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,440
Yes, yes.

102
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,120
Sweeney Todd.

103
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,180
Played by Johnny Depp in the most recent terrible movie of it,

104
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,560
which was really awful.

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,140
Was it?

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,680
Yeah.

107
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,220
Yes.

108
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,640
The broadsides at the time were quite disturbing,

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,100
considering, you know, they had such funny little pens and stuff,

110
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,040
not like the city graphs of yesteryear.

111
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,080
They wrote with a feather.

112
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,960
Yeah, a feather cheese.

113
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,980
They wrote with a, I'm sorry.

114
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,020
Well, a, uh.

115
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,500
Was it a fountain feather?

116
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,000
It was a damn Greek salad that they would smear on paper

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and then run away screaming obscenities.

118
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,000
That's how the Bible was written.

119
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,380
Yeah, the Bible itself.

120
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,140
Think of it.

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,180
I mean, you've been deluded if you think of, you know,

122
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,200
the Bama Vishnu guys and the Koran and whatever nod and stuff.

123
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,860
That's, I mean, by sous chefs.

124
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,040
I know that's how the Book of the Subgenius was written.

125
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,580
Yeah.

126
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,360
Get a few sentences down, then run screaming away,

127
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,000
then crawl back and write a few more sentences.

128
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,380
You know, it was just their very...

129
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,620
Oh, I thought you meant you read it with olives.

130
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,300
Olives?

131
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,380
Not the olive.

132
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,320
Kalamata.

133
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
Wait, you read it at Olive Garden?

134
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,500
No, we're talking about the pit in...

135
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,820
He wrote it in his own blood,

136
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,120
and his wife asked if he was going to be okay after losing all that blood,

137
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,100
and he said, all live.

138
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:17,920
Oh.

139
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,780
And do you know what happened when Christ came to Mount Olive?

140
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,680
What happened?

141
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,980
Bluto.

142
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,380
Bluto.

143
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,080
Yeah, I was going to say Bluto cut him away.

144
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,800
Yeah, I was going to say Popeye beat the crap out of him.

145
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,240
Yeah, that's true.

146
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,400
Anyway.

147
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,960
Anyway.

148
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,220
It's funny because I can...

149
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,600
Oh, we got a million happy folks.

150
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,200
Come to the greatest comedy event on any continent.

151
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,080
X day, you'll be holding your sides laughing.

152
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,940
It's a real knee slapper every moment.

153
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,500
You're at next day with our guffawing crowds of goofball clowns.

154
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,000
You'll be slapping.

155
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,300
You'll be slapping your knees because mosquitoes will be biting them.

156
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,540
How hilarious.

157
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,500
Oh, yes, the mosquitoes who have descended.

158
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,660
Well, the mosquitoes think it's funny.

159
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,160
Buzzing clouds of stinging night flies, burrowing chiggers,

160
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,420
huge bloated ticks, squirming centipedes.

161
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,660
But when they bite you, they give you the compliment.

162
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,240
Huge huntsman spiders.

163
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,040
I mean, that means that you must be worthy.

164
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,660
It means you taste good.

165
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,640
That small consolation, I can tell you,

166
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,440
is one who has often been tasted.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
It's very spooky down there, dude,

168
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,440
because of the mounds culture.

169
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,940
It was a really big deal around...

170
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,180
Yeah, Peter Paul and...

171
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,000
No, no, no, not the mounds.

172
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,060
The bars or the...

173
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,980
Oh, they had bars.

174
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,440
I feel like a nut.

175
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,500
Back in the day, they had firewood.

176
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,300
Are you making fun of me, Dr. Sinister?

177
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,360
Great Indian sizzle of a day.

178
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,480
Oh, well, a sizzle is what we sell, not the steak.

179
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,000
You're selling more than the sizzle.

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,840
It is kind of spooky down there in southern Ohio.

181
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,460
Yeah.

182
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,640
Princess, we and I drove down to Starwood last year at night,

183
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,640
and there are state signs,

184
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,300
warning of headless horrors.

185
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,480
Horsemen crossing the road.

186
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,020
It's true.

187
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,900
That's because there are many hollows.

188
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,840
There are hollows.

189
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,380
There's a lot of hollers.

190
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,120
Is there any way to do laundry once you're on site?

191
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,460
You're practically an Appalachian down there.

192
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,180
Yeah, an Appalachian is spooked as hell, man.

193
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,660
You have to beat it on a rock.

194
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,720
You know, I grew up around the Appalachians.

195
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,620
It's just a matter of understanding their lingo.

196
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,320
Oh, yeah.

197
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,300
Yeah, I mean, I speak mountain people.

198
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,260
You don't sound like it right now.

199
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,900
Montani semper liberi.

200
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,300
That is the state motto of West Virginia.

201
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,120
Which means mountaineers are always free.

202
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,300
And, yes, there are people who speak Latin in West Virginia

203
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,220
to come up with that motto.

204
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,460
Well, and, you know, I'm from the state

205
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,760
that has the state motto,

206
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,040
six tempered tyrannous.

207
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,380
Ah, thus always unto tyrants.

208
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,120
I don't know if the tyrannosaurs are involved in all this.

209
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,040
You mean the Commonwealth.

210
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,520
The only state whose flag has a naked tit on it.

211
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,380
Six foul-tempered tyrannosaurs.

212
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,900
There is a naked tit on the state flag of Virginia,

213
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,860
which is why I need to move there.

214
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,820
Wow.

215
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,160
Well, our friend,

216
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,900
Puzzling Evidence,

217
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,640
recently went to his military school reunion,

218
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,700
which was strange since the school itself

219
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,800
no longer exists in the parade ground

220
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
where Wellman used to march back and forth in his uniform.

221
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,780
Now it's an all-girls school.

222
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,640
But there were still a few grizzled vets of that school.

223
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,060
And he went there, yes,

224
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,060
but he also went somewhere else that I clued him to.

225
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,700
You see, I found out that there's this place nearby

226
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,300
where this guy had a dinosaur park.

227
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,860
And he is a...

228
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,300
You know what I'm talking about?

229
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,760
You're talking about the guy...

230
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,560
I know that guy.

231
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,660
He became...

232
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,460
Is he a Tea Party character?

233
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,240
Because he was very aggrieved

234
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,720
that the evil industrialized North

235
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,480
had won over the gentlemanly South,

236
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,440
so he made it a

237
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,120
Dinosaurs Attack the Union Army and Win the Civil War park.

238
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,900
What a beautiful...

239
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,940
And Doug went there and filmed it with his camera.

240
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,980
That's almost as good...

241
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,100
You can see a Deinonychus sneaking up on Lincoln

242
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,960
and tyrannosauruses pulling Union Army guys off their horses.

243
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,860
Well, I mean, if we're talking about the same gentleman...

244
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,280
You can walk...

245
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,040
You can walk through the park and see this.

246
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,040
He's a bit of a prankster.

247
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,360
When Doug showed up, the place was closed,

248
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,060
but they let him in anyway, his typical luck,

249
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,140
so he was able to walk through with nobody else there

250
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,060
and make his own slideshow and movie,

251
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
which he ultimately intends to put on YouTube

252
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,160
with me narrating it someday.

253
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,960
Dinosaurs Winning the Civil War

254
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,420
is almost as good as this awful Harry Turtledove novel

255
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,300
I once read that had white Afrikaners

256
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,220
going back in time to give AK-47s to the...

257
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,780
Oh, no.

258
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes, that was actually a great book.

259
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,440
Like, on the cover it had a painting of Robert E. Lee holding an AK.

260
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,280
But what Doug always ends up talking about

261
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,040
is that Twilight's episode of the tank

262
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,960
going back to Custer's last stand.

263
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,180
That's a terrible...

264
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,680
I'm going to open up a Custer's stand.

265
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,920
That's one of the worst written Twilight songs.

266
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,760
But he loves it because of the idea that

267
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,640
their names were beyond the monument.

268
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,220
They actually went into battle with that tank

269
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,080
and were still wiped out by the Indians.

270
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,580
And this segment of...

271
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,920
Why are people getting out of the tank, too?

272
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,140
Why?

273
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,140
Didn't they just go back?

274
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,600
This segment of Synesthesia is brought to you by Custer's last stand.

275
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,420
The last frozen custard you'll ever want to eat.

276
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,500
It's a summertime treat.

277
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,280
Not many people know that there actually was,

278
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,000
in the annals of the Old West,

279
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,640
a Custer's last stand.

280
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,540
Major Amos Custer was wiped out by Indians.

281
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,060
No kidding.

282
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,160
And his small crew, not as big as the Custer defeated.

283
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,860
He just got done playing baseball back in the reds.

284
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,020
Custer's folly was in 1876,

285
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,260
the year of our first...

286
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,580
First centennial.

287
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,960
And it shocked a lot of people

288
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,060
who thought that the hostiles were being dealt with in the Black Hills.

289
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,460
I know some descendants of those hostiles

290
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:42,640
who claim that they have the best mutilated parts of Custer's body.

291
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,800
Of course, the Army's story was that

292
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,800
they respected the great long-haired Custer so greatly

293
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,440
that he alone was not mutilated by the Lakota women.

294
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,940
Well, they sure mutilated the rest.

295
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,240
In fact, his John Dillinger is preserved

296
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,920
in somebody's little reservation household.

297
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,280
I thought that they pounded something into his eyes

298
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,740
because he had been too obtuse to see

299
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,920
or something like that.

300
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,540
I mean, they did all sorts of symbolic mutilations.

301
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,700
Something like that.

302
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,420
I'm not a Custer to all this talk of ice cream and more.

303
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,620
...around at the time when the tribes were coming together a little bit,

304
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,980
a little bit too much for Mr. Custer

305
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,280
because he meant more than he expected.

306
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,440
I have to mention that wonderful

307
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,820
Son of the Morning Star book

308
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,400
which everyone should read

309
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,200
who's interested in the Custer Massacre.

310
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,760
Or interested in Indian massacres in general,

311
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,880
although today we call them Native American direct actions.

312
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,100
Oh, you guys are going to be around next day

313
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,140
are going to be right near Nadin Hooden or Nadin or whatever they call it.

314
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,900
Gnadin Hooden.

315
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,340
Gnadin Hooden.

316
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,460
Gnadin Hooden is not...

317
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,060
You know the movie The Mission with De Niro and Liam Neeson?

318
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,260
I actually once knew...

319
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,220
It's actually pronounced by the locals Gnadin Hooden.

320
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,500
Gnadin Hooden?

321
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,740
I once knew a girl from...

322
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,660
Scalping involved?

323
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,800
I once knew a girl from there.

324
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,960
Gnadin Hooden in Tuscarawas County.

325
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,320
That was their claim to fame.

326
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,580
It's not that close, actually.

327
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,500
Put them in the churches in the mission and kill them.

328
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,120
Unbelievable.

329
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,940
Great.

330
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,560
There's a mission?

331
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,920
What is our mission?

332
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,360
What is our mission?

333
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,080
It is nameless.

334
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,040
The nameless mission.

335
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,420
It must remain nameless.

336
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,220
All will be with the old...

337
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,020
In the fullness of time.

338
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,880
Sabotage.

339
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,920
Black mission fakes.

340
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,160
Murder, treachery, and extortion.

341
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,140
Actually, at this point, shouldn't we send out the mission codes for the sleeper cells who are listening?

342
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,500
The mission codes...

343
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,200
We want to keep that army of robots from marching until the very last minute.

344
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:49,280
But when they hear the special transmission, they will drop whatever they're doing and start plodding toward Wisteria.

345
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,260
One of these days, we're going to turn this station into a numbers station.

346
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,340
What a wreck.

347
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,160
One, eight, four, three, five.

348
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,040
Eins, null, zwei, drei, neun, sechs, zehn, vier, sieben.

349
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,380
Special transmission of numbers on WCSC and Cleveland.

350
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,600
One, seven, six, seven, eight.

351
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,920
One, two, three, four, five.

352
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,860
One, two, three, four, five.

353
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,120
One, two, three, four, five.

354
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,200
One, two, three, four, five.

355
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,200


356
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,400
Two, three, four, five.

357
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,140
Two, three, four, five.

358
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,980
Two, three, four, five.

359
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,800
Two, three, four, five.

360
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,900
Two, three, four, five.

361
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:38,160
Oh, yes, the time is bearing down on us, you know.

362
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,120
I can't even count in Lakota anymore.

363
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,100
It's been so long.

364
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,020
I can't even count anymore.

365
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,900
I never spoke Lakota.

366
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,460
The last time I magnified that Viking helmet, I think it was 1973.

367
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,000
73.

368
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,660
That's when your grandfather got whooped by the local hoolay hanging around the house.

369
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,600
By an alcoholic, you say?

370
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,520
He was far too big.

371
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,840
Stop talking about my grandma.

372
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,020
No trash talking about grandma is to be permitted.

373
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,780
Actually, I want to congratulate my grandma on her 90th birthday, which she celebrated this week.

374
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:10,920
Wow.

375
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,500
Congratulations, Graham.

376
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,540
My one surviving grandparent, she just turned 90.

377
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,140
I'm sure she's not listening, but congratulations.

378
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
You never know.

379
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,240
You never know.

380
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,060
Grandma may be very proud of you.

381
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,140
She wouldn't if she knew the whole story.

382
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:35,980
Reverend Nikki Deathchick's 101-year-old grandma at her wedding a few years ago.

383
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,700
And she didn't need any help getting up the steps or in the door or nothing, not like I do.

384
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,760
She was quite spry.

385
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,080
Yeah, it's funny.

386
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,840
On the other hand, I had a 101-year-old grandma.

387
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,260
Grandma-in-law who had not left her bed in 20 years and was miserable.

388
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,040
I had a 102-year-old granny or auntie.

389
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,860
Auntie?

390
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,300
Yes, 102.

391
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,040
She made it in the Guinness Book of either Arizona or someplace.

392
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,060
Ah.

393
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,740
It was above 102, but it was bad.

394
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,060
As I understand it, the secret for old ladies to live long, long years is to smoke cigars.

395
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,920
They always say that, don't they?

396
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:21,600
Yeah.

397
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,980
And getting down on the floor and scrubbing it.

398
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,860
That's the other thing that keeps your body in shape.

399
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,580
Floor scrubbing while you're smoking cigars.

400
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,780
While smoking cigars, exactly.

401
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,240
Some grandmas like parakeets.

402
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,060
Just don't ash in the water bucket.

403
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,380
I mean, you'll be cleaning the floor forever.

404
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,460
But if you do, then exactly.

405
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,900
If you keep cleaning the floor forever, then you'll live forever.

406
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,420
Right.

407
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:39,820
That's true.

408
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,720
Well, maybe that's the key.

409
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,140
You have to ash the cigar in the water bucket, and then you have to do it again and again.

410
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,620
And keep cooking until the house burns down.

411
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,320
Yeah, you'll live to 100 and whatever, but you'll be stuck.

412
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:51,440
Yeah.

413
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,160
That's an eternal loop.

414
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,780
That's an eternal loop.

415
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,320
I don't know.

416
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,480
It'll always be groundhog day.

417
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,220
I don't know if I necessarily believe that.

418
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,600
Groundhogs get such a bad rap.

419
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,640
Yes, you know, one thing about groundhogs is they have another name.

420
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,480
And I'm sure you know what that name is.

421
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,740
Parque Carco and the Eastern Woodlands people.

422
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,240
Well, how about Marmotus Monax?

423
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,600
How about a woodchuck?

424
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,320
Yes, the groundhog and the woodchuck are identical.

425
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,880
But how much ground would a groundhog hog if a groundhog could hog ground?

426
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,640
Apparently, you've never read my monograph on the subject,

427
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,140
Coordinated Casting Motions in Marmotus Monax,

428
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,340
which show exactly how much wood is possible to be cast by these creatures.

429
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,180
Dr. Halligan actually figured that out.

430
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,880
Yeah, well, I...

431
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,380
He can answer.

432
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,120
But each one of these groundhogs requires like 10 acres.

433
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,220
Each one of these groundhogs requires 10 acres.

434
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,140
They hog so much ground.

435
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,420
Well, they don't require a mule.

436
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,760
Anyway...

437
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:50,840
What do we learn?

438
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,160
Well, you know, it's one of the never-ending questions.

439
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,700
The other one being, how many licks does it take?

440
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,260
To get to the center of an all-day slowpoke?

441
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,220
Yeah, that's more...

442
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,140
To get to the center of the earth, how many licks?

443
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,040
Well, your tongue gets mighty dirty.

444
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,840
But it might be worth doing anyway if the center of the earth is made of creamy, chocolatey nougat, as some theorize.

445
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,820
More like molten lava.

446
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,820
Well, you have to wait for it to cool.

447
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,360
That's why you...

448
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,440
Well, they make lava cakes.

449
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
It could be good.

450
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,820
Yeah, don't burn your tongue.

451
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,720
It's boiling sugar.

452
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,840
Enough, it'll burn, certainly.

453
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,440
But cool it down, and it's delicious.

454
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,160
Cool it down, and it solidifies into nuggets of nougat.

455
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,860
That's right.

456
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,660
Very cold.

457
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,320
Okay.

458
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,800
Now, when I was a little tad, I used to eat...

459
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,140
As we share our nuggets of knowledge.

460
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,360
I used to eat...

461
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,460
What were they called?

462
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,240
Well, there was the slowpoke, as I mentioned, the all-day sucker.

463
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,620
There was...

464
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,420
They're valueless, Frank.

465
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,180
There was...

466
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,660
What were those little bean-like, sugary things that were also made by the Welch's Candy Company?

467
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,820
Smart pills, they used to call them.

468
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:04,080
Well, whatever they were made, they and the slowpoke actually supported the Welch's Company,

469
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,200
which supported the John Birch Society and Robert Welch.

470
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,140
Boston Big Beans?

471
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,840
The Welch's...

472
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm boycotting Welch's products in general because, of course, the founder of the company was Reverend Welch himself.

473
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,900
Of course, he started marketing grape juice as an alternative to wine.

474
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,060
He didn't want people drinking.

475
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,760
Wine is a monger.

476
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,900
A strong drink is waiting.

477
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,080
He filled the Hudson River with grape juice.

478
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,280
And your entire cereal market is because people didn't want people playing with themselves.

479
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:30,720
Right.

480
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,900
And that's why he invented general magnetics, the way of controlling minds by using a television set.

481
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,800
Just think of it.

482
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,720
He's everywhere.

483
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,960
He's in our grape juice.

484
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,360
He's in our, you know, airplanes and our stealth fighters that may or may not even exist.

485
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,440
Everything I know is wrong.

486
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,620
Everything.

487
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:48,880
Everything.

488
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,600
Bob is everywhere.

489
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:56,120
Actually, everything you know is true somewhere in the polycosmos.

490
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,700
But wrong to you, buddy.

491
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,540
I think you guys...

492
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,120
In this one, yeah.

493
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,180
I think the polycosmos is polyamorous on the head.

494
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,200
No, duh.

495
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,560
That's what it's all about.

496
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,060
Why do you think God set it up that way?

497
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,960
Remember the Oz books and Polychrome, the Daughter of the Rainbow?

498
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,360
I always thought she was hot.

499
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:14,980
Who?

500
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,100
Polychrome.

501
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,340
Polychrome.

502
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,000
Did you ever read the Oz books?

503
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,680
Yeah.

504
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,540
By L. Frank Baum?

505
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,960
Remember Polychrome?

506
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,500
Yeah.

507
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,720
That's what I want.

508
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,440
And she was also a magnetic huntress back in the old days of the Mabuhay Gardens,

509
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,580
where they used to wear squirrel suits and those divine haircuts.

510
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,080
You know, the whole tube look and everything.

511
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,740
Like as if they were being condensed themselves somehow, you know?

512
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,700
Well, now we all have our own private memories to console ourselves in our dark times.

513
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,980
Well, the squirrel suits worked a lot better.

514
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:47,980


515
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:47,980


516
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:47,980


517
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,100
They're a lot better than the skunk suits.

518
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,440
A skunk suit?

519
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,520
For some reason, the skunk suits didn't work out.

520
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,060
It's symbology, baby Kate.

521
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,900
Well, a skunk, the polecat, that's only found here in the New World.

522
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,740
There are no skunks in England, despite recent stupid movies which assert otherwise.

523
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,560
Well, they know if you get...

524
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,220
The very word polecat is interesting.

525
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,520
And you can either introduce or...

526
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,800
I think we should introduce skunks to the New World since they gave us Starlet.

527
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,680
I mean, I'm surprised.

528
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,940
There aren't skunk-like...

529
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,660
...beings in the Old World.

530
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,540
There are, actually, and the word polecat is an Old World term.

531
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,300
Yeah.

532
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,360
But the skunk, the American skunk...

533
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,100
It means stripper, right?

534
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,600
The word was not coined to describe, you know, house cats kept by the poles.

535
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,840
No, it was not.

536
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,300
Nor did it mean a catamount or a big cat like...

537
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,220
Or a catawall.

538
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,040
A bobcat or...

539
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:45,360
Oh, I just remembered which large animal kept predators at bay because of its horrible stink.

540
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,440
And it was?

541
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,360
The human...

542
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,480
The human being.

543
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,240
Yes.

544
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,720
Everyone hates to smell a humie.

545
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,060
And a homie.

546
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,340
The human being was the skunk of the Old World.

547
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:58,940
That's right.

548
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:08,020
The stinky olfactory presence of primitive humans often caused the large megafauna to move out without even taking their furniture.

549
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,920
And those who adapted and those furnitures which also adapted along with them.

550
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,940
And what did the catamount ever amount to?

551
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,880
I mean...

552
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,040
It amounted to a lot.

553
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,980
Back when they could...

554
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:17,980


555
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:17,980


556
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:17,980


557
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,480
They could get together.

558
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:24,940
And back when you had to spend a minute and a half loading and recharging your musket with wadding and so on.

559
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,140
But today you can mow them down from a helicopter like Sarah Palin.

560
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,820
Yeah.

561
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,640
Did you see that too?

562
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,780
The thing of Sarah Palin mowing down all those lobsters, was it?

563
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,400
Hmm.

564
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,300
So she's down on lobsters now.

565
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,780
I remember that message she had to the country where turkeys were being turned upside down and beheaded in the background.

566
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,200
I heard she quit her bus tour early, actually.

567
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,780
Well, she quits everything.

568
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,100
She's pretty good.

569
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,000
Exactly, yeah.

570
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,620
She's a very good quitter.

571
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,600
She said Paul Revere was trying to protect our Second Amendment rights from the British who were going to take away our guns.

572
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:05,420
Well, she said that Paul Revere rode to warn the British that he was coming along with a small army of...

573
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,920
Her followers even edited the Wikipedia article.

574
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,720
To make it seem as if she was correct.

575
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,020
Paul Revere did that, right?

576
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,380
Yes.

577
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,220
Not to make it seem as if she was correct, but to say one alternate interpretation of this historical event is that...

578
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,260
Yes.

579
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:17,660
Yes.

580
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:17,720
Yes.

581
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:17,740
Yes.

582
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


583
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


584
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


585
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


586
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


587
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


588
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


589
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


590
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


591
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,740


592
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:27,640
Isn't that one of the prerequisites of power is your words must be interpreted numerous different ways to keep numerous people from jumping on you and killing you.

593
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,600
You can keep them at bay that way.

594
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,880
You can keep them calmed down.

595
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,360
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is a master of that.

596
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,600
He really is.

597
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,560
Yes, we can.

598
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,160
We can what?

599
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,500
We can can you.

600
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,540
Tomatoes, peaches, all kinds of things.

601
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,080
She got some books.

602
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,500
Yes, we can can can, too.

603
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,540
Yes.

604
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:47,920
We can.

605
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,560
You can can can.

606
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,480
Speak for yourself.

607
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,800
I don't know if I can can can.

608
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,760
Corn, .

609
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,420
I've got time to try.

610
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:02,800
Maybe in a filtered lake you can do it before the tiny lake monster begins to nibble on your epidermis.

611
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,140
At least they're not nibbling the epidermis.

612
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,440
There's a lot of lake monsters that clean, you know, they pay money, the people pay money to have the small fish eat their toes.

613
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,220
Well I would, but I left it in my other suit.

614
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:16,740
I mean...

615
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,760
Some cities, though.

616
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,860
It's keeping me on my back.

617
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,500
Otherwise, I'd be quite willing.

618
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,480
You'd take it at that level of experience and responsibility.

619
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,000
You wouldn't want to go further than that, so to speak,

620
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:34,360
like maybe have the head shifting and a little bit of the old deep, deep cranial implant work going.

621
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,480
Come on, fish, please.

622
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,660
You know, all this stuff is temporary, temporary solution.

623
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,620
We'll all be burned clean on X day.

624
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,960
I encourage you to make sure that your cranial implant is tuned appropriately.

625
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,240
I don't know.

626
00:24:51,300 --> 00:25:00,020
I know that you used to be able to find in Dobbs Town the doctors who could do the real good tune-ups on the cranial implants,

627
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,160
but I don't know if they're available anymore.

628
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,960
They've transitioned on.

629
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,940
Yeah, most of them.

630
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,180
They're so good at it now you can barely hear them running.

631
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,200
Mine keeps flashing midnight.

632
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,600
Well, here's a reason for that.

633
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,980
You're supposed to reset them before you use them again.

634
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:18,820
Geez.

635
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,880
I thought I was a Luddite.

636
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,780
Well, I guess somebody just doesn't like machines and wears wooden shoes.

637
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,240
I certainly wouldn't.

638
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,740
Well, I understand you're supposed to turn your cranial implants in for a tune-up every 50,000 miles.

639
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,740
Yeah, so many miles.

640
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,520
I don't know if that applies if you don't actually use the mileage.

641
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Maybe it's like so many months and so many miles.

642
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,280
Then it depends.

643
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,200
It depends on the conditions in which it's being stored.

644
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,300
If your brain is just in storage, you want to make sure it's climate-controlled.

645
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,940
You want to keep the relative humidity pretty low.

646
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,520
Low relative humidity, temperature around 72 degrees Fahrenheit.

647
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,600
Don't leave it in the back of the car.

648
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,260
Uh-oh.

649
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,000
That's a bad idea.

650
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,740
Think of it as a little baby or you're a little Pomeranian or something, whatever like that.

651
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,700
You don't want to suffocate.

652
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,700
Do Pomeranians come from Pomeroy, Ohio?

653
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,600
Yeah.

654
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,600
What about that?

655
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,080
Maybe.

656
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,660
Maybe a river from Pomeroy.

657
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,500
You can see all those corpses floating down there.

658
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,120
In the Ohio River.

659
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,960
In the last days of Pomeroy?

660
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,120
In the final days of Pomeroy.

661
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,980
Speaking of last days, let's pause for a moment.

662
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,380
Portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some listeners,

663
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,120
which is why we advise listener discretion.

664
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,200
And, of course, the views and opinions expressed on this program

665
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,940
are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University.

666
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,880
This is Synesthesia.

667
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,580
I'm Dr. Sinister.

668
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:57,100
We've got Governor Rocknar, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Wombat, Priestess Pisces, Dr. Howell,

669
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,520
Princess We Are Doe, and, of course, Reverend Ivan Stang here in the studio.

670
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,960
And we're anxious.

671
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,280
It doesn't matter.

672
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,920
Listen.

673
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:03,920


674
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,520
This is getting kind of crowded here.

675
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,580
It doesn't matter.

676
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,060
It doesn't matter.

677
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,520
It doesn't matter.

678
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,680
Give us a jingle.

679
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,980
Just give us a call and we'll see.

680
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,460
Stop that.

681
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,980
Stop it.

682
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,000
What kind of wombat you were in the past?

683
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,060
The wombat's poking me?

684
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,780
Oh, man.

685
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,520
We're never going to get that out.

686
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,480
Oh, that is my hand.

687
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,540
This is a shunned marriage.

688
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,100
Because I can't do many things for you.

689
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,700
It has teeth.

690
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,440
I warn you.

691
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,340
Oh, that's where about the teeth.

692
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,980
I have bigger peck of wood than my own two fry.

693
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,040
There's plenty to go around.

694
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,680
And look, look, look over there.

695
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,500
Dr. Howell is wearing a magnetic suitcase on his head.

696
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,720
He's being silly again.

697
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,600
Everyone is happy.

698
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,360
Yes, we are frolicking and dancing in utter spontaneous joy.

699
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,480
Bonto.

700
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,300
Bonto.

701
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,280
Bonto.

702
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,020
No longer restrained by society's laws and morals.

703
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,860
We're free.

704
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,500
Free.

705
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:02,860
Free.

706
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,280
Free.

707
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,860
And since the transition from analog to digital mind control waves, since the transition from

708
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,400
analog to digital mind control waves, just so you know, the tinfoil hats will now actually

709
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,340
amplify the signals.

710
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,800
Ah.

711
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,940
Very good.

712
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,340
Very good.

713
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,140
Really good to know.

714
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,700
That explains a lot.

715
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:20,900
Absolutely.

716
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,920
I wonder if we should switch some people over to Saran Wrap.

717
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,260
Oh, Saran Wrap.

718
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,780
Isn't that the guy who shot Robert Kennedy?

719
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,160
One of the suckers that tried that.

720
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,900
That was Saran wrap, Saran wrap, Saran ...

721
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,840
Then he went on to start a new wave band in the 80's.

722
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,780
Yes, that's true.

723
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,480
.

724
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,060
Okay, Saran ...

725
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,540
Hungry like the lone wolf.

726
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,060
Okay

727
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,740
Saran...

728
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,660
Saran ...

729
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,600
knocking using horn

730
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,660
And everybody is laughing.

731
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,740
And having fun at my expense.

732
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,400
Alright.

733
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,960
I'll get even. I will. I will.

734
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,160
Oh, the bathroom?

735
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,280
It's down the hall and to the right.

736
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,980
Let's get odd, yes.

737
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,080
It's always down the hall and to the right.

738
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,860
In fact, let's get irrational.

739
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,400
It's where the bathroom always is, down the hall and to the right.

740
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,940
Let's get odd.

741
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Oh, it's time for oddness.

742
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,900
I'm just going to eat everyone's forehead in about 45 seconds if we don't...

743
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,660
Are you referring to the blind bats of Venus?

744
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,820
Am I afraid of my burka? Of course not.

745
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,000
This was given to me by my new-new hexaguar back in the days when the princess reigned supreme.

746
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,900
She had no feet then, remember?

747
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,060
Like she'd float around like a Japanese ghost in the window.

748
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,740
I actually remember Magdalene wore a burka one year.

749
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,740
She wasn't supposed to be seen attending ex-days.

750
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,300
So she was concealed from head to toe in this flowing garment.

751
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,780
I remember it well.

752
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,500
Oh, me too. I have very good reasons.

753
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,680
I wore a burka.

754
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,260
I wore a burka to ex-day once because it was a quick costume.

755
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,540
Chrisley had a much better one.

756
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,760
Chrisley has a much better everything.

757
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,400
Yes, he certainly does.

758
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:12,900
That's kind of true.

759
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,600
Not to be confused with the congressman from New York State.

760
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,480
Or the horror actor who appeared with Peter Cushing.

761
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,640
No, they're the same.

762
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,960
The Chrisley that comes to ex-day is the same as the horror actor.

763
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,280
And the congressman?

764
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:28,740
Yeah.

765
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,260
Yeah.

766
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,200
All the same.

767
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,300
And the singer.

768
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,420
Have you ever heard Chrisley's album?

769
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,520
Christopher Lee's album?

770
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,000
You can't imagine.

771
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,640
Christopher Lee, the one who, actor from Horror of Dracula.

772
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,160
Imagine him singing The Streets of Laredo.

773
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,840
And he's not kidding.

774
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,880
Wow, that's what I want to hear.

775
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,600
It's on the Golden Throats collection with the William Shatner songs.

776
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,380
Get it, get it.

777
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,760
And did you ever hear that one of Frank and Nancy?

778
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,900
Nancy Sinatra's anti-drug song?

779
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:02,460
Yeah.

780
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:02,880
No, no.

781
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,640
That should be one of our anthems at ex-day, I think.

782
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,440
Susie the Sluzy sent me last year, because I thought it was the worst song ever,

783
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,300
was sent me a copy of Lightning's Girl.

784
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,880
Lightning's Girl?

785
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,140
Yes, by Nancy Sinatra.

786
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,720
You know, Nancy Sinatra did a couple of really awesome duets with Lee Hazelwood.

787
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,080
Yeah.

788
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,020
If the computer were working, I'd pull that up now, but it's not.

789
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,100
But you don't have lights.

790
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,800
You don't have lights.

791
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,100
I have a copy of Let's Duet by Dewey Cox in that box over there.

792
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,300
Oh.

793
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:35,740
Here.

794
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,640
Well, I'm...

795
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,760
Let's duet.

796
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,920
I was born in a high, high hurricane

797
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,740
Living high on air

798
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,180
In ways that make us feel good

799
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,400
I don't understand what all this bragging about is.

800
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,800
What are you guys talking about?

801
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,940
It sounds like you're honking each other's horns or something.

802
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,280
Oh, excuse me.

803
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,200
I know you're all sleeping.

804
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,340
I don't think that was the horn.

805
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,220
That was...

806
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,200
Keep your hands...

807
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,800
Get your hand off my horn barrel.

808
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,480
All right.

809
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:03,920
All right.

810
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,260
Let's have some decorum.

811
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,320
There's a whole bunch of stuff on here.

812
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,440
Let's sport a little...

813
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,020
The decorum?

814
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,980
...service here.

815
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,460
Some things are naturally indecorous.

816
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,560
How about we move that over there?

817
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,160
Do you see that?

818
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,480
Okay.

819
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,460
Yeah, just a little bit to the left.

820
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:19,980
Yeah.

821
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,800
Let's decorate.

822
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,180
And let's put...

823
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,700
Here.

824
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,680
I've got this here.

825
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,280
That's the frosting on the cake.

826
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,660
You can put that over there.

827
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,600
We aim to, please.

828
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,700
Okay.

829
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,120
Okay.

830
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,500
Okay.

831
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,980
I like it a lot better that way.

832
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:31,880
Yeah.

833
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,900
I think it works.

834
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,240
Yep.

835
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,680
And if Dave could move that there...

836
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,260
Okay.

837
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:37,800
That...

838
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,060
That looks nice on it.

839
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,480
I think you should leave it out.

840
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,280
Yeah.

841
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,860
I second that.

842
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,560
Can I maybe have the noble...

843
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,380
It still feels like it needs something, but I don't know what.

844
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:56,180
Well, I could move that over there when it is glowing.

845
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,480
Wait.

846
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,920
It is very hot, and I don't think you want to...

847
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,700
I do like it.

848
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,620
I don't like it here or there.

849
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,560
I do like it anywhere.

850
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,640
Oh, no!

851
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,040
And I do like green eggs and ham as anyone would who had tasted it.

852
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,260
I don't want to hear that story ever again.

853
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,240
They tortured me as a child with that story.

854
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,800
But did you ever actually get to eat the green eggs?

855
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,980
You know, if you're colorblind, the ham might look green even if it's not.

856
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,960
The eggs are green, as anyone who has raised chickens can tell you.

857
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,480
Every now and then, they lay a green one.

858
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,080
If you hard-boil an egg...

859
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,480
They're good.

860
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,580
If you hard-boil an egg, eventually the yolk will turn green.

861
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:28,980
No.

862
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,780
The eggs come out...

863
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,100
They come out of the chicken green.

864
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,660
The shell is a delightful green color.

865
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,220
And that's where you get the green eggs.

866
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,880
Well, just think how many different ways you could...

867
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,660
They're so good.

868
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,500
...the language of laying a ham.

869
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,220
Say you were...

870
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,080
You get some green hollandaise sauce with it?

871
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,300
Nobody lays no ham.

872
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,980
Well, have you ever fornicated the pig?

873
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,580
That's how you get the green aids.

874
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,320
Speak for yourself.

875
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,680
And we're not talking about green aids and ham.

876
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,120
But...

877
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
Green aids and ham?

878
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,920
Yes, exactly.

879
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,040
Now you're right.

880
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,300
I'm not really laughing at that, am I?

881
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,080
I don't know.

882
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,760
Actually, a regular caller to this program actually has AIDS, or he developed AIDS, but

883
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,300
he's got it in check now with his current regimen of medication, and he got married

884
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,840
this weekend.

885
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,240
So congratulations, Dean Keith, on your nuptials.

886
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,260
As Sarah Silverman said, if life gives you AIDS, make lemonades.

887
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,380
I feel like a bad person for finding her funny.

888
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,700
Oh, no.

889
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,200
You are.

890
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:27,940
She's not.

891
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,900
I don't think there's anything...

892
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:28,900


893
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,700
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

894
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,020
I think...

895
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,680
What I've seen of her, which is not very much...

896
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,480
She's such a nice Jewish girl.

897
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:34,920
...is quite funny.

898
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,120
Yeah, she's...

899
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,840
Oh, I couldn't stand that show.

900
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,200
I'm becoming depressed now.

901
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,620
Don't worry.

902
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,460
Don't be depressed.

903
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,400
It gets better.

904
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,800
Look, cornbread.

905
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,160
Cornbread?

906
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,920
Hot pastrami sandwich.

907
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,400
Yeah, maybe if you take that, it's going to make me feel better.

908
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,100
What?

909
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,660
Hot pastrami sandwich.

910
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,840
Reverend Stang, I want to thank you for telling that story at a DeVival years ago about talking

911
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,880
to a guy off the bridge, just with the words, hot pastrami sandwich.

912
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,940
Yeah, the guy was going, what?

913
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,280
Come on.

914
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
What is there to live for?

915
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,840
And it was a friend of a friend of mine who answered off the top of his head, a hot pastrami

916
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,260
sandwich.

917
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,860
And that made him come down.

918
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,840
The suicidal fellow thought about it for a second and said, you know, you're right.

919
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,400
And they both went off.

920
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,880
And it was in New York, I think, and they went and had a hot pastrami sandwich.

921
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,100
There's a whole chapter in the new Subgenius book about reasons why you shouldn't commit

922
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,880
subicide.

923
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,040
And that's one of the reasons why I'm no longer a vegetarian.

924
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,300
That's why there are no sub-substates anywhere on the sub-substates.

925
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,160
The allure of the pastrami.

926
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,360
Well, the main point of it was that God or Bob are going to kill you anyway, and they're

927
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,460
professionals at it.

928
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,980
By definition, you're an amateur.

929
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,940
So leave it to the pros, kids.

930
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,200
You know, you're just going to mess it up.

931
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,140
We were talking about that on the way over.

932
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,220
People who try to kill themselves by driving into the Grand Canyon, because they saw it

933
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:58,680
in a movie.

934
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,700
Well, guess what?

935
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,460
It's not really all that steep.

936
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,240
Well, you know what?

937
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,380
Actually, we do have something similar to that in the Cleveland area.

938
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,940
If you go off the road on I-480 right before you get to the bridge over the Cuyahoga Valley,

939
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,600
it is possible to drive right over the edge and into the valley below.

940
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,640
They have like a whole bunch of no parking signs, because when I used to live in Youngstown,

941
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,140
there was a strip with a huge gully.

942
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,000
And for some reason, there was like 47 no parking signs in a row right there, instead

943
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,660
of a normal street.

944
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,280
So it's like a normal guardrail or anything.

945
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,460
Just think of what it would be like to have a flat tire on the BQE in New York City during rush hour.

946
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,780
I can tell you exactly what that would be like.

947
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,200
What you need to do is lock yourself in your bathroom and scream at yourself for an hour.

948
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,020
Well, that hasn't helped so far.

949
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,640
I don't see why.

950
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,800
This has the ring of experience to it.

951
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,640
Boy, some folks sure know how to have fun.

952
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,500
Yeah.

953
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,100
You're accusing me of a peculiar form of fun, or somebody.

954
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,660
One of the coolest things I've heard in recent years about innovation is that you're not

955
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:58,660


956
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:58,720
going to have to run out of hydrogen sulfide.

957
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:58,720


958
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:58,720


959
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:58,720


960
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:58,720


961
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:58,720


962
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:58,720


963
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,060
But I think one of the greatest innovations in suicide was hydrogen sulfide.

964
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,640
Hmm.

965
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,180
If you can get enough like hydrogen sulfide, either create a chemical reaction that will

966
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,960
release it or bottle it up somehow.

967
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,520
And this is what's really sick about it is these people would sit in a car.

968
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,220
I guess in Japan.

969
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,820
It's been bigger in Japan than anywhere else, but they'll sit in their car.

970
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,120
Everything's in Japan.

971
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,480
Yeah.

972
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,860
Because it's such a small.

973
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,920
The Japanese are such small people.

974
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,940
They're like stonewashed cathedral or something.

975
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,900
I mean, what are you talking about?

976
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,520
What do they do?

977
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,160
They're not so small anymore.

978
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,940
Those stonewashed cathedrals aren't fashionable anymore.

979
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,580
But yeah, you sit in your car and you uncork a bottle of hydrogen sulfide, it'll kill you very quickly.

980
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,460
And then, when the authorities or whatever find your car, they see a dead body in there and they open it up.

981
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,720
They die too.

982
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,960
They die too, yes.

983
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,940
It releases all that hydrogen sulfide.

984
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,200
Oh, I see.

985
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,440
Well, you know, we are going to be seeing the movie classics at X-Day.

986
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,160
The endless monster movie, Bull Data Stream, will be flowing.

987
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,460
The Grindhouse.

988
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,380
There will be a 24-7 Grindhouse plus Dr. Dark's drive-in, which is showing Big Man Japan.

989
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,180
With subtitles.

990
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,120
With subtitles.

991
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,420
And believe you me, it is the weirdest Japanese monster movie you will ever see.

992
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,000
Yes.

993
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,080
I actually have the schedule of the Grindhouse films.

994
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,360
It's incredibly long.

995
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,140
Yeah.

996
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,420
But it looks really, really horrible.

997
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,320
I have a good one.

998
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,500
In a good way.

999
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,660
I mean, as you understand.

1000
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,720
I mean, like Radar Men from the Moon.

1001
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,460
Yeah.

1002
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,500
The Phantom Creeps.

1003
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:29,700
The Phantom Creeps.

1004
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,600
Leonard Nimoy is in that one.

1005
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,520
Horrors of Spider Island.

1006
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,740
Horrors of Spider Island.

1007
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,020
Incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-up zombies.

1008
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,340
Yes, we've all logged our hours with these.

1009
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,160
Frankenstein meets the Space Monster.

1010
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,540
Frankenstein meets the Space Monster.

1011
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,160
That's a pretty good one.

1012
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,420
Yeah, that's better than you think.

1013
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,300
I watched that about a month ago.

1014
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,580
That's not really too bad of a movie.

1015
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:49,860
Right.

1016
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,280
Let's see.

1017
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,120
What else is...

1018
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,200
Last Man on Earth.

1019
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,900
Last Man on Earth.

1020
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,180
The precursor to that I Am Legend Will Smith movie.

1021
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,540
It's actually a better version.

1022
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,780
And The Omega Man.

1023
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,800
So that's The Omega Man?

1024
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,620
The Omega Man is a remake of The Last Man on Earth.

1025
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,160
The Last Man on Earth.

1026
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,680
Yeah.

1027
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,480
Carnival of Souls.

1028
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,940
I'd Bury the Living.

1029
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,180
Oh, my gosh.

1030
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,960
There's classics like Plan 9 from Outer Space.

1031
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,320
Oh, yeah.

1032
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,680
Plan 69 from Outer Space.

1033
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,820
The Beast of Yucca Flats.

1034
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,980
With Tor Johnson.

1035
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,540
Yeah, that's a fun one.

1036
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,340
They didn't have sync sound capability, so whenever anybody speaks, they're being seen from behind.

1037
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,420
Here's a fun fact.

1038
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,100
They don't have to work hard on the dubbing.

1039
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:44,200
The Beast of Yucca Flats had Tor Johnson run up and down sand dunes to chase the kids in the movie,

1040
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,640
only he couldn't make it up the sand dunes,

1041
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,360
so they used a special crane to haul him up during the making.

1042
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,700
That must have eaten up half the budget.

1043
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,360
Maybe it's just something they had in their auto parts yard.

1044
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,920
A crane?

1045
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,220
That's what I read, yes, years ago.

1046
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,320
Don't ask me where.

1047
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,200
In that Tor Johnson classic, The Beast of Yucca Flats.

1048
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,960
Of course, wasn't radiation responsible?

1049
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,220
Isn't it always?

1050
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,860
It wasn't until quantum foam was discovered.

1051
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,500
Exactly.

1052
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,240
Now let's see.

1053
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,020
Also showing at Dr. Dark's drive-in is The Lost Skeleton Returns Again.

1054
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,100
Sequel to The Lost Skeleton of Cadavera.

1055
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,620
Yeah, those are actually pretty funny.

1056
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,900
Mexican horror, bees, classic, psychotronic, blah, blah.

1057
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,620
Planet Terror and Machete.

1058
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,140
Oh, those have to be seen.

1059
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,160
Did anyone ever see the Mexican movie The Brainiac?

1060
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,660
No.

1061
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,340
No.

1062
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,720
No, but I understand there's a shot from it in Arise.

1063
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,820
Yes, there is.

1064
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:01,160
Well, I used to live in Tucson, Arizona, and before everything got taken over by the conspiracy,

1065
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,500
they would show those Mexican monster movies late at night TV,

1066
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,760
and I saw many of them, K. Gordon Murray productions dubbed into English,

1067
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:16,180
and one of them is The Brainiac, where a sorcerer in the 17th century is condemned to death,

1068
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,720
and then he returns in the 20th century shooting down,

1069
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,740
from the sky like a meteor, and he lands near the car of the first unfortunate victims who go to investigate.

1070
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:33,080
And when he changes, he becomes something that looks like a devil pinata that sticks out a long tongue

1071
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,200
and sucks out the brains of the unfortunates who come in contact with him.

1072
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:45,040
Other brains, which he removes, he keeps in a carved Mexican chest and eats with a long silver spoon out of a gleaming goblet.

1073
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,340
Several times, this mise-en-scene is repeated in The Brainiac.

1074
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:55,640
But before he turns into the pinata, there's a shimmer or wobble effect.

1075
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:03,380
The interesting thing about this and all the other Mexican vampire movies is that you had the feeling when you watched them

1076
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,980
that they were made by people who believed it could be possible.

1077
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,500
People who really believed in vampires and monsters made these movies.

1078
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,520
And nowadays, in order for a Mexican movie to be broadcast on Arizona television,

1079
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,980
it has to first prove that it's being broadcast in the country legally.

1080
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,260
Exactly.

1081
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,320
They have to.

1082
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,320


1083
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,320


1084
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,320


1085
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,660
They would never show these old black and white kings anyway.

1086
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,360
They don't show old monster movies or even old movies anymore on television late at night.

1087
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,500
It's all infomercials and like that.

1088
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,940
That era has come and gone.

1089
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,380
You know, they recently introduced a bill in the Arizona legislature to change all the Spanish language place names in the state to English.

1090
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,220
Like, it's not going to be the city of Mesa anymore.

1091
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,080
It's going to be the city of Table.

1092
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,100
You are kidding, aren't you?

1093
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,140
You're not sure if I'm kidding or not, are you?

1094
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,300
Right, I'm not sure.

1095
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,500
As a former resident of Arizona, I can tell you some of that already goes on.

1096
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,040
For example,

1097
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:56,200
on the border of Arizona and Mexico is the city of Sasaabe, if you're on the Mexican side,

1098
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,620
and Sasabee, if you're on the American side.

1099
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,520
Well, yeah, sure.

1100
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,660
It's the same city, but the border runs through it.

1101
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,920
There's something instead of Buena Vista, it's Buena Vista.

1102
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,300
Good view.

1103
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,220
Damn it, we're Americans, call it nice view.

1104
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,100
What do they call it?

1105
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,220
Buena Vista.

1106
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,520
Buena Vista.

1107
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,100
Oh, sure.

1108
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,240
There used to be a restaurant in Warren, Ohio called the Buena Vista.

1109
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
You know, we were talking about the movies.

1110
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,440
Did we mention all of the music?

1111
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,780
Because I don't remember if we did.

1112
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,820
Did we mention the music?

1113
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,440
No, we did not mention all of the music.

1114
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,940
The Buena Vista still exists.

1115
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,720
I thought it was called the Buena Vista.

1116
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,080
No, the Buena Vista.

1117
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,720
See, my grandma who lived in Warren called it the Buena Vista.

1118
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:48,200
The music of X-Day includes the torch singer, Fat Man D, and her husband, Tommy Amoeba.

1119
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,040
Tommy Amoeba, yeah.

1120
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,220
Tommy Amoeba.

1121
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,880
He's more Devo than Devo.

1122
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,160
Andrew the Impaled, who not only plays music, but also hurts himself.

1123
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,920
The Saint Sebastian of X-Day.

1124
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:06,780
Boron Nuzzle, which is a sort of Bull Dada band.

1125
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,120
Veterans of the Detroit Divide.

1126
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,560
One of the guys in the band has prescription 3D glasses.

1127
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,180
Electronic music, if you like it, folks.

1128
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,500
That's Boron Nuzzle.

1129
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,580
Yes, Sid Redland.

1130
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,260
He's one of the...

1131
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,940
Do you remember when those guys passed out on stage?

1132
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:29,320
Cult of Sears, Duke of Uke, the Six-Fisted Tales of Connie, which is the jam band.

1133
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,040
It's jam-packed with down-home goodness.

1134
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,000
We mentioned Zero Defects.

1135
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,560
We mentioned...

1136
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:40,300
Oh, the Ministry of Slap People are there.

1137
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,820
I always seem to leave them out.

1138
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:49,160
Also, there's going to be DJ Tubings, DJ 720K, DJ Sam Snow, DJ Graham.

1139
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,760
Bring earplugs.

1140
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,680
Bring earplugs.

1141
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:58,800
720K and DJ Gravity are both from the Youngstown area, and I think Sam Snow also is from Youngstown.

1142
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,360
Actually, you mentioned wear earplugs, and that is our public service announcement for the hour.

1143
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,600
Wear earplugs.

1144
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,540
You're going to need them to keep the wiggle worms out.

1145
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,860
If you want to live to hear the music another day.

1146
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,080
Yes, that's true.

1147
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,720
You're on to it.

1148
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,220
Did we mention the Evolution Control Committee?

1149
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,840
Yes.

1150
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,120
We did mention the Evolution Control Committee and Zero Defects.

1151
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:33,100
I'm going to be very embarrassed when I run into Trademark because I interviewed him like two years ago and never sent him a copy of the interview like I said I would, so I'll be bringing it to him the next day.

1152
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,160
Oh, you are going to be there?

1153
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,200
Yes.

1154
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,140
Good, good.

1155
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,260
At least for a couple of days.

1156
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:49,220
You know, I got a call from somebody just before we were leaving saying, I read in the program book that the registration closes down at 4 o'clock on Saturday, and we were going to get there at 5 o'clock on Saturday.

1157
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:49,840
Oh.

1158
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,900
And I actually picked up the phone, which is something I rarely ever do.

1159
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,260
Pick up the phone now and call.

1160
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,380
And said, I reassured her, no, don't worry, we're not Nazis.

1161
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,180
You can pay first and we'll ask questions later.

1162
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,620
Or something like that.

1163
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,280
Maybe we are.

1164
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,320
We spit.

1165
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:16,900
Don't, you know, it's like, just ask Reverend Stang and he'll tell you to go ask Pisces.

1166
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,880
That's exactly what will happen.

1167
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,120
Yes.

1168
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,560
Or 39.

1169
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,780
Just ask the public.

1170
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:31,540
I made a public service announcement earlier where I explained to everyone that you have until the 28th to ask me stupid questions.

1171
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,960
The 28th of June.

1172
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,160
Yes.

1173
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,280
After the 28th of June, there are no more, you're not allowed to ask me, well, you can ask stupid questions.

1174
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,480
Yeah, the month of June is a bad answer.

1175
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,540
But after that point, I won't answer them.

1176
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,660
The month of June really is actually the month of Connie in a way.

1177
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,280
The leafy month of June.

1178
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,060
The origin of the name of the month of June.

1179
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,780
Of course, is the Roman goddess Juno.

1180
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,320
And the name Juno is cognate.

1181
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:53,940
I didn't know.

1182
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,540
Yeah.

1183
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,980
And the name Juno is cognate with the Greek word gyno.

1184
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,760
The letter gamma in modern Greek is often pronounced like a sound.

1185
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,960
And of course, the letter Y, when you see that in a Greek word, well, they don't have a letter Y in Greek.

1186
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,300
They have the epsilon, which is like a letter U.

1187
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,620
Gyno, cuny, cony.

1188
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,360
In Spanish, they call it the Greek Y.

1189
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,220
You think I speak of country matters?

1190
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,140
So are you saying that June is the guna?

1191
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:19,780
Of the year?

1192
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:20,900
Oh, it is.

1193
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,940
It is the most.

1194
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,860
The most vaginous year.

1195
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:24,600
Oh, yes.

1196
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,300
Well, it's the weddings.

1197
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,820
Of course.

1198
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,340
Most weddings happen in June.

1199
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,680
That seems to be popular.

1200
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,420
And I see that also you're getting.

1201
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,540
I was at one this year.

1202
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,400
Your shift is going all the way from springy, wingy, dingy to summer, summer, dumber.

1203
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:40,940
And there's a lot of light.

1204
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,000
Don't you get too springy?

1205
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,600
Which, as anybody who knows chickens knows, that a lot of light makes for a lot of.

1206
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,940
Come here, baby.

1207
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:53,720
Well, just the same way chickens, they want to make eggs and so forth.

1208
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:54,760
They do.

1209
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,280
They must.

1210
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,340
It keeps coming back to eggs.

1211
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,000
The humble chicken is, of course, descended from Tyrannosaurus Rex.

1212
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,520
We all know.

1213
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:01,920
Some say.

1214
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,740
Some say.

1215
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,060
Not I.

1216
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:03,820
I like to pretend.

1217
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,820
Tyrannosaurus Rex, a great king indeed.

1218
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,040
The last true great king that I would vote for if it wasn't a.

1219
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,360
Six-semper Tyrannosaurus.

1220
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,980
Six-semper Tyrannosaurus, exactly.

1221
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,240
I wonder if that was the case, would there be a naked Tyrannosaurus boob on my stage?

1222
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,040
I've never seen a.

1223
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,280
Tyrannosaurus with clothes on, though.

1224
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,340
Well, no, I meant just that.

1225
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,920
Would the Tyrannosaurus be showing boob?

1226
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,320
I'm afraid I have.

1227
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,260
Remember that stupid show, Dinosaurs, with the guys in monster suits?

1228
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,340
But there was no Tyrannosaurus on the show.

1229
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,580
Yeah, I don't think any of those conformed to any specific species.

1230
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:41,060
They did conform, but they didn't actually have a Tyrannosaurus because they would have

1231
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:41,440
disturbed.

1232
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,580
They had a conference before the show ever began.

1233
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,620
The Tyrannosaurus's distinctive small arm with only two fingers would have disturbed.

1234
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,120
Right.

1235
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,380
Mother and father America.

1236
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,440
So they ended up with a hybrid Megalosaurus species for the dad.

1237
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:58,140
The mom, an ornithopod of some kind, and so was the son.

1238
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,380
Ornithopod, like having bird-like feet?

1239
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:07,120
The boss of the supposedly carnivorous dad was a Styracosaurus, but feared nonetheless.

1240
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,200
Why is it that every sitcom has a big oafish dad?

1241
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,640
Because they don't dare have a big oafish mom and a smart, hip dad.

1242
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,620
I've decided that the official dinosaur of Pisceans is the Squalodon.

1243
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,200
Squalodon.

1244
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,180
The Squalodon.

1245
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,180
Squalodon.

1246
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,360
That's a story too tawdry to tell.

1247
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:30,500
But there was a Carcharodontosaurus and another one that were larger than Tyrannosaurus.

1248
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:35,900
Larger carnivores than poor old dethroned Tyrannosaurus rex.

1249
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,360
Spinosaurus was the one that was the...

1250
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,880
Spinosaurus was larger, yes.

1251
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:48,320
But in addition to Spinosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus, there's also Giganotosaurus, a gigantic allosaurid.

1252
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,080
And then?

1253
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:54,020
Allosaurids and Tyrannosaurids are not related according to current opinions.

1254
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,180
Well, of course the Allosaur is the other lizard.

1255
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,320
And then Godzillosaurus, the hugest one of all.

1256
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,000
That's fair.

1257
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,720
And Cloverfieldosaurus, the ugliest one.

1258
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:12,920
Some people place Tyrannosaurus with the Dromaeosaurus, who are of course related to Deinonychus,

1259
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,100
Velociraptor and all that kind of thing.

1260
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,880
Really? I didn't know that.

1261
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,840
Yes, they are an enlarged form of that.

1262
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,360
They're not that big of a size, supposedly.

1263
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,660
But what about the Dabasaur?

1264
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,840
The Dabasaur?

1265
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:23,900
Oh, that's a tiny dinosaur.

1266
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,100
Well, a little dabble, do you?

1267
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,000
Smart, Ian.

1268
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,260
You know, what you have to do is go deeply into the records.

1269
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:36,040
And many things have already been dug up, but they have not been prepared by the museum people.

1270
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,340
That takes a long time.

1271
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,140
So many discoveries have already been made.

1272
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,500
The skeleton is almost perfect.

1273
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,860
It's lacking only a head.

1274
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,820
Go to Crate 62 and bring me the head of that creature.

1275
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,480
The Camarasaurus.

1276
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,220
We will name this thing, yes, Thunder Lizard, Brontosaurus.

1277
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,720
I'll be famous!

1278
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,500
Before Camarasaurus, did it have a mullet?

1279
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,200
Huh?

1280
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,020
Did the Camarasaurus have a mullet?

1281
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:07,560
It had a distinctive shaped head, like its friend, the Brachiosaurus.

1282
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:11,640
But it was not a Diplodocid the way the actual Brontosaurus was.

1283
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,120
So it had the wrong head.

1284
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,820
But, you know, if you look at the big picture, there were huge Camarasaurus.

1285
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,820
The size of a Patasaurus.

1286
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,840
So what's the difference?

1287
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:29,300
The only difference is now not the head, but the arch of the back, which is different in Camarasaurus and Patasaurus.

1288
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,040
The Camarasaurus used to get in races with the GTO-asaurus, and then all of a sudden the Firebird-asaurus would show up.

1289
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,280
And then they would call them Papasaurus.

1290
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,980
Because you can't have any drag racing in that era.

1291
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,080
The Brontosaurus, a moving mountain of flesh and bone.

1292
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,920
How many times have I heard that?

1293
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,840
My son, you know, has been...

1294
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,160
has been writing a script based on Bone Wars.

1295
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,620
Martian Cope.

1296
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,160
And at one point he worked and Marsh is making this...

1297
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,660
he's ending a speech with these amazing creatures, too huge to leave the water.

1298
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,380
These hairless, gigantic, cold-blooded, mindless creatures.

1299
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,840
In other words, basically every single thing we were brought up to believe that was wrong.

1300
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,060
It's not wrong.

1301
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,140
Pardon me.

1302
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,100
But nothing has been proven.

1303
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,020
There is a fad in paleontology.

1304
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:20,600
There you go.

1305
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,500
We need to sift out the evidence.

1306
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,180
Nothing indicates that so-called Brontosaurus was endothermic or warm-blooded.

1307
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,000
Nothing indicates that it did not go in the water.

1308
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:38,660
In fact, there are ichthyological traces which have always been interpreted as the fact that it was swimming and with its front feet.

1309
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,840
But, of course, they spent most of their time outside the water.

1310
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:43,820
Like a pirate.

1311
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,740
I don't know if there was only time, I could tell you.

1312
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,940
But time is a thing of dragonflies and angels.

1313
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,060
The former live too little and the latter live too long.

1314
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,440
And we are running out of it here on a most enjoyable...

1315
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,660
Rerunning out of it, I should say.

1316
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,940
Yes, it'll be rerun again in the summer.

1317
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,320
I'm tailing it right out of it.

1318
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,380
But to remember, folks, it's not over until it's over.

1319
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,280
And don't believe everything you hear, especially about feathers and dinosaurs.

1320
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,700
No, you must believe everything.

1321
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,740
Especially the things that...

1322
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,060
I'm sorry.

1323
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:14,440
...contradicted you.

1324
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,240
...on July 7th.

1325
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,160
I'm sorry.

1326
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,460
Just compartmentalize.

1327
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,840
If you can believe many contradictory things, some of them will definitely be right.

1328
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:22,820
Well...

1329
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,240
If you believe everything, something's true.

1330
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:24,860
...none of them will.

1331
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,520
That's the hard part.

1332
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,720
Everything I predicted will come true sooner or later.

1333
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,560
Millions of years ago...

1334
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,560
And you are dinosaurs.

1335
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,000
...go to the Earth.

1336
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:35,960
Millions.

1337
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,680
Yeah.

1338
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,540
Yeah, this has been a very special episode of Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

1339
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:43,720
Thank you.

1340
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,000
Thank you for having me.

1341
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,000


1342
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,000


1343
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,000


1344
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,000


1345
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,000


1346
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,800
I want to thank Dr. Howell.

1347
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,540
Of course, you can hear him on his program Puzzling Evidence.

1348
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,400
Are you still on KPFA out there?

1349
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,000
Yes, that's right.

1350
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:56,080
I'm on KPFA and at RadioValencia.fm, with my own show that Friday night.

1351
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:02,180
Look for our podcasts from San Francisco's pirate radio station, RadioValencia.fm.

1352
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:07,460
So the way it is is I've got two shows within 24 hours of each other, and they're kind of

1353
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,660
indistinguishable because Puzzling Evidence comes over to my show and makes it sound like

1354
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,120
his show.

1355
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,880
Oh, no!

1356
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,080
Yes, he has. He's put in telephone commercials and so on,

1357
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,600
right in the middle while I'm reciting some poem or something.

1358
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,480
But there you go.

1359
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,860
Anyway, it continues.

1360
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,140
That's why they call him Buzzing Evidence.

1361
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,900
Well, everyone, praise Bob.

1362
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,720
What about your live shows?

1363
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,040
They're temporarily on hiatus, but we will start up again in the fall.

1364
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:39,560
And people who visit New York City might wish to tack on to my museum tours

1365
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,340
at the American Museum of Natural History this November.

1366
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,260
What?

1367
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,820
There's no time to continue this plug-ola, but just keep...

1368
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,500
We're not telling anyone they need to go there.

1369
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,440
No calls to action, no prices given out.

1370
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,500
The whole museum is going with us at X Day anyway.

1371
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,280
It's all a contingency plan.

1372
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,700
At long last, real estate in Manhattan will be reasonably priced once you...

1373
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,440
Yes, take it along in Chinese take-out food containers.

1374
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,840
Well, I will let you guys have fun with the rest of your evening.

1375
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,340
I need to go back to...

1376
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,760
Preparing for the coming week's events.

1377
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,040
Good night, sweet priestess.

1378
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,520
Good to hear from you.

1379
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,200
Good to hear from you.

1380
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,560
See you in the all-together at X Day.

1381
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,100
Absolutely.

1382
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,600
See you on the saucers.

1383
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:21,840
I love you all.

1384
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:22,940
Kisses.

1385
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,360
Mwah.

1386
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,600
Au revoir.

1387
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,560
And I will talk to you soon.

1388
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,780
There she goes.

1389
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,280
Whoa, cut off in our prime.

1390
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,720
Well, that's it for our show tonight.

1391
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,140
Take care, folks.

1392
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,540
All right, thank you, Wombat.

1393
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,960
Thank you.

1394
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,140
And thank you, Dave.

1395
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,300
Thank you, sir.

1396
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,660
Thank you, Ragnar.

1397
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,800
You still there, Ragnar?

1398
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,700
Don't tell me he passed out on the air.

1399
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,180
He's sleeping.

1400
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,880
See, like, no money mark has been known to fall asleep on the air sometimes.

1401
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,420
You can actually hear him snoring.

1402
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,340
He's not the only one in this room who's been known to fall asleep.

1403
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:04,120
Hey, I'm often sleep-deprived, and then I get Pedro-bombed when I go in.

1404
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,960
See, but that's the wonderful thing about sleep deprivation,

1405
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,840
is that it'll start making you hallucinate,

1406
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,240
and that makes for some very interesting...

1407
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,400
Yeah.

1408
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:09,540
...interesting radio.

1409
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,580
Well, why do you think Dave does it?

1410
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,220
I...

1411
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:13,960
I...

1412
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,200
I...

1413
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:14,780
Don't...

1414
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,760
Don't spoil the secret, man.

1415
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,300
It's like...

1416
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,160
That's like explaining that the Wizard of Oz is a man behind the curtain.

1417
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:20,980
I didn't want to hear that.

1418
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,960
Well, he's partly that, but he's also more.

1419
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,320
Yeah.

1420
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,520
Who's calling in here?

1421
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,760
Okay, we got a local caller here.

1422
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,480
Oh, but they hung up too quick.

1423
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:33,800
Well...

1424
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,700
They hung up.

1425
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,100
But I thought we were hung up.

1426
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:36,860
I thought we were done.

1427
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,820
We got more...

1428
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,260
We got...

1429
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,180
We got a lot of hangups.

1430
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:39,220
We got a lot of hangups.

1431
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:39,220


1432
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:39,220


1433
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:39,220


1434
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:39,320
We got a lot of hangups here.

1435
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,480
Well, I...

1436
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,360
I thought we were going to pack up our tents and...

1437
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,340
Well, the following program is not quite ready, so I guess we're just going to continue listening

1438
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,160
to the...

1439
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,040
Subgenius Power of Switch.

1440
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,240
Where are we, Bob?

1441
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,820
Where are we?

1442
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:08,480
Post Office Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118subgenius.com.

1444
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1445
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1446
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1447
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1448
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1449
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1450
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1451
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1452
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1453
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1454
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1455
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1456
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1457
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,200


1458
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:17,980
Did I forget to mention that after X Day, after the saucers again failed to arrive

1459
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:26,060
at 7 AM July 5th, and after we struck the set and made way for the Starwood sets and

1460
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:33,720
packed up our stuff and went back to the big house, that I slept for a total of 16 hours.

1461
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,080
First I slept for four hours in the afternoon.

1462
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,160
Then I got up and did some...

1463
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,720
Some media-related stuff.

1464
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,940
Then I slept for 12 hours straight.

1465
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:53,300
I woke up with severe physical pain all over my whole body from the effort of doing so

1466
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,580
much while in what you call show mode.

1467
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,120
It must be what...

1468
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,960
You know, when somebody has to transform into a superhero, and they feel great and powerful,

1469
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,880
but then when they transform back, they feel like crap.

1470
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,480
And not because of a hangover or anything like that.

1471
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,160
It's because of the superpowers.

1472
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,240
When they go away, you're...

1473
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,460
Oh, God.

1474
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,920
Everything hurts, inside and out.

1475
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,700
But it's worth it.

1476
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:32,440
I did have to recharge again Wednesday night and did a radio interview on Oberon Zell's

1477
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:32,940
podcast.

1478
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,520
He's the head of the Church of All Worlds, a sort of a swingers cult.

1479
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:38,860
I'm not sure if you've heard of it.

1480
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:45,260
And I have to recharge myself, because I'm the headlining speaker on Saturday night at

1481
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:45,880
Starwood.

1482
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:51,500
I have to be in top shape to just improv off the top of my head.

1483
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,080
Why is this truck driving straight at me?

1484
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:55,560
Ah!
