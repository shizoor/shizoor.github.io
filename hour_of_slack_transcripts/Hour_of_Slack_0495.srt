1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Open your heart, unzip your pants, close your mind, and bend over,

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,040
because you're about to receive the Word of Bob!

3
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,380
Do you want to pour it down?

4
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,380
Do you want to pour it?

5
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:12,100
Do you want to, do you want to, do you want to pour it?

6
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,760
Do you want to pour it?

7
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,580
Do you want to pour it?

8
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,900
Oh yes, dear friends, and we're back!

9
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,300
Yes, friends.

10
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,700
We're back!

11
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,380
We're back!

12
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,220
That wonderful hour.

13
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,300
Friends, that bad hour.

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,540
That one-time hour, friends.

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,020
That mysterious hour.

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,700
That poltergeist-infested hour, yes.

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,340
Friends, the poltergeist is working tonight, because one of these tape decks won't turn off.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,640
Get your finger out of the hole there, Dr. Stang, you're liable to hurt yourself.

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,520
There you go.

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,980
Well, let's turn on the dampers and see if we can get the nuclear power plant started here, doctor.

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,720
I'm anxious to take off.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:57,920
Okay.

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,240
Take off.

24
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,400
Take off.

25
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,600
Oh, wait a minute.

26
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,500
Would you get all those guys out of the other side there, please?

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,680
What'd you do, doctor?

28
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,960
Central control processor on.

29
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,020
There, central control is on, doctor.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,100
Good, good.

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Okay, you want to close the watertight doors here?

32
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,020
Uh, yeah.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,720
Oh, watch out for that squid, man.

34
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,240
There's a prairie squid right by the door.

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,820
Speaking of which.

36
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,500
And, uh, inject some of those collar soles, would you, into the, uh, retro, retribution chamber?

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,080
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,420
Oh, wh-

39
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,920
Well, we really-

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,720
Yes, line two has a prayer request.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,020
Is that so, well, friends?

42
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,820
Well, tell them to pray.

43
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:40,540
That's right, they're just, you're just gonna have to pray, friends, because, uh, Pastor Naked ain't here and-

44
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,120
They've been injected now.

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,240
Read a contract check sequence.

46
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:52,940
You know, as, uh, like, last week we, uh, we had the, the all-female callers, but, and we wouldn't let any tool-using primates call in.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Tool-bearing primates, I believe is the proper term.

48
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,260
Yes, only the, only the- that's right.

49
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:02,120
And, uh, and tonight, not even, not, not even the, the tool-bearing ones, nor the-

50
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,360
Not even the faithful.

51
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,000
Not even the faithful will talk on the phone tonight, friends.

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,760
Nay, friends.

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,660
No, there's enough motor mouthing going on here in the control room.

54
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,320
We don't need help from outside.

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,200
Because we've got to talk to you tonight about something very, very important.

56
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,040
We're talking about conservation of a natural resource, friends.

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,660
Yes.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,040
My dear friends, when was the last time you had you a good old prairie squid, eh?

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,240
Yeah, prairie squid.

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,700
Now, what, what sort of evocations does that name bring up to you, friends?

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,920
Prairie squid.

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,640
It even makes my microphone pop.

63
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,200
Well, we're gonna, uh, probably half of our audience doesn't even know.

64
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,080
What, what is that?

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,340
Half of our audience has probably never seen what, well, it's, you left the airlock open.

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,020
Yeah, so, yeah, that's, that's what that is.

67
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,180
Oh, kill the airlock.

68
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,780
Yeah, well.

69
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,580
Okay.

70
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,140
Okay.

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,300
Friends, let me tell you something.

72
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,920
First off.

73
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,080
Let's get serious about this, doctor.

74
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,760
Number one. First of all.

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,940
The set deck two is not working.

76
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,760
And the, the ports on the starboard side are completely...

77
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,940
That's okay, yeah.

78
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,800
We're losing air fast, and we're gonna, we're gonna have to, we're gonna have to try to keep up with it, friends.

79
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,660
Well, I'll open up this big blue cylinder of church air over here, doctor.

80
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,820
Ah, yes, heavens.

81
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,720
Oh, now I feel considerably better.

82
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,840
Ah, yes.

83
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,720
Now, baby, this church air is really...

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,360
Oh, yes, praise God, I feel that church air now.

85
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,060
Yeah.

86
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,380
Dude, you feel it.

87
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,540
Friends, can you feel it out there in the radio audience?

88
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,500
I bet you can.

89
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,300
I bet you can.

90
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,680
Yeah.

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,800
If you can't reach out and feel it, friends.

92
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,020
And if you can't reach down and feel it, then you're gonna, and then you probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

93
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,840
You probably don't even care what one tastes like.

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:54,840
When you were, when you, now, I know about half our audience, Dr. Gordon, probably unders, probably remember when they were teenage boys and girls out in the, you know, west Texas or wherever they're from.

95
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,180
Going out in the fields and taking off their clothes and spreading some prairie squid bait all over, you know.

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,860
Yes, yeah.

97
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,640
What did you used to use for, I used jelly mostly.

98
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,540
Yeah, I found...

99
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,340
Honey, whatever I could steal from my folks.

100
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,880
Peanut butter with bananas in it worked real well.

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,360
Yeah.

102
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,900
Yeah, I found that with...

103
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,880
And those...

104
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,180
Excuse me, I'm still decompressing from all that traveling, doctor.

105
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,280
Those squids, would they be crawling out of the woodwork?

106
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:21,980
Yes, indeed.

107
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,800
Out of the brush?

108
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,820
Out of the weeds, so to speak.

109
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:24,820


110
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,540
You just lay there and wait for them.

111
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,180
And there you were.

112
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,220
And be quiet, because you'd scare them away.

113
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:29,600
Yeah, you had to be quiet.

114
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,320
They're very...

115
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,900
And you know, it's just, just to give you an example, it's just like, do you remember back when you were a kid, there were all those thousands of those little cute horny toads around?

116
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,700
And why do you think they called them horny toads, friends?

117
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,100
Yeah, because they, they counter exist, you know.

118
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,480
They're part of a symbiotic relationship with that favorite outdoor mollusk of ours.

119
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,180
Yes, and dare we say the name again?

120
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,400
The mighty prairie squid.

121
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,060
Prairie squid, yes.

122
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,220
Oh, yes.

123
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:02,880
And of course, as you know, Dr. Stang, I have just come back from a fact-finding tour through the Amazonas regions of Brazil.

124
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:12,840
Yes, friends, just to fill you in exactly on what's going on here, we have as our special guest tonight, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

125
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,760
Yes, indeed.

126
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:24,040
The erstwhile head of the Green Hill-Dobstown encampment, and now commandant of Dobstown II in, just outside Rio de Janeiro.

127
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,620
Yes, friends, right on the coast where the surf is high and so is everybody else usually.

128
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:42,460
And, uh, friends, you know, and this, what you're listening to, dear friends, is the hour of slack on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

129
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,200
Now that the uranium has warmed up, the airlock leak has been stopped, I think it's about time we launched this show, doctor.

130
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,920
Ah, I can feel that, the mighty thrust of that show lifting.

131
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,860
It's lifting us up higher and higher.

132
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,440
That thrust, yeah.

133
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,360
As Dr. Mothersbaugh's beautiful hymn, the Bobcata, plays in the background.

134
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,420
And maybe if I hit this tape deck hard enough.

135
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,080
Hit it hard. Here, wait a minute. Let me shoot it for you, doctor. Just hold on.

136
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,780
Please do.

137
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,040
Huh!

138
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,020
That do any good? I don't think so.

139
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,060
Felt good to me.

140
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,460
Yeah.

141
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,800
Well, look, why don't we just, um.

142
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,100
Let's kill that deck.

143
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,160
Why don't we just throw it away? Why don't we just throw it through the plate glass window?

144
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:21,540
Okay.

145
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,760
Hank, go ahead.

146
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,900
There it goes, friends.

147
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,160
And, yes, yes, yes.

148
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,440
Well, we're one tape deck short and four cards loose here, but.

149
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:42,680
But friends, this is, uh, we're gonna focus on an endangered species that probably, you know, half of you who weren't raised in the south probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

150
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,240
And we might as.

151
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:53,180
Maybe we ought to identify, you know, just so people will know, who don't know what a prairie squid is, doctor, perhaps we ought to at first, sort of, as best we can define.

152
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,820
Our terms and say that a prairie squid is really.

153
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,740
It's a sort of a physical metaphor for a lot of things, and it's probably exactly what you think we're talking about.

154
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,040
Well, it's not a metaphor.

155
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,640
It's a, it's an endangered species.

156
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,500
Yes, I know.

157
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,900
That used to live on prairies.

158
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,640
And the fact that most of these callers don't even know what a prairie squid is.

159
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,700
Well, they don't even know what a prairie is.

160
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,720
It's all been covered up with.

161
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,220
Most of them.

162
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,780
Los Colinas.

163
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,560
Yeah, that's right.

164
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
And all that kind of stuff, right?

165
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,560
Yeah.

166
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,080
Well.

167
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,740
Throw this.

168
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,380
Yeah, but at the same time, it is a metaphor for existence, Doug.

169
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,220
The very struggle of.

170
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,000
Who's Doug?

171
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,780
Of the prairie squid.

172
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,660
Doug, the guy over there.

173
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,000
The struggle, the struggle of the poor.

174
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,500
Now, friends, you know, you do see prairie squids nowadays.

175
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,000
You can go to the supermarket.

176
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,480
Yeah.

177
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,520
And buy a dead cellophane wrapped.

178
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,500
Plucked.

179
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,340
Shaved prairie squid.

180
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:43,740
Yeah.

181
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,440
I mean.

182
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,100
It's shocking.

183
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:45,660
It's shocking.

184
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,500
To us, to us old timers.

185
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,860
I mean, most of you, you, you.

186
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,660
That's the only way you're ever going to see it.

187
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,960
They've never seen them alive.

188
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,400
I know.

189
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,880
And a lot of people don't even know that they are actually a wild animal.

190
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:07,220
And friends, that's such a waste because frankly, frankly, what the prairie squid is best used for is the sexual act.

191
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,640
Yes.

192
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,440
Sexual congress.

193
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,480
And I, I'm, you know, I, I know this may, we don't want to offend any radio.

194
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,940
But it's a, it's a, it's a well-known fact, Dr. Stang.

195
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,020
Yeah.

196
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,480
I mean, you can look in the encyclopedia under prairie squid.

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
Under prairie, under squid sub prairie.

198
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,900
Or subgenius.

199
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,220
Yes.

200
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,760
And it'll say, see, subgenius, see prairie squid.

201
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,360
Exactly.

202
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,820
And, and, you know, yes, it is.

203
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,920
That's its best use.

204
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,960
And some people might find that offensive.

205
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:39,040
But they're the people that don't like to think about things like that because sometimes they're not sure how to do things like that.

206
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,920
Or they're afraid that somebody will laugh at them if they said that they did something like that.

207
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,380
That they, they had them a prairie squid or two.

208
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,160
Oh, most of them think the prairie squid is a myth.

209
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,900
Oh, yeah.

210
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,820
They get real embarrassed if you talk about a prairie squid in, in polite society.

211
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,300
The polished ears of the rationalists.

212
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,860
Yes, oh, yes, yes.

213
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,720
The modernist, the so-called.

214
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,620
The politically correct ears of the various groups.

215
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,580
Humanistic.

216
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,300
Yes.

217
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:10,620
You know, if they were humanists, if they were really concerned about humanity, they'd, they'd free the prairie squid prisoners.

218
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,080
And they'd quit killing prairie squids and making purses and shoes out of them.

219
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,880
Well, I mean, it's, it's, it's worse than, than killing whales for dog food, Reverend Stang.

220
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,960
I mean, if you think about it, I mean, at least, at least you're benefiting some canines who would otherwise not have anything else to eat.

221
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,880
But the very idea of killing and tanning prairie squid and turning them into purses and basketball shoes.

222
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,220
It's repellent, it's repellent to anyone who's really lived with nature.

223
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:45,220
Anyone who is really a nature-oriented person who's concerned about the environment would, would with, despite the stigma, despite the embarrassment.

224
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,520
They would be proud, Doctor.

225
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,620
They would be proud.

226
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,100
They would be proud.

227
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,860
Nay, they would find it their duty.

228
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,480
Bob born duty.

229
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,460
Duty, my dude.

230
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,040
Duty, yes.

231
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,060
To seek out that prairie squid and, and protect them.

232
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,660
And, and nurture.

233
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,040
I mean.

234
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,960
And nurture that prairie squid.

235
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,060
Oh, look at it.

236
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,980
We got a note here.

237
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,480
There's an anti-Bob person on line two.

238
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,520
It's probably somebody who doesn't like this show.

239
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,700
Probably doesn't like to think about prairie squid.

240
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
They probably don't.

241
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,800
Let's go ahead and give it a try, shall we?

242
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,940
Well, if they, if they've got nerve.

243
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,340
Hold on.

244
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,520
Hold on.

245
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,440
Hold on.

246
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,860
Hold on.

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,000


248
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,060
Oh, I'm.

249
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,360
Get, get that microphone out of your ear, Doctor.

250
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,140
Hello?

251
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,180
Oh.

252
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,520
Oh.

253
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,340
Close the airlock, Doctor.

254
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,020
Dear friend, can you hear us?

255
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,380
No.

256
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,060
Well, the poltergeists are back in the, in the board again, Doctor.

257
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,780
And I think that we're just.

258
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,120
Dear friend, are you out there?

259
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,240
They're blinking.

260
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,820
They're sorta.

261
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,520
Oh, yes.

262
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,120
Well, the show that, the show that no one can talk to.

263
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,840
That's Reverend Ivan Stang and his little brother, Dr. Stang.

264
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,160
I say hi to all of you.

265
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,280
Do you all know each other?

266
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,280


267
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,460


268
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,020
Okay.

269
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,100
Well, Mr. Stang knows Allstate.

270
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,260
He knows Mr. Stang so good by now.

271
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,260


272
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,260


273
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,580
I mean, so much people in the middle of New York, right?

274
00:11:59,760 --> 00:11:59,760


275
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,040
Mm, yeah.

276
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,040


277
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,120
But I think we've been through quite a bit since don't think you've been through

278
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,440
as much as you've been doing the other show next week.

279
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,580
We've covered anything, everybody, they've covered the week.

280
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:08,880
The major show Frank Howell now had probably been dondied.

281
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,040
There was one of the malice fires in thewright's home tonight.

282
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,960
Of course.

283
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,260
That's his spring break, that one.

284
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,820
There was a whole, big fire.

285
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,740
anti-Bob. They all want to be.

286
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,540
There's a common psychosis. There's

287
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,020
anti-Messiah complex.

288
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,700
Well, that's the only way you see it. If you get

289
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,880
your name in the paper as an anti-Messiah,

290
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,780
it's in the same size type as

291
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,300
if you were the Messiah, you know?

292
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,760
They link you to the Messiah

293
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,600
by being... I mean, guys that are saying

294
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,680
they're anti-Bob's, they're just saying that

295
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,700
so they can have their name linked with

296
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,240
Bob. You understand?

297
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,600
Exactly. It's a hate-love

298
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,700
relationship. They know they can't...

299
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,480
They aren't good enough to be Bob

300
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,040
or to even serve Bob right.

301
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,860
And they're mostly anti-squid

302
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,220
people. You know, you see them at these

303
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,460
squid suppression rallies.

304
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,720
Yeah, and no right

305
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,340
to squid.

306
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,020
Burning records.

307
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,540
Trying to stamp out prairie squid.

308
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,680
And those are the same kind of intolerant

309
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,780
people who the only way they can react

310
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,660
to something is to kill them.

311
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,860
If they don't understand it,

312
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,440
they kill it.

313
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,560
And if they can't eat it, they make socks or shoes

314
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,140
or something like that out of it.

315
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,400
There's people out there that would kill a Playboy magazine

316
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,980
if they saw it crawling around through the bushes

317
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,080
like a prairie squid.

318
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,960
And since they're good for the same things...

319
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,160
Well, except that, of course,

320
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,280
a Playboy magazine is by no means

321
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,100
a prairie squid, Dr. Stang.

322
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,240
I'm sure that you and I know

323
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,040
that perhaps a Playboy magazine

324
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,380
might be employed with a prairie squid,

325
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,100
but certainly no such thing.

326
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,980
Man, I've never needed a play... anything besides

327
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,060
just the squid. The squid itself is all it really means.

328
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,440
Friends, a prairie squid, it's like

329
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,360
a snail without a shell.

330
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,860
A really large, about a foot long,

331
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,060
they've got a light...

332
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,820
they're differing variations

333
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,020
of color of hair and how much hair

334
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,060
and how curly it is.

335
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,480
Yeah, and where it's distributed

336
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,240
and whether they're an elongated squid

337
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,840
or a small, squamous, flattened-out squid.

338
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,160
And just as a snail

339
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,400
is like one just...

340
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,040
it's a pseudopod, it's a big foot.

341
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,000
A prairie squid, friends,

342
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,220
is a huge, erogenous zone.

343
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,300
That's all it is.

344
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,080
A mobile erogenous zone.

345
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,340
And we're not talking about one of them

346
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,000
camper conversion kits either.

347
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,880
That's right, and this is not...

348
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,440
this isn't some chauvinistic thing,

349
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,320
because I know a lot of country girls out there

350
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,580
know what we're talking about,

351
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,740
because a prairie squid...

352
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,660
Well, it interfaces both ways, right, Doctor?

353
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,400
I mean, that's the beauty.

354
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,140
Without expensive interfaces,

355
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,880
you can plug right into these amazing new pets.

356
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,200
I mean, you don't need attachments or rubber washers

357
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,420
or anything like that with a...

358
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,480
it just one serves the entire family.

359
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,580
And back in the old pioneer days,

360
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,000
when they first came across this prairie

361
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,360
from little towns up the...

362
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,320
It was a family thing.

363
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,340
Yeah, sure, you had the little prairie squid cage

364
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,000
right there on the back of the covered wagon.

365
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,620
Everybody had them.

366
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,480
I mean, you nurtured them.

367
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,480
And now they're almost extinct.

368
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,920
Now you could cruise Turtle Creek

369
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,460
from one end to the other

370
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,340
and never find...

371
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,080
never find an ambulating prairie squid.

372
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,040
About five years ago,

373
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,440
I saw the first wild prairie squid

374
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,820
I'd seen since my childhood

375
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,340
running around near Glen Rose, Texas,

376
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
near the power plant.

377
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:17,840
So...

378
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:18,740
Well, who knows?

379
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,220
Maybe they'll be real big, glowing prairie squids

380
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,720
Yeah, that's true.

381
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,020
Maybe they'll be mutated prairie squids, you know?

382
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,720
I mean, other things are changing fast

383
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,780
and people's social habits are changing.

384
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,620
And perhaps one day, Doctor,

385
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,540
perhaps one day,

386
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,720
the squid will...

387
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,900
The squid, if Dobbs is willing,

388
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,100
will return in all of its glory.

389
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,440
After Bob comes again.

390
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,280
And the squid will.

391
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,800
The... yes, friends.

392
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,800
Yes, after Bob comes the squid.

393
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,820
But I think...

394
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,780
I think now it's...

395
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,420
it's time for a phone call.

396
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,780
We'll go ahead and take a phone call here, friends.

397
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,160
We're not going to answer.

398
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,440
Line one.

399
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,880
Rue Mouse, call Johnny Normal's conference line.

400
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,800
And you guys let her talk or she's nice.

401
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,520
Let her talk or she's nice.

402
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,140
Okay, we'll be nice if you talk.

403
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,900
Yes, that's right.

404
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,340
Oh, there she is right now.

405
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
All right, let's see what she has to say.

406
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,160
Go ahead.

407
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,280
You don't even know why Rue Mouse...

408
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,680
Oh, no.

409
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,440
Oh, no.

410
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:05,900
Oh, no.

411
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,320
I'm sick.

412
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,020
I come in peace and this happens every damn time

413
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,420
you put me on the defensive.

414
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,100
Well, first of all, you're not supposed to say damn.

415
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,020
So let's go...

416
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,620
Let's start over.

417
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
Let's say, hello, you're up down to...

418
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,020
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

419
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,380
Uh...

420
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,760
Okay, here's the chance.

421
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,400
This is your chance if you blow this.

422
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,140
Okay, I want you to know...

423
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,760
Forever.

424
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,200
I want you to know that you're all on tape

425
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,160
as violating the FCC rules,

426
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,180
so don't be sending people out after me.

427
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,440
I've got tape on you.

428
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,540
Nothing's going to come back on you.

429
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,740
Ding-dongs, but...

430
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,880
Nothing will happen to me.

431
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,460
Watch it.

432
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,600
You self-righteous hypocrite.

433
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,640
I am the head of Hestel.

434
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,020
My father is Had Urter.

435
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,260
Well, I'm not a...

436
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,580
I'm not a self-defiling hypocrite.

437
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,480
I'm a surfer.

438
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,940
You know, that's what I am.

439
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,620
But I don't want to get into that.

440
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,240
Let's go to...

441
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,400
Only three more minutes.

442
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,880
I'm sorry that that neurotic woman got on the air,

443
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,220
but you know what happens sometimes.

444
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,260
They get past our...

445
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,120
By all means, let's...

446
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,540
We're sorry.

447
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,260
We're sorry.

448
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,040
I just can't believe someone would call in

449
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,760
and have the nerve to say things like that

450
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,640
about Prairie Squid.

451
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,620
I know, and not only that,

452
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,380
but they call somebody else's show...

453
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:10,680
I know.

454
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,620
...using our airtime.

455
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,120
Using...

456
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,140
And our area code, for that matter.

457
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,740
That show that dare not speak its name...

458
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,140
You can bet it's going to be charged to K-N-O-N.

459
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,140
...in Berkeley out in California.

460
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,140
Oh, they're hip out there in California.

461
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,980
Oh, yeah, but they...

462
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,140
They're so hip, they've got...

463
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,480
Oh, they've got their crack, so to speak.

464
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,140
Yes, yes.

465
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,080
Their drugs and their wild sex.

466
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,900
Oh.

467
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,380
But have you ever heard a person

468
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,980
from one of these hot tubbers

469
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,380
talking about a Prairie Squid, friends?

470
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,620
No, you never have, never.

471
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,200
They don't know anything.

472
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,080
You haven't heard about those...

473
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,460
They don't even know...

474
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,320
They've never heard of it.

475
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,400
Those organic boys with their avocado dips and everything.

476
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,120
They're city folks.

477
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,720
Yeah, they don't know about Prairie Squid.

478
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,080
Oh, they don't know.

479
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,560
They know everything.

480
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,640
They know everything.

481
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,960
But they don't know that.

482
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,100
And if you told them,

483
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,480
if you tried to tell them about it,

484
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,700
they'd think, oh, how quaint.

485
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,960
He's talking with his southern accent.

486
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,740
How folksy that...

487
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,840
Oh, he must...

488
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,820
He must be near to the earth or something.

489
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,240
Yes.

490
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,980
Yes, yes.

491
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,160
But I'm an artist.

492
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,440
I don't have to lower myself to those...

493
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,020
to those demeaning...

494
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm involved with such incredibly cerebral machinations

495
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,140
over the politically correct aspect of my art

496
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,300
and how it applies to Prairie Squid.

497
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:16,740
Yes, I'm not obsessed with...

498
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,800
Prairie Squid, that I don't really have to think

499
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,580
about the humorous side of these things.

500
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,100
If there is a humorous side, because I'm serious.

501
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm from California.

502
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,820
I don't have to do veiled juvenile humor,

503
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,460
guising as some sort of highfalutin,

504
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,460
environmental concern citizen satire.

505
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,640
Yes.

506
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm not that kind of person.

507
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,600
Oh, no, no, no.

508
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,320
Of course not.

509
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,640
That's what they'll tell you every time.

510
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,380
Yeah, that's the line they'll spring on you.

511
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,480
The sophisticated line.

512
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,220
The conspiracy is...

513
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,600
Their bourgeois line.

514
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,500
The conspiracy is insidious,

515
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:46,700
friends.

516
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,560
Incredibly, they make you want what they have.

517
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,740
And they make you feel stupid because you haven't got it.

518
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,060
Yeah, and they make you think it's better than what you already have.

519
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,440
That way, once they get your attention directed at what they have,

520
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,540
they can get your slack.

521
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,860
Your slack, friends.

522
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,020
That's right.

523
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,320
And you're a Prairie Squid, too.

524
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,860
And as long as you're the kind of person that can still...

525
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,720
You know, if you can find one,

526
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,140
you can go out in the woods and have a short relationship,

527
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,680
with one of these harmless animals...

528
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,580
Or a long relationship.

529
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,420
I mean, you know, like, it's not...

530
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,740
There's no limited time.

531
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,540
The tantric sex magicians in India and the ancient cultures of the Earth have known of...

532
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,300
I mean, these creatures are not just common to the continental U.S.

533
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,740
That's right.

534
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,740
And Reverend Stang, I don't know if you know it or not,

535
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,760
but in Tibet, they breed in the temples a special variety.

536
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,940
Oh, the fattened special prairie...

537
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,400
The special prairie squid.

538
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,480
The soft squid, they call it.

539
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,700
Yeah, it's the one that the Dalai Lama has.

540
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,400
Uh-huh.

541
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,040
And they still breed them there.

542
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,280
Those things eat...

543
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,060
And they have to ship them out to India, where the Dalai Lama is now.

544
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,800
You know, the Chinese let them, because...

545
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,880
They're better fed than almost anyone in Tibet.

546
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,760
They're better fed than...

547
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,160
Any human being.

548
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,140
They're better fed than most of Tibet put together.

549
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,580
And, uh...

550
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,060
And, friends, when you become a member of the Church of the Subgenius,

551
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,940
you become eligible.

552
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,740
Yes.

553
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,480
Eligible, friends.

554
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,120
We'll give you your very own prairie squid direction and survival package.

555
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,400
Give yourself to the feeling, friends.

556
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,120
Remember to write for information.

557
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,080
We don't want...

558
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,300
We don't want you to send money.

559
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,060
We want you to send your whole wallet.

560
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,740
That's right.

561
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,720
You can take the money out.

562
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,340
Just send us the rest, especially those...

563
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,380
Those little pictures that you keep in the secret compartment that you don't show anybody.

564
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,960
We'll take the credit cards and things, too.

565
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,500
Well, we'll take those.

566
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,640
But those little pictures that no one else knows about, that's what...

567
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,380
The Bob already knows about those.

568
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,500
And we can judge just how...

569
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:39,860
How...

570
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,300
How highly to rank you in the great hierarchy of this church.

571
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,640
And Bob collects them, too, we might add.

572
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,780
And the better ones...

573
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,480
The better the pictures...

574
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,940
The better the pictures that come out of that little tiny secret embarrassing compartment in your wallet,

575
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,020
the higher up the rungs you move.

576
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,920
Yes, friends.

577
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:01,900
And we also found that one person who sent his wallet in had a picture of a prairie squid in it and didn't even know what it was.

578
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
He thought it was some curious...

579
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,480
He thought it was some curious little life form or a blow-up of a bacteria or something.

580
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,440
And he'd been carrying it around for years because he felt it gave him good luck.

581
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,500
And it did.

582
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,160
It did.

583
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,720
It gave him incredible good luck because it brought him to Bob.

584
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,580
And you see that just a picture of a little thing like a prairie squid can set you on the right path.

585
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,980
It'll put you right.

586
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,540
The path to Dobbs and salvation.

587
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,680
Praise Bob.

588
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,100
Bob loves you.

589
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,860
Bob loves you.

590
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,980
Bob loves you, friend.

591
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:53,560
And, you know, if you could just let go of those hang-ups that have kept you tied down, friends, you could...

592
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,400
Shackled by your own insecurities, as they might say, Reverend Stang.

593
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,400
Your ignorance.

594
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,280
Your pathetic ignorance.

595
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,220
Your pathetic pink ignorance is what it is.

596
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,240
Your ignorance of the subgenius P.O. box number which we were about to forget to give.

597
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,700
Oh, can we do that?

598
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,560
You bet we can.

599
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,200
We have to.

600
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
Oh, well, in that case...

601
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,680
Bob said we had to party.

602
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,700
Yes, well, that box number...

603
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,680
Friends, why are you sitting there listening to this radio show?

604
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,120
Why aren't you out partying?

605
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,940
Bob said to party.

606
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,620
Party.

607
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,140
Party.

608
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,380
Bob said you had to party.

609
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:24,960
He didn't say you could.

610
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,760
You had to party.

611
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,460
You better party.

612
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,780
He didn't say you might if you felt like it.

613
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,920
Yes, indeed, friends.

614
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,520
He said to get out there.

615
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,180
Where's that right...

616
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,880
Where's that dirt?

617
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,980
We want Bob says to get out there and do it.

618
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,360
Bob says find the squid.

619
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,260
Yes, friends.

620
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,220
Let's bring those squids back.

621
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,240
Well, well, well, in the meantime, we'll just step back into the real world.

622
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,620
Someone said to Barry McGuire, he said, all you Christians, you're all the same.

623
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,600
You've all been brainwashed.

624
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:58,280
And Barry thought for a moment, he said, yes, that's true, but you sinners have been brainwashed

625
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,880
also.

626
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,720
The only difference between you sinners and us Christians is that us Christians, we have

627
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,760
chosen to wash our brains.

628
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,520
That's a little rough.

629
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,540
And that doesn't sound too good to the polished ears of the liberals and the modernists.

630
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,120
So they soften it down, you see.

631
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,900
And of course, they would read that verse, let God be true in every man, be an untruth

632
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,300
in a measure to a degree by chance, in my opinion, they'd say.

633
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Yeah, let's soften that because somebody might get offended.

634
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,740
Yeah.

635
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,200
But the Bible says, let God be true.

636
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,340
And let every man be a liar.

637
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,640
Let God be true and yourادashd missed that.

638
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,720
So I think that's true in every sense of the word.

639
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:56,720


640
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,460
Yeah, and I don't think we'll ever be Когда I come to words that are intended

641
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,380
to be natural and illogical or just tan but I think they say in軍овеч.

642
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:58,380


643
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,340
I say productively common ground fuerte.

644
00:23:59,340 --> 00:23:59,340


645
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:05,320
C survive it to them not the luus but the luus is the luus and we are the.

646
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,020
but expulse by his friend ing eating dirty

647
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,600
things.

648
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,240
You're crazy.

649
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,900
You know what my name is.

650
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,420
I think I had one.

651
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,140
religion and that old-time constitution

652
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:30,260
it's been 1984 since 1953 friends that's right that was probably the last time

653
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,160
your parents let you told you about the Perry squid after that you know there

654
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,020
was a law yeah that you weren't even allowed to talk about it and until same

655
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,240
law they Edgar Hoover passed on there was a lot there's a law friends on the

656
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,220
books that says it says this no subgenious can do anything at once now

657
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:58,360
is this a free country Yes repressive I mean it is they they talk Oh America

658
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,820
home of the free land of the brave right sure brave enough to are they brave

659
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,940
enough to talk about prairie squid oh no , no

660
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,000
and they talk about prairie squid and remember they use the language of the

661
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,420
Can they talk about those two dogs we know of?

662
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,240
Oh, no, no.

663
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,060
Can't talk about them either.

664
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,940
But, you know, and they're saying, oh, well, it's a land where we have free discussions.

665
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,240
It's a democracy.

666
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:27,200
But you can only launch a bleeding head of Arnold Palmer on a Thursday night, they say.

667
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,340
And not if it's a public holiday.

668
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:38,800
Yeah, a golfer head can only be launched on Thursdays in your own, you know, in the home of a consenting person.

669
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,620
You can't just go next door to your neighbors and launch a head if you feel like it.

670
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,120
And, Dobbs, forbid you launch a head in public, like downtown on the main square or something like that.

671
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,540
And, North Little Rock, you find yourself in trouble with the county law, boy.

672
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,440
Yeah, you can tell them, oh, but officer, like Doctors for Bob did, you can say, oh, officer, but I'm a bold surrealist, sir.

673
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,440
I'm a bold surrealist.

674
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,720
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, we got bold surrealists.

675
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,780
We got 40 men hanging from telephone poles up in Tucker that like to sing.

676
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,180
Say they were bold surrealists.

677
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,140
Yes, friends.

678
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah, they, oh, they'll launch every kind of head.

679
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,720
They'll launch a sneed head.

680
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,520
Oh, yeah, they'll launch a Trevino forearm if you aren't careful.

681
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,100
Wearing big green straps the whole time.

682
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,480
The whole time, friends.

683
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,420
Friends, I want you to listen to this tape, and I want you to meditate.

684
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,120
Meditate on this message tape.

685
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,620
Close your eyes and think about Prairie Squid and listen to this tape.

686
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,920
That's true.

687
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,020
They did, but the head moved up or down.

688
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,780
And I can recall not too long ago.

689
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:46,240
Not too long ago, my father said to me, while playing around at home, you're moving your head.

690
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,380
And I said, I don't think so.

691
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,900
I said, I'm keeping my eye on the ball.

692
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,240
And he said, well, you're keeping your eye on the ball, yes, but your head is moving up and down,

693
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,260
which I had worked into this unconsciously.

694
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,880
See, Arnold Palmer unconsciously knew that his head had to be launched.

695
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,500
Yeah.

696
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,280
But that's not the real.

697
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,760
That's not the Arnold Palmer that you're thinking of, friends.

698
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,340
No, no, no.

699
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,960
It's not the guy that drives a tractor.

700
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,780
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

701
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,260
No.

702
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,100
No, it's not the guy who sells, you know, oil-based petroleum products.

703
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,980
This is the.

704
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
Oh, forget it.

705
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,200
You don't even want to.

706
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,920
There's no way they can.

707
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,200
There's no way they can understand it.

708
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,800
They really couldn't.

709
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,400
Just write to that box number.

710
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,880
Yeah, that box number, friends, for the Church of the Subgenius.

711
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:35,600
And we'll send you plenty of information about Prairie Squids, golfer head launch-ins, slack, slack, how to make.

712
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,240
And Reverend Stang.

713
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,520
Sex.

714
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,680
All the time.

715
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,920
Yeah, the good sex for mutants dating league, I believe, you know.

716
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,440
Oh, that's right.

717
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,240
Yeah, that's another church service.

718
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:44,920
It's been a while since.

719
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,040
Yeah, since Buck sold the good sex for mutants dating league.

720
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,840
Well, he had to.

721
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,280
He was just getting worn out.

722
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
You know what he sold it for?

723
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,240
It was getting worn out.

724
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,440
It was wearing him out.

725
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,240
But you know what he sold it for?

726
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,740
All them hot mutants coming.

727
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,140
You know what he sold the franchise for?

728
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,460
No, what did he sell the franchise for?

729
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,140
A bottle of Ripple.

730
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,420
Well, that seems to be value received for value given, if you ask me, Doug.

731
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,180
That's right to P.O.

732
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,840
Box 14.

733
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,440
303-806 in Dallas, Texas.

734
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,620
7-5-2-1-4.

735
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,360
You can get information, and you don't have to send money.

736
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,900
You'll get lots of printed information.

737
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,520
It'll tell you where to write the good sex for mutants in Salt Lake City.

738
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:31,960
We'll send you the little maps of the known existing prairie squid wildlife refuges in your area,

739
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,080
if there are any, if you're fortunate enough to live in a part of the country where there are still a few of these,

740
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,200
precious creatures left.

741
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,500
Where they're still legal.

742
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,020
Yeah.

743
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,260
Well, they're not really.

744
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,240
Oh, Dr. Dool, you just got back from the mutant beauty contest at the Good Sex for Mutants.

745
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:56,720
Yeah, I was one of the judges at the Good Sex for Mutants Dating League first annual beauty contest in Salt Lake City just 10 days ago, Reverend Stang.

746
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,760
Those lovely, how were those lovely and disgusting subgenius mutants, Dr. Dool?

747
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,800
They were some of the most beautifully disgusting mutated sickly creatures that I have ever seen.

748
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,820
Beautiful mutants.

749
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,120
Yeah.

750
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,400
And there was actually a close runner up.

751
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:20,840
She was voted Miss, well, we think she was voted Miss Congeniality, was actually a mutated variation of prairie squid.

752
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,520
Praise Bob.

753
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,700
Praise Bob.

754
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,280
And it was the biggest, the biggest prairie squid that I have ever seen.

755
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,380
I say it was about 110 pound prairie squid.

756
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:38,000
And friends, if you just tuned in late, if you just tuned in late, you're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM.

757
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,880
In Dallas, Texas.

758
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,380
The vocal organ, so to speak, of the church of the subgenius.

759
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,460
And we are serious.

760
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:54,740
You really can write to us at, get that pencil, P.O. Box 14-0306 here in Dallas, 75214.

761
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,240
And we'll tell you about that Good Sex for Mutants League.

762
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,400
It really is a dating service for mutants.

763
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,820
For mutants.

764
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:07,440
You know, various minority cults like the Christians have their own special dating service.

765
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,100
God, I love that.

766
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,160
I forgot to bring the questionnaire for that.

767
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,080
I was going to read it over.

768
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,960
It is hilarious.

769
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,580
But, and so we've got our own mutant dating service, friends.

770
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,920
Get that pencil, P.O. Box 14-0306 here in Dallas, 75214.

771
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,340
And we'll tell you about that Good Sex for Mutants League.

772
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,440
It really is a dating service for mutants.

773
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:29,860
For mutants.

774
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,200
You know, various minority cults like the Christians have their own special dating service.

775
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
God, I forgot to bring the question.

776
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,680
Get that pencil, P.O. Box 14-0306 here in Dallas, 75214.

777
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,000
And we'll tell you about that Good Sex for Mutants League.

778
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,080
It really is a dating service for mutants.

779
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,660
For mutants.

780
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:56,380
It really is a church for people who the only thing they have in common is that they have nothing in common with the conspiracy, friends.

781
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:56,660
That's right.

782
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:56,660


783
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,240
And you know about the conspiracy.

784
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,940
And if you don't, then you're not a subgenius.

785
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,680
Why don't you?

786
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,060
That's why.

787
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,180
That's it.

788
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,720
That's it.

789
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,840
And they want, oh, half of them out there that send us their, you know, membership.

790
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,060
That's right.

791
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,060


792
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,060


793
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,060


794
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,720
That's their love offering and get the magazines and the tapes and so forth.

795
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,560
They, half of them out there aren't really subgeni at all.

796
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,540
Listen to those phones.

797
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,860
They're pathetically trying to reach us.

798
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,320
They have things they have to tell us.

799
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,900
They want to be healed.

800
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,840
They want to, they hate us.

801
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,620
They want to kill us.

802
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,540
They want to love us.

803
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,980
They want to ask us how we do it.

804
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,400
And mostly they want us to loan them money, which is.

805
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,280
And they want us to shut up about Prairie Squid because they're embarrassed.

806
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,700
We're not going to.

807
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,600
Oh, they turn so red.

808
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,740
Because this is the Prairie Squid show tonight.

809
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,660
We're dedicating.

810
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:45,400
We are taking this valuable church time to inform you about this very, very, very clear

811
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
and present danger.

812
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,140
That is to say the extinction of the Prairie Squid.

813
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,440
Please stop.

814
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,500
Please stop.

815
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,700
Oh, yes, dear friends.

816
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,840
This is Li Li Jing, the Chinese subgenius.

817
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,060
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON.

818
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,940
And that is Texas.

819
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,540
Oh, yes, it's so true.

820
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,660
Thank you, Li Jing.

821
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,060
I got a call from China just this morning, the high priestess of all Asia.

822
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,600
You know, when friends, if you had joined up, if you'd been the first person on your

823
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,760
continent to join up with the church, you'd be the pope of this continent.

824
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,580
I know they.

825
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,680
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon here.

826
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,940
I am the pope of South America.

827
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,800
The entire continent of South America.

828
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,260
It's mine.

829
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,420
When those soul are the harvest friends.

830
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,040
When we start collecting the harvest.

831
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


832
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


833
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


834
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


835
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


836
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


837
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


838
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


839
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


840
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


841
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


842
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


843
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


844
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,040


845
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,280
The harvest.

846
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,680
The harvest.

847
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:38,960
We're going to start collecting the harvest.

848
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,300
We're going to start collecting the harvest.

849
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,300


850
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,360
We're going to start collecting the harvest.

851
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,360


852
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,360


853
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,360


854
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,360


855
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,780
You know who's going to get the skim, to skim that fine, fine layer off the top out of the

856
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,000
soul rendering vat, don't you friend?

857
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,600
Oh, and they're trying to keep them from selling any kind of soul down there nowadays.

858
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,320
Oh, yeah, they don't.

859
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,680
It used to be in the old days you couldn't give it away, and now it's against the law

860
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,040
to sell it, so what are you going to do?

861
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,160
And all the religions want to have your soul, friends.

862
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,840
Bob wants your soul, but just temporarily.

863
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,880
He'll give it back after he's taken the squeezings.

864
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,720
And he only uses it a little bit while he's got it, friends.

865
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,920
That's something to think about.

866
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,040
He doesn't dry you out.

867
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,660
That's right.

868
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,600
Friends, as Janer Hypercletes, the trance spouter of all time,

869
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,160
Janer Hypercletes in Little Rock, Arkansas, once said,

870
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,040
they said my mind was in this jar, and then they poured it down a sink.

871
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,520
I want you to think about that, friends.

872
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,520
Dr. Gordon, shall we go to the Swingin' Love Corpses?

873
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,600
This isn't their brand-new album that just came out.

874
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,860
It does have a beautiful song about prairie squid right in the middle of it somewhere.

875
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,740
I just remember exactly which.

876
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,100
Why don't we go ahead and roll that, and I've got the small prairie squid right here,

877
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,520
and we'll tickle it a little while the music's playing.

878
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:51,860
Oh, yes.

879
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,500
This is the Swingin' Love Corpses, friends.

880
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,520
Dr. Philo Tramadonko.

881
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,880
Poor crazy body.

882
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,540
Now I know how she suffered.

883
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,100
She couldn't stop blue to take root.

884
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,060
Now I know how she suffered.

885
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,560
She just couldn't stop blue to take root.

886
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,220
Crazy body.

887
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,420
Poor crazy body.

888
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,320
She just couldn't stop it.

889
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,040
Now I know how she suffered.

890
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,960
Now I know how she suffered.

891
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,740
Poor crazy body.

892
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,520
She couldn't stop blue to take root.

893
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,240
She couldn't stop blue to take root.

894
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,120
Blue.

895
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,740
Blue.

896
00:34:59,860 --> 00:34:59,860


897
00:34:59,860 --> 00:34:59,860


898
00:34:59,860 --> 00:34:59,860


899
00:34:59,860 --> 00:34:59,860


900
00:34:59,860 --> 00:34:59,860


901
00:34:59,860 --> 00:34:59,860


902
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,240
Sarkomeres.

903
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,900
You're crazy Bobby!

904
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,040
You're crazy Bobby!

905
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,900
Sarkomeres.

906
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,520
You're crazy Bobby!

907
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


908
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


909
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


910
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,000
Sarkomeres.

911
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,800
You're crazy Bobby!

912
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,480
So, as the sarcomeres contract,

913
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,540
thin filaments from the opposite ends of a sarcomere,

914
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,000
that is, filaments extending from different Z-disks,

915
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,840
meet at the center of the sarcomere

916
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,440
when it's about two micrometers long.

917
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,500
As the sarcomere contracts further,

918
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,720
thin filaments from different Z-disks

919
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,300
begin to overlap within the lattice of thick filaments.

920
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,760
The latticework of filaments

921
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,380
becomes crowded in such a double overlap state.

922
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,700
And the sarcomere expands laterally.

923
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,880
Its cylindrical shape increases in girth.

924
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,140
This lateral expansion

925
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,460
stretches the Z-disks and other lateral structures.

926
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,440
You've got to see this guy for what he is!

927
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,660
He's a maniac!

928
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,920
Out to rule the world!

929
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,100
What can I do to make you understand him?

930
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,960
I love you!

931
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,240
Goodbye Iceman!

932
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,740
Goodbye Iceman!

933
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,080
Goodbye Iceman!

934
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,340
No!

935
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,440
I want that money you owe me!

936
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:25,320
I want that money you owe me!

937
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,080
He's a maniac!

938
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,400
I'm going to kill you!

939
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,460
I'm going to kill you!

940
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,900
I'm going to kill you!

941
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,140
I'm going to kill you!

942
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,040
...stores the energy of systolic contraction.

943
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,300
There is now increasing evidence

944
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,440
that the connective tissues

945
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,160
surrounding the individual muscle cells

946
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,240
as well as the tissue linking the cells

947
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,440
also plays a role.

948
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,120
And I think that about sums up how the prairie squid actually moves, Doctor.

949
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:08,560
I'm sure, I'm very sure that our audience has been finally, finally so glad to know,

950
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,660
or at least feel like they can go out into the street and feel cool again.

951
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,920
Knowing about, you know, how they work, right?

952
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,380
Yeah.

953
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,860
Yeah, that's what it's all about.

954
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,400
Chicago's youngest mother, an unnamed girl,

955
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,680
at the age of 10 years and 8 months, gave birth naturally in Chicago.

956
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,140
This is the second youngest in the United States when she was delivered of a 6-pound, 4-ounce girl.

957
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:38,720
Now, friends, you know, at the same time, he described it as pterodactyl-like.

958
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,180
It had a Brahma bull type of hump on the back, like a pelican's pouch at its throat,

959
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,580
and a 5- to 6-foot wingspan.

960
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,260
Not with feathers.

961
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,200
This was a reptilian thing.

962
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,680
And it was seen by a paramedic who works for the Harlingen, Texas, emergency medical service.

963
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,480
Well, I was down there on the river, and a big bird came down, man.

964
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,260
It was tremendous.

965
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,100
Yes, big bird is back.

966
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,640
Probably hunting prairie squid along the edges of the Rio Grande River.

967
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:12,520
And, friends, somewhere at the edge of your mind is a sort of a tiny cluster of memories

968
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:18,700
that date back to human prehistory, to a time when every man, or in those days,

969
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,180
they weren't men.

970
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,760
Not men at all.

971
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,640
They were yetis.

972
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,120
Yes.

973
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,880
And the women, even the women, were yetis, too.

974
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:33,160
And in those days, friend, the prairie squid didn't have to live among horny toads to stay stimulated.

975
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:42,000
It was able to, let us say, converse physically with the yetis at any time that they wished.

976
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,500
You know, the yetis, friends, your ancestors, those of you who are true subgeniuses.

977
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,160
Except for that one variety of self-stimulating prairie squid.

978
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,740
The squid, doctor, which, as you know, became extinct in the late devouring period, I think it was.

979
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,740
Yeah, well, that was, there was, yeah, but that was long after the yetis were extinct themselves.

980
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,540
And that's probably what killed them off.

981
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,500
I'm holding in my hand here a book titled Things You Never Knew Existed.

982
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,600
A very forthright compendium, friends, one might say.

983
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,880
And right here on page 44, there it is.

984
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,520
Squid, comma.

985
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,660
Prairie.

986
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,440
And there is an entire summation.

987
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,300
Now, you can get this information on this prairie squid by merely writing to the Church of the Subgenius.

988
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,260
That's right, friend.

989
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,420
And if Reverend Stang would be so kind as to give him that sacred box number really quick one more time,

990
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,940
and I believe we'll, uh, we might get a guest telephone caller as their lights are still, well, no, it looks like he's drifted off again, doctor.

991
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,160
Oh, we'll, we'll get one.

992
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,720
We'll get one.

993
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,400
Friends, that address to write to for more information about J.R. Bob Dobbs,

994
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,160
the only, only...

995
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,740
The only individual who could save your soul and then give it back to you again.

996
00:39:53,540 --> 00:40:09,560
That address for Bob is Subgenius Foundation, P.O. Box 140306, dear friend, in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

997
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:17,320
And, uh, oh, friends, you don't know what, you don't know what, what could be coming your way in the mail

998
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,160
once you sign up with this amazing...

999
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,160


1000
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,160


1001
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,160


1002
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,340
...amazing church with your free information.

1003
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:28,200
Uh, you can find out the inside story on not, not just things like Prairie Squid.

1004
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,520
You can find out why you've been losing at the races and how to start winning again.

1005
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,120
How come you didn't get that big raise at your conspiracy job that you're nailed to?

1006
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,880
How come that special date with her didn't work out?

1007
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,180
And remember that first time you found you couldn't do it for the second time?

1008
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,920
Yes, friends.

1009
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,140
That's the only, almost as scary as...

1010
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,160
...the second time.

1011
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,160


1012
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,920
...the second time you find that you can't do it for the first time.

1013
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,000
It's scary, friends.

1014
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,300
It's a scary, scary world out there.

1015
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:56,840
People...

1016
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,000
You won't have...

1017
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,200
...waiting to see what you can do.

1018
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,260
You won't have these problems if you just let Bob solve them for you.

1019
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,620
Get right with Dobbs.

1020
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,360
Get right with...

1021
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,460
Let Bob into your life, friends.

1022
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
Let Bob into your heart.

1023
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,340
You need Bob.

1024
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,400
You have to have Bob.

1025
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,840
You have to have him.

1026
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,060
You better have him.

1027
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,860
You know you want it.

1028
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,740
Because I'll tell you, friends, when those...

1029
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,360
You have to have it.

1030
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,560
Because when those end times come down...

1031
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,780
...if you're not right with Bob, you're gonna fry.

1032
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,960
And you'll probably deserve it.

1033
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,820
You will deserve it.

1034
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,080
You'll wish you could die, friends.

1035
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,220
You'll wish you could die.

1036
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,480
But Bobby...

1037
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,140
But it'll be worse.

1038
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,360
Oh, Bobby, he won't let you.

1039
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,460
He won't let you die.

1040
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,440
You'll be going, Bob, kill me.

1041
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,920
Give me a car right here.

1042
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,420
Please, Bob.

1043
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,600
You didn't tell me the end times was gonna be worse than a Sidney Sheldon miniseries on TV.

1044
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,420
Friends, we're gonna take that caller right now.

1045
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,560
Where are we gonna take her to?

1046
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,540
...continues to be shaken under the...

1047
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,880
...these conditions.

1048
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,460
...squick.

1049
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,060
It's squid.

1050
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,780
It's been a long time since we were trapped by a squid.

1051
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,760
That's a squid ick for the uninitiated.

1052
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,820
Yes, this is a show that continues to be trapped by the tiny callers.

1053
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,660
An icky squid is a sticky squid.

1054
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,000
You call in, we are forced to listen to you.

1055
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,700
...at the academy.

1056
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,020
That's right, an icky squid is one that's actually...

1057
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,920
And if you were just to call...

1058
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,640
...the icktheist, what is an icktheologist?

1059
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,740
If you're awake, it won't make any sense.

1060
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,660
It's a giant icktheosaur.

1061
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,780
No, you're asleep right now, and this is the ugly show.

1062
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,400
Is that a squid, or is that an icktheosaur?

1063
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,420
...all over northern central California at this hour.

1064
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,820
And even people in the building refuse to listen to him.

1065
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,640
Well, let's hear what that other caller has to say.

1066
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,480
Okay.

1067
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,220
Oh, he's calling another caller.

1068
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,960
He's calling another caller.

1069
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,760
It's a chain reaction.

1070
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,260
Call callers and find out what they have to say.

1071
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,980
The last person who broke the chain, something terrible happened.

1072
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,660
So don't do it.

1073
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,360
Do what it says and call the next caller.

1074
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,260
Call a caller now.

1075
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:43,040
The last caller disintegrated two U-quarks, a D-quark, and three pi-bases.

1076
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,520
Now, you can't...

1077
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,620
Go ahead, go ahead.

1078
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,900
We let you speak.

1079
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,300
You're reading.

1080
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,220
I'll tell you.

1081
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,680
I'll tell you.

1082
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:47,800
I'll tell you.

1083
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,400
All them free-clothers just pick up the phone and dial in.

1084
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,160
They've been called.

1085
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,220
There you go.

1086
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:52,340
See?

1087
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:52,640
Yeah.

1088
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,700
Somebody don't tell us.

1089
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,240
Tell us about your basketball game down there at Santa Fe School.

1090
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:56,820
Squid.

1091
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,220
Tell us about that.

1092
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,680
Icky squid.

1093
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,620
They talk about squid.

1094
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,380
They talk about squid out there.

1095
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,180
Yeah, they can talk.

1096
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,480
They like to act like people who know what a prairie squid is.

1097
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,380
But anybody who called in icky squid...

1098
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,700
Because they heard about it for months, frankly.

1099
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,820
Yeah, of course.

1100
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,020
I'll just throw these little wellmen down there.

1101
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:13,460
Yeah.

1102
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,860
Yes, that was one of the Hour of Slack shows out there.

1103
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,620
Actually, that one's not...

1104
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,980
That predates the Hour of Slack.

1105
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:18,600
That's the...

1106
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,460
That's the pre-Hour of Slack show, isn't it?

1107
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,060
More than an hour, less than a show.

1108
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,440
Yes.

1109
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,760
It's kind of a cut show, if you know what I mean.

1110
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,660
But there's also...

1111
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,140
We just...

1112
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,460
Just last week, a new Hour of Slack started up in Boston

1113
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,300
at the radio station with the MIT campus.

1114
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,540
They're praising Bob, Dr. Bleepo Abernathy,

1115
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,420
and Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger of the Church of Mr. Science.

1116
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,140
Some of you out there are lucky enough to be in correspondence

1117
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,320
with these individuals.

1118
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,820
And we'll be playing some of their variation.

1119
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,660
It's different.

1120
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,520
It's a Yankee kind of thing.

1121
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,580
But up in Boston, you know, they're a wild bunch.

1122
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,000
There's some subgeni up there.

1123
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:58,740
Feisty.

1124
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,480
They're dangerous up there, Doctor.

1125
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,720
They have to be because the audience is in Boston.

1126
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,140
I have stood in front of...

1127
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,600
It was like the Alamo Friends,

1128
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,460
that time at the Spit Club,

1129
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,340
DeVival in Boston.

1130
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,080
You know, we travel around and do DeVivals in other towns,

1131
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:13,820
not Dallas.

1132
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,620
Dallas, apparently,

1133
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,400
isn't ready for...

1134
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,140
They want to call us a comedy act.

1135
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:19,900
An act.

1136
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,520
A joke.

1137
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,920
A joke, they said.

1138
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:22,340
Uh-huh.

1139
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,260
If that's an act,

1140
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,600
then those five people who left that club spit in Boston

1141
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,720
without any legs ought to get an Academy Award.

1142
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:31,360
Yes, friends.

1143
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,900
And, friends, I want you to think about...

1144
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,980
Let's go to some...

1145
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,700
I haven't played this version of one of Buck's songs

1146
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,720
in a long time.

1147
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,280
This is his own band.

1148
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,860
Well, as Pastor Naked cannot be with us tonight,

1149
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,900
I think it's only proper that we...

1150
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,220
That we not play his version.

1151
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,220
That we not play his version.

1152
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,540
But, uh, Onans, and here...

1153
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,460
Somewhere in here.

1154
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,500
Ah, yes.

1155
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,320
Ah, yes, friends.

1156
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,440
Somewhere in here, the tapes are running backwards.

1157
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,000
Bob's my friend, and he's leading me somewhere.

1158
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,360
Is he waiting there for me?

1159
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,700
Is he waiting for me?

1160
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,520
Bob's my friend, and he's leading me somewhere.

1161
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,680
What could be waiting there for me?

1162
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,800
What could be waiting for me?

1163
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,340
What could stop the aliens from killing me?

1164
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,380
What could help me?

1165
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,120
What could help me?

1166
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,740
Ah!

1167
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,500
Ah!

1168
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,720
Bob can't help me.

1169
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,940
He can help.

1170
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,240
But will he?

1171
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,180
Will he help me?

1172
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:00,140
Bob's my inner guide, and he's leading my body.

1173
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,820
He's even nice to my pets.

1174
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
He's nice, he's nice to my pets.

1175
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,320
Bob's that little voice.

1176
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,120
He's not just a dream now.

1177
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,040
He's not just a dream.

1178
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,920
The mightiest guru yet.

1179
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,880
The mightiest, the mightiest.

1180
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,840
Bob is coming.

1181
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,540
Bob is coming.

1182
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,360
Bob's the alien from killing me.

1183
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,860
He's getting there.

1184
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,640
He's just technology.

1185
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,980
Oh, yeah.

1186
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,440
Bob can help me.

1187
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,220
Oh, yeah.

1188
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,920
But will he?

1189
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,580
He'll help me.

1190
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,360
He'll help me.

1191
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,820
I have to pay a fee.

1192
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:42,760
Dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy.

1193
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,460
Bob's my friend.

1194
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,880
Dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy, dodgy,

1195
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:59,200
Vadgy, vadgy, godgy, bawdy, bowdy, Chatty, what we got, it's dobreiyet Awesome,

1196
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,620
leading to someone.

1197
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,220
Huh.

1198
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,100
Well, help me, somebody.

1199
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:08,720
That was Dr.

1200
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,400
Praise God.

1201
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,760
Praise Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

1202
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,500
Yes, indeed.

1203
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,580
He's the youngest doctor out there from Knoxville, Tennessee.

1204
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,920
And a true crib fisherman, too, Dr.

1205
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,720
Yeah, he's a crib fisherman.

1206
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,800
He'd be fishing out of some cribs, I tell you, Bob.

1207
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,120
Yeah, looking for some prairies.

1208
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,340
Yeah, he'd be a squid fisherman.

1209
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,320
Well, they do have prairie squid in Tennessee

1210
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,940
because there is sufficient prairie there, or at least open.

1211
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,040
Well, they have those gulch squids, they call them.

1212
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,980
Yeah, and they've got some of that delta squid down around New Orleans.

1213
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,540
But I don't know about that delta squid.

1214
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,520
It kind of tastes muddy.

1215
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,300
That's my favorite kind, boy.

1216
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,440
You like it with red beans and rice?

1217
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,400
Yeah, after you use them, I'll only eat them after they've been used.

1218
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,460
Well, they aren't even good.

1219
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:53,600
That's right.

1220
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,480
They're tough.

1221
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,280
You've got to soften them up a bit.

1222
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,320
You've got to tenderize them a little bit.

1223
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,480
That's what the doctor would say.

1224
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,120
Yes, oh, yes.

1225
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,060
And vine squid.

1226
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,000
So I'll tell you, this little famous piece of music is also by Dr. Onan.

1227
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,560
I believe that's part of the Hour of Slack introduction at times, is it not?

1228
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,720
Yeah, yeah, right.

1229
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,500
He's got a new one on the way, a new digital Bob song.

1230
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,620
See, everything's digital here.

1231
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,560
We're not live.

1232
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,300
That's why we can't take any calls.

1233
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,360
This show has been entirely on.

1234
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:25,900
Basically, you have to use the digits of your right or left hand to operate anything on this show.

1235
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,220
That includes move the turntable.

1236
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,360
You can't move the turntable around with your fingertips.

1237
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,820
But we don't use turntables.

1238
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,540
We only use broken tape decks here on the Hour of Slack.

1239
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,660
And friends, praise Bob, a tape deck can be smashed to pieces.

1240
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,640
But if it's needed for the Hour of Slack, it will.

1241
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,240
Praise Bob, and best to have a frock zip you lobster.

1242
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,260
Oh, yes.

1243
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,660
Let's step into a quick moment from a subgenius revival.

1244
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,220
This was the last one in L.A.

1245
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,620
You were there as security, running security.

1246
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,740
And Bob got shot again anyway.

1247
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,740
Oh, yes.

1248
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,300
But this time it was one of those dispensables.

1249
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:57,840
Little Bobs.

1250
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,480
Yes.

1251
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,580
He was afraid to go out there.

1252
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,000
He knew.

1253
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,740
The guy that wore the Bob mask in L.A.

1254
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,580
And it was a Bob mask.

1255
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:09,440
I mean, Bob, the real Bob, wouldn't go in L.A. at the Alexandria Hotel.

1256
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,660
Yeah, he certainly wouldn't be seen at the Alexandria Hotel.

1257
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,580
That's for sure.

1258
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,480
In fact, I didn't even want to be seen at the Alexandria.

1259
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,540
In fact, nobody wanted to.

1260
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,720
The only thing that was really seen was obscene.

1261
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:25,480
And that was that obscene big dead rat that was in the Pope of New York's breakfast table or something like that.

1262
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,060
I forget it.

1263
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,240
That's the way Popes are.

1264
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,880
They're treated in L.A., friends.

1265
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,880
Last year.

1266
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,780
Last year.

1267
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,860
Oh, speaking of Popes in L.A., Doctor, before you play that, I think we ought to.

1268
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:42,520
Most people don't know that the Pope of all Arkansas, who's on temporary combat duty in Los Angeles, reaffirmed his nuptials.

1269
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,780
Yes, he did.

1270
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,840
He did.

1271
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,040
And he did it the subgenius way, too.

1272
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,360
He had already gotten a short-duration marriage.

1273
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,260
That's right.

1274
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,400
From Pastor Naked.

1275
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,300
He already had the paperwork.

1276
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,760
He did have the paperwork.

1277
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,080
He would have sanctified couplings, friends.

1278
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,420
Yes, he did.

1279
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,020
For the last few years.

1280
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,940
But their short-duration marriage ran out.

1281
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:08,300
And rather than send Buck any more money, they went to Las Vegas and had one of those parlor chapel, as Norm just told me to call it, a parlor chapel wedding.

1282
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:08,960
Marriage parlor.

1283
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,960
And when he left the chapel, this acolyte came running.

1284
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,360
You know, it was one of those ten-minute ceremonies.

1285
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:21,920
This guy actually had the gall to come running out going, sir, there's supposed to be a $25 tip, quote, tip, unquote.

1286
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,620
And to which Pope Sterno threw down a dollar and said, sir.

1287
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,520
Sir, kill me.

1288
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,240
That's right.

1289
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:35,420
But we should say congratulations to Pope Sterno and his faithful ubermatrix, that is to say, Miss Dottie.

1290
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:35,860
That's right.

1291
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,500
And they're creating more little yetis, friends.

1292
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:37,900
Yes, sir.

1293
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,620
They are further contaminating the gene pool.

1294
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:51,760
Sterno's father, the way he became a subgenius was his father was one of the guys who had to stand on the Nevada desert and face nuclear tests from about half a mile away.

1295
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,500
Wearing only goggles and a lead-shielded jockstrap.

1296
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,100
Mm-hmm.

1297
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,660
Duck and cover, baby.

1298
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,400
You betcha.

1299
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,840
But they weren't allowed to in those days.

1300
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:10,140
And the result is thousands of subgenius children of those selfless servicemen who gave their genetic structure for nuclear dominance.

1301
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:10,880
There you go.

1302
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:21,420
And rather than, I was about to play that Hal song from the L.A. Devival, but I think instead we will, Dr. Dool, dare to play this live report from L.A.

1303
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,620
Sterno, we're going to you now.

1304
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,080
This is Dr. Sterno Docs.

1305
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,240
Yes.

1306
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,480
Yes.

1307
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:26,600
Yes.

1308
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,600


1309
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,600


1310
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,600


1311
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,600


1312
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,600


1313
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,600


1314
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,600


1315
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,600


1316
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:32,080
Dr. Byron Verner of Famous Potatoes Organization in Los Angeles.

1317
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,360
Can you hear us, Sterno?

1318
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,540
Sterno?

1319
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,000
Yep, that's them.

1320
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,360
I'm having trouble.

1321
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,540
I don't think they can hear us.

1322
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,960
Sunset Boulevard is very second.

1323
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:56,240
At this moment, using a peculiarly evolved set of ocular sensory mechanisms attached.

1324
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,980
Bubba Gee.

1325
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,460
The sensory.

1326
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,540
Bubba Gee.

1327
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,880
Accumulative mass of tissue.

1328
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:02,900
Bubba Gee.

1329
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:02,900


1330
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:02,920
Bubba Gee.

1331
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,780
Located in the upper meridian of our.

1332
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,420
Bubba Gee.

1333
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,040
Particularly alien.

1334
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,480
Well, for actually, if I could turn down the right channel.

1335
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:10,840
I don't really.

1336
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:10,840


1337
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:21,440
And there seems to be a woman crossing the street with a skirt which is much, much out of the limits of.

1338
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,060
That sounds like Los Angeles, all right.

1339
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:24,780
Appreciative.

1340
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,080
Better check in that purse.

1341
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:26,220
I'm going to go get a new one.

1342
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,220


1343
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,220


1344
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,220


1345
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,220


1346
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,220


1347
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,500
This might be a snapping turtle in there.

1348
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,440
Why would, why would she.

1349
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,200
Yeah, why would she.

1350
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,160
A snapping turtle, did he say, Doctor?

1351
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,420
That's the thing, Doug.

1352
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,560
Hey, watch out for the coodles.

1353
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,780
About going into these lesbian snapping turtle bars.

1354
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,760
Lesbian coodle bars, we call them.

1355
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,740
We told Doug about them yesterday, but it's not the same thing anymore.

1356
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,240
The other day.

1357
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:43,960
Famous Doug.

1358
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,040
That's another, that's another place, friends.

1359
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,500
Yes.

1360
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,100
That's another place.

1361
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,400
It's not the same thing anymore.

1362
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,540
Where you can get those, those prairie squid drinks.

1363
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,700
You can actually get prairie squid drinks.

1364
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,660
Yeah, they put them in a blender.

1365
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,080
They put them in a blender with, with, with protein powder and just, and just turn them

1366
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,880
into a really thick, it's kind of like a daiquiri in, in, in texture.

1367
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,100
But it's not the real prairie squid though.

1368
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,380
It's the flash frozen stuff.

1369
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,060
I mean, nobody, nobody does it with a live prairie squid.

1370
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,200
Praise Bob.

1371
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,000
Praise Bob.

1372
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:22,040
Well, dear friends, it's time for a moment of serenity and melody.

1373
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,680
Yes, if you'll turn to page five, you'll see a little bit of the original.

1374
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:30,540
I'm going to lead you in the hymn, which we call Bob is my story.

1375
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:39,420
This is a hymn which is usually performed in moments of extreme stress and such I judge

1376
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:39,940
this to be.

1377
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,560
It's very easy and you can support me on the second verse and the chorus if you choose.

1378
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,060
So we'll sing Bob is my story.

1379
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,900
Page five.

1380
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,660
I saw a light in the dark.

1381
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:54,660


1382
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:54,660


1383
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:54,660


1384
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:54,660


1385
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,060
A man with a pipe and a grin.

1386
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,120
All in the new morning light.

1387
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:07,960
Smiling at me like a madman till he made me uptight.

1388
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,400
I told him don't bother me anymore.

1389
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,760
But he kept on just the same.

1390
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,000
Till I was totally brainwashed.

1391
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,780
Bob is his name.

1392
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,940
This is the chorus.

1393
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,960
He is my story.

1394
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,400
Bob is my song.

1395
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,080
Bob my amphetamine.

1396
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,480
All the day long.

1397
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,220
I won't tear my poster of dogs down.

1398
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,080
I'll feel no sadness or shame.

1399
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,780
Till I rejoin him in Dogstown.

1400
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,680
Bob is his name.

1401
00:54:54,560 --> 00:55:01,000
He has no lack of his patented slack for those of his following fold.

1402
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:08,540
He is the friend of whoever will send green bags or gold.

1403
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,800
He's growing stronger and stronger.

1404
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,940
But he keeps redder than flame.

1405
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,400
I'll be a pink boy no longer.

1406
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,600
Bob is his name.

1407
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,780
Bob is my story.

1408
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,180
Bob is your story, friends.

1409
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,340
And Bob is your fame.

1410
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:36,460
Bob is the glands that keep you feeling the way you do.

1411
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,020
Keep your squid juices pumping.

1412
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,480
Bob.

1413
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,760
Well, that's all by the old digital counter on the wall, Reverend Stang.

1414
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,580
Yes, we're coming down.

1415
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,980
We got three minutes left.

1416
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,920
Three minutes of slack time, friends.

1417
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,680
And I could play some burbling background noise.

1418
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,400
Or I could play the official sign-off tunes and so forth.

1419
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,320
Well, we could just talk for another three minutes.

1420
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,400
Easily.

1421
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:58,920
Easily.

1422
00:55:59,420 --> 00:55:59,980
Easily, yeah.

1423
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,640
We could talk for another three hours, friends.

1424
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,140
Or three days, if that's what it takes to get you to write to that sacred post office box.

1425
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:10,280
You've been hearing the learned old scholars of the Church of the Subgenius Society tonight.

1426
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,160
That's right.

1427
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:17,040
And learned we are in the dark knowledge and forbidden sciences of time control.

1428
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,740
Slack extraction.

1429
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,200
And the arcane secrets of the prairie squid.

1430
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:27,080
Friends, are you going to put up with what the gland owners are laying down on you?

1431
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,660
I want you to either stand up or shut up, baby.

1432
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,160
That's right.

1433
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,140
Praise Bob.

1434
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,000
You've got to hip out to it or die trying not to.

1435
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,820
Or just kill me.

1436
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:39,420
That's right.

1437
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:45,100
But, Dr. Gordon, I am going to use this last two minutes to play something I always mean to play and rarely do.

1438
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,480
And that's the credits for the hour of slack.

1439
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:47,780
Yeah.

1440
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,680
You've got all of these people working on the show.

1441
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,180
The only money those people get is the credits.

1442
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:51,560
That's all they'll get.

1443
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,580
Maybe you ought to roll them once in a while, Reverend Stang.

1444
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:53,880
That's right.

1445
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,400
Roll those credits.

1446
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,040
The problem is they're an hour and a half long.

1447
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:03,280
So, friends, Norm Ward and the Monday Morning Creatures will shut off this tape at the proper allotted time.

1448
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,180
Praise Bob or kill me.

1449
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,940
Help me, somebody.

1450
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,980
My legs are on fire.

1451
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,460
She ain't got no legs.

1452
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,520
Pull the lever.

1453
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,340
Down you go.

1454
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,780
The voices.

1455
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,680
Tapes.

1456
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,340
Music.

1457
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:26,380
The TV you've been listening to come from Lepo Abernathy.

1458
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,320
Buck, Naked, and the Jaybirds.

1459
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,900
Dr. Odan Canobites.

1460
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,160
Show's right up on the green lines, Dr. G. Gordon.

1461
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,960
Gordon, killer for Bob.

1462
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,400
Help me, somebody.

1463
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,400
She ain't got no legs.

1464
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,980
Doctors for Bob.

1465
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,740

1466
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,140
Reverend Cleve Donut Duncan.

1467
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,160
Dr. Snavely Eklund.

1468
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,200
Can I stay on radio the easy way?

1469
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,180
Yeah, we're allocating to you.

1470
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:05,800
We're heading out of here.

1471
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,120
This is the tape.

1472
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:12,880
Now that you have paradigm perspective, let's move on to the shift in paradigm.

1473
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,260
This is Dr. Ahmed Fishmar.

This is Hell's Mommy Satellite Weavers.

1477
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,360
This is compatible with all religions.

1478
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,480
And this is Negative Land.

1479
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:42,900
These are those fantastic swinging love corpses.

1480
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,560
These are doctors for dinosaurs.

1481
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,480
These are doctors for Wotans.

1482
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:51,760
These are doctors for cats.

00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,880
This is Gary Gubrog, friend.

1484
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:02,060
This is Saint J'Nor, I believe.

1485

Tell all Bob dogs to sell.

1489
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,520
Help me, somebody.

I don't know.

1513
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,760
This mic doesn't work.

1514
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,600
Turn on the machine.

1515
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,280
