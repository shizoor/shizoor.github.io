1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,360
You've got something in this room.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,840
Something strange.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,760
Magnetic.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,860
Something behind the amplifier.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,100
The South China Sea.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,900
The South China Sea.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,140
He's probably groggy from lack of sleep.

8
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,580
All right, you f***.

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,840
You're forgetting this is the end of the world.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,160
It's time to start acting like it.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,600
It's happening right now.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,980
If you're masturbating, wrap it up.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,120
Make it a good one.

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,860
It's the last masturbation you'll ever have.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,960
I actively don't plan anything for After X Day.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,660
I've been doing it since 96.

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,700
And it's like, yeah, if there's any chance,

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,900
I'm not going to screw it up by not buying into this.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,900
Okay, folks, it's almost quarter of seven in the morning,

20
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,800
July 5th, 1998.

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,600
Friends?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,340
It's not about when we get everything we want.

23
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,460
What it's really about, like every other religion,

24
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,060
it's about when the non-believers get what they deserve.

25
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,780
No, seriously now, and I do mean seriously,

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,420
you're going to get whatever you want.

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,400
The important thing is to really know what you want.

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,160
If your imagination is so limited

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,980
that all you're going to do is just do what you want,

30
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,920
all you can think of is a better version

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,380
of your crappy apartment,

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,960
that's exactly what you'll get.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,640
And it won't seem that different after 7 a.m.

34
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,880
Bob is teaching me things about disappointment,

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,100
except the disappointment in Bob

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,260
is sweeter than the disappointment in life.

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,300
Ten seconds.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,780
Life's disappointments are brutal.

39
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,400
Bob's are part of a joke

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,960
that once you finally get over the buzzword,

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,780
you start laughing at it.

42
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,100
Two, one.

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,300
And I can't take a chance.

44
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,980
I can't take a chance.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,540
I can't take a chance.

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,840
For 30 years, almost none of us ever broke character.

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,160
It threatens sometimes that the character might take over.

48
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,240
Once again, we find ourselves in that age-old traditional situation.

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,060
7 a.m. or something like that,

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,960
something like that.

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,060
Something like July 5th, something like 1998,

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,960
something like the planet Earth.

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,440
We don't have any idea where or when we are,

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,100
and that is the point of the whole thing.

55
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,000
X day could happen any second.

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,480
It may not happen this year.

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,540
There have been times when we were so good

58
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,860
at keeping a straight face

59
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,640
that we could have had another Scientology.

60
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,060
We love fooling people,

61
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,960
but we don't want to fool anybody that way.

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,340
So somebody should have a greater fix.

63
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,900
He can save us.

64
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,960
Oh, he did no good until he did the есть.

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,260
They are all terrible.

66
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,260


67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,260


68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,080
I每есь

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,760
I would like to be that person

70
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,940
that you said Chester was better at.

71
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,200
their minds and yes, sabotaging their future.

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,200
Regardless of what you're looking for.

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,480
In the early 80s, we were outliers.

74
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,420
We were outside the norm.

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,280
People who had grown up in the 50s were just trying to come out of all of the weird stuff

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,920
that had been heaped on us.

77
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,260
Once a person is perverted, it is practically impossible for that person to adjust to normal attitudes.

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,880
The 60s were still echoing, but it turned into the 80s and that whole spirit got flipped

79
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,600
on its head.

80
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,960
You are being deceived.

81
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,380
You're being brainwashed every day by the devil.

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,280
Everything's getting too square again.

83
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,220
The normalcy was oppressive to me.

84
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,500
I grew up in a cultural vacuum, a small conservative Illinois town.

85
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,300
I kind of prided myself on being the outsider in high school, you know, the guy that's so weird,

86
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,420
no one would talk to him.

87
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,460
There is a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions

88
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,860
working solely on the mind.

89
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,720
I'm here to rob you of your very abnormality.

90
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,460
And I'm here to tell you tonight.

91
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,480
The conspiracy is them.

92
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,400
They're the ones that want to hold us down.

93
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,680
They're the ones in control.

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,880
People are always told how to talk, how to walk.

95
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,520
It was the war of the weirdos against the straights.

96
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,860
To enjoy the feeling of being with the in crowd is so seductive.

97
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,520
Marion was rejected today.

98
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,660
If she felt accepted, the whole pattern of her life would be different.

99
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,800
We were grasping for this crazy religion to help us see the light.

100
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,740
It's the church of the subgenius.

101
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,460
Their prophet's name is Bob.

102
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,380
Bob Dobbs came to town to sit free.

103
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,080
It was just this outpouring of expressing ourselves and how wrong we thought the direction of society was.

104
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,520
I thought it was hilarious.

105
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,660
We're probably the only cult that admits that we're ripping them off every day and teaching them to enjoy it.

106
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,680
There must be discipline.

107
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,620
It's wrong.

108
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,800
It's sin.

109
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,780
You've seen them.

110
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:03,420
If Jim Jones could talk 900 people into killing themselves, we could talk 900 people into sending us a dollar.

111
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,340
There's only one guaranteed way you can have peace.

112
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,380
The world will end in 1998.

113
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
God's judgment is going to come.

114
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,400
Quit your job.

115
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,580
Slack off.

116
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,400
The idea of being able to get away from this

117
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,220
zoo of the world.

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,540
It's a dream.

119
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,680
For those who've abandoned hope,

120
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,680
we'll restore hope and we'll welcome them into a great national crusade to make America great again.

121
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,500
Great again.

122
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,440
Great again.

123
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,580
Great again.

124
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,820
Great again.

125
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,020
Great again.

126
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,140


127
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,140


128
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,980
Great again.

129
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,420
Great again.

130
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,620
Great again.

131
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,460
Ah, yes, dear friends.

132
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,960
You guessed it.

133
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,040
That's a clip from the beginning of the subgenius documentary by Sandy Boone.

134
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,660
Now showing on Amazon, YouTube, Apple TV, Fandango, Abel, YouTube.

135
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,180
A bunch of others.

136
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,520
All the details are on dobstown.org.

137
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,600
Don't you wish you could see it?

138
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,680
Meanwhile, here are a couple of new tracks from Reverend Negative from his album, Losing My Religion.

139
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,900
Reverend Negative and Friends.

140
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,620
So here I am with our friend, The Pink.

141
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,300
Hi, I'm The Pink.

142
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,820
Hi, Pink.

143
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,980
Pink boy.

144
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,240
What are you doing?

145
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,800
You bland normal.

146
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,580
Look at you.

147
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,120
Well, that may mean what you think.

148
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,380
Subgenius.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,880
But I'm the Pink.

150
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


151
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


152
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


153
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


154
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


155
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


156
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


157
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


158
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


159
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


160
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,880


161
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,160
I'm a weirdo, too.

162
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,920
You're a what?

163
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,440
You're a weirdo, too?

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,820
But you like football and mainstream media.

165
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,140
The Great Gates of Dobstown.

166
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,160
Not unlike the Great Gates of Kiev.

167
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,900
But not with a piano.

168
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,740
That's right!

169
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,080
Bring out your head!

170
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Bring out your head!

171
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,640
Bring out your head!

172
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:06,960


173
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,140
You roughback vultures. You guys are real hurts!

174
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,220
Ring out your head!

175
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,300
Welcome to Dobbshound where you, yes you are weird just like us!

176
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,840
Pony on down, or horse on down, or cow on down, or goat on down, or...

177
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,140
Bear on down, bear down, bear down, bear down to the cask after me!

178
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,820
Get yourself a cup of mutant tea, yes have a mutant tea!

179
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,420
Ring out your head, ring out your head!

180
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,640
Grab an ear in each hand and twist!

181
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,420
It's yours!

182
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,400
So you can...

183
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,020
You can do it!

184
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,760
You're allowed!

185
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,360
You're a very loud!

186
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,640
Ring it out, ring it out, ring it out, ring it out, ring it out!

187
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,960
Thanks to Reverend Negative!

188
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,140
More to come!

189
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,300
By the way, our background music is the Empire Jazz Orchestra.

190
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:46,080
Next up, a topical tune from a band that for broadcast radio purposes I must call Crib Pooper,

191
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,420
but the real name is Crib ****, a song called Covid Cove.

192
00:10:53,080 --> 00:11:01,160
Somewhere nestled between what is now Madison and Wanakee, there existed a gathering site for the ancients.

193
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,580
A harmonious confluence of the natural and mystical realms,

194
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:11,740
its murky green waters are said to possess unimaginable healing powers.

195
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:23,040
Free from laws and sometimes clothing, folks from all walks of life make the pilgrimage to stew in the cleansing nectar of Covid Cove.

196
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,160
I pumped a fresh tank of premium, no ethanol, used my VooVoo's well for a gas funnel.

197
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,400
I'm fully Bluetooth connected, not infected, big mabel on the back, no doubt.

198
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,780
I'm a little bit of a

199
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,300
It's a God-given right to congregate, we're just passing the vape instead of passing the plate.

200
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,080
Gotta trim up the prop, protect the shaft, these sun-soaked days are my life raft.

201
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,140
Covid Cove, when the sun is up, they'll be coming in droves.

202
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,240
Covid Cove.

203
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,920
It's a God-tank party trove.

204
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,460
Covid Cove.

205
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,020
Let our bodies stew in this viral man grove.

206
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,260
Covid Cove.

207
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,100
It's a cocktail molotov.

208
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,600
Bikini top, she got her booty popped.

209
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,560
Got my Tommy Bahamas and my aqua socks.

210
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,540
Pullin' up with a Yeti full of white claws.

211
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,160
Hand in her mouth like I'm Santa.

212
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm Santa Claus.

213
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,640
I slapped that body up against mine.

214
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,580
My body's warm but my temp is fine.

215
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,740
Some snowflakes telling me to wear a mask.

216
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,580
I'll take a Zen 9 to 5 and wipe my ass.

217
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,840
Life jacket types, Clorox wipes.

218
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,740
Bilge pump, jumper, watch the numbers spike.

219
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,580
Boat work is hard so I'm hardly working.

220
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,040
A real man needs a woman with a freshwater merkin.

221
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,760
Buy a merkin.

222
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,880
Covid Cove.

223
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,600
When the sun is up, they'll be coming in groups.

224
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,760
Covid Cove.

225
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,780
It's a God-tank party trove.

226
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,820
Covid Cove.

227
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,580
Let our bodies stew in this viral man grove.

228
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,800
Covid Cove.

229
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,600
It's a cocktail molotov.

230
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,460
I've been coming out here for 20 odd years.

231
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,520
Getting greased up, creased up, 12 pack of beer.

232
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,300
Poking the boys and I'm making my toys.

233
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,600
They never see it coming, yeah I had a metal oi.

234
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,980
Ahoy!

235
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,900
Pontoons, dooms, rhythm and booms.

236
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,740
Cyanobacterial, failed to bloom.

237
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,440
Flamacode, red duels.

238
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,960
Pop in a chewy.

239
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,460
Keep her straight through the buoys like Tony Shalhouky.

240
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,060
The sun's going down and we're slipping to the cuddy.

241
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,980
It's so dang hot my body's looking at me flirty.

242
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,460
Easy sweetheart grist, leading me.

243
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,240
Totally forgivable Covid-19 float.

244
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,800
Tillers in the mist, gonna go all summer.

245
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,580
Keep the shark in the pants unless you see a chummer.

246
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,760
When the ice in the Yeti starts a-watering down.

247
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,020
The sun starts setting on this little big town.

248
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,780
Cold and cold.

249
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,700
When the sun is up, they'll be coming in droves.

250
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,800
Cold and cold.

251
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,700
It's a half day pleasure trove.

252
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,780
Cold and cold.

253
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,140
I just saw Hannah Montana on a wet banana.

254
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,720
Cold and cold.

255
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,760
It's a cultural party trove.

256
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,840
Cold and cold.

257
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,220


258
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,220


259
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,220


260
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,220
Maisa Dolores

261
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,200
Don't rush me! Stop, stop!

262
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,480
Sister Chris asked me to come down here for an experiment.

263
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,880
She asked me to listen to the Church of the Subgenius cassette

264
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,280
on.

265
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,520
I don't know, she said something like she wanted a normal reaction.

266
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,460
Well, that didn't sound normal to me.

267
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,460
At least it all sounded like a church.

268
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,300
I mean, aren't churches supposed to be quiet and not really boring?

269
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,560
I mean, I could hardly understand what went on there.

270
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,100
I mean, was it meant to be funny or what?

271
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,380
I mean, come on, tell me, is it serious?

272
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,180
Like, you know, do you have to...

273
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,420
Are they telling you to stop listening to Top 40,

274
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,860
give up things like watching Dynasty or eating Haagen-Dazs

275
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,860
or maybe shopping at home from an Esprit catalog?

276
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,440
What? Huh?

277
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,000
What are you trying to say?

278
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,060
What is this note?

279
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,500
Listen, stupid, stop babbling or I'll ship you to Dallas with a sign saying

280
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,060
U.S. Grade-A conspiracy dupe across your forehead.

281
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Hey, I don't know what that means, but I don't like your attitude, okay?

282
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,920
I mean, like, you asked me to come here and I mean...

283
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,860
Why did you even ask me? What?

284
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:41,040
I mean, you can do anything if you feel like it.

285
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,380
I mean, if you get caught up on it, okay?

286
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,380


287
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,600
Seriously, you got a job.

288
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,900
You know, how much did $300,000 just millimeters go to Dallas?

289
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,280
And theyesting the police here is just an insult to my gratitude.

290
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,280


291
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,280


292
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,720
Oh!

293
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,100
It's like, oh, this is the highest probably,

294
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,340
I get it.

295
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,080
You're going to get payback.

296
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
So you locked your ears?

297
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,580
So you locked your ears?

298
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,500
I don't know.

299
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,240
I don't know.

300
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,780
I don't know.

301
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,100
I don't know.

302
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,580
album called Better Living Through Confirmation Bias.

303
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,180
Zier is spelled Z-I-R.

304
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,080
And now, back in time, a mere 35 years,

305
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,940
for Hour of Slack number 76,

306
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,760
with Dr. Philo Drummond, Doctors for Bob,

307
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,140
Pastor David Epley,

308
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,500
Pope Sternodocs, and Dr. Hal.

309
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,340
Only we know what we don't know,

310
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,660
and when we do know it, we shall find out later

311
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,140
just exactly what it was that we didn't know.

312
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,580
But, in the meantime,

313
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,000
we shall experiment further

314
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,320
and delve into the deeper recesses of the human mind

315
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,340
to find out exactly what causes this device not to function properly.

316
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,140
Could it be a malfunction of the foot gland?

317
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,040
Or the nose gland?

318
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,100
Yes, possibly you did not know

319
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,640
that the nose and the feet

320
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,060
are true glands of the human body.

321
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,580
And only after permanent foot and nose glandscaping

322
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,880
can you know how to make your feet smell and your nose run,

323
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,540
which would mean possibly that you were backwards

324
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,260
or built upside down.

325
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,160
But, you'll delve further into that

326
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,600
at the end of the broadcast

327
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,240
when we come back.

328
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,020
You and I cannot hear each other.

329
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,940
Oh, that was Dr. Philo Drummond.

330
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,420
And we can get into this too.

331
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,480
The psychoneurotic mastosurgery,

332
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,960
the techniques of which has been developed

333
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,660
by the many great doctors

334
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,460
who have come over to Dobbs

335
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,860
and from many of the other religious cults around the world.

336
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,860
Maybe the same as I had my frontal lobotomy.

337
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,940
And we've got Europeans and Lithuanians

338
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,220
and ice doctors,

339
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:56,620
and they've been doing this for a long time.

340
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,540
And the big doctors,

341
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,600
and the doctors of the trees,

342
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,880
and the tree-walking brain socket doctors.

343
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,600
We've got a new song about doctors.

344
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,120
And here, hypercletes,

345
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,380
here it is.

346
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,460
Doctors

347
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,300
for Bob.

348
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,780
Doctors for Bob

349
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,600
and everything real in my life.

350
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,600
Doctors and Bob and everything real in my life.

351
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,140
Oh, real in my life.

352
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,940
Damn pickup truck come out blue,

353
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,940
done run over my wife.

354
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,180
He's got the blues

355
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,020
cause they run over his wife.

356
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,140
Some of you gonna get mad at me.

357
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,180
Jesus ain't in the church.

358
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
Don't turn the radio on.

359
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,280
Keep the radio off.

360
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,080
Keep it on.

361
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,480
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state

362
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,280
is Antichrist.

363
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,020
But I'm telling you that preparations are being made.

364
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,860
And that the very door of the day of the wrath of God

365
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,720
is at hand.

366
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,780
And that if you plan to get saved,

367
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,960
you'd better do it now.

368
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,220
There will be a day not in the too far distant future

369
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,580
in which Antichrist will be born.

370
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,060
And the mark of the beast will be revealed.

371
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,500
And the mark of the beast will be introduced.

372
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,700
And people will have a number in their hands and in their foreheads.

373
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,380
They'll be given a computerized number, if you please,

374
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,980
that will entitle them to do business in this world.

375
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,320
And without it, you can starve.

376
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,020
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

377
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,680
Boy, you are kidding.

378
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,240
And that's the way I've felt for quite a while.

379
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,460
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

380
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,440
Ah, you bet, honey.

381
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,440
That's what we're gonna try to do.

382
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,500
I have never flown a city before.

383
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,300
Well, many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

384
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,900
I think they'll pass the $10 bridge.

385
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,640
The original concept was that throughout history,

386
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,160
all great geniuses had somebody at their side

387
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,960
that was kind of steering them.

388
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,860
You know what I mean?

389
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,220
So you say that person is the subgenius.

390
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,520
That was the subgenius.

391
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,140
He was the guy that was really...

392
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,820
He was making sure the genius was used to his proper potential.

393
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,420
Right.

394
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,600
And I can prove for the right reason.

395
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,920
That's why the name is misleading, you know.

396
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,760
Now, I want you to hear a little of the service

397
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,640
where the Holy Spirit was using me

398
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,340
with the gift of discernment.

399
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,620
I was ministering in the Spirit.

400
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,020
God was showing me things about people I didn't know,

401
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,140
I'd never seen before,

402
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,720
but the Lord was talking to me.

403
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,720
God was talking and I was walking.

404
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,760
Listen to a little of this right now.

405
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,740
And you have come to the end of your rope.

406
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,400
Oh!

407
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,100
I don't know which way to turn.

408
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,180
Give me money!

409
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,460
It's starting to affect your nerves.

410
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,120
It's affecting my mind!

411
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,480
And sleepless nights.

412
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,660
It's affecting my mind.

413
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,440
I want to kill my husband.

414
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,180
Today we're gonna put this in the hand of God.

415
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,020
Kill my husband.

416
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,320
In the hand of God.

417
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,800
I want to kill him.

418
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,040
In the Bible in two different places,

419
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,860
a handful of meal brought a miracle.

420
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,420
I want you to hold that envelope open.

421
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,880
That's right.

422
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,780
Please save my life.

423
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,520
I'm gonna give you a handful.

424
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,220
Save my life!

425
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,840
I'm gonna pour it in this envelope.

426
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,480
Ha ha!

427
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,120
Now.

428
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,620
The future of your usefulness to us

429
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,820
brought to you in living simulbursts.

430
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,740
From the depths of the third to simple lives of the Church of the Subgenius.

431
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,960
1984 version.

432
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,120
Send soon for a list of those deities certified approved.

433
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,480
PO Box 14306 Dallas, Texas.

434
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,540
And in turn approved to some.

435
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,080
My six is thirty.

436
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,360
Please send me a message.

437
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,620
75214.

438
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:23,960
Which follow?

439
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,120
Our mail.

440
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,220
Your mail.

441
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:36,540
We're available now on supplementary forms through our offices in Dallas.

442
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:47,580
You may now place the money in the envelope.

443
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,500
Slag!

444
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,500
Slag!

445
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,940
Slag!

446
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:53,460
Slag!

447
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:53,940
Slag!

448
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:53,940


449
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,160
In some ways, the brain is less important to a subgenius than to a pink.

450
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,720
Being less intuitive, pinks need more brains than we do.

451
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,680
Their value system is based on intelligence rather than good sense,

452
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,420
which is related not so much to thinking as to the feelings of the heart and the foot.

453
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,000
As mentioned before, however foolish it may sound,

454
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,480
the subgenius foot doubles as a gland, and a very complex gland at that.

455
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,320
Don't you want to be treated the way you need to be treated?

456
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,000
It treats you the way you need to be treated by intuiting the world around you

457
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,720
so subtly that you rarely notice its machinations.

458
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,780
It was discovered by Dr. Philo Drummond,

459
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,560
and he best explained its functioning in this excerpt from his daily radio show,

460
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,640
On the Road, so named because it is usually recorded in a car.

461
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,740
Self-worth.

462
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,960
Or money.

463
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,960
To love people because they need it.

464
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,560
Or their money.

465
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,060
I believe it's something God puts in us.

466
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,620
Or what else does God put in us?

467
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,700
I wish he'd give us some money, huh?

468
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,840
Yeah.

469
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,260
I want the money.

470
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,860
Oh, we could truly know nothing only.

471
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,080
Reinforcing the powers of the brain and foot gland is a small secondary brain

472
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,980
at the base of the subgenius.

473
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,740
The subgenius spine, the mighty stegosaurus,

474
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,920
also possessed this organ, which made it tweet like a bird.

475
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,280
It helped it direct the reproductive and eliminative systems

476
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,960
that are so important to us.

477
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,620
Another gland unknown to normals is the peen gland in the brain,

478
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,980
which regulates the eight separate stages or character generations

479
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,480
through which the subgenius personality evolves during an average day.

480
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,520
Literally eight different personalities each have control

481
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,980
at the jessie helm of being.

482
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,100
The subgenius brain is the subgenius brain of the subgenius brain.

483
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,100


484
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,100


485
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,820
The actual average human has but four good, bad, bland and asleep,

486
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,240
the last thought by some scholars to overpower the others for up to 18 hours a day.

487
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,440
These different personalities account for the compartmentalization of the subgenius brain

488
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,920
into eight distinct units or efficiencies in the descending order of control.

489
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,740
First, the left brain, the peen gland.

490
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,500
The subgenius brain, which controls paranoia, anal compulsion,

491
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,760
overwork, trying too hard, thinking too much.

492
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,700
Then the north brain, the make brain or take brain.

493
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,080
It handles jobs and money.

494
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,900
The south brain, the fake brain or talk brain,

495
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,540
which covers the gray and limbic areas of speech, writing and lying.

496
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,940
Then the hind brain, the me brain, the pivotal center brain,

497
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,620
the private you rides piggyback on the lord

498
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,720
and is infected by drugs or religion.

499
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,240
Bob comes in on this channel.

500
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,720
Then the forebrain.

501
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,600
The sane brain, which covers love, friendship, traditional family values,

502
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,180
called by some the tame brain.

503
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,580
The inner brain or sex brain is self-explanatory.

504
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,200
Finally, the right brain or lame brain or more brain,

505
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,560
depending on your orientation, intuitive, art, music, drug addiction.

506
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:18,640
And the eighth brain, the outer brain, is a pseudo-physical shell,

507
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,720
encasing not only the other brain, but the brain itself.

508
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,180
Which means, the entire body.

509
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,260
This diffuse brain, larger but far less controllable

510
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,040
than the others, is the nenta life.

511
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,840
The nenta life represents fully half of our brain power.

512
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,040
But because it is so independent from us, we can rarely make use of it.

513
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,020
Occasionally, a subgenius comes along whose nenta life

514
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,520
is incorporated into his thinking processes.

515
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,680
Such less subgeniuses were Da Vinci,

516
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:59,620
Einstein and currently Howard for most of us however the net life is a separate entity a

517
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:06,900
semi-conscious ghost twin which mindlessly follows the physical vessel about but remains dormant

518
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:21,780
are we controlled by secret forces our alien space monsters bringing a startling new world

519
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:32,800
do people think you're strange do you then you may be on the right track unpredictables are not

520
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,880
alone and possess amazing hidden powers of their own

521
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:47,280
are you abnormal then you are probably better than most people yes your kind shall triumph

522
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,700
Oh

523
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:33,900
the church of the subgenius is the pan religion of the future and rebels against the namby-pamby

524
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,740
two shoes new age

525
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,480
yo

526
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:37,480


527
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:37,760
the

528
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,880
the

529
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:38,920
the

530
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,100
the

531
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,400
the

532
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,980
Such people are fools.

533
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,180
They do not curse.

534
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:06,080
They have no understanding of the need for spiritual violence in this modern space age of go-go society.

535
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,200
The subgenius wants no part of the new age.

536
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,280
It is already here, and it obviously sucks.

537
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:24,060
The subgenius would rather retrieve the manly past before 1971 or even 1953,

538
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,400
or else dwell in the naughty, fun-loving remote future.

539
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,180
Words by Subgenius Foundation, which means me and Philo in this case.

540
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,820
And now, from his swinging album, Sunshine Supers Hits,

541
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,880
the Rudy Schwartz Project covering a pink classic.

542
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,960
Music

543
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,260
Music

544
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,560
Music

545
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,680
Music

546
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,880
Music

547
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:58,880


548
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:58,880


549
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,260
Music

550
00:33:59,260 --> 00:33:59,820
Music

551
00:33:59,820 --> 00:33:59,860
Music

552
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,100
Music

553
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,140
Music

554
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,860
Music

555
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:02,860


556
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:02,920
Music

557
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,440
Music

558
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:15,140
It's a supernatural delight

559
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,420
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight

560
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,060
Everybody

561
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,920
The sardine can ask a passing race

562
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,880
If he had seen his journey

563
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,560
Sorry.

564
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:19,240
Steve has a special box in which he keeps the poisonous things he uses.

565
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,040
Bob was growing up too.

566
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,840
He knew about the reproductive organs

567
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,500
and,

568
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,180
he also knew about masturbation.

569
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,180
But he read that the problem was more mental than physical.

570
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,340
Unlock me some of them cream peas.

571
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,720
The Rudy Schwartz Project.

572
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,860
And now back to the subgenie.

573
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,360
In this subgenius documentary,

574
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,340
the clips in which Dr. Philodrumada and I take turns explaining ourselves.

575
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,820
Don't you wish you could see the crazy subgenius home environments

576
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,640
in which these interviews were filmed.

577
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,340
Subgenius Home Interviews

578
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,340


579
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,040
Subgenius Home Interviews

580
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,520
Subgenius Home Interviews

581
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:05,400
I grew up as a little white boy in America in the 1950s in a middle class home.

582
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,860
Subgenius Home Interviews

583
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:06,860


584
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,180
So I have nothing to complain about.

585
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,740
I feel like anybody who grew up in that situation has it better than most medieval kings.

586
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,820
Because we had aspirin and some people had air conditioning.

587
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,940
I'm one of those guys that was fortunate to have like an idyllic childhood.

588
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,960
My family was as normal as they could get.

589
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,840
I was forced to go to a fairly fundamental job.

590
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:36,840


591
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,220
I was forced to go to church for the first 18 years of my life.

592
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:48,360
So that probably had some effect on why I rebelled so strongly once I got away from my folks.

593
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,420
Subgenius Home Interviews

594
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,460
I can't say that I'm rebelling against my religious upbringing or anything like that because I didn't really have one.

595
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,440
I was raised basically secular humanist scientist.

596
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,080
This is Fort Worth, Texas. I was surrounded by Baptists.

597
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,820
Subgenius Home Interviews

598
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,420
I did feel like a weirdo.

599
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,320
Kids would go,

600
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,680
Uh, hey Dad, where'd you family go to church?

601
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,680
I didn't even know the name of a single church. I'd really be stuck.

602
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,700
I'd say things like,

603
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,600
Oh, they have the...

604
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,360
Subgenius Home Interviews

605
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,620
Subgenius Home Interviews

606
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,000
Subgenius Home Interviews

607
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,540
Subgenius Home Interviews

608
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:36,320
I was very much into comic books and any kind of alternate publications and music like Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart.

609
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,680
Subgenius Home Interviews

610
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,400
And people that were not mainstream.

611
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,840
Subgenius Home Interviews

612
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,040
I did not feel like my classmates.

613
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,440
Subgenius Home Interviews

614
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,940
Despite my very fun childhood, I had terrible teenage years.

615
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,000
I had to hang around the theater department in order to meet girls.

616
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,880
That's how I met my first wife, in fact.

617
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,220
Subgenius Home Interviews

618
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,960
I was discouraged from participating in art.

619
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,840
Subgenius Home Interviews

620
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,380
It's not a place where you can make money. You need to get a real type job.

621
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:19,060
So I worked for AT&T and that's kind of like where my insight to the conspiracy took place.

622
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,060
Subgenius Home Interviews

623
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:27,100
My sister-in-law, she said, I have these friends, Philo and Cookie, that I met. You should meet them.

624
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,580
They've just moved to Dallas.

625
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,800
I said, I don't want to meet any friends. I don't need friends.

626
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,060
She said, no, you might like this guy.

627
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:39,700
He collects comic books and he likes Captain Beefheart.

628
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,620
I thought, what? Both comic books and Captain Beefheart?

629
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,460
Subgenius Home Interviews

630
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,160
We just became great friends.

631
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,920
He was the liberal. I was the conservative.

632
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,240
But we were both so disaffected with politics, we didn't believe any of it was true.

633
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,360
Subgenius Home Interviews

634
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,040
What we really had in common was collecting, well, what we might call kook books.

635
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,360
Or pamphlets. Or extremist literature of religious or political kinds.

636
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:16,040
You know, you'd go to a laundromat and there would be The Watchtower from Jehovah's Witnesses.

637
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:21,420
Or a comic book from Chick Publications, you know, This Is Your Life.

638
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:29,840
We loved the range of ridiculous things that human beings can convince themselves of.

639
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,860
If I went out and made my daily quota,

640
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,760
the first thing I'd do is go over and wake up Reverend Stang.

641
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,860
Say, let's get up, let's go do something, let's have some fun.

642
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,340
We were trolls before they had that term.

643
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,140
The internet hadn't been invented, but CB radios had.

644
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,300
And Philo, because he had a real job, had a CB radio.

645
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,320
But we didn't use it to help the world.

646
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,180
We used it to puzzle and confuse strangers.

647
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,540
We would get on and say things like,

648
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,280
Men of Earth, men of Earth,

649
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,140
we are speaking to you from 50 million light years away in space.

650
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,600
Come in, Pink Boy.

651
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,860
Well, there was these two guys that were doing it back to us.

652
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,000
They were trolling us and they were saying,

653
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,680
shut up, Pink Boy, shut up, Pink Boy.

654
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,400
And we interpreted that as, oh, the aliens are finally talking to us.

655
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,300
And that was what they had to say.

656
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,660
The next thing we knew, Pink Boys were everybody.

657
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,840
We didn't like bosses, rude waiters, nasty clerks in stores.

658
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,060
We were surrounded by dumbasses.

659
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,780
We knew that we were dumbasses too,

660
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,680
but we felt like it was a matter of degrees.

661
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,340
People that we didn't want to have anything to do with,

662
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,500
the pinks and the mediocritons, the techno-glorps.

663
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,020
Part of me was in terror of all of that.

664
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,360
But there was also the terrible stress of having to, you know,

665
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,120
make the living and not lose your soul.

666
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,160
Whoa!

667
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:14,280
Well, if you want to get, if you want to be damned by Bob.

668
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,480
I'll give you 5.

669
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,060
And 25 points after the video of me with today.

670
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:54,160
That was it for this episode of Bob and the

671
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,840
And thanks to backings,

672
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:57,980
all the more

673
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,340
and

674
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,700
more

675
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:08,980
among social circles for his perceptiveness, nor his self-perceived talent.

676
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:18,340
Indeed, it is told that his dramatic performance prematurely brought the curtain down, and

677
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:26,000
in truth his shrill, unmanly voice had offended countless stately patron barons.

678
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:34,880
"'What is this?' he says, eyes scanning the script back and forth.

679
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,860
"'I cannot read this.

680
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,140
What language is this?

681
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,820
And see here!'

682
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:48,760
He holds the book out at arm's length, fingers his chin with the other hand, and cocks his

683
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,960
eyebrow up in dramatic pause.

684
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,660
"'I die?

685
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,900
Bill!

686
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,980
Let's die!'

687
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:55,980


688
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,080
Talk.

689
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,200
You don't kill the hero.

690
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,660
It's just not done.

691
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,640
I'm the star.

692
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:10,720
Granted, I did not sign on to do a sequel because of my typecasting fears, but this

693
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,080
is no way to present my glorious exit.

694
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,900
Too bad!

695
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,460
Action!

696
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,400
Clumsy, Juliet enters the stage.

697
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:25,980
She is in a rush.

698
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:25,980


699
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:25,980


700
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:25,980


701
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,540
He is Danish, Young, and Cast душ Chad.

702
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:39,760
He, at least, would find the marvellous British boy a perfect match to share the

703
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:39,760


704
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,300
So, before the 상 It's too close.

705
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:42,300


706
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:42,300


707
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:42,300


708
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:42,300


709
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:42,300


710
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:42,640


711
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,640
it up and any audience member in the cheap nosebleed seats would trip over it with their

712
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,160
eyeballs.

713
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:01,780
Juliet was awkward to a fault and in fact needed her long dress trimmed else she would

714
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:06,600
trip and fall again as her replacement front teeth would attest to.

715
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:15,380
She was also in turn quite rude and obnoxious.

716
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,660
Come on with your line already there she says in the echoing silent theater.

717
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:35,920
That's Romeo to you chiclet he proclaims and pushes her back onto her stage mark under

718
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,580
the low bar.

719
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,420
Budget spotlight.

720
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:47,860
Here for art I dammit he declares and produces a knife from his custom Harley Davidson quick

721
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,180
release special mail order only belt.

722
00:45:53,260 --> 00:46:01,020
He plunges the knife over and over into Juliet's flailing body holding her by the hair letting

723
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,040
her drop when he is exhausted.

724
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:12,140
Romeo stands panting in the spotlight going dim as the batteries grew weak.

725
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,700
See?

726
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,640
He shrieks.

727
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,880
I don't have to die I can take the bitch out instead.

728
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,980
We can get a new one for every performance.

729
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,880
She can even use her own name if she's too stupid to remember the characters name.

730
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,840
Romeo turns.

731
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,020
He's not the only one.

732
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:33,020


733
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:33,020


734
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:33,020


735
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:33,160
He's a good friend.

736
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,280
Romeo comes at the sound of Juliet groaning.

737
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,800
F**k you thumb d**k.

738
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,440
Juliet gasps.

739
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,980
Romeo looks at the knife in his hand.

740
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,240
There is no blood.

741
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:57,200
It was a stage prop rubber knife from Archie McPhee sellers of more fun and bizarre items

742
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,960
than you will ever need in your lifetime.

743
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,000
I'm not going to lie.

744
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,000


745
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,700
I'm going to take you to the hospital.

746
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:12,400
Juliet is rushed to the hospital and Romeo is whisked off to the police station for questioning.

747
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:22,680
Romeo sits in the chair at the interrogation desk twiddling his idiot thumbs and occasionally

748
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,320
rattles the handcuffs because he likes the sound and refuses to talk.

749
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,980
Juliet is in the hospital.

750
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:32,980


751
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:32,980


752
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:43,420
She turns and she says that he is erase me.

753
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:57,440
How sweet it is, that Czymmer got a better degree than my denial period says that.

754
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,180
Movie

755
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,720
Romeo snacks on nets between his scheduled meals and awaits his next,

756
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,040
Hey Romeo, how you doing?

757
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,160
boning.

758
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:23,460
One day, two strangers arrive to visit the now bold-legged Romeo.

759
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:30,960
Through the thick, scratched, bulletproof glass, they introduce themselves.

760
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,660
I'm Quentin Tantino and this is Martin Scorsese.

761
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,240
We'd like you to star in our new western movie.

762
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,440
Yes, that was of course the inexplicable,

763
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,100
Sheridan of Cleveland.

764
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,940
What a character.

765
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,580
And now this.

00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,240
Thank you.

788
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:29,360
Thank you.

789
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,880
Thank you.

790
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:20,480
The Psychoskeletons did that song called A1 Hospital Food.

791
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,440
And now this.

792
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:32,760
Anyway, I had to cut in because the Will of Dobbs just got a call from someone who said that they had called the Cult Awareness group.

793
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,180
There's a group here in Dallas called Cult Awareness.

794
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,960
And had called them up just to see what they would say about the Church of the Subgenius.

795
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:46,380
And the funny thing is that when they first opened, I called them up and said,

796
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,120
Yeah, I'm kind of concerned about these insane cults myself.

797
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,420
And I thought I'd send you some varmints.

798
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,580
And so you could refer people to us.

799
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,380
And apparently they didn't like the material I sent.

800
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,840
I'd never heard from them since then.

801
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,220
But they're now telling people, whatever you do, stay away from those guys.

802
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,080
That's subgenius.

803
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,280
Man, that's the worst.

804
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,680
And especially what?

805
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,220
Keep your kids away from them?

806
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Especially keep your kids away from the Church of the Subgenius.

807
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,900
Because of the sexually explicit material.

808
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,420
Now see, y'all that only listen to the radio show.

809
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,320
You know.

810
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,060
You don't know what you're missing.

811
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,860
And who don't order the tapes.

812
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,440
But I can't advertise that stuff.

813
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,060
And all you can really do is write for information.

814
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,800
From P.O. Box 807.

815
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,420
Glen Rose, Texas.

816
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,940
76043.

817
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,200
For more information about Church of the Subgenius.

818
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,300
And for that sexually explicit material.

819
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,060
Which you don't get for free, by the way.

820
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,920
Not like.

821
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,620
I mean you get this radio show for free.

822
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,960
And get our information for free.

823
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,000
And it's not very sexually explicit.

824
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,400
But like I say.

825
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,620
You.

826
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,300
Those of you who've been putting off.

827
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,320
Writing to P.O. Box 807.

828
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,860
Glen Rose, Texas.

829
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,440
76043.

830
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,120
Fine.

831
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,080
I don't care.

832
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,140
Honestly, I really don't.

833
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,540
I always end up getting the last laugh, dear friends.

834
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,820
I have total confidence.

835
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,620
That that will continue to be true.

836
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,780
So, you know.

837
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,020
I can't tell you.

838
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,240
What the deal is.

839
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,080
With the money.

840
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,720
But.

841
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,160
Gotta get some money.

842
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,360
That dirty.

843
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:35,860
Turkish.

844
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,260
Hark.

845
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:36,800
Black.

846
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:37,620

Martin.

849
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,660
Perkaluma.

850
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,760
Who gets his money?

851
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,640
I'm a thousand brown man.

852
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,360
Yeah.

853
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,960
Yeah.

854
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,640
Yeah.

855
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,380
I'm still the forgive.

856
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:57,840
They, uh.

857
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,260
I heard here and you.

858
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,720
Good.

859
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,120
Good job.

860
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,160
That way says.

861
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,600
The last little.

862
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,660
Word to me.

863
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,480
God.

864
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,020
Hmm.

865
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,260
Nothing way.

866
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,520

867
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:22,520

and has to do with

906
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,880
the universe of us.

907
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,860
It has to do with glass madness.

908
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,580
It has to do with

909
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,040
nothing else.

910
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,780
It has to do with Gilligan's Island.

911
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,540
It has to do with

912
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,520
Triple A Ars.

913
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,600
It has to do with

914
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,260
Gary Eklund.

915
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,740
It has to do with the tip of the luck plane.

916
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,560
It has to do with

917
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,880
the ball that passes over to the main.

918
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,420
It has to do with

919
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:09,040
I hate that old conspiracy

920
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,460
as much as it hates me.

921
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,220
But me and Bob will get them

922
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,300
just here waiting to see

923
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,560
for as long as they run

924
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,740
things they have turned them into

925
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,140
Bob.

926
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,320
The time has come to get them back.

927
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,260
Here's how I look at it.

928
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,260
Now Bob has come to fight them.

929
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,700
That's how we know we'll win.

930
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,340
And we know to serve them

931
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,560
is our only sin.

932
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,340
We won't have long to wait now.

933
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,620
The end is coming soon.

934
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,040
We'll march happy

935
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,060
toward the future

936
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,620
cause we did what we must do.

937
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,300
Underwater vacations

938
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,700
Bob will rule all the nations.

939
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,040
We'll be farming

940
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,580
the vegetation out on Mars.

941
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,260
Cause we killed them

942
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,280
and we ate them.

943
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,820
Said boy we sure did hate them.

944
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,240
And then we made the rounds

945
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,360
of all the bars.

946
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,100
Thank you Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

947
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,920
Great stuff.

948
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,340
So what are you guys

949
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,000
going to do at this revival meeting?

950
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,460
You're going to make fun of

951
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,040
religion stuff right?

952
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,740
We never make fun of religion.

953
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,800
You must understand we're making

954
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,680
money off religion

955
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,060
but not fun of religion.

956
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:24,520
No.

957
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,120
No.

958
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:25,860
No fun.

959
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,560
No fun.

960
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,240
This is no fun.

961
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:27,840
No fun.

962
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,600
We hope to erase the slack area

963
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,120
in this part of the country.

964
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:30,860
We are missionaries.

965
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,740
This is hard work.

966
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,500
It's brutal and gruesome work.

967
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,900
Let's move the position.

968
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,960
Uh, really now.

969
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,180
Are you guys in this cult business

970
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,940
just for the bucks or do you have...

971
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,840
Mr. Wilsey isn't it a fact really

972
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,460
that you've invented this whole thing

973
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,180
that you've thought up all these little gimmicks

974
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,780
and you're taking advantage of it?

975
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:51,780


976
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,200
You're taking advantage of a lot of

977
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,040
ignorant people by getting money out of them?

978
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,760
People who believe in you and your silly preachings?

979
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,340
No it isn't Joe.

980
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,980
The Illuminati will be unmasked

981
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,460
and the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with that.

982
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,320
Bob is going to see that the whole conspiracy,

983
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,440
the Illuminati, the trilaterals,

984
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,820
you name it, the guys that drive up and down the street

985
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:17,400
selling ice cream, all of that will be exposed.

986
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,380
That's what America needs.

987
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,080
They have their brains washed.

988
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,180
Clean out all that filth and all that garbage

989
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,340
and all that fear and all that sickness and perversion

990
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,420
and all that junk that comes from the pit of hell.

991
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,180
Radio announcer and many friends of the rail land

992
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,740
this is the old fashioned healing broadcast

993
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,180
coming direct from the auditorium here in Dallas.

994
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,300
This is a special night tonight.

995
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,460
This is oil night.

996
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,880
Would you love to have a heart like God?

997
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,960
Come out and be anointed with this miracle oil

998
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,320
that God has let me use for quite a few years now

999
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,880
and we're giving it out.

1000
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,540
Come and join the hundreds of people.

1001
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,620
Bring that bottle and get some of this miracle oil

1002
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,620
that's absolutely raised the dead

1003
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,120
and has performed some of the greatest miracles.

1004
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:00,860
You name it.

1005
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,380
It's performed every known miracle that's happening.

1006
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,580
But look, it's, no, Hal, look out!

1007
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,900
You clumsy fools!

1008
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,260
What have you done?

1009
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,860
The show, it's ruined!

1010
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:13,680
Ruined!

1011
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,220
Goodbye for all of us here.

1012
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,100
This is Puzzle Inn and its loveliest wrecks, Reverend Hal

1013
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,240
and Reverend Irv.

1014
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:21,900
We tried.

1015
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,760
Saying it's too late and we trumphed.

1016
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,400
Goodbye folks!

1017
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,820
I don't know how it works!

1018
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,900
The whole thing's ridiculous.

1019
