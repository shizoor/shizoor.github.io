00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Folks really want to believe that the Martians are coming.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,760
They're bored. They want some excitement.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:16,480
And after all, they come here because this is the closest thing that they can get to actually being on the planet Mars.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,180
Ah, yes, dear friends.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,960
I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony.

6
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:16,920
I'd like to hold it in my arms and keep it company.

7
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,820
From PR News in Washington, I'm Bill B. Blunt.

8
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,120
Democrats condemn Republican tactics to kill Bill.

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,000
Republicans say they support playing PR News.

10
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,980
Stay tuned.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is said to be doing fine and resting comfortably by reason of insanity.

13
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,060
Pro-Russian gunmen are escalating inside the buildings and remain outside.

14
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,900
The BBC's PR Report has the latest from outside the buildings.

15
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,360
Outside the building, a crowd of local ethnic protesters remain, saying that does not appear to be a building.

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

17
00:01:59,880 --> 00:01:59,980
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,440
Dressing in clothes from Afghanistan is warning the Obama not to do anything.

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,340
And I urge them not to take any steps that could lead to activity.

20
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,880
Hagel warns this is PR News in Washington.

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,400
cioè

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,900
Well, maybe what you've got is an ordinary Gang warning.

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,920
Well, maybe what you've got is an ordinary Gang warning.

Well, maybe what you've got is an ordinary Gang warning.

waking and itching could be signs of eczema, seborrhea, or psoriasis.

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,260
Ask your doctor.

28
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,960
Look at more funny cases share them and stay updated

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,100
Thank you.

33
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,500
Thank you.

34
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,140
Thank you.

35
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,740
Thank you.

36
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:07,920
Thank you.

37
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,420
Thank you.

38
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,100
Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

44
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,100
Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

50
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Thank you.

51
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,440
Thank you.

52
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:20,780
Peki.

53
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
Where should I put ride 6, that's good.

54
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,060
It has to turn on to the aproveando distributor.

55
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,720
Use the button purchased by Tree 아니야ur Scholar Service.

56
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:30,960
Try it if you want it.

57
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,200
We will control the most powerful bomb in the universe, the sun.

58
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,740
If we can rent that thing that drills to the center of the earth, I would rather do that.

59
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,160
Everyone would like to go down there because big monster.

60
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,680
Well, I understand there's some large dimetrodons and some big mushrooms.

61
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,040
Yeah, I know, I know.

62
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,700
Well, they live in the magma of underground.

63
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:03,620
They do swim unharmed through the magma of the underground, an astonishing being or any being.

64
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,600
But these large pelicasars can do it.

65
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,840
And I understand the thing is viewport so you can take pictures if you bring your camera.

66
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,740
Dave, some people think that we're evolved from whales.

67
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,300
Who thinks that we're evolved from whales?

68
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,840
Aliens.

69
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,100
Aliens think that they, well, you know.

70
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,240
They think that we are evolved from whales.

71
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,460
Whales.

72
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,080
And they've been giving Bob a hard time about that.

73
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,620
I don't know.

74
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,980
I don't understand this.

75
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,840
Well, even as a fructose child, with our gathered blithering as we sat and watched the cranial tube,

76
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,940
there was Mr. Science telling us that an early date and time, one mammal hit the road and the other one hit the swimming pool.

77
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,020
So there is a strong belief in our common ancestral things.

78
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,160
They often say that the pitches that...

79
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,600
um...

80
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,020
seals hear.

81
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,340
And the habits and social order of seals is very much similar to a dog.

82
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,960
So to call a sealistic dog is not as unusual as one might think.

83
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,760
It's not as perhaps...

84
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,280
an anomalistic dog.

85
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,120
Well, I think we're just about ready to take calls here on the victory line.

86
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,460
Now between the hours of 2.23 in the morning and 3.45 in the morning,

87
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:30,600
we're going to be receiving special gamma ray ding-dings from your gamma and gamp up there deep in the cosmic sweaty poop.

88
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,500
We're going to be taking them all on to our prefrontal areas and we're going to be sucking them down through the diaphragm,

89
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,020
shown here and given to you by Nurse Cobb and some of the other nurse helpers.

90
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:50,200
For those of you who can no longer sweat and whose pores are now closed by the duck ointments passed out earlier,

91
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,540
those of you who passed out,

92
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,260
will find themselves in a very, very safe place.

93
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:11,740
And friend, you can be safe too if you'll just give your mind, wallet and heart over to J.R. Bob Dobbs and his church of the subgenius, yes?

94
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,420
You too can be clean, clean, clean, clean like Dave here.

95
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,640
Yes, much like Dave.

96
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,680
All smooth and beautiful.

97
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,520
Vegetables cleaned and cluttered here in this CRISPR area.

98
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:22,520


99
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:22,520


100
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,040
Yes, and the below the fray.

101
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,660
Your brain doesn't need to be all wrinkled and convoluted anymore.

102
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,100
No.

103
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,680
Nay, nay, nay, nay.

104
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,060
It could be clean.

105
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,380
That's right, Dr. Logan.

106
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,620
It feels better that way, doesn't it?

107
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,360
Now, now, now that you've given over that $30 check to Bob,

108
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,520
you are in our care.

109
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,380
Clotches.

110
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,900
Yes, yes.

111
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,840
Great in our control.

112
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,060
Great under our control.

113
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Well, now that we've got them, what do we do with them?

114
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,240
Dave?

115
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:11,380
I say we eliminate all the fat vesicles from their knees and from their calves.

116
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,960
We make the pores on the top of their head much bigger than the ones on their nose,

117
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,280
so the next time they pick a pimple, their brains explode.

118
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,340
I say we fry them.

119
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,380
I say we kick them into joy juice and poop them out later.

120
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,980
I say we fondle the cosmos with our own erectus.

121
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,940
Yes, yes, yes.

122
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,380
Yes, yes, yes.

123
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,180
Yes, yes, yes.

124
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,860
Well, that was a prescription for greatness,

125
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,160
if I've heard one here on the subgenius radio network.

126
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,060
That was an idea whose time has come in its pants and your head.

127
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,080
Boom.

128
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,480
That's an idea whose fruition has gone smelly.

129
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:07,820
I'd like to supply some of our subliminal listeners with some exercises for the upcoming week.

130
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,340
First week.

131
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,460
Beginning on Wednesday.

132
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,060
Those with the blue sticker on the back of the fridge.

133
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,800
And the red dungarees.

134
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,220
You cannot wash off.

135
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,860
Remember, it is your time for free food at the mall.

136
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,780
Don't ask.

137
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,840
Don't pay.

138
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,280
Take it.

139
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,260
It's being taken care of by our friends at...

140
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,840
Can I say the name?

141
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,580
WCSB in Cleveland.

142
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,320
Yeah, yeah, right.

143
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,600
None of those places near Washington.

144
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000
Lone cow Dave.

145
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,740
Don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

146
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,300
Listen, it is not my fault.

147
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,880
I had nothing to do with putting the opium receptors in the human nervous system.

148
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,960
The fact that you have a receptor in your brain and the resistance for acid is not my problem.

149
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,380
I mean...

150
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,420
Too late.

151
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,960
Huh?

152
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,360
You have disрузced me with your thinking.

153
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,620
Then as if that is all you have to do...

154
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:29,620


155
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:29,620


156
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:29,620


157
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,300
Masculine old lady Taylor.

158
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,540
Oh!

159
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:32,640


160
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:32,640


161
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:32,720
Masculine get an 이번?

162
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:32,720


163
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:32,720


164
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:32,720


165
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:32,720


166
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:32,740


167
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:32,740


168
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,280
Drink holy can.

169
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,280


170
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,280


171
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,280


172
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,000
Our friend here.

173
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,000


174
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,560
I see the full circle of joy.

175
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,540
Cerumen我們

176
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,840
Graengo amleto aymakido action.

177
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,340
Where is the healing gem of Christmas?

178
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,320
verkus retirement

179
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,820
them in the streets. We shall never surrender, whatever the cost may be, because the conspiracy,

180
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,900
you see, wants us to get angry. The conspiracy, you see, wants us to lose our collective tempers

181
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,140
and to go out and buy guns and then to march into some public place and start blowing the

182
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,340
brains out of a few dozen pinks. That gives them a reason to round us up and put us away in their

183
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,700
prison nowhere houses. They're just waiting for some petty nitpicky excuse like mass murder to

184
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,360
give us hard time. They could care less that we're helping reduce world overpopulation or

185
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,640
decreasing the unemployment rate. They could care less that we're expressing our own individuality

186
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,140
and fulfilling the American dream of the ultimate personal pursuit of happiness. Oh sure, it may be

187
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,840
our God-given right. It may be expressly protected by the Constitution, but they could care less.

188
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,900
So don't get into the urge that's fallen into their trap. Resist the temptation to rid the

189
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,080
world of inferiors.

190
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,320
Their moment will come soon enough, but until then, we must bide our time. We must love our

191
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,680
enemy even as he drags us from our beds in the night and kicks us and beats us and batters us

192
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,600
black and blue. We must love our enemy despite his dumbness, even as we wait in their checkout

193
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,460
lines checking out all the ugly people and reaffirming our belief that there is indeed

194
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,560
evil in the world. We know they control our lives, that they deliberately bounce our checks and run

195
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,220
up our bills. We know that they take our tax dollars at gunpoint and then spend it on themselves

196
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,680
and their families. We know that they take our tax dollars at gunpoint and then spend it on

197
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,540
their parasitical freeloaders in exchange for a rigged vote. We know that they control the media,

198
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,160
the movies, and then try to make the rest of the world hate us for being better than they are.

199
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:26,540
But can you blame them, dear friends? As distasteful of a task as it may seem, try to switch places

200
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:33,140
with the enemy. How would you feel if you were one of them? Can you stumble a mile in their shoes?

201
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,800
Just imagine what it would be like without having an imagination. No talent, no intelligence,

202
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,900
no nothing.

203
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,340
Just a blithering idiot. And along comes the subgenius. And what does he have? Why, everything.

204
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,080
Brains, broads, and buttloads of slack. You'd be spiteful, too. You'd probably join the conspiracy

205
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,860
and sell your soul if they promised to give you something the subgenius didn't have. Now, remember,

206
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,880
you'd be too stupid to realize the subgenius didn't have what you had because he didn't want

207
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,100
to have it. Even if you could figure it out, you'd probably rationalize it away as sour grapes that

208
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,180
the subgenius didn't want the material goods that you possess only because you had them.

209
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,520
And if you could, you'd be a good man. And if you could, you'd be a good man. And if you could, you'd be a good man.

210
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,780
It would never occur to you that the conspiracy had already made the same offer to the subgenius

211
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,580
and he had turned them flat down. And not only that, but the conspiracy had offered the subgenius

212
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:25,760
more than it had offered you, and he still turned it down. No, you would seek solace in the false

213
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,600
consolation that you were better than your intellectual superiors because you drive to

214
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,660
work every day in a new BMW and walk the conspiracy treadmill nine to five in your

215
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,340
designer yippee outfit. So you see, when you look at it from their standpoint,

216
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:46,440
it's hard to hate our fellow subhumans. One could almost feel compassion for the average minded

217
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:54,380
normals and pinko mediocrities because we know, we know that there but by the grace of Bob goes us.

218
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,380
It was merely a fluke of nature that provided that superior mutation, that divine birthright

219
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,920
that destined each and every one of us to that inescapable future of the future ruling class.

220
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,440
We didn't ask to be more than mere mortals, but we were cast into the role by influences,

221
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,720
beyond their control from beyond the stars. It is a gift that we admittedly do not deserve and may

222
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,240
lose at any time. A so-called hunting accident or unexpected motorcycle crash. Anything with

223
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,400
irrevocable brain damage can make us forfeit that birthright as well. We too can find ourselves

224
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,380
shuffling amongst the moron majority, living the life of someone too stupid to know just how stupid

225
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:38,140
they really are. Or worse yet, conspiracy dubbed intellectual sideshow freaks, the fools who are

226
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,580
fooled into thinking that they're thinkers by some mere,

227
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:47,420
piece of paper or diploma issued by and for the amusement of the conspiracy. Oh, the pain, the pain.

228
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,860
Dear Bob, if ever we should be reduced to such mental poverty, please, please do not let us go

229
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,200
so far as to think we are smarter than we were before the lobotomy. Let us at least die with

230
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,160
dignity rather than live out our delirious duller delusion. Give us courage to do unto others as we

231
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,520
would have them do unto us. Somebody please, please pull the

232
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:17,680
plug. Let us die with pride instead of being the object of sarcastic derision. And in return, we make

233
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,480
this solemn pledge unto them to return the favor to each and every normal come judgment day. Yea,

234
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,520
we shall put them out of their misery despite the personal sacrifice. Come next day, we shall do unto

235
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,980
the normals as we would have them do unto us if we were in similar circumstances. Our formal enemy

236
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,760
shall become our future friends and we shall perform our errand of mercy. The ultimate sacrifice,

237
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,560
human sacrifice, for at long last the wait will be over and we shall overcome the normals and pull

238
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,740
the plugs on the pinks. We'll strangle them with their own entrails. We'll haul them up a piano

239
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,780
while we'll slice them and dice them and feed them to our fish because we know that deep down

240
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:02,240
it's the very least we can do. Herein is the word of our priest Bob. Amen.

241
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:19,000
There might not come a day when there'll be peace and understanding.

242
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:32,920
And there might not come a time when the world is cured of hate and crime. As long as there are

243
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:40,660
people and as long as there are fear and greed. What's the point in fighting this war?

244
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:48,560
Wars will come and wars will go. The poor and the weak will always be in need.

245
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:57,860
But there will come a day and for this I'm sure you need not pray.

246
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:06,520
Yes, there will come a day I'll shove that cell phone up your ass.

247
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:17,820
No, there won't come a day when there'll be peace and understanding.

248
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:28,180
And there won't come a time when there's no such thing as hate or crime.

249
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:37,660
As long as there are people and sad to say they're growing like weeds.

250
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,700
Wars will come.

251
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,960
And wars will stay.

252
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,500
Like it or not it's gonna be that way.

253
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:55,820
But there will come a day and for this I know you need not pray.

254
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:04,620
Yes, there will come a day I'll shove that cell phone up your ass.

255
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,340
I'll stick it deep inside your ass.

256
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,000
Your cell phone up your ass.

257
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,800
From PR News in Washington, I'm cooler than normal.

258
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,740
The number of people is down slightly. The number of people rose slightly.

259
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,060
PR's Moron reports that this is PR News in Washington.

260
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,620
And this should be Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

261
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,120
With the alien smegma pie as requested.

262
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,000
Thank you, thank you. We were getting pretty hungry.

263
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,440
Yeah, I love the flaky crust on those.

264
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,860
Thanks for getting that in quick.

265
00:22:50,540 --> 00:23:00,400
And thanks to the Rudy Schwartz project that did that song and the one at the long instrumental at the beginning.

266
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,360
And thanks to Papa Joe Mama for the rant.

267
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,600
And miscellaneous cut-ups by Lee Murr and New Monet and Puzzling Ever.

268
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:09,600


269
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,940
And the evidence reorganized by yours truly.

270
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,500
And now this.

271
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,740
Which is Dave. Again.

272
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,400
Yay!

273
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,740
It's a Dave.

274
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,880
It's a Dave.

275
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,920
It's a tape? What is a tape?

276
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,300
It's a Dave. It's a Dave. It's a Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

277
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,680
It is. But is it a tape? I still don't know what the hell you're talking about.

278
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,820
You see, I've got these creases growing right now.

279
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,860
And every time I move them it makes a little squeaky noise.

280
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,640
Sometimes I have a hard time hearing it.

281
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,240
Other times I just want to ignore everything.

282
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,820
You ever get that feeling?

283
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,580
Yeah, I have trouble hearing over the sound of my own forehead.

284
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,320
Sometimes.

285
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,120
Because it gets crits and whirs and grinds.

286
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,180
And if there's sand in it.

287
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,260
That's the prosthetic forehead, right?

288
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,760
It's like one of those machines in Quicksilence Metropolis.

289
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,720
I mean, the big huge wheel type thing.

290
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,780
Right.

291
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,260
So, we thought about discussing the origins of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

292
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,880
But I also have an article about the origins of Princess Wee.

293
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,400
So she's...

294
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,720
Yeah, there's...

295
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,220
She's been originated?

296
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:33,320
Well, apparently the Chinese have been talking about Princess Wee for a long, long time.

297
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:33,740
Yeah.

298
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,360
That's a mythological creature.

299
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,640
Yes.

300
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,520
There's seven arms and six vaginas and three ears and stuff like that.

301
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,120
Seven million years in age.

302
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,280
No, no, no, that's not too personal.

303
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,500
Besides, you're short a couple there.

304
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,500
A few.

305
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,740
But there's two ancient Chinese concepts.

306
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,040
Which might be our most powerful tools.

307
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,140
Wu Wee, pronounced Wu Wei, but I won't pronounce it that way.

308
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,160
And Di.

309
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,700
Pronounced duh.

310
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,760
And I will pronounce that that way.

311
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,920
Wu Wee literally translates as no trying or no doing.

312
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,520
But it's not at all about dull inaction.

313
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:21,740
In fact, it refers to the dynamic, effortless, and unselfconscious state of mind of a person who is optimally active and effective.

314
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,840
People in Wu Wee feel as if they were doing nothing.

315
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,580
While at the same time, they might be creating a brilliant work of art.

316
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,720
Smoothly negotiating a complex social situation.

317
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,620
Or...

318
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,540
Destroying a radio show.

319
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,620
And so forth.

320
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,740
I'm sorry.

321
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,920
I got that.

322
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,260
People in Wu Wee have Di.

323
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,300
Duh.

324
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,800
Typically translated as virtue, power, or charismatic power.

325
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,200
That's it.

326
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,960
That was the sound of Wu Wee.

327
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,760
The sound of Wu Wei.

328
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,680
But...

329
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,240
Yeah, it's sometimes called the wah.

330
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,040
The wah?

331
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,920
The duh.

332
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,000
Wu Wee.

333
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,220
Wu Wee.

334
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,660
Well, see, we got the duh, the we, the Wu Wee, the Wu Wee, and...

335
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,220
And the duh.

336
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,480
Uh-uh.

337
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:28,280
I've seen a lot of goat rodeos in my lifetime, in my short span of existence.

338
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,360
This has got to be...

339
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,740
I could just see goat riders on top of them going, Wu Wee.

340
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,260
Wu Wee.

341
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,080
Stuff like that.

342
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,500
Goat riders in the sky.

343
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,780
Why a goat?

344
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,600
That's them.

345
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,880
You know, waiting in the wings.

346
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,320
They're waiting to take over.

347
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,720
The pove and hoofed ones.

348
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,680
If, uh...

349
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,460
I thought they...

350
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,120
I've kind of...

351
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,800
Are you sure they haven't taken over?

352
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,940
I'm positive they have.

353
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,120
In fact, I'm so sure of it, I'd be willing to bet 45 cents on it.

354
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,040
Wow.

355
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:13,780
As a capital outlay, I could start with that and work my way up to perhaps several million dollars if the right people were to come along and have the right idea about how to live in the future.

356
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,660
But so many of them don't.

357
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,880
They just lacklusterly pass their days hoping that someone will come and save them.

358
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,160
There's somebody who can come along and save them right now, isn't there?

359
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,220
Reb, reb, reb, reb, reb.

360
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,000
There will come a stranger wearing one brown shoe.

361
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,620
There will come a stranger wearing one brown shoe.

362
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,980
And one brown shoe.

363
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,800
And he will be smoking a pipe.

364
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,680
And by these you shall know him.

365
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,460
And he shall know your daughters.

366
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,540
And the Hubbard slays.

367
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,740
All at the same time.

368
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,500
Yes, knowledge.

369
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,200
The fruit of ignorance is knowledge.

370
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,960
And we could pair it up like a pear or cut it up like a peach.

371
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,720
Or we could just slice and dice it and throw it at everything.

372
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,620
We have a new pineapple claim.

373
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:03,720
I'm sorry.

374
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:03,720


375
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:03,720


376
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,760
That's what you use as a pineapple corer.

377
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:13,420
You stick it on the top of the head, the crown of the head, and just start grinding and turning.

378
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:31,520
And it cores the center out, which then can be removed carefully and shipped in a frozen container to J.R. Bob Dobbs and his genetic engineers who can then read the DNA in your cranial sample.

379
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,840
It's about an inch in diameter what they take out.

380
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,940
So you won't miss it.

381
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,280
When they take out that much, you'll never know it's no longer there.

382
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,020
You'll never know you had it in the first place.

383
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,720
I think that's kind of what Papa Joe Marma was preaching on earlier in the show.

384
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,160
Yeah, but he still wants to be a woman.

385
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:59,820
And besides, if you're packing that much information into a small amount of space like that, there's no way that things aren't going to run out or drip once in a while.

386
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,160
Provided.

387
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,760
There's the alacrity and the alarm and the alarum to notice them.

388
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,020
Multiple alarums.

389
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,040
Yes.

390
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,620
But yeah, the brain juices do leak.

391
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,060
And to tell the truth, Dave, they smell.

392
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,460
Oh, thank you so much.

393
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,240
No, I don't mean yours.

394
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,760
I mean everybody's, not just yours right now.

395
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,580
Yours is bad right now, but everybody's gets that way.

396
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,040
Did you consult with Reverend Brain Leak over this?

397
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:30,960
No.

398
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,140
Where is old Reverend Brain Leak?

399
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,300
Brain Leak is in the state of Michigan where he lives.

400
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,940
Which is like Satori to many of the Zen devotees in the state of Michigan, but it's a very aggravated hockey-driven state.

401
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,060
Where people throw car licenses at you and argue with old ladies on the corner.

402
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,660
And then they beat them up, you know, vigorously and demand their attention.

403
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,260
I want to go to Michigan now.

404
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,420
He's also been in a state of confusion.

405
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,440
But, you know, that happens with young folks.

406
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,580
I am the capital.

407
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,700
I am the original and mainest city of confusion.

408
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,260
And if you want to come and live with me, you can.

409
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,660
But don't plan on doing anything because there are no plans.

410
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,380
Wow.

411
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,620
It's as tame as you were.

412
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,420
Oh, I can hear them now.

413
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,180
They're like, they're already talking in the past tense about everything.

414
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,920
You think the world maybe really ended and we didn't know about it again?

415
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,040
Right.

416
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,420
I think so.

417
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:31,420


418
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,680
I mean, to them, we're already dead.

419
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,220
Or gone.

420
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,160
They might think we're dead.

421
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,400
We're probably just elsewhere.

422
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,500
And I don't mean dead by that.

423
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,080
I mean on some beautiful spaceship.

424
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,420
Or in a vat.

425
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,280
But thinking that we're on a beautiful spaceship.

426
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,360
What's the difference, you know?

427
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,240
What is the difference?

428
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,760
Really?

429
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,420
Well, they're in a vat of boiling fat.

430
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,560
And that is a total mess.

431
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,400
And that is a total mess.

432
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,400


433
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:01,820
And that is a true thing.

434
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,800
That is real.

435
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,900
That is very material and substantial of a feeling.

436
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,160
But to lighten the atmosphere,

437
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,080
there are thousands of ukulele players wearing very bright Hawaiian shirts

438
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,460
surrounding the entire area

439
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,580
playing Aloha Hawaii

440
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,880
as the ship blasts off.

441
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,200
So there's not a lot of regret among those who are being melted down for it.

442
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,200
No, of course not.

443
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,360
Everybody looks forward to that kind of heaven.

444
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,720
Hawaiian shirted ukulele players.

445
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,240
Yeah.

446
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,660
Do you play in slack key Hawaiian guitar?

447
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,380
No.

448
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,260
Remember the Duke of Uke,

449
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,240
our ukulele playing friend

450
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,780
who covers heavy metal tunes with a ukulele?

451
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,340
who covers heavy metal tunes with a ukulele?

452
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,300
Oh yes, he's even

453
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,200
you can hear him in elevators

454
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,580
around the country now where they still have elevators

455
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,620
playing

456
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,200
I Want to Be Sedated by the Ramones.

457
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,640
That's right. That was one of his hits.

458
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,980
And it actually received national airtime

459
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,220
And it actually received national airtime

460
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,200
and I, well, never mind.

461
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,620
Yeah, what you were about to say is unlike us.

462
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,280
Yeah, what you were about to say is unlike us.

463
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,040
They received national airtime.

464
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,220
They received national airtime.

465
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,680
But you know, there's many, many reasons

466
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,760
why we can never be allowed

467
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,620
why we can never be allowed

468
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,540
into real radio stations

469
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:18,560
into real radio stations

470
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,420
or prime time or any of that.

471
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,100
And every time that I'm in

472
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
a real radio station,

473
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,680
you know, the kind that's full of crap

474
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:28,700
you know, the kind that's full of crap

475
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,380
all day long

476
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,980
24-7, I feel like

477
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,220
I feel like that

478
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,760
the hour of slack just wouldn't fit into

479
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,500
their format.

480
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,840
I was forced to listen to

481
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,820
commercial radio a couple of weeks ago

482
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,620
because I had to be on a show

483
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,840
and I was

484
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,700
and I was

485
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,880
reminded once again,

486
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,780
no way, there's no way what we do

487
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,440
would ever happen

488
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,500
on commercial radio.

489
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,540
Especially if you believe in reincarnation.

490
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,300
Just think of all the millions

491
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,380
and millions of people

492
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,880
who have gone out there to, well,

493
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,540
I don't want to name the big industries

494
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,660
that run the commercial radio business

495
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,160
because there's only five of them

496
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,620
and each one I represent with a finger of my hand

497
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,840
like my thumb and my forefinger.

498
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,700
Well, never mind, that's another story entirely.

499
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,000
But, um,

500
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,940
people who espouse

501
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,200
certain beliefs like

502
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,640
deep meditative breathing,

503
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,360
Arnold Schmeck,

504
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,520
gross misappropriation,

505
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,400


506
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,940
other devices that you can hide

507
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,420
in your...

508
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,420
Golfer head launching.

509
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,140
Yeah, golfer head launching and stuff like that.

510
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,980
You automatically, there's a little

511
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,520
red X right next to your name

512
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,540
and you have to wear the, uh,

513
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,360
what are they, the they live

514
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,480
glasses or some kind of special equipment

515
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,460
to see what's even going on.

516
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,500
So, you know, you're gonna

517
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,440
walk into that room, you're gonna smell the air

518
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,720
and you're gonna get me the

519
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,700
heck out of here, you know.

520
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,320
Well, that's just one of the problems with

521
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,420
reincarnation.

522
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,120
An even more serious problem is that

523
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,520
this show, The Hour of Slack, has been on

524
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,420
for so long that there

525
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,060
are people who've heard

526
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,920
some shows twice

527
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,860
in two different lives.

528
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,880
It's like they heard show number

529
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,100
51 back in

530
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,200
1983 and then they died and were

531
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,820
reborn and then now,

532
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,220
20 years later, or 30

533
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,160
years later, they hear a

534
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,060
rerun of Hour of Slack number 51

535
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,580
and go, why do I feel like

536
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,520
I've heard this before?

537
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,560
Is that what you call subgenius time control?

538
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,940
It's a rerun, but it hadn't been rerun since before I was born.

539
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,000
Now, that's like what?

540
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,640
That's it. It's a form of transubstantial deja vu

541
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,240
encountered by

542
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,200
some of the three-time lifer

543
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,400
subgenius. Sometimes they go as

544
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,700
many as three lifetimes as subgeniuses.

545
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,060
Ah.

546
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,360
They really get sick of Hour of Slack number 51

547
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,960
by then.

548
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,200
Well, by the time they're a baby born in

549
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,240
1912, already wanting to hear this

550
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,460
drivel in which their parents can't

551
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,420
supply because they give them other kinds of

552
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,820
drivel. So,

553
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,340
we have to also bring them

554
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,080
into the fold. I'm not like a...

555
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,800
Pablum and all that good stuff.

556
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,240
Now, I just wondered if that was a kind of subgenius

557
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,000
time control was my question.

558
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,400
Well, if you batter, dip, and deep fry them, it is.

559
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:16,880
Yes.

560
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,240
Time control, going out of control, street

561
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,320
cleaners, ball cleaners.

562
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,260
Oh, wait, I'm a clothing cleaner.

563
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,220
I can't do that.

564
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,020
No, we had to sell Jayner.

565
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,480
We had to sell

566
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,140
Jayner to the Canadian fake

567
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,480
boss.

568
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,380
And then they

569
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,360
hated each other once they actually

570
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,480
saw it, talked to each other. They hated

571
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,880
it, like everyone does.

572
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh, well.

573
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,560
At least we got paid.

574
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,260
Well, you know, the thing they say about

575
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,840
country fried steak, you know,

576
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,440
it's just enough to go around.

577
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,380
Is that what they say about

578
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,400
country fried steak? Because I never

579
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,280
could understand what they were saying

580
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,460
the whole time that I was

581
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,580
eating it, because I was chewing too loudly.

582
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,380
He just dreams of it constantly.

583
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,040
Yes, I do.

584
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,380
Real chicken fried, smothered in that white

585
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,400
gravy. Oh, yeah.

586
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,520
Mmm-mmm.

587
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,320
I can't do a plug for Waffle

588
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,120
House, because

589
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,760
there's not one anywhere nearby.

590
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,220
I think it's 30 miles to the nearest Waffle

591
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,340
House from here. I checked.

592
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,460
Otherwise, I'd be there instead of

593
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,140
here at this

594
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,180
microphone. Yes, it's at the

595
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,680
nexus of his dreams.

596
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,140
The Waffle House in the sky.

597
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,160
Oh. This music

598
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,020
in the background,

599
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,040
old people have heard it

600
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,480
many times. Mmm.

601
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,060
Dr. Dark gave us this

602
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,020
recording of Superman music

603
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,300
from the original Superman TV

604
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,240
show. Not the one anyone living

605
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,900
can remember, but the one with George

606
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,280
Reeves. Mmm. Not Steve

607
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,380
Reeves or Christopher

608
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,040
Reeves. Not Christopher Reeves. But George

609
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Reeves, the Superman who

610
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,360
we grew up, you know, he committed

611
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,300
suicide, that actor

612
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,720
did, shortly after

613
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,300
the Superman show. And of course,

614
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,200
those kids all were going, he thought he was

615
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,120
Superman, so he just jumped out the window

616
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,700
and he fell off of that

617
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,940
Daily Planet building and died.

618
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,480
Because he's stupid, he thought he was Superman.

619
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,260
But actually, it turns out

620
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,600
the actor was having a torrid

621
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,420
affair with, I think, the wife of

622
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,960
the producer. Mmm.

623
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,200
And, um,

624
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,980
he felt like... And he wasn't a real

625
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,180
Superman, so to speak. He was the

626
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,260
only way out was to go

627
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,300
back to Krypton.

628
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,060
Well, yeah. And it's gone. I think, you know,

629
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,120
he said, screw this, I'm

630
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,540
freaking Superman, I'm jumping out of the window.

631
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,180
Dr.

632
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,300
That's what we all like to...

633
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,280
Faster than a speeding bullet.

634
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,340
I could play that

635
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,560
very thing that you're quoting,

636
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,580
but I won't.

637
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,480
It's at the beginning of the CD that's on right now.

638
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,780
Dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun,

639
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,620
dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun!

640
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,340
Look! Up in the sky!

641
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,420
It's like Bela Lugosi

642
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,400
reading the 23rd Psalm or something

643
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,140
like that to children or something.

644
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,480
You've got... Do you have

645
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,200
that record? Yeah.

646
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,720
Bela Lugosi reading the 23rd

647
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,160
Psalm to children?

648
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,260
Yeah. Yeah.

649
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,500
Which one is that? I can't even

650
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,400
remember which one that is. Well, it

651
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,480
was the one that the Nazi... What's

652
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,160
he named? The one more criminally... He said,

653
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,540
he had bought all these

654
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,100
recordings from Hollywood

655
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
before things got frigid between

656
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,260
the United States and Germany during the war

657
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,400
and had acquired all these

658
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,160
semi-forbidden tapes

659
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,940
and he used them as propaganda

660
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,820
devices. Wait a minute, I've got it.

661
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,720
Not like chicken scratchers or

662
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,320
pickle grinders or any kind of

663
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,140
device like that, but you know, like

664
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,200
a rhetorical

665
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,840
device. It was like this.

666
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,220
Though I walk through the

667
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,300
valley of the shadow of death

668
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,300
I will fear no

669
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,460
evil, for I

670
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,780
am evil.

671
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,260
Hey, the other day, I should have... Princess

672
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,220
Wei, should I have brought

673
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,300
my new screenplay

674
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,320
called Count Jesus and

675
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,800
read it on the radio?

676
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,040
Possibly you should have. No, you don't want to.

677
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,420
So you're working on a new

678
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,360
screenplay already? Well,

679
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,500
I kind of stole... Here's what I did,

680
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,460
Dave. I suddenly had this idea

681
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,480
and I found a... On Wikipedia,

682
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,660
I grabbed the synopsis

683
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,220
of the novel Dracula by

684
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,360
Bram Stoker and I had a fun

685
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,440
little time doing search and replace

686
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,900
and I replaced

687
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,460
Dracula with the

688
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,700
name Jesus

689
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,420
and Count with

690
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,180
Lord Christ

691
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,860
or Christ Lord or something.

692
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,440
And I replaced London with

693
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,640
Jerusalem and

694
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,940
Transylvania with Nazareth

695
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,120
and Vampire with Nazarene.

696
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,660
Nazarenes. Yes.

697
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,200
And the great part was where the

698
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,320
brides of Jesus who were

699
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,680
called the Three Sisters,

700
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,440
the Three Nazarenes came and attacked

701
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,980
Simon Peter

702
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,120
who I replaced Jonathan

703
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,800
Harker.

704
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,560
Who did Van Helsing

705
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,200
turned into Pontius

706
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,300
Pilate? He was

707
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,260
the good guy. And they had to kill.

708
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,980
It's like Matthew, Mark, Luke and John

709
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,340
and Mary Magdalene had to

710
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,260
kill Count Jesus

711
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,280
because he'd been going around

712
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,780
putting everybody under his telepathic

713
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,300
control. Turning them into

714
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,220
Nazarenes. Yeah, turning everybody

715
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,980
into everybody whose blood he drank

716
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,540
became Nazarenes.

717
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,480
It's funny, after I

718
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,400
had changed everything, the story was

719
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,180
still the New Testament

720
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,360
and Dracula by Bram

721
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,220
Stoker remained completely

722
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,320
interchangeable.

723
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,360
Wow, man. I'm glad you discovered

724
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,120
that for the sake of humanity.

725
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,340
But see, I don't want to read that on the air

726
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,360
because it would be offensive.

727
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,300
Yeah, for the sake of your career

728
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,820
as a

729
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,560
person continuing to exist in America

730
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
I...

731
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,820
It's funny, you can

732
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,180
describe the process and somehow

733
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,340
that's not as offensive as when you

734
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,400
actually read Count Jesus

735
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,320
at the end.

736
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,100
I think the last line is

737
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,360
and they cut off his

738
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,880
head and stuffed myrrh

739
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,340
in his mouth and

740
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,240
freed Mary from the

741
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,200
curse of Jesus.

742
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,740
Yeah,

743
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,140
it was heavy.

744
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,800
It was heavy.

745
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,420
It made me want to

746
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,980
run out and produce a movie.

747
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,960
A low budget movie

748
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,440
with all the cameramen dressed in

749
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,040
robes playing

750
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,920
shepherds and Jesuses.

751
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,160
I know a guy who made

752
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,220
a movie called The Rebel

753
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,420
Jesus. I didn't know him very

754
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,260
well. He was the great director Larry

755
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,220
Buchanan who's better known

756
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,140
for Mars Needs Women.

757
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,620
Yes.

758
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,360
And other hits that were made in

759
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,340
Dallas. But one of the movies he made in

760
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,940
Dallas was The Rebel Jesus.

761
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,440
And it was about how Jesus wasn't

762
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,560
crucified but went to India

763
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,440
and smoked hash.

764
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,420
And it did

765
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,200
indeed, but was partially

766
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,900
filmed behind hotels.

767
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,300
He did go to the Holy Land

768
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,720
but he had trouble finding

769
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,360
locations that didn't have telephone poles

770
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,240
or cruise ships in the background.

771
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,160
So they went ahead and left him in.

772
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,500
It's like I've got

773
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,380
a still somewhere of Jesus

774
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,060
doing the Sermon on the Mount or

775
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,420
fishes and loaves or something. And there's a big

776
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,640
cruiser on the ocean behind him.

777
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,440
And this is

778
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,720
a still. They could have

779
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,900
airbrushed it out.

780
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,900
But that was

781
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,680
the great Larry Buchanan.

782
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,080
What a filmmaker.

783
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,200
Isn't he the filmmaker that made all the movies

784
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,660
with the women with the big boobies?

785
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,620
No, you're thinking of Russ Meyer.

786
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,260
No, no, no. It was a totally different thing.

787
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,400
Larry Buchanan also did

788
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,920
Zontar Thing from Venus.

789
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,600
He did a movie called Down on Us

790
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,080
which was about

791
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,140
Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin

792
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,060
and Jim Morrison

793
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,100
being murdered by the CIA

794
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,200
because they were anti-war.

795
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,260
And that has some

796
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,360
great fake

797
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,280
Hendrix music and

798
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,280
fake Jim Morrison poetry

799
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,620
which ended up being

800
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,400
transcribed by

801
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,360
the Rudi Schwartz Project and read by me

802
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,200
and it's on a Rudi Schwartz Project album.

803
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,260
But it's fake Jim Morrison poetry.

804
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,420
It's fake Jim. It's me

805
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,800
reading fake Jim Morrison

806
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,700
written by Larry Buchanan

807
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,980
in a kind of a poet

808
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,680
voice like this.

809
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,200
The bacon for tomorrow's

810
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,380
breakfast will have the peculiar

811
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,160
taste of ash.

812
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,640
I was real proud. That's my one

813
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,540
of the albums I'm on.

814
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,780
I'm on a Rudi Schwartz album

815
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,640
and I'm on a Negative Land album

816
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,660
at the very very end of the song

817
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,500
called Christianity is Stupid.

818
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,980
That's a song title.

819
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,620
And you can hear me going

820
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,200
yai yai yai yai yai

821
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,480
That's Five Strikes right there.

822
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,020
Well the funny thing is

823
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,420
everybody who hears that album

824
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,860
assumes that the preacher

825
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,480
that they cut up for that song

826
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,360
is me.

827
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,000
Because this guy's going

828
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,580
the loudspeaker spoke up and said

829
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,420
the loudspeaker spoke up and said

830
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,000
Christianity is stupid.

831
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,060
Communism is good.

832
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,240
I can see why they would think

833
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:32,940
that was me.

834
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,860
Except that I think they're all stupid.

835
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,000
And good.

836
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,020
Your friend Clyde is once again

837
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,980
in his media barrage using

838
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,180
the loudspeaker spoke up and said

839
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,100
Oh really?

840
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,180
Oh so Clyde Lewis

841
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,680
is using Negative Land.

842
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,020
Yes.

843
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,140
Well maybe he is copying the hour of slack

844
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,520
from 20 years ago.

845
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,840
We were ahead of our time

846
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,440
and he's now 20 years behind our time.

847
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,660
But still ahead of everybody else's time.

848
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,980
No but you see

849
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,780
this is the way things are

850
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,960
and how far they've gone.

851
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,400
When you listen to his callers

852
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,580
and the content of his programs

853
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,820
he is 20 years behind the time

854
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,560
and so everybody else is.

855
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,340
But us, we went back

856
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,080
we screwed up somehow.

857
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,980
We're not hitting the right pivot points.

858
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,440
We're missing

859
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,160
We're 20 years before

860
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,520
Jesus' time.

861
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,980
We're right up to date

862
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,480
for the year 30 B.C.

863
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,800
That was a great comic strip.

864
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,140
30 B.C.

865
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,780
until that guy turned into a Christian.

866
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,920
He did too.

867
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,640
Johnny Parker went born again

868
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,180
and suddenly the caveman and the ants

869
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:47,920
were doing these

870
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,060
pious

871
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,780
joke killing routines

872
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,280
around Christmas time.

873
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,460
That was because that was the best comic.

874
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,500
When we were kids.

875
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,680
Yeah when we were kids.

876
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,640
Yeah but then he decided to save

877
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,600
his readers.

878
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,400
But he's still

879
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,640
his name is still on those

880
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,000
those damn comics are still out there.

881
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,340
Think how many really

882
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,560
talented young cartoonists there are

883
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,500
who gave up because they're

884
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,760
reprinting Peanuts.

885
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,320
And why aren't they reprinting

886
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,420
Little Abner which was actually ahead

887
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,620
of its time. Yeah.

888
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,620
And behind its time.

889
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,900
I like the salacious drawings

890
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,440
of the women that

891
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,160
contempt a young man.

892
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,800
Those are great man.

893
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,460
What in Peanuts? Yeah Lucy was so hot.

894
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,340
Not in Peanuts.

895
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,600
I never saw Lucy. Little Abner.

896
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,060
Oh yeah. Not Little Abner.

897
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,400
I'm talking about the Biblical

898
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,020
you know the Biblical cartoons you were

899
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,240
talking to on the other

900
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:50,800
afternoon.

901
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,480
I'm gonna go back to the girl

902
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,320
of Little Abner. Did you ever see

903
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,800
Wolf Girl? She was in the 40s.

904
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,680
Man.

905
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,180
I remember in Playboy there was a

906
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,820
Girls of Little Abner issue.

907
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,200
Really? They were all

908
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,640
truncated. Most of them were

909
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,160
had the dwarf Mountie syndrome

910
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,080
and were wearing Mountie clothes.

911
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,640
You know like Northwest

912
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,220
Mounted Police clothes and stuff like that.

913
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,460
They were very short women.

914
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,360
And they did have real sharp

915
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,040
looking teeth. They were burying their fangs.

916
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,360
No man you're thinking of Peanuts not

917
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,060
Little Abner.

918
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,060
You're all confused Dave.

919
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,240
You're in a state of confusion. In fact you're

920
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,140
the capital of the state of confusion.

921
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,520
Dave Town.

922
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,360
It doesn't have to do with cashews

923
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,180
or fruit mix or Peanuts

924
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,500
or anything like that. It has to do

925
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,320
with what you've been talking about when you were trying

926
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,240
to confuse me on purpose.

927
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,440
Lone Cow Dave don't you see

928
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,820
what they're doing to yourself?

929
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,260
That was Reverend Televangelo.

930
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,040
Who said that?

931
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,540
I'm supposed to make a

932
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,120
torrid comment

933
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,840
right now.

934
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,100
Something with a T.

935
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,340
A comment with a T. And then I was

936
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,500
supposed to fall back asleep and you were supposed to wake me up.

937
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,640
Wake up Dave!

938
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,800
I've read now.

939
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,520
I've read now.

940
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,500
That's the smartest thing

941
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,400
any of us has said all

942
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,820
night.

943
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,520
I've read

944
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,640
a lot of things.

945
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,340
I've read a lot of things.

946
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,660
I just have to say praise

947
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:28,900
Evangelista

948
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:30,920
Televangelista

949
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,600
for that quote.

950
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,600
I don't know how we would put one foot in front of the other without that quote.

951
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,360
It's a lot shorter to type Lone Cow

952
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,880
Dave than Lonesome

953
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,340
Cowboy Dave.

954
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,720
Which I do

955
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,160
every week. I have to type

956
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,080
that name out at least twice.

957
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,160
All the way

958
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:52,520


959
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,700
Swineboy is my most

960
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,880
popular name.

961
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,140
My fan club says it's Swineboy.

962
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,240
It's the form of endearment

963
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,800
most used commonly by

964
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,240
people in the Buffalo

965
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,160
to Rochester area. People out

966
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,080
in the far west have different

967
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,380
it's like calling a smoky

968
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,320
bar a handle bar.

969
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,220
Well, Yankees

970
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,900
can't tell the difference, half of them,

971
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,720
between a cow and a

972
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,600
pig or a horse.

973
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,420
Yeah, especially with the plumbing utensils

974
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,400
they have to use. How can you anyway?

975
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,220
Plumbing utensils?

976
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,640
I wouldn't want to try and milk

977
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,500
a male horse or something

978
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,800
like that. Try to find

979
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,760
the secret to happiness

980
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,540
just because somebody tells me

981
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,000
I should take more math.

982
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,880
I don't know.

983
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,400
I know exactly what you're saying.

984
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,580
Princess, we remember the time

985
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,560
we were in Dave's

986
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,540
supermarket. Dave's?

987
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,720
And a

988
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,580
Yankee came up to us and her daughter

989
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,760
and they asked us

990
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,180
the difference between, well basically

991
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,340
they had us explain what a sheep was

992
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,400
because they'd gone to the

993
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,420
butcher

994
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,020
and tried to get it and said

995
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,200
what's the difference between

996
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,000
lamb and veal?

997
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,060
What was the difference?

998
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,520
What were those animals?

999
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,360
The butcher wouldn't even talk to them.

1000
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,280
He insulted them and

1001
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,380
they walked up to us for some reason

1002
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,500
and said, excuse us, could we

1003
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,240
I can't do a Yankee accent, but

1004
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,280
can you explain the

1005
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,660
difference between lamb and veal?

1006
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,900
And we go, well veal's a baby cow

1007
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,260
and lamb is a baby

1008
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,200
sheep. And then

1009
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,380
they both wanted

1010
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,260
to know what a

1011
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,500
sheep was.

1012
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,160
And I think I said

1013
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,660
that's the smaller

1014
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,180
one that's covered with

1015
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,940
white wool.

1016
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,400
It's not as big

1017
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,500
as a cow, but it's bigger than a pig.

1018
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,400
I don't think we went into

1019
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,360
the gory details of

1020
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,320
how veal calves are

1021
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:03,980
grown.

1022
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,620
That's one of the most beautiful stories

1023
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,300
I ever heard you say, Stank.

1024
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,980
I think that we intoned

1025
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,240
the poem of

1026
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,180
a baa baa black sheep.

1027
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,560
Have you any wool? No?

1028
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,200
No, but we speculated that they had never

1029
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,960
heard that. These were people

1030
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,100
who had apparently never

1031
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,020
watched Sesame Street

1032
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,540
or if they did

1033
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,320
they weren't paying much attention.

1034
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,300
And they didn't get

1035
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,360
nursery rhymes or storybooks.

1036
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,360
These folks were really

1037
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,480
cursed. I mean, a Chinese immigrant would know those words

1038
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,560
if they're spelled backwards.

1039
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,500
I think they might

1040
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,120
have been interplanetary and I think

1041
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,200
they just let it go

1042
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,140
just like Superman did. I'm from

1043
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,980
Krypton, I don't know what the hell a sheep is.

1044
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:48,620
What's a sheep?

1045
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,360
Well, look Superman, whatever. Would you

1046
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,980
please just cook it for us with your

1047
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,020
x-ray vision? No, no, kill it first!

1048
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,320
Imagine how

1049
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,720
that would feel, you know,

1050
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,100
Superman cooking a live

1051
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,980
sheep as it was

1052
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,440
walking along. Who would want to live with such a guy?

1053
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,960
You know, I mean, think of... He might be like

1054
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,380
microwaving a cat. Yeah.

1055
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,380
Like if you were like Santa Claus or

1056
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,220
Bruce Springsteen or somebody

1057
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,200
and we was married to you.

1058
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,120
Right. And any time

1059
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,120
you got mad at you... Exactly what I was saying.

1060
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,500
And she was like Wonder Woman or Superwoman or something.

1061
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,900
That's just what I was thinking.

1062
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,280
Yeah.

1063
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,300
She's doing it right now.

1064
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,160
What a horrid thought.

1065
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,260
No, really, Superman could

1066
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:32,900
microwave

1067
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,360
animals while they were alive. If he

1068
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,880
was mean, he could do that to

1069
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,320
people. As a child

1070
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,420
in Smallville. Do you suppose he

1071
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,900
ever did that? Do you think he ever experimented

1072
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,880
with small animals?

1073
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,440
Toads, cats? If he was a teenager, he had to

1074
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,280
have done something inordinately

1075
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,500
cruel and not really mean it like, let's

1076
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,560
go burn neighbor Wilson's

1077
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,600
house down and...

1078
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,920
Hey, hey, hey,

1079
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,620
Clark Kent, let's go dump pig's

1080
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,740
blood on Carrie's head.

1081
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,360
I don't know if I want to mess with

1082
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,420
Carrie. She's got

1083
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,320
her own powers.

1084
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,300
Well, he is absurd and a plane.

1085
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,560
No, he's a superman.

1086
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,500
Yeah, but he doesn't have

1087
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,340
telekinetic powers like

1088
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,560
Carrie did. He had every other kind of power.

1089
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,560
Right. But in some ways,

1090
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,380
Carrie, that teenage girl,

1091
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,260
mentally disturbed teenage girl,

1092
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,980
could possibly defeat Superman.

1093
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,540
Now, here we're getting into,

1094
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,200
we're getting off the subject of

1095
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,840
the Church of the Subgenius and into

1096
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,740
who would win, Superman or Carrie?

1097
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,680
You know, you're Superman.

1098
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:38,860
I don't know.

1099
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,720
Who would win, Darth Vader

1100
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,400
or Jurassic Park?

1101
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,960
Jurassic Park is a mean dinosaur.

1102
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,240
Yeah.

1103
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,340
It would be great.

1104
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,540
Half an hour of anime film, two hours

1105
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,320
and two and stuff, and you spend like five

1106
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,700
minutes in the beginning and the end

1107
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,280
talking to the master. Superman has to,

1108
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,280
because they're at a deadlock, you know?

1109
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,320
I think

1110
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,200
Darth Vader would beat

1111
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,380
Jurassic Park because he has

1112
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,420
the Death Star.

1113
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,520
And he had the same power that Carrie did.

1114
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,480
And I don't mean any of the

1115
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,540
Carries that we know.

1116
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,020
There are a lot of them.

1117
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:18,780
Yes.

1118
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,200
A lot of modern Americans

1119
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,660
have no reason, they feel

1120
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,320
there's no reason to wear underwear.

1121
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,160
They're not disciplined.

1122
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,640
They're not

1123
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,600
inscriptable. They're not confusing

1124
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,200
in any way. They're completely

1125
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,340
in total, they're lost to this

1126
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,460
world, as

1127
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,380
Professor Franco said just last night.

1128
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,340
They're not a part of this

1129
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,720
world we live in anymore.

1130
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,140
They refuse to, they think they're

1131
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,080
freer than other people are.

1132
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,560
And they're not.

1133
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,140
No.

1134
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,260
No.

1135
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,620
Bad cheese

1136
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:56,720
fragrances.

1137
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,200
P-U.

1138
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,620
Essence of bad cheese?

1139
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,060
Yeah, bonfowler cheese.

1140
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,560
That's the worst kind.

1141
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,080
Bonfowler cheese.

1142
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,320
Hours of symposiums

1143
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,480
about how to make it better.

1144
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,360
That's what I can't do.

1145
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,980
You know what we can do, though?

1146
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,520
We can make this show better

1147
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,040
in about five minutes.

1148
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,040
I'm not going to be jumping out of a window

1149
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,340
like Superman, I suppose.

1150
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,260
No, Dave, don't jump out of the window.

1151
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,980
No, they won't let us. That's why, remember,

1152
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,360
they keep the windows bolted shut here,

1153
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,660
so you can't do that anymore.

1154
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,280
Also, you can't smoke.

1155
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,900
Well, there was a person who, I can't remember,

1156
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,900
it might have been almost 20 years ago,

1157
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,040
but there was a person who thought they could

1158
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,980
clamber out the window. There was that one

1159
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,180
window, do you remember?

1160
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,020
Yes.

1161
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,880
At WCSB's old studio.

1162
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,380
Where they kept the record albums.

1163
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,040
Where Dave would be sent to smoke.

1164
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,820
Yes.

1165
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:55,880
Cigarettes.

1166
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:56,760
Yes.

1167
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,880
You could smoke marijuana

1168
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,440
all day long in the building.

1169
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,720
Nobody ever said anything about that.

1170
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,440
Better not smoke a cigarette.

1171
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,460
You gotta go outside and smoke a cigarette.

1172
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,540
You smoke your marijuana all day long.

1173
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,460
Those days are long gone, though.

1174
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,880
Heaven's Days is gone because of 9-11.

1175
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,920
Ever since 9-11, you can't smoke pot

1176
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,700
in a radio station.

1177
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:19,860
You can't.

1178
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,700
The police are still hot now.

1179
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,260
No, sir.

1180
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,740
And they're still forbidden from learning

1181
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,940
the sacred rights of Ulan and the other

1182
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,800
different temperatures we have to get into

1183
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,180
and stuff like that. Why can't we all

1184
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,120
just do it?

1185
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,380
You know what the listeners are thinking right now?

1186
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,560
What? They're not smoking pot?

1187
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,260
Why can't we all just get along?

1188
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:40,920
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1189
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:44,180
You're saying this show sounds this way

1190
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,720
and they're not smoking pot in the radio station?

1191
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,380
Actually, that is

1192
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,540
exactly how it is. That's the way it is.

1193
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,780
That's the way of the future.

1194
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,560
Well, they used to remember

1195
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,680
the old days before they got all

1196
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,960
neo-euro over in Holland there now.

1197
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,100
And now they're even post-neo-modern.

1198
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,320
I mean, post-neo,

1199
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,960
you know, whatever.

1200
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,900
I just said, damn, I hate

1201
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,460
when that happens. But I don't really

1202
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,620
care that much, so I'll continue to dominate

1203
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,060
with my stupidity.

1204
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,020
Well, I did forget what I was talking about.

1205
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,560
Post-modern neo.

1206
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,540
Oh, the kabouter bars.

1207
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,540
And the, you know,

1208
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,740
the people who spout, who are clearly

1209
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,400
you know,

1210
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,480
part of the kabouter bar scene

1211
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,200
in Amsterdam. And

1212
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,380
they were funny to Dutch people who I don't

1213
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,480
really believe have a true sense of

1214
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,240
humor. I think they're kind of too

1215
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,000
Germanic.

1216
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,320
I'm sorry to mean that.

1217
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,100
It's germane to the conversation

1218
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,560
now that we start to fade you

1219
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,600
out and play

1220
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,220
the monster

1221
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,200
URL end and

1222
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,320
MH high sound effects

1223
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,700
and maybe the

1224
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,740
psycho-skeleton's Mars base.

1225
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,560
Okay, I'll do my smoky Amsterdam rap.

1226
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,580
I didn't want that. I didn't want

1227
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,760
an evil book.

1228
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,700
I don't know Africa.

1229
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,480
Even a man who is pure

1230
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,020
at heart

1231
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,380
and thinks he has

1232
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,320
his slack, yet

1233
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,280
if he eats those pickles

1234
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,120
too soon, will have pimples

1235
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,340
on his back.

1236
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,560
Pimples on my brains,

1237
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,020
don't they?

1238
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,020
Pichles in milk,

1239
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,160
good old

1240
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,600
Pichles in milk.

1241
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,820
And pimples.

1242
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,060


1243
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,720
No!

1244
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,500
Ah!

1245
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,760
There's still time!

1246
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,260
Make the wish! Quickly!

1247
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,840
Think of the power we can have.

1248
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,680
No!

1249
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,880
Ah!

1250
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,460
Ah!

1251
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,600
Yes!

1252
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:04,480
Ah!

1253
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,280
Ah!

1254
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:08,640
I know it ain't made sense!

1255
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:08,640


1256
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:08,640


1257
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:08,800
Make주�ov

1258
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:08,800


1259
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:08,800


1260
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:08,800


1261
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:08,840
Aha!

1262
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:17,000
Oh hi, dichaamos de

1263
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,000
Thanks for watching!

1264
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,520
Thanks for watching!

1265
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,040
Thanks for watching!

1266
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,740
Thanks for watching!

1267
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:17,940
Adventures of Superman!
