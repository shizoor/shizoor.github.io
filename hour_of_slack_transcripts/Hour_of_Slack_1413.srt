1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Hi Bob! Hi Bob! Hi Bob! Hi Rick!

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,460
Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan!

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,920
You better get out of here fast before I call the police.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,740
Okay. Let's have a scene with the Bobbies.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,900
Let's get them all in here. I'll tell them the whole thing.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,260
What whole thing?

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,180
The show begins.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,920
Power of the One.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,680
Come on, Bob. For old time's sake, huh?

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,660
Did you just call me...

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,760
Blob?

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,580
I don't know, but...

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,120
I told you not to mention his name. Why'd you call him Blob?

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,920
I didn't call him Blob. I said Bob.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,080
Enjoy, Bob.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,260
It's Bob.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,200
Aw, crap. When I want to laugh, I'll take Bob. Thank you very much.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,980
What is that?

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,060
Pause it.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:01,740
A Bob?

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,120
Well, this is a full-fledged aggressive Bob, alright?

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,960
And I don't know what's going on, but it should not be in this man's kitchen.

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,380
And if it is, he should turn and run.

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,560
Not try to reason with it.

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,080
What's your problem, Bob?

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,540
Oh boy, look out. Look out, here it comes.

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,380
We are building a Bobtopia.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,800
Oh, it's all coming together.

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,700
What the fuck is going on here?

30
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,160
They're all pink on the inside.

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,540
It's a sea of Bobs.

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,580
I say hey to Bob, they say back hey to Bob.

33
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,320
Say hey to Bob, hey to Bob, hey to Bob, hey to Bob, hey to Bob.

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Bob, hey, you look good. Bob, Bob, you look good.

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,160
I got some surprises for you, too.

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,980
I'm looking forward to a surprise, then.

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,220
Good.

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,760
Um, I'm gonna need a little help.

39
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,740
And I would like to bring out my assistant, Bob.

40
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,420
Ah! Pink!

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,460
Oh no, pink! Pink! Pink!

42
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,040
It's all over. It's all over.

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,820
No one's going to notice if you're pink.

44
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,520
Wait a minute. Go back.

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,780
Zoom in.

46
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,060
Where's that man, Pink?

47
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,740
Oh, sorry I can't open the door, but I don't want Bob sneaking back in the house again.

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,460
Oh, that's okay. I just came by to see how you're doing.

49
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,700
Oh, I'm working through some things.

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,700
I've gotten past denial and I'm well on my way to acceptance, so...

51
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,240
Yeah, yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. Anyway...

52
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,880
Take Bob back.

53
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,920
I bet I can't do that right now.

54
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,660
I've talked to Bob and he's really sorry.

55
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,560
Now be a sport and take him back.

56
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,320
I can't.

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,860
Take him back!

58
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,160
No!

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,620
Take him!

60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:43,920
No!

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,160
Zip, zip, zip.

62
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
Zip, zip, zip.

63
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,480
Zip, zip, zip.

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,620
Zip, zip, zip.

65
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,720
Zip, zip, zip.

66
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,880
Zip, zip, zip.

67
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:08,900


68
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,500
I'll let him go or who are you?

69
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,500


70
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,500


71
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,500


72
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,500


73
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,020
Zip, zip, zip.

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,120
Zip, zip, zip.

75
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,120
Zip, zip, zip.

76
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,140
Well, who are you?

77
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,900
I'm Bob.

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,480
Interesting gene pool.

79
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,560
Don't cast aspersions at my family.

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Oh, I beg your pardon.

81
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,480
Why is Pink?

82
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,780
Whose is Pink?

83
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:24,980


84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
Whose is Pink?

85
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,120


86
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,180
What?

87
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,420
It's pink!

88
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,180
Oh, hey!

89
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,680
The sky was on fire

90
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,740
when I walked to the mill

91
00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:03,060
To take up the slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky

92
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,620
wonty, round and round the cobber's bench

93
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,720
the monkey chased the weasel

94
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,900
The monkey thought it was all in fun

95
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,020
goes the weasel

96
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,180
A penny for a spool of thread

97
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,100
A penny for a needle

98
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,380
That's the way the money goes

99
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,440
goes the weasel

100
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,320
Uh, hi.

101
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,680
Uh, y-yeah, okay.

102
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,580
Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.

103
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,640
We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you.

104
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:20,720
They're experts at what they know

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,900
our viewers. Today's guest is Bob. Hi, Bob. So, Bob, so you just get in town? So,

106
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,160
so what have you been up to? He was my best friend before Bob was my best friend.

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,240
He's been with me through so much. And that's the way Bob has set that system.

108
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm a mental slave. So if you could just free yourself. Free your mind. From mental slavery.

109
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,180
That is the key.

110
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:19,460
Feel my altitude flowing high through salvation. Distracting me from the rules.

111
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,320
It's right.

112
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
The wind, a wave of blues

113
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

114
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,200
Fluttering like a butterfly through the trees

115
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,920
Crossing all the lines of limitation

116
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,160
Now I'm finding all of mine among the leaves

117
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,980
Releasing all my hesitation

118
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,740
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

119
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,540
Feel my altitude

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,900
Flowing high through salvation

121
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,540
Distracting me from the rules

122
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,120
Drive the wind away from blues

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,240
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

124
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:15,960
Distracting me from the rules

125
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

126
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,360
Passing birds I see

127
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,160
Rainbow clouds are luxuries

128
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,980
Feel my mind erased

129
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,380
It's all adapted from the earth

130
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,980
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

131
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,340
Fluttering like a butterfly

132
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,180
Through the trees

133
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,980
Crossing all the lines of limitation

134
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,260
Now I'm finding all of mine among the leaves

135
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,080
Releasing all my hesitation

136
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,360
Dressing like a butterfly

137
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
Through the trees

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
Crossing all the lines of limitation

139
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,180
Now I'm finding all of mine among the leaves

140
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,920
Releasing all my hesitation

141
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,640
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

142
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

143
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,040
Blasting through the hymen

144
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,560
Not because Simon says so

145
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,580
Sucking juices from leaves, stems and roots

146
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,080
Far away from passports

147
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,320
Number one still told who?

148
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,620
Wiggle army, wig outs

149
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,100
Flutter, not parquet

150
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm talking about flutter

151
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,840
Flutter butter

152
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,080
Fly butterfly

153
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,200
And the dream catcher's calling you again

154
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,460
And the bees I've seized

155
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,600
And all of these

156
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,340
Fluttering like a butterfly

157
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,160
Through the trees

158
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,820
Butterfly

159
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,460
Dab, changes in alle the Forever

160
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,560
From all of me

161
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,520
Together we are

162
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,660
Ready for a new

163
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,240
Nemesis

164
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,440
The world is fine

165
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,440


166
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,320
Let's go

167
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,900
guitar solo

168
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,800
guitar solo

169
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,780
guitar solo

170
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,520
That was Fishbone,

171
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,380
the song Flutter Butter

172
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,200
from their 2011 album

173
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,560
Crazy Glue, which I think

174
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,600
the band itself sent me last

175
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,820
year, which is strange,

176
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,500
because they've been around exactly as long as the

177
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,380
Church of the Subgenius, and are pretty

178
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,340
well known, at least among musicians,

179
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,340
especially bull-dotted musicians.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,520
More of them next

181
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,360
week. This is

182
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,720
Hour of Slack number 1420.

183
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,880
13, and the collage parts,

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,460
such as the beginning,

185
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,280
are all by The Large,

186
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,360
who sent quite a large

187
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
stash of pretty incredible bob-ish

188
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,560
clips from here,

189
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,620
there, and everywhere.

190
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,620
Much more of that coming up, as

191
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,660
well as music by a band he

192
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,420
found for us,

193
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,400
Sultans of Blin,

194
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,740
and, of course, some fresh

195
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,180
new Rudy Schwartz project,

196
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,980
but the gapping, yakking, gabbing,

197
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,680
and gibbering part of this show all

198
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,540
comes from the Ask Dr. Hal

199
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,580
show of February 22,

200
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,720
2013,

201
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,500
on Radio Valencia in

202
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,420
San Francisco.

203
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,360
Welcome,

204
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,520
friends,

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,820
and

206
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:18,820


207
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,760
am not

208
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,560
sure about things tonight.

209
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,660
For some reason,

210
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm not even

211
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,480
hearing myself, but the compressor

212
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,660
never lies. So, welcome

213
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,600
again to the Ask

214
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,740
Dr. Hal show, live

215
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
on

216
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,340
radio.

217
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,340
Radio.

218
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,740
And now, ladies

219
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,560
and gentlemen, prepare yourself.

220
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,620
The Ask Dr. Hal show

221
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,120
is here

222
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,640
upon you.

223
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,560
Get it

224
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:57,900
off!

225
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,920
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

226
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,460
it is I, Dr. Howland

227
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,560
Owl, and I'm

228
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,360
here with my

229
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,740
dear friend,

230
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,980
Ivan Stang,

231
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,860
of the Church of the Subgenius.

232
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,760
Yes, our atmosphere

233
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,600
is not what he's used to.

234
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,740
Different atmosphere, different

235
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,140
pressure.

236
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,940
Oh, that's so much better. Oh, thank you.

237
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,620
And so Stang struggled,

238
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,640
as only the nobly

239
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,680
born must, with the

240
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,660
horrible clouds of toxins

241
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,100
surrounding him.

242
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,240
But with that music comes

243
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,780
air.

244
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,120
Yes, it's so airy.

245
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,980
Monster music provides the

246
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,480
air, the atmosphere of our

247
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,500
lives. Although no

248
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,280
other microphones are viable.

249
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,620
This is the same situation that we had the other night.

250
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,340
It requires a K-Rob

251
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,460
or a Pete Goldie to set things

252
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,100
to right.

253
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,980
Somebody knows what that

254
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,860
O-N symbol

255
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,040
means on that.

256
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,700
Well, you're welcome to

257
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,920
fly.

258
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,540
There must be a button.

259
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,920
On the other hand, I don't see why

260
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,740
we can't simply use

261
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,020
two microphones and each

262
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,780
share one.

263
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,400
Rather than go endlessly

264
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,040
dithering and nattering about the equipment.

265
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,000
Possibly altering it

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,140
and making things worse.

267
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,320
Does anybody have any chiclets?

268
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,320
If we're going to share microphones.

269
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,980
I mean, for Philo. Have any whatlets?

270
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,020
Chiclets, or breathless.

271
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,920
I can offer you a piece of root

272
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,580
beer float

273
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,020
flavored sugarless gum.

274
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,380
No, that's for Philo.

275
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,540
Give it to him.

276
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,020
He hasn't cleaned his false teeth in a while.

277
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,920
Do you need a piece of that gum that I

278
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,660
described to you?

279
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,180
This is a new gum that has just come out

280
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,120
from Dessert

281
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,620
Delights, from Extra.

282
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,780
Part of their Dessert Delights

283
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,540
series. I think you'll be...

284
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,000
What does it do with that thing?

285
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,380
That...

286
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,220
Once again, the thing...

287
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,360
Well, when K-Rob fixed it the other day,

288
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,060
he used this thing here.

289
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Well, here's where those mics are going in.

290
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,740
Do you dare to

291
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,320
push buttons on the thing?

292
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,200
Not me.

293
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,340
Not I,

294
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,600
said the lazy horse.

295
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,440
Not I, said the big fat pig.

296
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,060
Get back there and arrange yourself

297
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,140
in a comfortable way, because we're in

298
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,700
for the long haul

299
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,940
here on this show.

300
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,440
That was good.

301
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,140
Greetings in the precious name of our

302
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,080
beloved Lord Satan. This is Jack Chick

303
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,040
speaking. As believers in Satan,

304
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,800
we have great powers of darkness

305
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,220
given to us by Jesus.

306
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,760
Because we are his joint,

307
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,720
but if the Lord touches your relatives,

308
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,960
friends, or whoever, please feel free to

309
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,920
reproduce. This tape is going

310
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,980
to share with you how to confront

311
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,920
Jesus Christ. I call

312
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,060
this tape, The Bible, Part 1.

313
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,600
And it is a very

314
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,540
heavy tape, heavy information.

315
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,740
And I doubt if most

316
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,340
Christians can handle it.

317
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,240
The only ones who will are lost

318
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,320
souls of men who will travail

319
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,360
before the Lord and those on the street

320
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,240
and those whose hearts are really burdened.

321
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,680
This tape is also for pastors who mean business.

322
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,640
Pastors who believe the Bible to be

323
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,580
the word of Satan and who know

324
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,620
that business is alive and well on this planet

325
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:27,960
Earth.

326
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,660
I don't know if

327
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,500
listeners can hear it, but the phones are

328
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,660
lighting up. They're just going crazy

329
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,160
here.

330
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,820
You know, that could be one of those

331
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,440
excess technicians

332
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,820
advising

333
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,300
Is anybody there, said the listener?

334
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:47,880
to push.

335
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,680
Come on, speak up. You call.

336
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,540
I need to know if someone is speaking.

337
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,400
Everything is turned on, according to

338
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,220
Hoyle, but it could be that we can't receive

339
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,400
calls either. That may be.

340
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,920
Can I talk to you about Jesus?

341
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,380
No, we don't wish to talk about

342
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,560
Jesus, who was a sorcerer of the left-hand

343
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,340
path. On this...

344
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,920
What?

345
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,260
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

346
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,480
He fits the pattern. He fits the pattern

347
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,340
completely. But what...

348
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,560
An angel of light. Are you going to come down

349
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,400
here where we have Ivan

350
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,960
staying in Philodrome

351
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,540
and where we're supposed to have puzzling evidence

352
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,420
but don't?

353
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,560
Because he's gone.

354
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,900
He's a gone gosling.

355
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,540
Jesus has been helping me

356
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,400
with some drywall and painting all week.

357
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,280
You don't even want me to tell you about him?

358
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,640
Not right now, because this isn't

359
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,600
the Jesus show, but the Dr. Hal.

360
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,820
The Lord is not slack, as men

361
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,720
count slackness. Amen.

362
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,140
Abadiah 9.17.

363
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,160
And

364
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,500
Yehob

365
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,580
smote Sinab

366
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,760
upon the crown, and

367
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,280
lo, his knees

368
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,600
smote together, and his bowels

369
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,740
turned to water, and he

370
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,620
fell, staining the

371
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:01,980
ground.

372
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Very good,

373
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,560
Dr. Goldie. You will

374
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,600
make sense of this electronic spaghetti.

375
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,780
And liberate the station so a thousand

376
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,740
virile subgenius voices

377
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,000
can chant their...

378
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,040
Oh, there he's gone.

379
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,940
Was that that hearing expert, Pete Goldie?

380
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,400
Who's over...

381
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,060
Wow, all of a sudden everything's

382
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,680
shaky. Oh, don't worry about it.

383
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,760
Pete Goldie's going to come down. He's going to fix everything

384
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,820
up. He knows how to turn these

385
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,720
knobs and twist these dials

386
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,700
and so on. And maybe he won't do it at

387
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,840
60 miles an hour, so I'll be able

388
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,680
to see how he does it. Or maybe

389
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,540
he'll even have the patience, though this is

390
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,380
not likely, to let me

391
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,260
do it, because doing something

392
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,560
yourself is the way to learn

393
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,360
it, not watch somebody else

394
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,220
perform slate of hand

395
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
with a vastly complicated

396
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,120
array of instruments,

397
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,540
switches, flashing lights, and

398
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,320
what have you. What about this

399
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,140
shiny candy-like button?

400
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,260
The history erase button?

401
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,860
Oh, there's no candy here.

402
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,260
I assure you,

403
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,220
we don't have candy on this

404
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,240
program. Did I just hear

405
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,140
a car go by outside?

406
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,180
Yes, because we believe

407
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,100
we believe in the

408
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,400
ambient noise of our pulsating

409
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,960
mission neighborhood being part

410
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,580
of our sonic record.

411
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,240
So those screams weren't just a sound

412
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,840
effect record.

413
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,320
I think somebody out there

414
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,120
was sincerely calling for help.

415
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,340
I thought it was just

416
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,280
crazy sound effects

417
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,360
and movie soundtracks

418
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
that these radio shows...

419
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,060
Incredible what they can do with special effects

420
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,640
these days.

421
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,440
But the electro-hypnotic ray,

422
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,100
are you sure this experiment won't hurt him in any way?

423
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,300
Oh, absolutely sure.

424
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,680
Well, but

425
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,100
what's that thing up near his head that looks like

426
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,140
a miniature power plant with a loudspeaker

427
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,560
on top of it? That, Wilma,

428
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,080
is my latest scientific achievement.

429
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,060
My newly perfected

430
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,580
electro-hypno-mentalophone.

431
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,400
Your what? Well,

432
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,900
you remember the mentaloscope, don't you?

433
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,240
Sure. And this is an adaptation of it.

434
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,120
With this,

435
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,060
the electro-hypno-mentalophone,

436
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,240
the memories of the subject will come to us

437
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,980
verbally, through the loudspeaker here.

438
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,920
The music.

439
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,820
Back! I created you! Back! Back!

440
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,920
The wolfman.

441
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,960
The wolfman.

442
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,900
Larry Talbot.

443
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,080
Yes, he went searching

444
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,240
for Viseria

445
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,640
in the company of the old

446
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,820
wise woman of the gypsies,

447
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,520
Malaifa.

448
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,780
The path you follow

449
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,700
is thorny, my son.

450
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,940
Hey, how'd you like the new Wolfman movie

451
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,040
where Claude Rains

452
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,840
turns out to be a werewolf

453
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,320
and tries to kill his own son?

454
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,920
It's Anthony Hopkins in the

455
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,260
mod version.

456
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
You mean that wasn't

457
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,360
Lon Chaney in the junior?

458
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,600
Sir Lawrence Talbot's

459
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,760
unlikely offspring

460
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,200
is Guillermo del Toro.

461
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,840
But, I gotta say...

462
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,760
No, I'm sorry, Benicio del Toro.

463
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,340
I got those mixed up on a show

464
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,900
the other day.

465
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,440
Yeah, and that's no bull, too,

466
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,300
but it's important to keep them apart.

467
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,400
Anyway, even more unlikely

468
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,800
is it that Claude Rains would sire

469
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,460
Lon Chaney Jr.,

470
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,860
this bumbling stumbler who says,

471
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,540
I can't get my hands around

472
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,740
this werewolf thing. Give me something to do

473
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,460
with my hands. I can build a radio.

474
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,460
You know, even as a kid,

475
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,880
I intuited

476
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,500
that Lon Jr. was,

477
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,040
a bad actor.

478
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,660
Or, not a great actor,

479
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,400
shall we say.

480
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,400
What about his immortal interpretation

481
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,840
of Lenny in

482
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,500
Of Mice and Men?

483
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,880
Now, you know, I never saw that, but he got an Academy Award

484
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,160
or a nomination or something for that.

485
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,780
And he was eternally imitated

486
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,860
on Warner Brothers cartoons with

487
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,420
Which way did he go, George? Which way did he go?

488
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,440
His whole performance became

489
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,600
a meme

490
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,900
in the world of that time.

491
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,100
I want to squeeze a little bunny

492
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,560
and squeeze him and squeeze him

493
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
and love him so much.

494
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,380
Well, that was in that satirical cartoon

495
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,120
by Tex Avery called Lonesome Lenny.

496
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,600
Boy,

497
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,440
Dr. Howell

498
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,320
truly knows

499
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,220
all and sees all

500
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,340
and has seen all

501
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,660
kids programming.

502
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,820
As many cartoons as I could.

503
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,520
Sure. I still watch all the

504
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,580
cartoons that I can.

505
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,260
That's right.

506
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
Every now and then there's a good one.

507
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,200
That's right.

508
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,120
Even the modern ones are sometimes good.

509
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,760
I saw a cartoon just about an hour ago

510
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,260
in your house that you had drawn on a flip-it book.

511
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,080
Oh, yes. I have plenty of those things.

512
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,700
Those animation things.

513
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,260
You know, Dr. Howell, I have a sad story

514
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,580
I can tell very quickly.

515
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,100
But in third and fourth and fifth grade

516
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,080
I made over 100

517
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
little animated flip-it books

518
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,160
including a series

519
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,960
called 101 Tortures.

520
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,200
Although I ran out after about ten.

521
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,820
I'll bet those were great.

522
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,220
Well, the sad thing is

523
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,320
when my family moved from Fort Worth to Dallas

524
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,560
I thought, these Dallas kids don't know I'm a weirdo.

525
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,460
I'm going to destroy all my comics

526
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,200
and burn them and then I'll

527
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,840
become a normal person and I'll get a girlfriend.

528
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,480
Friends,

529
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,580
don't even bother.

530
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,220
It doesn't work. Keep your comics.

531
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,120
You can't. You can try to pass.

532
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,360
But they'll still know.

533
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,500
Instead, what you should do is

534
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,840
embrace your abnormality potential

535
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,680
and drive it to the hill.

536
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,080
In their faces.

537
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,140
Easy for me to say.

538
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,620
It may not be the best way to get a job

539
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,200
or a girlfriend, but

540
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,840
believe me, it beats burning up all your

541
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,040
handmade torture comics.

542
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,880
I wouldn't have a single one

543
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,740
except that good old school teacher

544
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,560
of mine, say, from fourth grade.

545
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,840
That the teacher confiscated from you?

546
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,240
No, she helped me.

547
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,180
She encouraged me.

548
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,020
I had a good teacher

549
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,720
in fourth grade.

550
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,000
Great Mrs. Neendorf.

551
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,420
She will be elevated our next day.

552
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,120
Very good.

553
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,180
Mrs. Darden, my fifth grade teacher,

554
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,960
shall be resurrected only so that she may

555
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,900
experience pain forever.

556
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,920
Yes, I know what you mean about that, too.

557
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,240
You had a Mrs. Darden or two, I suppose.

558
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,720
Yes, third grade was good,

559
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,060
but fourth and fifth got weird.

560
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,660
Well, kids, no matter how bad it is,

561
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,360
it could be worse.

562
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,580
And it'll probably get worse before it gets better.

563
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,340
But you don't know.

564
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,960
It just might get better.

565
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,940
My dad always told me

566
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,220
about a chemistry teacher

567
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,460
he had in his youth who went insane.

568
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,620
A huge man

569
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,880
with a black, square-cut

570
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Assyrian beard

571
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,260
who came roaring into class

572
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,180
and shook up a bottle of Coca-Cola

573
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,940
and sprayed it all over the front rows

574
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,640
yelling,

575
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,120
Analyze this!

576
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,700
And was hauled away.

577
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,760
By the stereotypical men in white coats.

578
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,680
He later founded the band GWAR,

579
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,460
which stands in front of audiences

580
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,920
spraying them with yellow-colored liquids,

581
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,240
red-colored liquids,

582
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,400
and foamy, white, gloopy liquids

583
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,280
out of their costume parts.

584
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,580
What of the limitless sex and violence

585
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,460
in the wake of red?

586
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:04,380
Is it on the way to murdering your horse?

587
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:04,580
It is to suck up

588
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:04,580


589
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:04,600
which are melted into juice

590
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:04,920
and are aproduct of the

591
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:04,960
aggression laid great by Chinooks.

592
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,460


593
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,460


594
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,600
such as the

595
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,120
196 ice- horizons

596
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,020
from the

597
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,340
rockby of the old

598
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,580
Thank you, GWAR, our old buddies.

599
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,300
In fact, the vocals on that cut were by Reverend Chuck Varga, also known as the Sex Executioner.

600
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,160
Believe it or not, I actually performed the wedding of the Sex Executioner on a tugboat in Manhattan,

601
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,720
about two blocks from Ground Zero of the World Trade Center.

602
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:39,040
And the clips from Jack Chick and the electro-hypnomenal phone came from Reverend Decapitator.

603
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:47,380
Anyway, back to the somewhat low-res recording, streamed from Radio Valencia of the Ask Dr. Hal show, which was real.

604
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,360
I must assert, again, this is not a tape of Ivan Stang.

605
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,840
You're actually hearing Ivan Stang because he's physically present here in our studio tonight.

606
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,660
Driver, driver.

607
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:08,800
And perhaps you think it's my journalistic duty to grill him intently about certain subgenius practices which have lately been in the news.

608
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:19,300
Uh, well, I don't need to tell your audience that they shouldn't believe everything they read or see on the news.

609
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,100
Even the internet sometimes can lead you astray.

610
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,960
And those supposedly scandalous X-Day films are actually...

611
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,980
...computations done at great expense and computation power by people who weren't actually present.

612
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,660
Well, and there were some that we just, you know, filmed as a joke, you know.

613
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,440
A joke?

614
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,960
Yeah, just a put-on. That's all. That's it. Yeah, it's a put-on.

615
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,820
It's a satire on mental illness.

616
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,200
Oh, yeah, like Mad Magazine. Right, yeah, like Mad Magazine. Right, right.

617
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,240
Yeah, yeah, like Mad Magazine, officer. You've read Mad Magazine, right?

618
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,520
Well, I guess so.

619
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,020
Oh, everybody seems to like it, so I guess you can get on your way.

620
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,560
No, please, really, keep your applause. It was nothing. Nothing at all.

621
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,540
Oh, it re... oh.

622
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,340
And now you see...

623
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,360
It wasn't nothing.

624
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,300
You can... a little more applause would hurt.

625
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,560
It does sound good on the album.

626
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,300
The album.

627
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,480
These fan-io-bums are not available in any store.

628
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,360
Not stored in any store.

629
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,480
They're sold in stores.

630
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,900
Did you eat at Papa Lotte, as I recommended?

631
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,960
No. Dr. Vredes took us to another place. I can't remember the name of it.

632
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,100
A good one, I trust.

633
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,260
Oh, it was great. It was wonderful.

634
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,720
It was...

635
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:51,140
They were handing out free soup to people who stood in line, and they preached the word of Jesus, and they had some nice free soup.

636
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,420
You had to listen to the Jesus stuff to get the soup, and is that the story?

637
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,100
Yeah, yeah. It was... yeah, but it was... the price was right.

638
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,420
Well, there is that.

639
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,420
All we had to do was listen to the...

640
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,460
The preacher was pretty good.

641
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,340
You can listen to all kinds of speech, if I...

642
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,940
So, yeah, Jesus is just all right with me.

643
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,840
He... we did have to part ways after that child custody case.

644
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,240
The Lord...

645
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,500
How are they doing over there in their foreign land?

646
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,280
Of Columbus, Georgia?

647
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,520
Oh, I thought they were in England still.

648
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,540
No, no, no. I've seen the child convo.

649
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,500
And?

650
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,460
The kid who was disputed. He was a surly teenager at Chris Lee's wedding.

651
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:32,960
Surly, eh?

652
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,320
For the first... he was with a buddy, and they made a big deal of how uninterested in all the silly wedding stuff they were,

653
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:45,020
until they got bored with being surly, and then they became the most helpful, pleasant teenagers.

654
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:54,740
Yeah, helping to clean up, probably snitching alcohol here and there, but they ended up being good boys, real good boys.

655
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,220
I see.

656
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,120
And there was another infant...

657
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,480
Ah, they're up to their boyishness.

658
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:58,500
...who was a little boyish.

659
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,660
There's a little infant, uh, Jesus Jr.

660
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,080
Jesus Jr.

661
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,640
Named, uh, Valentine...

662
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,360
Valentinos.

663
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
...Smith, uh, Devalaqua.

664
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,680
Oh, really?

665
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,020
Yeah.

666
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,140
Valentine Smith as in the, uh...

667
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,020
Stranger?

668
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:20,180
No, I threw that in as if they named it after me, in my other, uh, when I'm from Ohio. I'm Mr. Smith.

669
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,420
Mr. Smith goes to Washington.

670
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,200
I can't... people, you know, they... they approach you...

671
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
You go for donuts.

672
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:35,540
...and they'll... they'll... like, in my case, they'll say, uh, say, Mr. Stang, as if to let on they know that I'm not really a reverend.

673
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,840
Well, Bob, darn it!

674
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:46,880
I... I didn't go to Dobstown Divinity School for nothing. I am indeed a minister, and I am reverend... the... uh, Reverend Stang.

675
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,580
And if you have to say Mr., you can call me Agent Smith.

676
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,980
You didn't bring any of that pecan divinity along, I take it?

677
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,920
Uh, actually, I got a little bit in the... in the refrigerator. I almost said icebox.

678
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,300
Oh, buh-buh-buh-boy.

679
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
It gives away your age.

680
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,340
Oh, buh-buh-buh-boy.

681
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,980
When you call it an icebox, that's like, uh...

682
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,880
I know, it's a giveaway.

683
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,680
...saying LP or records.

684
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,100
It's a giveaway, uh, about... that one comes from an earlier cycle.

685
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:12,900
Uh...

686
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,220
You have to watch your language and not use archaisms or...

687
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,140
What record is that?

688
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,300
What record? Why...

689
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:19,820
What record?

690
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,600
I was playing the immortal music of Hans J. Salter, but otherwise...

691
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,940
I was, I was, uh... no, you're supposed to say, what's a record?

692
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,900
Oh, I see. What's a record?

693
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,640
You call CDs records.

694
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,860
CDs, those are grandpa things, aren't they? I mean, nobody uses those. So, you download it all.

695
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,400
As Lila said on Futurama, Fry's so funny, he still says ask instead of ax.

696
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,400
It's a sweet mellow cracking sound.

697
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,380
Individual circles smack flat on the surface, fry up to a golden brown.

698
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,160
Fryin' up to a golden brown.

699
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,540
Untold spatulas flick madly the pancakes that the crawdaddies crave.

700
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,860
The pancake's just like homemade.

701
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,200
Uncle Louie dances a light jig,

702
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,280
reservedly as if holding back the conclusion

703
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,000
for the lady batfish he most wishes to impress.

704
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,000
Each of them restrained, but not in such a way as to cause sexual tension.

705
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,700
A tray of crawfish is wheeled across the ballast,

706
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,640
but dear lord, somebody forgot the corn.

707
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,440
Oh, don't worry about it, they cackle,

708
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,320
with a chorus of overwrought cocksuredness.

709
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,580
They'll soon be gone,

710
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,680
there'll soon be a new crop,

711
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,460
and the harvest has been good.

712
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,360
Yes, there'll have to be a better crop,

713
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,320
because the harvest has most certainly been good.

714
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,580
Hush puppies snapped into clarity,

715
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,920
fried to a peppery golden brown.

716
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,860
Let's hope the Ku Klux Klan has cleared the litter from their mile of road.

717
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,100
East of town, a puckernut bush has yielded its crimson bounty,

718
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,480
but now its leaves betray a trace of sadness.

719
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,040
Is it the dryness of the season,

720
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,500
or are we just passing through another of those peculiar phases?

721
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,280
You know, when the billows piss a saline mist,

722
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,840
and the batfish begins to ponder,

723
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,500
we may be leaving this here bayou.

724
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,000
Yep, it might be time to be leaving this here bayou.

725
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,700
Oh, my God.

726
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,340
Welcome to tricks and tricks.

727
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,100
Appeared a little.

728
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,760
Well, yeah.

729
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,420
It's always a creep to understand

730
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,420


731
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,760
And it'd be a可怜

732
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:36,760


733
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:36,760


734
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:36,760


735
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,620
while純 900 even an old boring increased Bring about the

736
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,300
This is and Well,

737
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:49,400
you've put onshot on GSA in flat black hair.

738
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,560
LLC showsassa Call back align.

739
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,560
Dr. Drummond and Palmer Vredes are over by the window.

740
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,620
They need no broadcasting to entertain themselves.

741
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,720
They are happy with the social fabric seen so tellingly through the window,

742
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,260
the living tapestry which is the pulsating heart of San Francisco's mission district.

743
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,220
That's not the window. That's Philo's big smartphone.

744
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,180
Oh, well, your phone is so smart, huh?

745
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,980
Well, it's huge. It's one of those bay window sized phones.

746
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,360
It's a circus inside this tiny phone.

747
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,820
It's a drive-in theater sized smartphone.

748
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,160
Well, I want to watch Lawrence of Arabia on that.

749
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,880
I haven't seen a bunch of movies that I'd like to that have come out recently.

750
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,940
I kind of miss them. I miss them. I have to try to catch up later.

751
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,160
But, of course, since I'll ever watch our old monster movies,

752
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,900
I'll watch them when they're old and I'm older.

753
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,300
I suppose that's the only consolation I can give myself, eh, Stang?

754
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,520
Uh, no. Actually, if you wanted to read up on how to steal movies off the internet,

755
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,740
you could watch first run shows on your DVD player at home.

756
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,820
With Hulu, uh, Vudu, and, uh, well, uh...

757
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,140
Actually, I'm, I don't want to say exactly where the media ditches.

758
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,040
No, you should. You should, certainly.

759
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,040
But they leave, they leave movies laying around on the side of the information.

760
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,560
They're just littering the information highway.

761
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,940
Just, I mean, they're going to waste if you don't pick them up.

762
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,280
They're just litter. I suppose so.

763
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,040
I'm helping keep litter off the, uh, information highway

764
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,380
if I happen to get one of those Oscar review copies of, say, Argo or whatnot.

765
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,620
Well, I suppose, uh, you'd have not to mind that occasional lettering comes up saying,

766
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,440
This is the property of so-and-so motion pictures.

767
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,160
Do you get the, uh, instructions that come with your review copies for the Academy?

768
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,040
Yes, I do.

769
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,460
They tell you how to cut the seat, the DVD in half and, and strap it to the space shuttle reentry.

770
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,280
No, I haven't seen that one.

771
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,400
So it'll be burned up properly.

772
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,880
I haven't seen that one. And I'm not seeing Pete Goldie.

773
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,780
This is a matter of some concern because I did say only he could, uh, make it possible for a fire to...

774
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,340
That's not true. I think that puzzling evidence or K-Rob or God...

775
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,580
But none of those that you mention are present here.

776
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,020
We are bereft of God.

777
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,600
God is ev- but God is everywhere. Why, why don't we have God fix that thing?

778
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,280
God... I'm the holy man. I'm gonna do a prayer now.

779
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,420
God, would you come down here and fix that preamp?

780
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,720
Show us where that on button is, but don't blow up the station.

781
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,660
Thanks, God. Amen.

782
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,960
That should work.

783
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,840
Mighty talk from one who's running a well-publicized war on God.

784
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,340
But not only is Pete Goldie here, but he brought wine of the dreamers.

785
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,820
Wine is a mocker. Strong drink is raging.

786
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,280
Yes.

787
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:51,980
Lies.

788
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,560
That's- oh, that stuff's on sale around- on the corner.

789
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,300
Is that lies?

790
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,520
Yep.

791
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,540
Lies is here.

792
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,040
Philo is here.

793
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,640
I'm telling you.

794
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,100
I was told this wasn't Vredi.

795
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:13,540
Vredi's lies upon the couch, patiently waiting for some- something to happen.

796
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,460
Well, he might get hooked up with, uh, someone.

797
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,520
Yeah, we'll hook you up with somebody.

798
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,560
Boys?

799
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,500
Remember the old Good Sex for Mutants dating league in the early church of the Septuagint?

800
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,340
Well, you remember that well, I know.

801
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,340
No, I don't really.

802
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:30,900
Reverend Stang was-

803
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:40,780
Buck Naked invented it, and then it backfired on him, so he sold it for a dollar to Reverend Cat Lady in Salt Lake City.

804
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,360
That's what I remember. The Cat Lady's, uh, revenge, as it were.

805
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,680
She used it to get herself some good dates.

806
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,660
And, uh, so in that respect, it paid off for somebody.

807
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,260
Well, you see, a mutant got good sex, just as, uh, advertised.

808
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,480
I don't know about the good part, but it was something like-

809
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,060
It was sex, and it was judged to be good.

810
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,060
The mutant's part was definite.

811
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,760
We call them mutant.

812
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,320
The trigger for this journey is a childish word game, but there's something else to it.

813
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,760
The trigger for this journey is a childish word game, but there's something else to it.

814
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,120
One of my best friends, Bob, is Iranian.

815
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,660
And he's a really great writer.

816
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:17,860
And he's a really great writer.

817
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:17,860


818
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:17,860


819
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:17,860


820
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,840
But unfortunately, I've heard a lot of negative stuff about his country lately.

821
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,280
So, I'm gonna run it and find out the other side.

822
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,040
So, I'm gonna run it and find out the other side.

823
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,200
Bob, be careful. Don't hit yourself in the head.

824
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,140
Oh no! Bob! Bob! Are you okay?

825
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh no.

826
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,060
Now watch the fight, Bob.

827
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,940
I'm not into boxing.

828
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,680
Same boxing kid.

829
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,860
It's politics.

830
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,320
Having a hard time with male potency?

831
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,760
Well I don't and I'm Bob.

832
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,880
What's wrong with you? Christ, I'm Bob and I can get it up.

833
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,140
Whoa! Forgive me, Father.

834
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,760
Hey, Bob. Hold up there, Wonder Muffin.

835
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,380
Ratings are up another five.

836
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,140
Ugh!

837
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,220
You guys should give me another raise.

838
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,580
Actually, we've got an entirely new contract for you, Bob.

839
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,040
Five years exclusive with having his own age.

840
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,680
A-level storyline. Twenty minutes guaranteed screen time per episode.

841
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,140
Script approval.

842
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,080
That's a tall order, Bob.

843
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,720
He's in deep focus out there, Bob.

844
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,640
This obviously means a lot to him.

845
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,560
He shoots! It's going? Going?

846
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:37,260
Looks like Coop has made a dream come true for a very brave little...

847
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,340
Wow. The Lord must really have it in for that little boy.

848
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,700
Step out of the vehicle, please, sir.

849
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm very sorry, Mr. Policeman, sir.

850
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,520
Right, I'd like your full name, please.

851
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,340
It's Bob.

852
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,200
You any idea how fast you were driving, sir?

853
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,120
Mega churches with his skills? Garbage.

854
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,580
It's like a bar, baby.

855
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,040
After the assassination...

856
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,360
Who's there?

857
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,620
I don't know.

858
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,020
I don't know.

859
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,020


860
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,000
I don't know.

861
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,000
I got your message. His only visitor is his wife.

862
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,140
As a matter of fact, she's in with him...

863
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,960
His wife? He's been divorced for 20 years.

864
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,020
Call security, have him block the exits.

865
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,660
Connie?

866
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,480
Yeah. Alias brainwashed no more.

867
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,520
Ha.

868
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,360
And guess what? My ex-wife is now the proud owner of her own travel agency.

869
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,080
Life does go on, you know.

870
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,720
You know, losing you to another woman I could have dealt with,

871
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,700
losing him to the Foundation, that was too much.

872
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,760
Wait a minute here. Wait.

873
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,580
How come you never told me about Joseph Smith?

874
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,100
Who?

875
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,820
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.

876
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,900
Well, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.

877
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,360
That's not what the Harrisons said.

878
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,620
Who are the Harrisons?

879
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,440
The new people that moved in down the street.

880
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,800
Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus,

881
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,300
and they told him none of the religions were right.

882
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,700
Oh, did he now? What are they, religious kooks?

883
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,860
They're not kooks. They're cool.

884
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,720
How'd it go?

885
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,720
We're, uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.

886
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,380
See? That's what happened to me.

887
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,380
Did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a New Testament to the Bible buried here in America?

888
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,800
What are you talking about?

889
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,300
Well, it's just that the Harrisons are really nice people,

890
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,300
and you should see how loving and together their family is.

891
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,360
I think there's something to that religion.

892
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,420
That's what the Harrisons are.

893
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,280
They made me think, too.

894
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,160
Bob's your uncle.

895
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:40,980
Here you go, Bob.

896
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,840
For some reason, Bob thinks that I am going to become a big old blimp again.

897
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,200
I know where Bob is hiding.

898
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,100
When Bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal.

899
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,220
And what makes your voice high?

900
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,340
Tight-bending underwear.

901
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,120
Helium!

902
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,720
Bob is in a blimp!

903
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,580
For the might of Bob.

904
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,860
Blasted helium.

905
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,320
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.

906
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,760
Ha, ha! That's better.

907
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,620
Dr. Howe don't know how to work the whole word.

908
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,020
Don't be bored, my dear friend.

909
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,280
You're a...

910
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,200
Dr. Royce will be heard presently.

911
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,280
What's that?

912
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,260
I'll translate for you, Phyla, since you're not heard yet.

913
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,700
Phyla said, what's that?

914
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,500
And then he said,

915
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,180
Translating to the heart first characters of birth and death.

916
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,620
Oh, there you go.

917
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,140
Now we...

918
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,680
I think I'm starting to hear you.

919
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,620
What do you do it again?

920
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,400
No, I'm just hearing you over my mic.

921
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,620
Why, this one...

922
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,260
My mic is not my mic.

923
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,720
My mic is not my mic.

924
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,640
Don't whine, little...

925
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,120
We will take you to the circus and on.

926
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,640
My mic!

927
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:50,200
Yes, your mic is an endless reverberation.

928
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,860
I'm falling like a dead man through the ten years of my life.

929
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,140
Through the ten years of my life!

930
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,560
Boy, those cheap special effects.

931
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,700
It's like when the zoom lens was invented in the 60s and suddenly...

932
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,260
And suddenly the 70s movies became unbearable.

933
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,620
With zooms everywhere.

934
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,000
And worst of all...

935
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,300
Only true folk would get away with it.

936
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:12,780
Quick zoom.

937
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,900
Zooming in time to music on zoom.

938
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,160
Rock and roll movies.

939
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,300
That was the worst.

940
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,000
What's that?

941
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,480
Knob Creek?

942
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,480
What is it?

943
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,060
It's Knob.

944
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,080
Urban whiskey.

945
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,760
But, you know, of course, Dr. Drummond is joking,

946
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,360
since we are not supposed to have any liquor or alcohol here present.

947
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,620
And we're not supposed to do all sorts of things.

948
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,940
All about those cool sound effects.

949
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,220
Yes, there am I.

950
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:38,480
Record.

951
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,040
There it is.

952
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,600
Broken radio stations of the 60s.

953
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,920
Ah, puzzling evidence uses sound effects records.

954
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,160
He's not too...

955
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,520
Hey, what happened to my mic?

956
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,360
Oh, there it is.

957
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,080
It's right there.

958
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,300
It's a chocolate M&M, but don't make large bumping, crashing, thumping sounds.

959
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,940
I played that thumping mic stand sound effect again, Dr. Howell.

960
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,540
I love that.

961
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,220
I won't do it.

962
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,640
That's cut number...

963
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,720
I won't do it.

964
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,340
23.

965
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,500
Microphone stand being thumped.

966
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,140
You know, hollow sound board.

967
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:05,760
Here it comes.

968
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,100
Thump.

969
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,680
Please.

970
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,780
Please don't.

971
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,400
That's my favorite one.

972
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,160
That's a good one.

973
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,180
You hear that in movies all the time.

974
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,580
Yeah, you could make a...

975
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,500
Put a music track and...

976
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,700
Don't blame me.

977
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:21,340
Put a music track and have a hit single based on the repetition of that particular sound.

978
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,280
Help.

979
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:23,660
Help.

980
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,320
I'm in trouble.

981
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,320
Help.

982
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,000
I've been clutched by a giant clam.

983
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:30,860
Um...

984
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,600
It is a shame we don't have a white pen that writes with luminous glowing.

985
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,000
Ink.

986
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,840
But, uh...

987
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,980
See if my pink and watery eyes can...

988
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,560
I have one.

989
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,320
Who is that that said, who was that?

990
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,160
Who dat?

991
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:45,900
Who say who dat?

992
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,380
That's the...

993
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,320
Yeah, okay.

994
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,460
That's the mic with the echo.

995
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,120
That is the...

996
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,840
One echo mic.

997
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,920
Asked by the icht of the nicht ich.

998
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:54,740
Ich.

999
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,800
Yes, uh...

1000
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,140
That's a new subgenius god.

1001
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,740
Right.

1002
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,660
Ich, mich, ich, mich.

1003
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,760
The me or the I and the not I.

1004
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:03,740
I.

1005
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,080
Yes, sir.

1006
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,860
Some people have a knot head and some people have a wart nose.

1007
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,740
Where did Dr. Goldie go?

1008
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,020
He came and he bailed us out and...

1009
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,720
Who was that masked man anyway?

1010
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,400
Is he coming back?

1011
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,220
Some people's nose runs and their feet smell.

1012
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,900
They're bailed upside down.

1013
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,220
Ye, ye, ye.

1014
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:24,980
Uh...

1015
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,740
Well, that's...

1016
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,720
I just don't know why.

1017
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,200
Jokes from a crackerback jock.

1018
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,280
Part of these shows always plummet to the very depths.

1019
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,900
Before rising to the...

1020
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:37,360
Ice.

1021
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,580
From ancient childish childhood playground rituals and rhymes.

1022
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,420
To elevated scholarly rituals and rhymes.

1023
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,300
Notions, lingerie.

1024
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,520
All out.

1025
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,080
Oh, wow.

1026
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,920
Who has another bobbin like a new bobbin?

1027
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,060
I hope you're not taking bobbins.

1028
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,500
I'm taking your bobbin, your machine.

1029
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,620
I think we've all reached the state of loopiness.

1030
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,960
I'm freaking out because I pretty much have to tear.

1031
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,120
I'm gonna tear apart my entire bag.

1032
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:08,860
How's yours coming?

1033
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,480
It's in like 15 pieces.

1034
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,000
My brother knows Karl Marx.

1035
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,480
He met him eating mushrooms in the people's park.

1036
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,320
He said, what do you think about my manifesto?

1037
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,660
I like your manifesto.

1038
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,880
Put it to the testo.

1039
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,120
Took a trip down to meet the anarchist party.

1040
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,380
I met a goofy guy.

1041
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,520
He was hardy fart.

1042
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,020
He said, I know a little Latin and a cousin of Kai.

1043
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,460
Said, I don't know what it means.

1044
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,560
He said, neither do I.

1045
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,860
Eat natural food.

1046
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,060
I'm a man of the past.

1047
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,060


1048
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,060


1049
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,060


1050
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,060


1051
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,060


1052
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,060


1053
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,080
I'm a man of the past.

1054
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,080


1055
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,080


1056
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,080


1057
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,080


1058
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,080


1059
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,080


1060
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,560
Face whites deli.

1061
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,720
Fill your nostrils.

1062
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,780
Up with gravy!

1063
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,400
Don't drink tea and don't drink coffee.

1064
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,840
miraculous toffee.

1065
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,860
Dancing in the disco regarded, wait a minute,

1066
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,100
world's me jumper.

1067
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,520
World's me jumper.

1068
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,060
World's me jumper.

1069
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:54,600
World's me jumper.

1070
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,400
World's me jumper.

1071
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,320
I Έ��

1072
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:07,040
Could I prowl through this field,

1073
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:07,040


1074
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,240
Disco, oh no, oh no

1075
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,000
It's alright to say things can only get better

1076
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,620
You have lost your brand new sweater

1077
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,280
I know I had it on when I had my tea

1078
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,740
And I'm sure I had it on in the lavatory, oh no

1079
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,780
Dancing in the disco

1080
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,340
Go, go, go

1081
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,320
Dancing in the disco

1082
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,220
Oh no, oh no

1083
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,000
Dancing in the disco, bumper to bumper

1084
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,680
Wait a minute, where's the jumper?

1085
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,000
Where's the jumper?

1086
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,440
Where's the jumper?

1087
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,900
Where's the jumper?

1088
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,280
Where's the jumper?

1089
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,060
It's alright to say things can only get better

1090
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,780
You have lost your brand new sweater

1091
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,620
Pure new wool and perfect stitches

1092
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,940
Not the type of jumper that makes you itch, oh no

1093
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,000
Dancing in the disco

1094
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,520
Go, go, go

1095
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,560
Dancing in the disco

1096
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,440
Oh no, oh no

1097
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,040
And my mother would be so sad

1098
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,780
And my sister would be so angry

1099
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,660
And my brother would be so, so angry

1100
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,160
And my girlfriend would be so, so angry

1101
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,660
And my dog would be so, so angry

1102
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,500
Cos I was dancing in the disco, bumper to bumper

1103
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,040
Wait a minute, where's the jumper?

1104
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,520
Where's the jumper?

1105
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,940
Where's the jumper?

1106
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,260
Where's the jumper?

1107
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:22,520
The Sultans of Ping did that amazing song which reminds me of the Swingin' Love Corpses in its spasitude,

1108
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,220
and which was embedded in the collages sent by The Large,

1109
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:33,480
who sends those from Finland instantly, perhaps explaining why his English spelling is better than that of most Americans.

1110
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:40,100
The music and spoken word piece about Louisiana Pancake Batfish was by, who else?

1111
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,360
The Rudy Schwartz Project from the album Full Frontal Klugman.

1112
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:50,100
The music behind me now is Ghetto Princess by the Psychoskeletons on SoundClick.com.

1113
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,820
You're listening to The Hour of Slack from Church of the Subgenius.

1114
00:49:53,860 --> 00:50:02,500
Information about this show, all past shows, all our books, videos, our live events, all can be found at subgenius.com.

1115
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,580
Including the May 31st Castro Theatre Agents of Chaos show.

1116
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:14,540
And now, to end it, until next time, more from the Ask Dr. Hal show.

1117
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,380
Praise Bob.

1118
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:22,340
The thick black cloud was cleft, and still the moon was at its side.

1119
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:31,240
And I could read each written word, and by the moonlight, not absurd, I swallowed my pride.

1120
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,820
Oh, I see.

1121
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,540
All the microphones are, uh, well, they're just covered by...

1122
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,060
They're hatching from their little eggs.

1123
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:40,740
The mics are working.

1124
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,020
They're leathery eggs.

1125
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,280
The little microphones are coming out one by one.

1126
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,000
So, the whole stand, I mean, it's a mic and a stand.

1127
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,780
So this is the only show that cares about using more than one microphone at a time.

1128
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,320
Well, we have more than one performer, and it is a necessity.

1129
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,980
But other shows on this station don't care about that.

1130
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,860
That's because they're DJs who spin platters.

1131
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,820
In the archaic, uh, term.

1132
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,960
They call them records.

1133
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,960
They call CD records.

1134
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,000
Yes, they play some bully phonograph records on their gramophones.

1135
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:23,220
But, uh, but we also, uh, participate in celebrating various forms of technological achievement.

1136
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:29,540
How miraculous it is that a machine may speak in the breathy voice of a human being.

1137
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,620
Well, the one that Palmer's standing in front of isn't speaking.

1138
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,920
I don't think that, I don't think that mic there is on.

1139
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,500
Colonel Roosevelt, please restrain yourself.

1140
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:42,040
Audience, I'm referring to the mic on your, uh, what would be your left.

1141
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:48,580
Now, this, uh, endless reverberation, is it possible to ameliorate that particular special effect?

1142
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,040
Do you mind wandering in a labyrinth of echoes?

1143
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,300
It's, that's a pretty subtle echo.

1144
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,300
That was a good one.

1145
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,020
Ah, it was a good one, all right.

1146
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,040
It was a good echo.

1147
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,340
So, uh, blow, beautiful.

1148
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,920
Set the wild echoes flying.

1149
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,380
I'm a hearing expert.

1150
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,280
It adds.

1151
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,020
It adds to the ambiance.

1152
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:04,420
Hmm.

1153
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:12,460
Well, uh, most people, uh, do wear earrings today, so you're not in any kind of a minority, if that's the case.

1154
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:19,720
What we're going to do is explore some of the lesser known facts of subgenius history.

1155
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,860
As we go slogging down that well-worn pathway.

1156
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,160
Well, oh, all right.

1157
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,100
Well, then we won't.

1158
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:31,260
Instead, uh, let's throw it open and you, Ivan Stankin.

1159
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,340
Oh, my God.

1160
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,240
We said that.

1161
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,700
Ah, that's a terrible, um, do you want some root beer float flavored gum to wash away this?

1162
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,420
Oh, no, that makes me, oh!

1163
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,360
Well, that would be a waste of some damn good gum.

1164
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,100
Don't mention that stuff again.

1165
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,760
All right, I, I won't speak of gum then.

1166
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,200
That's quite all right.

1167
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,620
Yeah, don't talk, just don't talk about gum.

1168
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,540
Don't talk about Bob.

1169
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,420
Don't talk about anything that's going to make me vomit again.

1170
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,620
How about the, uh.

1171
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:01,980
Unseemly.

1172
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,220
Unseemly.

1173
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:03,220


1174
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,780
Going chat stream, uh, Dr. Pete Goldie, worker of miracles.

1175
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,540
I'm not going to look at that.

1176
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,360
Can we look at that and see what they're saying out there?

1177
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,580
I don't know what that guy said.

1178
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,540
The, the little people, uh, Billy Barkey.

1179
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:14,940
I don't want that.

1180
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,680
Or Vern Troyer or Mickey Looney.

1181
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,280
We want to see what they're saying right now about us.

1182
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:19,860
I don't want to outlaw that one guy.

1183
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,500
I saw him last week and they were mean.

1184
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,800
We're going to whoop that one guy.

1185
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,020
I can't believe people would be rude on the internet.

1186
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,380
Don't, don't whoop on no one.

1187
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,640
Now, what about Palmer's microphone over there?

1188
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,120
How does it go?

1189
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,280
Is it sounding?

1190
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:32,880
Microphone.

1191
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,500
Oh my God, he's not, uh.

1192
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,540
That's not funny, Palmer.

1193
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,600
That doesn't help things.

1194
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,740
His mind and his mouth are disengaged.

1195
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:48,740
Yes, we do have some, uh, some people paying attention to us on the chat stream.

1196
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,640
I see.

1197
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,760
I suppose they don't want, they want to stop us from talking.

1198
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,520
Oh no, they are approving, uh, everything.

1199
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,660
Yes, it's true.

1200
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,240
There's no subgeniuses.

1201
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,840
They're so old, older than me.

1202
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,880
Horrible old things.

1203
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,120
I wish we.

1204
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,200
I wish we.

1205
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,840
I wish we could ask them a question about the old times.

1206
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:13,080
But, uh, Ivan Stang said it was too well worn, a path that would, uh, acidly eat through the soles of our shoes.

1207
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,760
We're just saying, we're just saying what the callers are saying.

1208
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,900
We don't, we're, we're actually, we do not want to.

1209
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,360
Let us not presume to, uh, speak for our beloved audience.

1210
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,700
Nay, let them speak to us.

1211
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,220
Let a thousand flowers of evil bloom.

1212
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,180
Something's wrong with Palmer's microphone.

1213
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,160
But, uh, once again, we shall fix it.

1214
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,220
Because we've got top scientific assistants, experts working on the problem.

1215
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:52,600
And at any moment, the light of rationality and enlightenment will flood this labyrinth of darkness.

1216
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,320
And we will even be able to hear the voice of lies.

1217
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,460
Significance.

1218
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,380
Promises, promises, promises.

1219
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,780
Just like X-Day and all that.

1220
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,420
That's slack.

1221
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:08,080
And you complain of that, uh, Reverend Stang?

1222
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:17,960
No, I'm complaining on behalf of all the people who, the little people who didn't get, uh, the sex goddesses and the, that's the bank accounts.

1223
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,560
That's the hose.

1224
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,100
Uh, we've got a hose problem.

1225
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,240
Uh, we're going to...

1226
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,120
We've got a microphone problem.

1227
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,460
That's, uh, Mike O'Phone.

1228
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,980
That microphone is not a lot of money.

1229
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,620
But, it's, you see, it's just a matter of, uh...

1230
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:32,640
We choke the phone.

1231
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,800
And threaten it.

1232
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,020
One must, uh, check the connections.

1233
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,260
Threaten it with bodily harm.

1234
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,680
No, the visible show.

1235
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,480
Now, what about this microphone?

1236
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:38,980
Don't worry.

1237
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,680
Here's this hardwired one.

1238
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,680
That one?

1239
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,800
Yeah, you could go around there.

1240
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,200
It would freak its mind out.

1241
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,940
But I don't know, maybe we're going to require, uh, you know...

1242
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,520
What if you choked that microphone within an inch of its life?

1243
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,660
I don't believe in abusing the equipment.

1244
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,120
But, but, but this is a live mic.

1245
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,220
What if we abuse a ghost?

1246
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,460
As a scapegoat.

1247
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,220
A scapegoat for the microphone.

1248
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,800
A scapegoat?

1249
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,360
Yeah.

1250
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,100
Oh, I don't know.

1251
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,580
Because, you know, there's no laws against abusing ghosts.

1252
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,840
No laws written by men.

1253
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:13,800
Not yet, not yet.

1254
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,740
There you are.

1255
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,220
That seems to be...

1256
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,940
No law of any human terry in the court.

1257
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,720
A little more there.

1258
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,860
Yeah, we could abuse the ghosts all we want.

1259
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:25,840
There we go.

1260
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,480
If we can capture a ghost, we could even make ghosts sue.

1261
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,420
There, there, ghost.

1262
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,340
We could eat a ghost.

1263
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,020
Eat a ghost.

1264
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,380
So that's...

1265
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,900
Not, uh...

1266
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,320
I've got no idea of these ghosts.

1267
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,880
I don't care if they're male, female, or anything in between.

1268
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,120
Why a ghost?

1269
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,120
Well...

1270
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,380
I'm not mad at these ghosts.

1271
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,320
That's a...

1272
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,560
But what about the happy ghosts?

1273
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,840
I don't believe happy ghosts exist.

1274
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,380
Nobody's ever shown me a happy ghost.

1275
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:51,920
Really?

1276
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,500
There's plenty of proof for, uh, sad, mournful ghosts.

1277
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:55,800
Plenty.

1278
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,280
Plenty.

1279
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:56,680
They're everywhere.

1280
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,380
They're everywhere.

1281
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,600
They're haunting houses.

1282
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,540
Well, that hasn't stopped you from eating any ghost cheese.

1283
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,120
I would eat ghost cheese right now.

1284
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,320
The ghost cheese is some of the lightest, most fluffy cheese I've ever had.

1285
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,700
I prefer it when it's not...

1286
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,600
It's the least...

1287
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,900
When you don't know that it's ghost cheese.

1288
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,980
I like blue ghost cheese.

1289
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,980
The dreaded blue ghost of Martinez.

1290
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,860
You've seen...

1291
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,200
Martinez.

1292
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:31,640
That's like the wailing woman who goes in for 24-hour martinizing?

1293
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,720
There's one in every town.

1294
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,300
Every town has, uh, the...

1295
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,480
Sanfordizing and son.

1296
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,140
The hitchhiking bride or prom girl.

1297
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:42,760
That's right.

1298
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,100
It's a hitchhiking prom girl that drowned in the lake and...

1299
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,180
Martinez has the blue cheese over man.

1300
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:48,840
Yeah.

1301
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,440
The blue cheese over man.

1302
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,780
Don't forget the girl with the...

1303
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,760
The most horrible smell.

1304
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,440
The yellow ribbon around her neck.

1305
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,300
Yes, who was hitchhiking.

1306
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,580
And when you untie the ribbon, her head fell off.

1307
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,560
Ah, yeah.

1308
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,620
Who's got my...

1309
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,640
My golden ribbon.

1310
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,800
The overman was doomed to pick her up.

1311
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,140
She's outside.

1312
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,460
Somebody has to go down and let her in.

1313
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,340
Who's got my golden pie?

1314
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,780
The fact is, you can't be...

1315
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,360
I'm at the base of the stairs.

1316
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,120
Bullied about by spirits.

1317
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,280
Now I'm on the first step.

1318
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,780
You have to stand up to them.

1319
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,680
Now I'm on the second step.

1320
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,760
Now I'm on the third step.

1321
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,860
The second step that leads to a lifetime of interdependency.

1322
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,900
But Dr. Truman, it's a 100-step stairwell.

1323
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,260
That's a 100-step self-help course.

1324
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:39,660
Now I'm on the third step.

1325
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm charged with murder as a hate crime,

1326
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,760
scheduled to take effect on the 1st.

1327
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,400
President Obama is standing in the way of compromise.

1328
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,960
President Obama says...

1329
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,960
Uh, uh, uh, stuff's difficult to name, but not as grossly.

1330
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,820
Uh, uh, uh.

1331
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,500
The president gets mad at PR News.

1332
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,640
Because I get the big work.

1333
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,700
But PR reports 2013 will bring some 2014.

1334
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,020
Most of the 2013s are in 2014.

1335
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:10,700
For example, starting January 1st, 2013 actually starts next October 1st.

1336
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,420
Things like 2014 start next January 1st.

1337
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:18,520
That's when most Americans will be required to have PR News Washington.

1338
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:24,560
Activists say at least 40,000 New England residents could die in Syria next year.

1339
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:30,060
The international envoy to Syria told reporters this is PR News from Washington,

1340
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,600
which hasn't had a...

1341
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,760
...functional government since 1991 and is run by various warlords.

1342
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,800
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says PR's very, very bad and getting worse.

1343
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,300
Graham told Fox News Sunday there can be agreement on a small PR News in Washington.
