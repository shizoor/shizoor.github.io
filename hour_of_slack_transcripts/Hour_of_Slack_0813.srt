1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,900
Oh, my friends, my good, good friends.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,320
This is going to be a pretty unusual Hour of Slack

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,960
because it's going to be an all-lymph node Hour of Slack.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,880
Lymph Node Institute is, for those not in Atlanta,

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,100
are the alternate subgenius show at WREK Atlanta

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,660
that alternates with Reverend Susie the Floozy's show,

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,280
which I also often use to bail my butt out when I'm very late on shows.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,000
And that's the situation here, friends,

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,500
as the swinging love corpses bangs away in the background

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,800
on the infamous Bay Dat jams.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:54,440
We had some bad crashes, physical crashes of loved ones and loved computers,

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,900
things that slowed.

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,440
That slowed us down a bit.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,240
Unexpected, but, you know, that's life, isn't it?

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,800
But yet, we've been making new things in between.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,140
I've been very, very busy and learning new ways to make new things.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,720
I love to learn new ways to make new things.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,180
It's not very good for one's career

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,680
because you end up shooting your career down every couple of years.

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,860
As soon as you get good at something,

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,920
you move on to the next.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,120
Hmm.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,760
Newly invented medium.

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,580
Great!

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,860
But, yes, so many new, new things lurk on the horizon

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,940
for the dedicated subgenius.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,960
Video.

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,180
I can do video editing now at home for nothing at last.

29
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,220
New CDs.

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,120
We have a new mail order company.

31
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,720
You still get stuff from Subgenius Foundation and so forth,

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,140
but we changed fulfillment companies,

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,520
so you might check out the website.

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,640
The website, www.subgenius.com,

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,200
which explains everything there is to know about all of this stuff.

36
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,320
But, oh, man, friends, I'm so far behind.

37
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,080
There are devivals from going back a year and a half

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,300
that I have not had time to edit and use on this show yet.

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,740
Some great subgenius preaching.

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,060
And there are new books.

41
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,180
New books.

42
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,740
More book.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,600
In the making.

44
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,820
Remember those?

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,980
Those old Piper things?

46
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, we're kind of doing that again.

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,060
It's a new day, people, so put your hands together.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,420
Yeah!

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,620
Swing and love, gorgeous friends.

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,460
It's a new day.

51
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,660
It's a new world.

52
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,200
And this is a new way for me to get out of spending.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,180
I just don't have time to spend on a show,

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,760
so you lucky...

55
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,980
You'll be a bridge to the new century.

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,600
You lucky centurions you get to listen to.

57
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,640
A bridge to the future that everyone can watch.

58
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,940
And walk on no matter what the state of their shoes.

59
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,320
That's the Swing and Love Corpses, friends.

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,840
But this isn't going to be a Swing and Love Corpses show.

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,640
It will be a Lymphnode Institute show from WREK in Atlanta.

62
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,500
The Lymphnode lads, well, they do a subgenius-ish show.

63
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,000
Completely different from the way I do it.

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,080
And let us just let them do it.

65
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,100
By the way, I should mention, as always,

66
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,060
that, uh...

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,580
The program you are about to hear,

68
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,820
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,

69
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,380
is parody, satire, and comedy.

70
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,720
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius,

71
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,100
religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects

72
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,240
is intended only as humor,

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,960
and should cast no reflection on the high standards of...

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,240
Insert station call letters here.

75
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,800
...its staff, or that of...

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
...the church.

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,740
This episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

78
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,780
is brought to you by the Personal Tension Reduction Limited Series

79
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,340
plugs of ex-presidents.

80
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,580
From the cherrywood gorgeous George

81
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,600
to the tricky dick,

82
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,220
to the...

83
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,260
...the not-so-wimpy George Bushwhacker,

84
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,500
and our latest addition, the Slick Willie.

85
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,600
You can collect all 42.

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,260
Just relax, don't be so tense,

87
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,720
get help from the ex-presidents.

88
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,160
Hello, Don.

89
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,140
We now join the national anthem already in progress.

90
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,700
But we watch

91
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,180
whistle gallantly streaming

92
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,880
And the rockets'

93
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,740
red flag

94
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,720
Uh-oh.

95
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,120
The bombs bursting in air

96
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,560
Gave proof through the night

97
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,540
That our flag was still there

98
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,860
I'll make up for it now.

99
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:27,200
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

100
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:40,120
Oh, the land of the free

101
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:53,900
And the home of the brave

102
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,180
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

103
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,780
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

104
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:02,940
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

105
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:03,960
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:03,960


107
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,700
You're listening to Bob Slaktime Funhouse,

108
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,360
the Lift Note Institute edition.

109
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,620
Very well.

110
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,140
Happy 4th of freakin' July, people!

111
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,760
Whee!

112
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,500
Happy birthday, America!

113
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,720
If you're here for your sub-G fix

114
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,880
and want to hear an X-Day show,

115
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,660
well, you should have listened to Suzy,

116
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,460
Reverend Sister Suzy the Floozy.

117
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,180
If you listened to our X-Day show,

118
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,400
oh, three years ago?

119
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,100
98, yes.

120
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,160
Yeah, we got stiffed.

121
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,640
They didn't come.

122
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,180
The X-D勝 there's supposed to come on July,

123
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,140
July 5th, and...

124
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,560
Didn't happen.

125
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:28,880
No.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,300
Were you surprised?

127
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,800
We stayed up all night.

128
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,280
We did.

129
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,200
Were you surprised?

130
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,220
I was not surprised.

131
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,460
No, I wasn't either.

132
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,060
So we're not doing it this time.

133
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,060
We're going to talk about the prevalent holiday that's occurring for most everyone else.

134
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,820
America!

135
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,740
Independence Day!

136
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,920
Wake up and smell your 225th birthday.

137
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,100
Independs.

138
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,680
That means you're wearing depends undergarments, and if you poop yourself, that's okay.

139
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,140
And I was going to say that our country is kind of crapping its own pants, but we're

140
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,700
going to try to be pro-America, right?

141
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,780
I'm more about number one than number two.

142
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,720
I think it's my country tis of pee, as opposed to poo.

143
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,560
We do live in the time of pee.

144
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,740
Urine testing.

145
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,740
Mayan testing?

146
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,900
Urine testing.

147
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,040
Mayan testing?

148
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,440
Exactly.

149
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,680
Mayan testings?

150
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,560
Your urine.

151
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,940
Who wiped out the Mayans, or was that the Aztecs?

152
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,960
Who wiped out the Aztecs?

153
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,580
I believe the Spanish did them both.

154
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,200
Bastards.

155
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,620
Columbus was a Spaniard, wasn't he?

156
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,460
He was an Italian.

157
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,200
He was funded by the Spaniards.

158
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,820
Queen Isabella.

159
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,400
That's right.

160
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,120
Whore.

161
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,520
That's one man's opinion.

162
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,600
She was not the virgin queen of Spain.

163
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,600
That doesn't work that way.

164
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,480
Likewise, I'm not sure if she actually sold sexual favors for money.

165
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,180
Well, as the story goes, she ran after Columbus after his third attempt at getting the money

166
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,300
and said, sell my jewelry to finance your mission.

167
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,420
All hail the American knight.

168
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,860
If Columbus were all the things were gone, I have worked for all my life.

169
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,500
And I have worked for all my life.

170
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,980
I have put start again with just my children and my wife.

171
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
I have worked for all my life.

172
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,620
On the 4th of July, there are fireworks to celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

173
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,560
I think my lucky stars could be lighting here today.

174
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,440
Our forefathers declared the independence of the colonies from England.

175
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,360
Watch to our face, little Mary God.

176
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,780
Cross the flag, it's close.

177
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,540
Stand for freedom.

178
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,360
And they can't take that away.

179
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,320
Then there was a war.

180
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,140
One if I land, two if I see.

181
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,220
I stand for the world of the free.

182
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,920
And I'm proud to be an American,

183
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,920
for at least I know I'm free.

184
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,340
And I won't forget the men who died,

185
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,960
who gave that right to me.

186
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,940
The Redcoats are coming.

187
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,760
Yes!

188
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,500
A shot for a glass of wine.

189
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm going to work for it.

190
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,560
Taxation without representation.

191
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,240
Most tax breaks make no use.

192
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,760
I'm those religious Washington's crossing of the Delaware River.

193
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,460
I've left the blue and white to bear on.

194
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,820
And I'm glad we stand up next to blue and defend post-Telcando.

195
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,760
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.

196
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,940
God bless the blue ass-o.

197
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,600
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee.

198
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,740
Onward!

199
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,560
Onward!

200
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,860
Onward!

201
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,360
Onward!

202
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,700
Across the plains of Texaco.

203
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:47,800
Onward!

204
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,960
From sea to shining sea.

205
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,600
From Detroit down to Houston.

206
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,120
And New York to El Dorado.

207
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,400
First pride in every American heart.

208
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,340
I still have faith in America.

209
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,880
And it's time to stand and say that I'm proud to be an American,

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,900
for at least I know I'm free.

211
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,680
And I won't forget the men who died,

212
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,740
for God that right for me.

213
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:29,540
And I'll gladly stand up next to blue and defend post-Telcando.

214
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,980
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.

215
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,680
God bless the blue ass-o.

216
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,660
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee.

217
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:46,660


218
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:46,660


219
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:46,660


220
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:46,660


221
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:46,660


222
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:46,660


223
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,120
Onward!

224
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,500
Onward!

225
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,420
Onward!

226
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,760
Onward!

227
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,100
And it's time to stand and say that I'm proud to be an American,

228
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,860
for at least I know I'm free.

229
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:13,180
And it's time to stand and say that I'm proud to be an American,

230
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,640
for at least I'm proud to be an American.

231
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:16,640


232
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,820
I can go cause there ain't no doubt I love this man the god bless the blue ass man.

233
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,660
WAKE UP!

234
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,380
So they've got workmen here at the radio station and they keep using their leaf blowers and that's a lie.

235
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,660
They're a rumble cage.

236
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,880
Rumblefish.

237
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,020
Yes, the institute is always in flux. We're always changing things.

238
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,180
We're not on the radio station.

239
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,080
We're always moving things.

240
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,760
We're at the institute. We're reporting live from the institute itself.

241
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,200
My vision, not so good lately.

242
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,500
Not gonna understand. You're getting old as well.

243
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,580
I am. We're all getting very old.

244
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,040
How old did you say the country is?

245
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,220
225 years old.

246
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,840
This year?

247
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,300
Yes.

248
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,980
That's a pretty good anniversary. What is that?

249
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,800
It's nice and round.

250
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,840
Is it the China anniversary?

251
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,880
225? I don't know.

252
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,720
Barium.

253
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,300
Yeah, the barium anniversary or the drive a steak through its heart anniversary.

254
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,920
Cause anyone that's lived 225 years old has been doing something unseemly.

255
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,760
So anybody out in middle America, in the heart of America?

256
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,180
Yes.

257
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,260
Watch out, there's a giant wooden stake coming your way.

258
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,120
Them are good eating.

259
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,580
Yes.

260
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,260
Lots of steaks on the 4th of July.

261
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
Steaks and burgers and ribs.

262
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,580
Cookouts.

263
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,660
Cookouts.

264
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,620
I didn't say it was high quality. I just said it was radio magic.

265
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,500
.

266
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,140
The

267
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,160
Point

268
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,180
the

269
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:02,780
I don't wanna see a seven-year-old boy

270
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,360
Covered nights can hypnotize

271
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,960
Sparkle someone else's eyes

272
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:37,480
I don't wanna see a seven-year-old boy

273
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,940
Thank you.

274
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,040
Thank you.

275
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,340
Thank you.

276
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,900
Thank you.

277
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you.

278
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,140
Thank you.

279
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,900
Thank you.

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,360
Thank you.

281
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,840
Thank you.

282
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,960
Thank you.

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,580
I beg your pardon.

284
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,560
Vulgar song.

285
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,920
I beg your pardon.

286
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,140
Pull out a song.

287
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,880
The well-known vulgar song.

288
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,980
The bombs, bombs, bombs bursting in air.

289
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,180
I beg your pardon.

290
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,140
And the rockets, and the rockets, and the rockets, red glare.

291
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,800
Vulgar song.

292
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,200
The intense patriotism surging across our country

293
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,300
carried the national anthem to new and different heights.

294
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,720
Targeting.

295
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,300
All the way to the top of a music chart.

296
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,680
Vulgar, vulgar song.

297
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
Pull out a song.

298
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,160
I am an American.

299
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,380
You're an extremist.

300
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
Listen to my words.

301
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,720
Bombs, rockets, bombs, rockets.

302
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,700
Specimen collector.

303
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,380
Before you even start, I am an American.

304
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,380
I will escort you to the toilet to observe the passing of urine.

305
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,980
Two, three.

306
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,980
All he tried to do is obfuscate, to confuse.

307
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,400
I am an American.

308
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,460
The bombs, the bombs bursting, bursting, bursting in air.

309
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,300
The suspense, all the song.

310
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,020
And the rhythm.

311
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,640
The way it sounds more like a scream door.

312
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,860
A tail caught in a scream door.

313
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,940
I beg your pardon.

314
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,960
Are you dissatisfied with the song?

315
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,020
Sounds more like a scream with a scream caught in a scream door.

316
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,900
Well, no, it wasn't meant to be sung while sober, yeah?

317
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,860
Scream door.

318
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,620
Caught in a tail scream door.

319
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,460
I beg your pardon.

320
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:40,840
Yeah?

321
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,620
No, it actually began as a drinking song.

322
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,080
Oh, yeah?

323
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,240
Doesn't just hearing it make you wish you weren't sober?

324
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:47,760
Oh, yeah?

325
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,060
Oh, you mean, uh...

326
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,560
Yes.

327
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,940
It's author Francis...

328
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,080
He might have been charmed by topping the top 40,

329
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,160
but was this really what he had in mind?

330
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:57,980
Drink up.

331
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,700
Bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs, the bombs, the bombs, red glare.

332
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,560
Better yet, the sweet, delicious coldness of the first bite of peppermint ice cream on the 4th of July.

333
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,960
Better yet, drink up.

334
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,120
Was this really his song?

335
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,680
Drink up.

336
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,200
Well, you wish you weren't sober?

337
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,740
Who is?

338
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,860
Anacreon, a Greek poet who celebrated...

339
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,440
Scream door.

340
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,020
Drinking.

341
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,460
Well, I do.

342
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,000
Drink up.

343
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,560
To be free.

344
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,240
Yes.

345
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,420
The tune of our national anthem was lifted from an old English drinking song.

346
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,700
Go.

347
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,560
Doesn't just hearing it make you wish you weren't sober?

348
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,180
Who is?

349
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,180
The people who wrote it certainly weren't.

350
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,460
Drink up.

351
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Francis Scott Key wasn't either when he stole the tune.

352
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,940
I'll bet I'd have liked him.

353
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,760
Oh, you would have liked Anacreon even more.

354
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,500
Anacreon.

355
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,320
Anacreon.

356
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:40,860
I do.

357
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,720
Even more.

358
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,280
Anac...

359
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,220
Well, all the good things in life.

360
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,180
Oh, you mean, uh...

361
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,720
Yes.

362
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,400
Let's sing it again.

363
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,560
Long a song, Spangler.

364
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,260
Long a song.

365
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,340
Oh, say can you...

366
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:51,700
No, no, no.

367
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,540
Those are the new words, remember?

368
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,820
Oh, so who knows the old ones?

369
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,060
A song sung in pubs throughout England.

370
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,580
To Anacreon in hell.

371
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
I am an American.

372
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,760
Very sad in full glee.

373
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,560
I am an American.

374
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,720
A few words such as the one.

375
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,640
Now we stand by the rails and receive a hair-raising impression of how this projectile sounds as it passes by.

376
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,640
To be free.

377
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,700
The rocket's bursting in air.

378
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
To be free.

379
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,800
When this answer arrives.

380
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,180
To be free.

381
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,680
And the bombs red glare.

382
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,620
The old creation.

383
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,260
Drink up.

384
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,760
The separation of the first stage at Burnham.

385
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,800
Freedom to think.

386
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,620
Freedom to speak.

387
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,700
The intermittent sounds of the guidance rockets.

388
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,900
Freedom to speak.

389
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,060
The separation of the second stage.

390
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,780
To pray.

391
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,460
To read.

392
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,100
To act.

393
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,880
To pray.

394
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,060
To criticize.

395
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,000
Freedom to eat and sleep.

396
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,060
To work and play.

397
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,200
Without pain.

398
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,580
Freedom to live one or two hundred million different lives.

399
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,740
I am an American.

400
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,340
Drink up.

401
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,680
Let it be a holiday in your house of eternity.

402
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,540
Let it be a holiday in your house of eternity.

403
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,680
Every American has at least one thing to be thankful for.

404
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,460
A cheap shot.

405
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,320
Just not true.

406
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,000
But be still sold a flag and not a shirt.

407
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,960
It isn't on there in the back.

408
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,180
No, no, no.

409
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,760
I thought it was beautiful.

410
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,920
But then there you go.

411
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,400
I know.

412
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,980
I know.

413
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,320
That's it.

414
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,420
I know.

415
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:11,460


416
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,080
I know.

417
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,120
I know.

418
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,380
I know.

419
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:14,380


420
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,360
I know.

421
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,380
I know.

422
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,280


423
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,280


424
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:16,660
I know.

425
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,420
I know.

426
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:21,820
I know.

427
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,320


428
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
I show it with my face on your face.

429
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:23,900


430
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,720
I don't want to see your face no more.

431
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,480
Life never ends like this.

432
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,480


433
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,840
I don't want to eat your little ones.

434
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,140
When you look at me.

435
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,980
Walk through my night.

436
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,100
I want you to do what you are allowed to do.

437
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:50,780
Speak your störlichestes.

438
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:50,780


439
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,020
And we're back.

440
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,440
It's like we never left.

441
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,860
Yeah, those damn Brits.

442
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,740
What do they got?

443
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,460
They got fish and chips.

444
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,040
That's all right.

445
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,600
They have terrible food.

446
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,540
They have terrible dental care.

447
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,200
Did we rag on the Queen, Mom?

448
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,300
She wasn't really Queen when we did the independence thing.

449
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,100
No, it was King George II, much like we have a King George II right now.

450
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,920
Ooh, so can we declare independence?

451
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,960
He's not really a king.

452
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,600
He's our sovereign.

453
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,180
Suck, though.

454
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,220
Whereas Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar, and if you're a Rhodes Scholar, you have to sign a document.

455
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:49,960
Take it as seriously as you want, but it basically says that you'll do whatever you can to get America back into the arms of England.

456
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,640
Oh, my goodness.

457
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,020
I know.

458
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,860
I wish I was making that up.

459
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,980
How did we end up on topic?

460
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,540
Go on.

461
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,780
The Bush lineage does meet up with the Rothschilds somewhere.

462
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,480
Therefore, they're cousins to many of the crowned heads of Europe.

463
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,200
Oh, my goodness.

464
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:19,020
Oh, my goodness.

465
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:46,820
Oh, my goodness.

466
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,920
Oh, my goodness.

467
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,140
Oh, my goodness.

468
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,560
Oh, my goodness.

469
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,500
Oh, my goodness.

470
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,680
Oh, my goodness.

471
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,040
Oh, my goodness.

472
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,120
Oh, you're a devil, you're a man, you're a man

473
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,080
That's how it ever felt to me

474
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,820
Well, I've been like my heart when you stayed

475
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,780
Well, I've been like my heart when you stayed

476
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,700
Oh, yeah

477
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,040
Oh, yeah

478
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,920
Did you know that there was a whole land of people living here before Whitey got here?

479
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,640
It's strange, isn't it, to say that we discovered America

480
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,400
because there were a hell of a lot of people who knew where it was.

481
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,540
The Norse went up to Newfoundland.

482
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,660
Did you ever see the movie, was it The Viking?

483
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,100
The Viking with Kirk Douglas?

484
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,900
It was Lee Majors.

485
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,180
Lee Majors, right.

486
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,440
Fighting the American Indians as Vikings.

487
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,260
Vikings versus Indians is what it should have been called.

488
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,220
I do remember that.

489
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,000
It was good fun.

490
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,900
Lee Majors.

491
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,600
He's a Teutonic kind of guy.

492
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,580
Teutonic plague.

493
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,920
Two tons of fun.

494
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,240
One Teutonic and gin and juice.

495
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,040
Laid back.

496
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,980
Go, go, go America!

497
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,420
Yes, the positive things about America.

498
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,400
What have we done?

499
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,620
We ragged on the English.

500
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,520
Oh, no, what have we as America done?

501
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,800
We went to the moon, maybe.

502
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,040
No, I think we probably did that.

503
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,880
It ain't that far away.

504
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,880
I've been to the moon without the assistance.

505
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,280
Taylor.

506
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,440
The segue to the moon.

507
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,620
I've got a hell of a trampoline.

508
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,800
Yeah.

509
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,860
The放心

510
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:11,860
THE TRAMPOLINE

511
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,420
The Trampoline

512
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,420


513
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,420


514
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,420


515
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,020
Music

516
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,020


517
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,940
Ah, ah, ah.

518
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,540
No one needs anyone, they don't even just pretend.

519
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,360
Ah, ah, ah.

520
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,840
John is an American.

521
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,900
I'm afraid of Americans.

522
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,740
I'm afraid of the world.

523
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,160
I'm afraid I can't help it.

524
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,700
I'm afraid I can't.

525
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,880
I'm afraid of Americans.

526
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,740
I'm afraid of the world.

527
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,220
I'm afraid I can't help it.

528
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,680
I'm afraid I can't.

529
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,040
I'm afraid of Americans.

530
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,880
John is an American.

531
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,780
I'm afraid I can't help it.

532
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,480
John wants to breathe.

533
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,700
John wants to suck on a kook.

534
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,560
John wants a woman.

535
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,640
John wants to think of a junk.

536
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,960
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

537
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,920
John is an American.

538
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,880
Ah, ah, ah.

539
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,520
I'm afraid of Americans.

540
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,680
I'm afraid of the world.

541
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,220
I'm afraid I can't help it.

542
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,700
I'm afraid I can't.

543
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,860
I'm afraid of Americans.

544
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,800
I'm afraid of the world.

545
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,220
Ah, ah, ah.

546
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,260
John is an American.

547
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,680
He can do anything where there's somebody better.

548
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:58,680


549
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:58,680


550
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:58,980
John's only good at politics.

551
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,620
John's only good at vitamines.

552
00:28:59,860 --> 00:28:59,860


553
00:28:59,860 --> 00:28:59,860


554
00:28:59,860 --> 00:28:59,860


555
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,700
He can be a king of Indians.

556
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,080
Ah, ah, ah.

557
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,640
John won't sell things in America.

558
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:08,640


559
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:08,640


560
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:08,640


561
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:08,640


562
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:08,640


563
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:08,640


564
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:08,680
Because of corporate reasons.

565
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,100
Unpredictability

566
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,840
is the greatest

567
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,900
asset or weapon

568
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
that a leader can have.

569
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,100
Coke

570
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,260
is

571
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,260


572
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,980
largest

573
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,840
and

574
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:08,840


575
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,280
wine

576
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:14,980


577
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
The

578
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
Four

579
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,560
Man

580
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Hurrican

581
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:35,860
Patrol

582
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,720
are

583
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:36,800
operating

584
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:36,840
completely

585
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,200
had fallen victim to a water buffalo.

586
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,660
The patrol was sweeping the rice paddies

587
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,620
when the buffalo charged.

588
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,340
The spokesman reported four U.S. were wounded

589
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,840
and one weapon was lost in the enemy's horse.

590
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,780
Two hours later, the spokesman continued,

591
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,200
U.S. helicopters spotted a water buffalo

592
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,220
armed with an M-16 rifle.

593
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,780
Door gunner opened fire on the enemy,

594
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,660
resulting in one water buffalo killed.

595
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,500
Yeah, I'm a fan of America.

596
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,400
I'm a fan of the world.

597
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,880
I'm a fan, I can't help it.

598
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm a fan, I can't.

599
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,520
I'm a fan of America.

600
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,600
I'm a fan of America.

601
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,720
Jones and the Polka.

602
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,840
Jones and the Polka.

603
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,740
Jones and the Polka.

604
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,780
Jones and the Polka.

605
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,120
We have the joy of being the only country

606
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,120
to ever wage nuclear war on another country.

607
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,720
We have the fattest population, most overweight people.

608
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,220
Absolutely.

609
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,120
Okay.

610
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,400
We are damn huge.

611
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,300
Dude, we got some square mileage going on.

612
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,760
We are damn huge, and don't you forget it.

613
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,100
We control our whole damn continent.

614
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,460
What European country can say that?

615
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,260
We don't, though.

616
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:16,940
The Canadians.

617
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,180
Excuse me?

618
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,220
The Canadians.

619
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,480
What about them?

620
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,260
They're on our continent.

621
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,680
Yeah.

622
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,900
They control their part.

623
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,220
Don't they control their part?

624
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,820
I'm not so sure about that.

625
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,240
We allow Canada to exist.

626
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,160
As long as I'm not bleeding ignorant.

627
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,640
I don't think the United States could stand for too much craziness.

628
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:34,980
I don't think the United States could stand for too much craziness.

629
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,520
out of Canada.

630
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,220
They behave more or less like a United States without guns.

631
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,020
We send your peacekeepers where we send our peacekeepers.

632
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,840
Free medical care, too.

633
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,680
Yeah, well, universal medical care,

634
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,300
and possibly the decriminalization of cannabis.

635
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,640
Our forefathers grew pot.

636
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,260
You're going to be hearing something about that

637
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,160
from the fellas at the Fireside Theater.

638
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:52,600
Yay!

639
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,740
Our founding fathers, heroes, or hobbits.

640
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,580
So gets them on board, though,

641
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:22,580


642
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:22,580


643
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,460
so moves on.

644
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:31,500
Now to the big thapes.

645
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,240
�

646
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,840
What do you think?

647
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Created in 1957 as the result of a unique collaboration between NBC and conservative think tank General Consensus Incorporated,

648
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,660
Caliper Coggins is truly a marvel of telegenetics.

649
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:22,480
The product of the most sophisticated television equipment of the day and of DNA once thought to be that of Marshall McLuhan,

650
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,280
but later believed to be that of a prospector in 1820s California,

651
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,040
Caliper Coggins has been retained as a consultant to some of the most powerful, powerful corporations in the world.

652
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:38,180
A former head of the FBI and two-time Emmy Award nominee, Caliper Coggins pans for gold and has a core temperature of 16 degrees Celsius.

653
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,500
And Caliper Coggins makes its own gravy and stops on a dime.

654
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,300
Caliper Coggins loves to stay outdoors.

655
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,260
Caliper Coggins cleans your toilet.

656
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,480
Caliper Coggins loves the way you touch him.

657
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,280
Caliper Coggins is a real champ.

658
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,580
You are vulnerable and afraid.

659
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,920
And Caliper Coggins knows it.

660
00:35:54,260 --> 00:36:00,120
Caliper Coggins is remarkably versatile and trans-thematic.

661
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,440
Caliper Coggins is a great man for the job.

662
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,440


663
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,060
You know, I like them old boys.

664
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,820
But they do ramble on.

665
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,880
Seems they doff protest too much.

666
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,320
I'm starting to sound just like them.

667
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:21,200
But seems to me, what the world needs now is a refresher course in American history.

668
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,480
People got no grounding in the basics.

669
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,560
Especially this new generation.

670
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,320
Lazy cowpokes.

671
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,860
Why, I got more tolerance for the WB net.

672
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,060
And I'm starting to think this is a real piece of work.

673
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,320
Seems everyone's operating under the assumption that this Rome was a real piece of work.

674
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,840
Well, I'm here to tell you it wasn't.

675
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Well, it was real pretty, but hell.

676
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,760
We all knew it was gonna crash sooner or later.

677
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,120
Now, I'll be the first to say we ain't got everything all hunky-dory over here.

678
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,840
Thursdays, for instance, just ain't been the same for me since that Michael J. Keaton left Spin City.

679
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,800
Now, he's one class act.

680
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,780
But back to my point.

681
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,020
Seems to me that this thing is a real piece of work.

682
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,280
And I'm not saying that it's not.

683
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm just saying that the whole nation has some real self-esteem issues.

684
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,860
That acting proud like a big bully in the neighborhood, sitting on your chest, dangling a snot over your face.

685
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,580
We've been behaving like a little girl with an eating disorder.

686
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,240
And I tell you, it's a crying shame.

687
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,680
Confidence.

688
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,040
That's what we need dry and secure.

689
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,900
Why, that lack of confidence goes back to the beginnings of this country.

690
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:30,520
Why, did you know that old fella Thomas Jefferson said that democracy has a lifespan of only 200 years?

691
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,020
Why, did you know that old fella Thomas Jefferson said that democracy has a lifespan of only 200 years?

692
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,960
Why, did you know that old fella Thomas Jefferson said that democracy has a lifespan of only 200 years?

693
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,920
Now, ain't that some kind of self-defeatist attitude?

694
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,540
But looky here.

695
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,780
He give us that timeline of 200 years.

696
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,840
And well, some real red-blooded Americans, they take that time.

697
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,520
And with a whole lot of hard work and some well-choreographed events,

698
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,180
we cut that time darn near in half.

699
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,420
Hoo-hoo-wee!

700
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:54,280
I tell you, I'm saying America, hoo-wee!

701
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,260
America means business.

702
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,060
Multinational business.

703
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:02,140
So you ask yourself, what has Rome done for me lately?

704
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,720
And you come up kinda empty.

705
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,880
Now you ask yourself, what has Merica done for me lately?

706
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,000
Well, how about over 750 premium deluxe channels of entertainment?

707
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:22,800
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, including all major holidays, both religious and otherwise.

708
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,080
And that's the point, ain't it?

709
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,160
The Coliseum, them lines and fighting, it was a good start,

710
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,180
but those fellas in charge over there didn't see no need to refine their methods of diversion.

711
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,840
Maybe if they had, they'd still be running things.

712
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,160
Maybe they underestimated the power of a syndicated situation comedy.

713
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,480
Well, I appreciate you letting me go on. I get so worked up.

714
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,240
You know, some scurred some-inch-jumped-McClain whilst I was a contestant on that

715
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,280
Who Wants to Be a Million Dollars?

716
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,220
If I not catch that scallywag, I'm gonna see to it that his head saddles up real cozy like with his colon.

717
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,320
That there's the Caliper Coggins way.

718
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,600
My way or the high- whoop!

719
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,000
High way to heaven's on.

720
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,920
Now don't you go jumping, McClain, or I'll eat your face off.

721
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,840
If the New World, quote unquote, hadn't been a, uh, potentially profitable,

722
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,480
Yes, we wouldn't really be here now.

723
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,060
The Indians, who would have been the best,

724
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,480
Who had never been called that, would still be here, I assume.

725
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,140
Sure.

726
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,400
Still hunting buffalo and smoking tobacco.

727
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,000
Not contracting syphilis from whiting.

728
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,840
No smallpox, no syphilis.

729
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,620
Up with America.

730
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,720
Up yours, America.

731
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,180
There, I said it!

732
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,960
Well, finally, our true feelings come out.

733
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,800
Damn, fat, rich.

734
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,260
We produce the most waste per capita of any country in the world.

735
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,700
The right to be greedy, sir.

736
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,960
We consume the most natural resources of any country in the world.

737
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,340
Canada gets our acid rain.

738
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,880
Our president's an ex-drunk.

739
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,540
At best, he's an ex-drunk.

740
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,780
I've slept with his daughters.

741
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,700
Wow.

742
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,740
Pat, pat!

743
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,580
I can't wait.

744
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,380
Chelsea was such a nice girl.

745
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,900
The kind you'd want to stay up late reading with.

746
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,980
But the Bush girls are just nasty.

747
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,440
They're just filthy little wenches.

748
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,640
It's downright un-American.

749
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:46,480
I was America this morning.

750
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,700
Driving.

751
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,580
I'm driving.

752
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,060
I'm driving.

753
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,900
Just to drive.

754
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,000
No destination in mind.

755
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,020
Just spinning my wheels like I said.

756
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:16,180
I was America this morning.

757
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,720
I was America this morning.

758
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,720
I was America this morning.

759
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:29,700


760
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,320
Yeah!

761
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,780
Yeah!

762
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,260
Yeah!

763
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:34,840
Yeah!

764
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:35,620
Yeah!

765
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,080
Yeah!

766
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:37,340


767
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:37,780


768
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,260
Yeah!

769
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,780
Another turn, truckless

770
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,920
Sloan up the highway like a movie

771
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,140
A driving movie

772
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,300
Or a circus side show

773
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,300
We all waited for our turn

774
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,740
The cops for Mexican

775
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,760
Bunnies laid out like battle casualties

776
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,360
A fireman on one knee

777
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,840
Put hands still

778
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,980
Put white bloody Mexican bags

779
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,800
I will fight

780
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,020
I will fight

781
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,280
I will fight

782
00:42:38,300 --> 00:43:08,280
I will fight

783
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,400
I will fight

784
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,460
I will fight

785
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,980
I will fight

786
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:19,120
I rolled by eating my egg mcgluffin

787
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,640
And I didn't care

788
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:29,240
For those few moments I let Rome burn

789
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,160
I was American

790
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,300
I was American

791
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,140
This morning

792
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,540
I was American

793
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,160
This morning

794
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,520
I was American

795
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,140
This morning

796
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,520
I was American

797
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,280
This morning

798
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,780
I was American

799
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,020
This morning

800
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,440
I was American

801
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,120
This morning

802
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,360
He was amazing

803
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,680
He was amazing

804
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,380
This morning

805
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:02,940
He was amazing

806
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:02,940


807
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:02,940


808
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,600
I was American

809
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,280
This morning

810
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,840
He was amazing

811
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,260
This morning

812
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,160
The Man on the Television

813
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,600
I know that if I had just the right outfit and hairstyle, they could be me

814
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,280
Don't you know you can't be cool if you dress down like you have time

815
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,800
Cause everybody's got one

816
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,220
I think about smoking, that would make me an intellectual

817
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,020
That's what I've always wanted to be

818
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,480
I need to lift weights, that would make me more sexual

819
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,260
That would be so good for me

820
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,000
Being in America is wonderful, I think you would fake it

821
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,660
Own anything you want, I think you would take it

822
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,840
Look for today, don't think about tomorrow

823
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,520
Have a good time in America, Gamora

824
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,660
What are you looking at? You better not make me mad

825
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,040
I'll drive by your house and shoot your dog on moment

826
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,680
That I don't need you or the Bible or anything

827
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,820
You tell me what

828
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,380
What is the law?

829
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,000
With a good enough lawyer, I can do anything

830
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,380
You know, I'm America

831
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,360
Being in America is wonderful, I think you would fake it

832
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,920
Own anything you want, I think you would take it

833
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,400
Look for today, don't think about tomorrow

834
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,860
Have a good time in America, Gamora

835
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,200
Look for today, don't think about tomorrow

836
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,060
You better not make me mad

837
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,960
I want to be in America

838
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,620
Okay for me in America

839
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,060
Everything's free in America

840
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,660
For us, for free in America

841
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,460
I want to be in America

842
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,120
Okay for me in America

843
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,560
Everything's free in America

844
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,140
For us, for free in America

845
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,440
All right, so it's America the Beautiful, guys.

846
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,240
It's beautiful here.

847
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,400
We do have a hell of a country.

848
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,300
It's nicely paved.

849
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,300
Could be better.

850
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,100
Could be worse.

851
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,440
Could be a lot worse.

852
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,540
It's gonna get a lot worse.

853
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,560
Yeah, so attention to Echelon Listing Project over here.

854
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,560
If you'd like to shut us up, pay us off.

855
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,600
It might be cheaper than you think.

856
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,280
Although they could probably pay WREK less just to get us off the air.

857
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,860
That won't shut us up, though.

858
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,720
No, it wouldn't.

859
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,000
No, you're right.

860
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,660
We've got the internet.

861
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,800
God damn you.

862
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,620
That's right.

863
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,860
God damn you all.

864
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,140
What's the deal with all that testosterone?

865
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,400
It's not a test, and it's not, uh...

866
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,240
Osterone?

867
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:44,580
Yeah.

868
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,900
What if it was a pasta?

869
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,560
It'd be testosterone-y.

870
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,420
I believe you're right about that.

871
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,840
If testosterone was a pasta, it would be testosterone-y.

872
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,420
So happy Fourth of July.

873
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,160
Keep your fingers on your hand at all times.

874
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:14,380
I'm with the old dog and the young dog

875
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:19,020
Come on together for us to breathe

876
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:25,000
You can miss a day, you'll all get away

877
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,200
They'll be running fast and free

878
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,640
I sing the end of homesick, homesick, homesick

879
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,460
Say me it loud and loud

880
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,760
Bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me

881
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,960
And you'll never run

882
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:55,940
I know the old dog got a bad head

883
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,080
And the young dog got teeth

884
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,480
And you can best it

885
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,780
Well, I'll give you a chance

886
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,040
I'm with the old dog and the young dog

887
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,100
Come on together for us to breathe

888
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:15,320
I sing the bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me

889
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,000
And you'll never run

890
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,160
Bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me

891
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,360
And you'll never run

892
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,740
There's a message

893
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah

894
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,800
In this detain

895
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,860
There's a bone

896
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,620
To this heart

897
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,640
With the dogs up

898
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,740
I get up on it

899
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,440
And burn up in hell

900
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,940
And money's never wrong

901
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,620
I sing it

902
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,380
Bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me

903
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,340
Say me it loud and loud

904
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,560
Bones sweep on me, bones sweep on me

905
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,440
And you'll never run

906
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,160
And you'll never run

907
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,060
And you can best it

908
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,780
But you've gotta free me

909
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,400
Zero to one

910
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:26,400


911
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,120
Yeah man

912
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:27,820
You're my friend

913
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:27,840
Don't lie to me

914
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,240
Don't tray me

915
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,340
Ain't no such thing

916
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:30,340


917
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,580
Don't drag me to my stream

918
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:31,680
When my party's out

919
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:31,980
Aren't you gonna soup me?

920
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,520
You're gonna get kommen

921
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,360
Hey, how about those history classes in school?

922
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,760
Glad you got the full story, people.

923
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,280
Lies.

924
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,200
Jeez.

925
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,020
Lies.

926
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,680
Every last bit of it.

927
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,100
You know, I read Grimm's Fairy Tales.

928
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,100
It was about as accurate a history of Germany in those ages as our freaking history books are.

929
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,840
The best thing about being a winner is getting to write the history books.

930
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,320
You can just have all kinds of fun.

931
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,040
Your enemies turn into the world's enemies and the devils of history.

932
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,580
Ah, what fun that must be.

933
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:57,080

00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,220
Please use your headphones with your earphones.

954
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:34,900
Don't you hear the sound of a gunshot?

955
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,000
And if you're listening in the air, I suggest you get out of the room.

956
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,460
And if you're listening in the internet, thanks.

957
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,720
If you're listening in Atlanta, thanks.

958
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,740
If you're listening in jail then I guess you already know what America's all about.

959
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,960
Yeah, our props go out tonight for our Fourth of July show for all you guys who have lost

960
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,820
your rights as citizens.

961
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,820
Who the hell do you think it was that carved this country out of Indian flesh?

962
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,160
It sure as hell wasn't the bankers.

963
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,140
It was crazy dudes with knives who get real drunk and make mistakes.

964
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,440
stakes. But when you're standing in the middle of a prairie, it doesn't matter. But when

965
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,140
you're standing in the middle of a bar in Atlanta, it matters.

966
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,580
So just remember who it was that colonized the state of Georgia, alright?

967
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,960
Criminals, criminals, criminals, yeah!

968
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,540
So with that, happy Independence Day. All hail the Chief.

969
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,040
And like they say in New Hampshire, live free or die.

970
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:33,300
You heard Dogs of Democracy by Debo the Star-Spangled Banner as performed by Carl Lewis.

971
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:44,940
I am afraid of Americans by David Bowie. American women and U.S.S.A. by the But Whole Surfers

972
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:53,020
Deconstruction performed their song America, Beautiful America by Fox.

973
00:53:53,020 --> 00:54:01,380
I'm Iron Frenzy the Misfits with American Nightmare, our national anthem by Negative

974
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:11,380
Land, our founding fathers, pharaohs, or hopheads by the Firesign Theater, the lymph node institute,

975
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:19,960
Contributed America, the booty for the sexy, sexy, sexy, Calliper Coggins.

976
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:20,840
Be watch.

977
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,000
When the Americans get out of this box, we're gonna be the first to get out of this box.

978
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,000


979
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,040
When the Americans find as they will, who could blame them if they said the hell with

980
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:27,940
the rest of the world?

981
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,220
Let someone else buy the foreign bonds.

982
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:35,040
Let someone else build or repair foreign dance, or design foreign buildings that won't shake

983
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,700
apart in earthquakes.

984
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,460
When the railways of France, Germany, and India were breaking down through age, it was

985
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,800
the Americans who rebuilt them.

986
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,120
When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them

987
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:46,840
an old caboose.

988
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,060
Both are still broke.

989
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,420
I can name you five thousand times when the Americans raced to the help of other people

990
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:52,800
in trouble.

991
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,560
Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble?

992
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,180
I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.

993
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,500
Our neighbors have faced it alone.

994
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:07,560
And I'm one Canadian who's damned tired of hearing them kicked around.

995
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,260
They will come out of this thing with their flag high.

996
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,900
And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating

997
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,840
over their present troubles.

998
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,300
I hope Canada is not one of these, but there are many smug, self-righteous Canadians.

999
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,000
And finally, the American Red Cross was torn apart by the American Red Cross.

1000
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,000


1001
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,000

1013
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:06,800
having heard this lymph node institute show before locally by the way this show was done

1014
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:15,480
before September 11th but just so you know this was not a reaction to that it was just a

1015
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,900
you know the way things were before and we want them sort of to be like that again

1016
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:31,040
I suppose so in the spirit of nostalgia thanks to lymph node Institute for that wonderful thing

1017
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:40,300

orb of the sun goes slowly down, burning out as all things must go to make way for new things.

1031
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:54,100
Can't wait to see the new universe. See you on the saucers, friends. Praise God.
