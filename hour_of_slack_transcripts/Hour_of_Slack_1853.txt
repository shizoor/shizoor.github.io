threaten the citizens and the values for which we stand.
Today, the United States is operating within our borders, waiting to strike again.
Every year, the United States welcomes 35 million prompt and effective transfers to our country.
Prompt and effective businessmen seek also to penetrate our students.
More than 700,000 of these come from countries in which Al has been active.
As a result, we have tightened our citizens.
In June, we announced the National Citizen Registration System.
This system reflects a fundamental fact of the war on citizens.
The fact is that terrorism is the best friend and most valuable resource of law enforcement.
The National Citizen Registration System will track two citizens in the first year,
stopping citizens while they are in the country.
For 10 months, we have been working with the United States to ensure that the citizens

For 10 months, we have conducted a campaign to identify, disrupt, and dismantle the Justice Department
for spitting on the sidewalk in the fight against organized citizens.
Well, in the war on justice, we have conducted the largest citizens investigation in history.
129 million individuals have been charged.
86 million have been found guilty.
Hundreds more in connection with the investigation.
We have been successful in protecting our arsenal.
But we are not illusions.
There remain sleepers in the United States who have action against them.
And as we limit the access of U.S. citizens to our country,
we recognize that the permanent residents carry out their attacks.
Individuals now being detained by the Department of Defense
as a plan to explode a dirty citizen on soil.

The Ballad of Bob by David Peel
and the Lower East Side

MediaSapiens at Freaker.net.
Friends, I am swamped with new material for this show.
There are some incredibly creative mutants out there.
In fact, there was so much to choose from that I started breaking it down into categories.
And those categories then form the themes of future shows.
For instance, the next show will be on drugs and drunks.
And after that, love.
This show's theme is the war thing.
And, you know, there's some killer recent material on that subject,
but not by very many subgenii.
In fact, after I was done culling it all down about the only new war
and questioning the government type stuff on alt-binary,
slash,
were a series of absolutely astounding collages
that had variously been done by Fernanda Nandeli-Moore,
Champion Jack Codini,
and a newish fellow named DJ Epoch.
Go figure, friends.
I thought they all were patriots, psychotic, and narco-materialists
who had tuned out and dropped out.
Like me.
But it turned out we were all a bunch of pro-tits.
Testers, after all.
Also, of course,
lots of Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith
on ESO Radio at WCSB Cleveland,
greatest college station in America.
And friends,
this coming up right now is from Champion Jack Codini.
Thank you, and praise Bob.
Thank you.

I have a lot to be thankful for tonight.
I was not elected.
Thank you very much.
Of course, I should reach Jet Prop 1
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.
Would you like to see some projected kill ratios?
I believe things happen for a reason.
Republicans want fear and cruelty.
I'm optimistic this can happen,
and I will give it my all.
And it will be a foundation of my administration.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.



I appreciate so very much the members of Congress
who have joined me in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,
and will be open for business.
By destroying our way of life,
our first priority is to sustain comprehensive and relentless business.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Now we're on.
So what's up?
Well, I normally don't worry about that war stuff,
but I've been getting letters from kids that were worried about that war stuff.
Yeah.
I think they should be.
Well, I got a very plaintive letter from somebody I figure
is probably a young man.
I think of him as the naive, idealistic young man.
And he was saying,
it seems like people are just letting the conspiracy
just walk all over them and destroy the Constitution,
and this time nobody's even getting upset.
They're just acting like, oh, that's perfectly normal.
Oh, you can't fight.
What's happened is anybody who defies the government
now perceived to be some kind of stupid, wimpy hippie?
And we must do something.
What can we do?
Legalizing pot isn't enough, he said.
There must be some.
And all I could tell the kid was,
if you want to weaken them, strengthen yourself.
You can't change.
You can't force anybody to change.
Uh-uh.
You can.
You can change where you're at.
Uh-huh.
You can, you can, uh...
Well, you gotta get your money and you gotta get your pay.
That's the drawback to all that, you know, fancy talk.
Yeah, well, what can you do?
What should...
What should kids do out there?
What direction should they go?
That's, that's, uh, up to each individual kid.
They're all gonna have...
Only each kid knows what it does best.
It.
You know, it, the kid.
Not to be sexist.
I could say he or she, but that's kind of clumsy.
I just prefer it since I think of them as half-formed creatures.
I think of them as children, really.
I see why they'd be really concerned.
They've never had...
They've never seen this, this drum beating and war stuff in their lifetimes yet, big time.
It's like the Cold War again, sort of, you know?
Big, giant threats hanging over your head all the time.
I grew up thinking it was gonna be like Planet of the Apes.
And then I thought...
We must...
Protest.
And...
And I, I, I got, I tried to make artwork that would change the world.
Art.
Little movies.
Things like that.
Underground films that would, that would change the world.
But all they did was make all the hippies really depressed.
And mad at me.
And...
Thank God for Bob, though.
Bob came along and saved me.
I was the first Bobby.
Yep.
I don't, I don't mind admitting it.
People put down the Bobbies.
Like, like Moonies.
It's a derogatory term.
But I don't call people Bob.
Not specific people Bobbies.
Because...
Because I'm the, the original Bobby.
I was the first one that worked for Bob without knowing him personally.
And without pay.
That's a pretty Bobby-ish, stupid, religious nut thing to do.
Yeah.
But...
And now...
That's the way it goes.
Now...
Well, now I get to sit at home listening to music as loud as I want.
Doing anything I want to do.
And just watching the money roll in.
Just rolling in.
A wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow.
Brought in by those Zombobs.
Zombobs.
The little employees, they get like 50 cents an hour.
Sort of a token pay.
Slack pay, we call it.
Are you listening, sheeple?
Zombobs.
, Zombobs.
Skull yeah, we don't pay no back, from full great�
zombobs.
Zombobs are the daft.


Hidretats.
I flew me a voodoo set for a day.
This could go a bit pickled.


Who do you talk to?

I asked our male� 9-B.
Yes, he said hello.
She asked if I meet hooks.
pose a threat. Understandably, children are now rotating even as they continue to play
elsewhere in the world. Meanwhile, Turkey, Kabul, Kabul, Kabul, has increased its Afghan
presence sending some children to Kabul to assume leadership of the International Security
Assistance Force. Already 500,000 children have offered weapons for this humanitarian
catastrophe. The U.S. and coalition partners have delivered some 28 needy children since
the start of the war, enough to feed the U.S. and coalition partners. Russia has cleared
out the north, including children. Thanks to those efforts, the grim predictions of
starvation came to pass. Demining teams have helped hundreds of thousands of landmines
in that country. U.S. civil affairs team built a hospital that has now treated more than
six patients, including children. They're being interrogated. They are yielding information
that is helping to prevent further children.
But perhaps the most important measure of progress is the flow of violence and bloodshed,
together with some children. They're coming back in Afghanistan. Our operations today
consist mainly of smaller children, cave-by-cave children, small pockets of children. Norway,
Denmark, and the Netherlands for air operations over children. Romania is deploying an infantry
battalion to Afghanistan and has offered an infant mountain company, a nuclear, biological,
and chemical response company, and four children.
People working in ethnography, meet up with their families and Thirty children will be
feelings of victory to be sent back to complete success.
I feel strong pride in д essentials, six families that have been
dispatched from their countries. They all tend to proorfäh ordered on America's


Terrorist security!
If we объясne Protest, that's the major goal system in the United States.


something they couldn't afford before.

They were good opponents in, and were really Täshiplines patients for it. But today's show is more usual.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
It's just two fries. It's like we're the same.
We're just two fries.
Or he's 30 years old.
Recipe for showing off.
So where do you get so many that will be willing to shoot people?
Kind of recruit all year long.
Hey, would you like to go shoot people?
And of those who do, there's a real esprit de...
But we have the equivalent of about 100,000 Hiroshima bombs.
The target.
A loved one who is awake.
Four, three, two, one.
This little boy.
Nuclear force is a cheat.
It costs $35 a year to maintain.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You know, business picks up
in a funny kind of...
hideous way.
You know, Chaz, I was standing there looking...
You know, the conspiracy is going full steam now.
They've gotten off their asses.
They're busting their asses.
They're getting others to bust their ass for them.
Are you talking about the Republican conspiracy specifically?
The whole machine.
Because the whole machine has been doing that for thousands of years.
But they've really picked it up now.
I mean, it's really like in some kind of a...
Hyper mode.
They're high tech.
They probably have perfected the science of psychohistory.
They know how to make their future come true.
Yeah.
But the thing that makes me think that they won't ultimately succeed
is that they don't seem to be washing their ass.
Well, they're certainly not washing their ass.
No, they're not washing their ass.
But we're the ones suffering for it, see?
That's right.
Well, I was telling the idea...
Well, I was telling the idea...


Realistic kid, you know, all we can do...
This monster is so gigantic and so old
that all the weirdos in the world aren't enough to fight it
because it's made of all the normals in the world.
Therefore, about all we can do is hide in the chinks of its hide
until one of us is smart enough to come up with a way
to tie its shoelaces together and cause it to topple over
and crush itself of its own weight.
Which might just happen automatically.
As it did to the mighty dinosaur.
Is the conspiracy a mighty dinosaur soon to go under
and weave the little shrews destined to evolve into the next conspiracy?
Bob!
Now we must learn to work together if we are to understand your mental illness.
Bob!
How can I get you to accept your condition if you won't cooperate?
Bob!
All right.
Bob!
Fine.
Bob!
Bob!
Very good.
Bob!

To numb the area while separating blood from fat.
Mothra is not the answer.
Mothra is not the answer.
And neither is anything else, dear friends.
Or whatever he said.
That fine cut-up.
And in fact, pretty much all the other cut-ups and collages on this particular show
are part of a massive gout of spewage of sound editing
done recently by Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

there's one going down on his target now no missed the ships he hasn't hit a single

and

but let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius
the devil owes you money friend but bob dobs is the bank where you can cash it in we gotta burn
out the banks of the devil we gotta root him out burn out the hate burn out the radiation
burn out the hate burn out the debt burn out the debt burn out the debt burn out the high


out the fire. These words may be harsh. They may not go down well on the polished ears of the
rationalist, the modernist, those who wish to see proof of Bob, but I don't care what they say.
I'll keep preaching. If you go down, pull them with you. Praise Bob. Help me, somebody. Let there be slack.
How did you know? Because Bob is nothing short of a damn coward and he's plainly crazy.
Bob Bob? Bob must!
Chapter 94
Bob spoke to Moses saying, command the children of Bob and tell them.
The main purpose of this project is the nuclear Bob Bob production. All Bob wires and
Bob.
Bob must! Set up their facilities. Bob must! Come back and do it. No charge. Bob!
We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast.
The National Company intends to continue throughout the rest of this night.
This is our official notification that we will continue throughout the remainder of these
nighttime hours. This is the National Company.
Bob must! Show me a series of tricks he taught his invisible monsters.
Bob walks free never to be tried again.
Bob spoke to Bob saying, Bob shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.
Ex-ex-ex-free-all-of-body Bob Bob's Bob Bob's Bob Bob's must wed reformed gun mall because he has given of his seed to Bob to defile Bob and to profane my holy name.
Bob!
The world, crippled by these events, waited for the first sign of an invasion from Bob.
Bob! Bob! Bob!
Bob!
Bob Bob? Bob Bob?
Bob!
Ex-ex-ex-free-all-of-body.
Bob called to give Enron a break.
Bob! Bob called to give Enron a break.
We know that Bob called to do that.
No.
No.
Did anybody call Bob?
No.
No.
One final question, if I could.
No.
Okay.
Did Bob call you to give Enron a break?
Well, we, I mean, of when we, and I've testified that we was high.
I'm sorry.
You said no?
No.
Okay.
No.
And you were having calls from Bob asking you to hold off on your downgrading of Bob at that time?
We were.
Okay.
I'm going to downgrade.
No.
Thank you.
Do you think Bob made a mistake?
No.
No.
No.
To that extent, I do agree with Chairman Bob.
I got these dream recollections that a couple of the babes of the church posted to all.slack.
Somebody's pushing.
I'm going to go to the doorbell, like, really frantically.
The listeners can hear that little squeal.
Of course, you know what that's got to be.
Reverend Magdalene said,
I've just had a bad dream detailing what it would be like to be hit with a bioweapon epidemic.
First, only a few will get sick.
Soon, every illness reported will cause police and ambulances to swiftly and silently move in and remove the sick person.
Then someone will overhear.
The EMTs whispering among themselves and the word will be shouted on the street.
Epidemic.
Those who are well will not touch those who are sick.
Some will not be able to resist touching those they love, and they will become sick, too.
The sick will hold one another.
Even strangers and the fever will make them cheerful as they wait for the end.
They will talk about love.
They will dream about peace.
They will play.
As they flee, the rich will open their houses to the poor.
Medicine will be free and compulsory.
Eventually, the doctors will find medicine that will stop it, and even some of the sick will live.
Some will be no more than vegetables, like this man seen here on screen two.
He's festering already.
Look at all that.
Oh, the boils are amazingly large.
They're almost psychedelic.
They're bigger than the rest of his body.
We're going to get a picture of him before we put him out of his misery.
Can't we lance this one postule before we go?
I've enjoyed this so much.
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me get a snap of this.
Snap?
How about a pop?
Let's just squeeze it a little bit.
Well, yeah, yeah.
Hey, let's film that popping in slow motion.
Oh, my God.
Look, his brain is festering, too.
His entire brain is mounting.
Hey, his living will does say it's okay to do this, right?
He's living.
Ah, who cares?
It's the end of the world.
It's the plague.
The fever is catching on.
People wearing dark shoes will be led to the end of the building where they will be shot by transparent transvestites.
It's for your own good.
The perks of the doctors without front tears or front rears will far outweigh the rest of the civilian populace.
Far out.
No smoking in the gas chambers.
New foods will be eaten.
By those who can no longer digest their own stomachs.
This music will be heard in every corporate office building.
Every corporate office building will be a coffin.
They will be in prison.
A tomb.
Imprisoned.
But the fever will make you cheerful.
What good is it to live when life is nothing?
What good is it to live in a gymnasium?
It gets the mausoleum that took...
Pull the wool over your own eyes.
And cover yourself with the sheet.
The shroud.
And just lay there.
Until the shroud takes an imprint of you.
Maybe someday it will be worshipped as the imprint of a savior.
A true artifact of our Lord.
A master book.
A blaster.
Check the neck on that one, baby.
I for one would like to know what we're going to do with the efficacious bodies we have stored here in this stone's plunder.
And look, the mausoleums are all packed.
There's nothing we can do but shake our hands and ring our feet.
We're done ringing bells.
Not enough prisons.
Not enough mausoleums.
Not enough funeral parlors.
Not enough gravesites.
Not enough show cakes for all the stiffies.
The Grand Canyon couldn't hold the full population of the dead.
So we had to dig a new Grand Canyon.
A mass grave.
For the disbelievers and the believers.
And those who will believe anything.
The watches sure are cheaper.
The watches sure are cheaper.
The graves.
Yeah, you can get a good watch.
Well, you can get a good watch for nothing.
All stopped at the same time.
The graves.
The graves.
The graves.

The graves.

The graves.
The graves.
The graves.
The graves.
Are you the shaft of Bob's pipe, so to speak?
That through which others are sucked?
Have you been braced with the cleaning fluids of Bob?
Ha ha ha.
Ah, the pity.
Fated to drift forever through the void is gravity's plaything.
Oh, cruel fate.
To be thusly boned?
Ask not for whom the bone bones.
It bones for thee.
The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.
Ah.
Ah, damn you!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!

The priest shall burn the head on the altar for a burnt lord.
It is a burnt head and it's made by sweet fire.
This is new. All new.
And medical science offers you proof positive.
You'll see the number 903 on the government stamp.
It is not a nice movie, people.
There will be no smoking in the death halls.
Throw it out. Window.
Dispose of all smoking materials in the morgues.
Watch out for that.
There are authorities here.
There are authorities here tonight.
And we do not want to piss off the gods and goddesses.
Where are you going to go?
Where are you going?
Hide when the man dressed in blue is on the inside.
When cannibalism is rampant and people stare at your feet on the bus waiting for a bite.
They haven't eaten in days.
They look at you like a snack.
The authorities are here, man.
They're here. They're inside your head, dude.
And they're hungry, too.
The authorities in your mind are hungry.
They want to consume the rest of the body culture.
Yeah.
They don't like what you did, man.
They're like the worm or obelisk that eats its own snake.
You're in big trouble with the authorities inside your head, dude.
Oh, you got problems, Barney.
The devil.
The devil is living inside your head.
The devil of the conspiracy is right there.
And he's ready to sign that check using your hand.
What you going to do about it, huh?
You just going to let him do it?
You going to let him do it?
The devil use you.
When you press that voting switch.
When you punch that little vote dot.
Are you going to let the devil use you when you pay that tax?
Are you going to let the devil use you when you put that rubber on?
Are you going to let the devil use you when you go in that chem can portable toilet?
I want you to ask yourself that, my friend.
You lay down in front of the smoke screen.
You let the devil into your body.
You let the devil in your body.
You let the devil in your body.
Well, he's in your spinal fluids now.
And let's begin the contest.
These are good spinal fluids you got from that listener, Dave.
I notice my perception is so much clearer and brighter and crisper.
It's as if I can see through the walls.
My own hands are pulsing like those light bulbs.
Cool, man.
I love the way you can do that.
Just by sapping the attention.
span off of those listeners
while they listen.
Yes, it's a digital delay.
You merely place your thumb in one hole
and put your hand in the other one
and the brain is completely under your control.
Cool.
Why must we talk constantly
of the conservation of these
millions and billions of dead bodies here?
The necrophilia has become rampant.
A dead man's vote.
That's your vote, friend.
Your vote is a dead man's vote.
Dead man's voting.
You put your shoes on this morning.
Somebody else should be putting them on tomorrow.
When they flip that flip-top box.
You were a dead man the minute you were born.
The minute you walked out of your ma's
or a yay-yay hole.
You were dead.
You were on your way to the grave.
It's a long trek.
Hey, buddy, my mom ain't got no yay-yay hole.
Now, why don't you take that right home?
We're all going to the same place, bub.
Yes, the great womb is spewing forth
stillborn bodies.
Wow, look at those little water heads popping out.
They're like little zygos that can't make it up the river.
Look, they're just pooping.
They're just pooping right out.
Some of them are screaming to Ishtar and the other old ones.
I don't think it will make much difference, do you?
Oh, that's what's so wonderful about nature.
Death allows new life to come.
And as those bodies float down the river,
why, new little babies are being born
all up and down the riverside.
Look at those screaming women giving birth.
Thousands and thousands, as far as the eye can see.
Are they going to make some great sandwiches?
Or are the seagulls going to be happy tonight?
Billions of potential copper tops.
Buildings full of potential copper tops.
Ishtar.
Yeah.
Traveling by small boat and pack horse,
conservationists have come to this remote spot
to tear off strips of decaying meat.
First to arrive at a dead sheep,
conservationists take advantage of landfills,

and then they turn to larger size to evict smaller birds.
A feeding hierarchy minimizes conflicts
over insect larvae infesting the carcass,
but doesn't entirely eliminate them.
The general rule is all males, except for the youngest,
eat before females,
and older conservationists eat before younger.
Sated for now,
the conservationists may return over several days
to finish the carcass.
Come morning,
conservationists expose themselves
by slowly unfolding on the bare rock floor.
They install cameras
to observe the chick on the dead sheep.
One after another, they step off the cliffs.
A dimension in another dimension.
The sure sign of dying on the ground.
That means you get all this absolutely free.
A whopping.
One hundred dollar value.
All absolutely free.
But you gotta call now.
Here's how to order.
Call 1-800-338-311-911-338-319-99-3119
or send it.
One hundred dollar.
Check or money order to Bob.
Well, how shall we resurrect the body politic?
We put this question to the Reverend Ivory Smiles
of the Church of the Sub-Hanio
in Australia.
In Australia, I think it's...
Oh, well, they're already doing it.
They've got strings that like,
and they're operating the body politic like a puppet.
They're moving the corpse around like a marionette
using their strings of control.
Ah, the psychic tampons,
which make the children dance
when there is no music.
Our favorite song.
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
I don't know, Dave.
I don't know, it was a shower.
I keep wanting to be involved
and do something about society
and the world and the war
and the problems.
Oh, hi, Cynthia.
When did you float in here?
But, but I just, I don't even,
you know, I've just lost all interest completely.
It's like, it's all so distant and so...
They're going to use buses on us, Dane.
They're not going to use those like, you know,
railway cars like they did in the 40s.
Oh, well, then it'll get personal.
Then I'll be concerned.
When they come for me
and move me into that railroad car
and take me off to the camp,
then I'll be all worried about the politics.
Oh, word is, no railroad car for you.
You get your own white SUV
with your own numbers on the side.
Is there going to be a war?
Are we going to be hauled off to concentration camps?
Or is it all just going to be, you know,
threats and worries and wars and rumors of wars
and gnashing of teeth and flailing of hair?
Well, that is part of the pogrom,
is to keep the...
keep the mind asunder
while plundering these difficult delights.
It's obvious that some sort of crash is being...
is on its way,
and we're trying to minimize it
with our own subcutaneous thoughts.
We don't have the cheese.
We don't have the correct armature
to blow these notes.
Who's not afraid to write and sing
the way he likes, Bob?
Who's not afraid to sing
when people were uptight, Bob?
Who's talking like people who get his music star?
Who's on the change of music stream for all of us?
Who'll help us with the answers when he sings the songs?
Who's controversial when it seems to get the wrong?
Who's not afraid?
Who's not afraid, not afraid?
And not afraid, not afraid?
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!

After an attack is over
and the all clear has been sounded,
arrangements will be made as soon as possible
to treat any people who are ill or injured.
Listen to your radio.
Details will be given about what to do,
when to do it,
and how.
If anyone dies
while you are kept in your...
fallout room move the body to another room in the house label the body with name and address
and cover it as tightly as possible in polythene paper sheets or blankets tie a second card to the
covering the radio will advise you what to do about taking the body away for burial here's

That's right, and 19 years later, it's still subgenius.com.
This Hour of Slack episode number 1853 was a rerun of number 853 from the year of 2002 titled Wars and Lemurs of War.
And I must say, when I listened back to it while mindlessly assembling subgenius membership packs, I was stricken by how insanely timely it seems today.
Almost 20 years ago.
It's that old.
I mean, but just us joshing around was so uncannily prescient that it sounds like it was ripped from tomorrow's headlines.
We never mention which epidemic, but it might as well be this epidemic.
And we never mention which war, but it could be the current Cold Civil War.
Chilling.
The only detail out of place is the name Bush.
Penn Jillette was.
Right in that movie about us.
We are good at this.
19 years later, you can still reach me at stang at subgenius.com.
But the church mailing address is now P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas 76043.
We'll do new shows again as soon as my physical therapy exercises start to pay off.
They did before and they will again.
As Nenslow told me,
Don't stop your meds just because you feel better.
And with that advice, I shall take my leave.
Praise Bob and let there be slack.
