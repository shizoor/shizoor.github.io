1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:10,580
Smoking. Smoking. Smoking. Smoking. Smoking. Smoking. Well, I smoked a pipe. What? Pipe was smoked.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,340
It's smart to try smoking. I know, Mom. There's something real good about it. Yes, the pipe. We

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,040
smoked it. Well, that's fine. Gee, maybe I'm rich already. Well, I'm glad you said that at least.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,100
I just imagine the beaver smoking that pipe. Well, I guess that's just one of the unwritten

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,640
rules of childhood. Dad smoked it.

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm lopsided. Senator Ted Kennedy is undergoing brain surgery in

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,680
Michigan today. PR says surgeons are trying to remove as much of Kennedy's brain as possible.

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,380
GOP presidential candidate John McCain is closing in on the International Space Station,

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,500
which he accused of funding terrorism. McCain also urged a campaign to limit the flow of PR

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:09,540
news in Japan. On Wall Street 16521, a judge in Texas must take part in parenting classes.

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,980
He was 79 years old. Marlee Meisner with the Texas Child Protective Services says probe the children.

12
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,800
It's indescribable. It's beautiful. We've been pointing out different things, and it's incredible.

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,780
Rock and roll pioneer Barack Obama is calling for the U.S. to impose financial penalties against PR News in Washington.

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,680
For almost two centuries, Americans have enjoyed neglect of our duties as citizens.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,260
Now, God join, make, help, learn, work, produce. God join, make, help, learn, work, produce.

16
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,740
God join, make, help, learn, work, produce. God join, make, help, learn, work, produce. God join, make, help, learn, work, produce.

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:51,620
Then...

18
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,300
The Self Genius Power of Squash!

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,920
Bob.

20
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,300
Bob.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,680
Bob.

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,880
Bob.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,160
Bob.

24
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,540
Yeah.

25
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,560
Well, that's what you get when you start messing around with dynamite.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,520
Why should you buy a Bob Radio?

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,500
This is Bob.

28
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,320
Radio is all about Bob and at the heart of every speaker that makes voices come alive.

29
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,300
When you turn on Bob, you can hear every word clear.

30
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,140
Then you've heard it a long time.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,120
And it's simple.

32
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,240
There's five memory buttons on top.

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,600
And when you push one, Bob doesn't tip over.

34
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,900
Give Bob a try for the best listening.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,260
Bob.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,640
The High Performance Radio and Light Company.

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,140
Attention, attention.

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,080
The listeners are listening.

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,520
Not again.

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,660
What program is this?

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,640
What program is this?

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,040
I want to know what program this is.

43
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,200
Somebody shooting face in my mouth.

44
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,100
It's that man with the funny mustache.

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,580
I feel tired.

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,600
He's doing it.

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,440
It's him.

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,860
He's listening to me.

49
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,620
It's my Bob.

50
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:50,840
Bob.

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,460
Afternoon Bob.

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,020
Beginning Monday over most of these stations, two of your Bobs will be coming.

53
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,800
Coming, Mother.

54
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,180
The first will be Bob and his quips and comments.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,720
And by the way, Bob's guest editor this coming week will be Bob Bob.

56
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,000
The second will be that master of the easy style, Bob Bob.

57
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,540
So listen at the new time for two of the most entertaining Bobs in radio.

58
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,100
Now it's Bob.

59
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,640
Now it's Bob Bob.

60
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,980
Bob Bob.

61
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,560
Bobs.

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,100
Bob.

63
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


64
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


65
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


66
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


68
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


69
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


70
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


71
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


72
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


73
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


74
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


75
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


76
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


77
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


78
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


79
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


80
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


81
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


82
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


83
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


84
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


85
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


86
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


87
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


88
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


89
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,100


90
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,680
Henry, don't you know you shouldn't whistle?

91
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,840
But dear, I really think we should.

92
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,560
Henry.

93
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,900
May I have the hot cakes and sausage, please?

94
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,480
Here, dear.

95
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,160
Hot cakes and sausage.

96
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,440
Because milk toast is better for you.

97
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,240
Henry.

98
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,620
Yes, Mother.

99
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,580
Yes, Henry.

100
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,800
But first, this is Bob.

101
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,020
Are you sure about that?

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,480
Yes, Bob.

103
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,080
Bob Dobbs.

104
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,140
It was many moons ago that I gave Dobbs my money.

105
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,200
The minute I yeet got my thirty dollars.

106
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,800
The minute that peace stench whiff was red.

107
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,660
And good old Stang scribbled my name in the book of life.

108
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,120
I gained the one thing the pinks do not have.

109
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,100
I gained inner slack.

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,880
Deep within the recesses of a warped and mangled mind is a slack that cannot be stolen.

111
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,460
That slack is faith in slack.

112
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,080
Blonde, deaf, and dumb faith.

113
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,520
Faith that the luck plane will tilt my way.

114
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:37,220
The saucers will arrive and the sex goddesses will reward me for my faith.

115
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,200
Hello, this is the flattering tongue of a seductress.

116
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
Lust after her beauty in your heart?

117
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,740
Let her allure you with her eyelids.

118
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,920
Understanding.

119
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,780
Slack.

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,960
He who does so, you are my sister.

121
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,000
With the attire of a harlot and a crafty heart.

122
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,380
And I have found you.

123
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,000
Come, let us take our fill of love until morning.

124
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,580
As an ox goes to the slaughter through Moses.

125
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,360
To lust for her.

126
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,500
Yes, early in the morning he came again.

127
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,780
He whores.

128
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,820
To lust for her.

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,440
I guess he was talking about that harlot priestess.

130
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,940
Yes, Pisces, who we heard earlier.

131
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,200
On this hour of slack number 1159.

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,200
Before that, friends, a whole lot of audio choppery by Fernanda Nande-Lemur

133
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,900
and some Norelpref ones, too.

134
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,040
We also heard and will hear some classic puzzling evidence show from the 80s

135
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,480
saved by Phineas Narco with puzzling evidence and Dr. Howe.

136
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,060
More of all of that to come, but first and later,

137
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,400
some radio synesthesia call-ins from WCSB Cleveland with yours truly

138
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,260
and Dr. Sinister, Priestess Pisces, Rocknar, and No Money Mark seen here.

139
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,860
Hello, you're on the air.

140
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,980
Hi, I'm here to save the remainder of the show.

141
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,320
Mark to the rescue.

142
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,080
Yeah.

143
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,480
Okay, I have a question for Reverend Stang.

144
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,000
What do you see as the future of the Church of the Subgenius?

145
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,300
Oh, vast riches, incredible power over...

146
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,080
Entire countries.

147
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,240
Yeah.

148
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,380
It may not be immediately.

149
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,580
I'm not talking about this summer.

150
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,400
The subgenius sphere.

151
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,920
That's going to be a whole new sphere of influence, a whole new culture.

152
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,640
Yeah, it might be another year or two before we start seeing...

153
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,200
Bob predicted it a long time ago.

154
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,180
He said it.

155
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,460
I read it.

156
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,500
That settles it.

157
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,780
I had a question for you.

158
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,900
Why are you called No Money Mark?

159
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,020
I hope that's like an ironic nickname,

160
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,100
like when they call bald guys,

161
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,040
or big guys hairy, or...

162
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,960
Well, I wish.

163
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,320
The way it came about was I was calling 669,

164
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,840
and sweet as a five, I needed some sort of nickname.

165
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,220
And my real name is Mark, and he suggested Money Mark,

166
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,940
you know, after the DJ.

167
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,380
And I said, no, No Money Mark, that's more appropriate.

168
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,620
So that's where it came from.

169
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,280
Awesome.

170
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,160
A divinely inspired and selected name.

171
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,240
Right.

172
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,160
Versus my nickname was just picked at random

173
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,900
when I jumped on an IRC channel,

174
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,900
because I couldn't think of anything.

175
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,500
Is that your astrological sign?

176
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,680
It is.

177
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,760
It is.

178
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,540
Oh, so you were cheating.

179
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,060
It actually made some sense.

180
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,480
Oh, look what happened.

181
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,060
He got too near the reactor car.

182
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,100
These callers don't even know how to approach the subgenius show.

183
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,020
A little flaming fleck of phlegm

184
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,040
in the dying entropic superstructure of the cosmos.

185
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,080
Oh, you mean this closet here?

186
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,640
Whoa, that's a good one, Gary.

187
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,480
Now I suggest you close that monster closet

188
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,280
before we're attacked by unthinkable things

189
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,540
that might come oozing out at any time.

190
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,080
Oh, here they come, slithery.

191
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,440
Get back.

192
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:55,600
Whoa.

193
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,560
Oh, no, it's the tambourine people.

194
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,340
And the march of the things now is...

195
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,520
Now, this is a beautiful float.

196
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,380
It's the Thing Society, and those are the thingettes

197
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,260
in their beautiful abbreviated uniforms

198
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,580
waving and winking at the crowd now.

199
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,220
And they're throwing what appears to be candy of some kind,

200
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,480
because look at those kids go to scoop it up.

201
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,080
Those are candy.

202
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,680
Candied Thing Baby eggs, Hal.

203
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,580
Have one.

204
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,960
Oh, uh, thanks.

205
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,180
You sure you don't want it yourself.

206
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,660
As the subgenius parade goes by in all its splendor.

207
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,100
Are you there?

208
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,880
Are you there, Fuzzling?

209
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,980
Yes, I'm here.

210
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,260
I'm over on the other side of the street.

211
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,220
You can see my scarf.

212
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:33,900
Oh, yes.

213
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,120
And this, I believe, is supposed to be Bullwinkle the Moose

214
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,260
pulled on all these ropes like a giant cloud.

215
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,500
He's Bullwinkle.

216
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,380
He looks like Bullwinkle.

217
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,860
This terrain is just like that.

218
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,000
And that next boat is, I believe,

219
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,780
this is Bart Simpson,

220
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,860
the famous television character

221
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,640
and Supreme Court justice.

222
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,900
You don't have a f***ing fun, man.

223
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,560
And as the station loses its license,

224
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,900
the KPFA closes.

225
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,800
We're slowly defining here in front of everybody.

226
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,240
It's too bad that we can't stop moronic colors

227
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,140
from jeopardizing the show and its very existence.

228
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,920
And now,

229
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,120
the little babies with instruments

230
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,160
sewn to the front of their vestments.

231
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,100
Aren't they cute?

232
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,400
You know, their moms and dads must be standing

233
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,700
mighty tall this day.

234
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,120
As the juvenile infant cadet

235
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,000
marches the last time

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,880
just before it's shipped off to the Persian Gulf.

237
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,920
I guess it's our nation's leader's theory

238
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,280
Look at that.

239
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,260
On the side, the computer is spelling

240
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:39,680
that must be a foreign way of saying

241
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,260
that English babies will also be sent

242
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,140
into the Persian Gulf.

243
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,260
I guess so.

244
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,440
Always Homeric, those kids.

245
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,080
Those kids.

246
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,080


247
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,080


248
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,080


249
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,080


250
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,080


251
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,080


252
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,080


253
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,740
Those Englanders.

254
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
Yeah, I remember Eric.

255
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,880
He was always at home.

256
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,540
He never came out, you know.

257
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,900
You know, in the afternoon of September 8th, 1926,

258
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,680
a short stocky man in a baritone coat

259
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,560
and a pearl-grey fedora

260
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,120
walked this balloon down the street

261
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,880
for the first time.

262
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,640
It was a historic occasion.

263
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,480
Yes, well, you know, of course,

264
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,780
Here comes the military folk

265
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,580
with the U.S. Marine Hawk missile.

266
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,840
Oh, yeah, dreaded torpedo.

267
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,720
You know, the generals who command these men

268
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,540
do seem confident of victory.

269
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,640
Yes.

270
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,280
They say that overconfidence

271
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,360
is a generic disease on the eve of a shooting war

272
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,520
in the Persian Gulf.

273
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,580
Oh, and there's the first pro-council of war

274
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,380
who has been saying that we can go to war at any time.

275
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,320
According to this information I have here,

276
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
this float represents Pocahontas,

277
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,500
the Indian princess,

278
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,280
and Captain Miles Standish engaged in a furious copulation

279
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,380
while Indians watched him behind a tree.

280
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:39,600
Oh, yes, I see.

281
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,520
They're powering that siren with their activities.

282
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,260
How amazing.

283
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,080
That siren is played by a man named, uh,

284
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,820
by the White Christians for Decency

285
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,840
and the Caucasian Christians for Commerce

286
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,520
whose float brings up the rear, as it were.

287
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,320
Well, I don't know anything about trees.

288
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,740
The majorette is, uh, gesturing with her baton.

289
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,200
The Indian dips in the flaming solution and up it goes.

290
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,020
Wait, look where she's putting it.

291
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,040
Wow.

292
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,140
Well, at least that put out the fire.

293
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,220
Sure did for that majorette, anyway.

294
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,940
And here comes the drunk, drunk, uh, oops,

295
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,320
uh, slight mishap at the edge of the crowd.

296
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,880
Yeah, I think that was the alcoholic's float.

297
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,880
That was the DWIers from, uh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

298
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,860
Oh, so it was, so it was.

299
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,860
Yeah, I don't have one of those neat sheets, so...

300
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,440
They're, they're cleaning up the mess and, uh,

301
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
it seems that they're bringing in the cute kitty cat.

302
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,260
And here's Philo's, uh, float, which is in every year.

303
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,440
A great favorite for the kids.

304
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,960
It throws candy with little razor blades in them.

305
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,340
That, uh, giant Filofax was created by the Boy Scouts of America.

306
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,040
Hello.

307
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,780
Welcome to the lips of an immoral woman, honey.

308
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,720
Aliens go down my mouth and say,

309
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,980
breasts satisfy you at all times.

310
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,980
In the Bible.

311
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,640
Sexual intercourse.

312
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Yes, and finally, pornographic literature,

313
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,600
pornographic films, pornographic television programs,

314
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,680
and drugs.

315
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,360
In the Bible.

316
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,700
Ho, ho.

317
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,400
Honey.

318
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,520
Yes, I, Dr. Howell,

319
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,680
am the mightiest of the submen, the undermen,

320
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,120
the greatest in the lowerarchy.

321
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,280
Of course, we're inferior to normal people, we undermen,

322
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,920
but nonetheless, of this enormous army of gimps and wimps,

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,600
I, Dr. Howell, approach common humanity the most.

324
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,440
Though subhuman and a subgenius, I am almost a human.

325
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,340
At least we undermen understand what we undertake.

326
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,400
What we take down under the surface of what we understand,

327
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,500
down and pulled down with the undertow into the underpinnings of the unconscious mind.

328
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,500
In this sub-scratum, we, the undermen, move in.

329
00:12:41,520 --> 00:13:09,500
We will cause a Ellen, whenever does she change her mind it will with a hug

330
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:09,540
after a once disgusting pig release,

331
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,540


332
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,540


333
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,540


334
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,540


335
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,460
this submin aviation has done enough good of us

336
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:11,460


337
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,840
are off the charts.

338
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,000
We do anywhere from 500 to 5,000 a week.

339
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,620
Oh, it's revolutionary.

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,960
But I pray that the Lord would let me marry someone who is a rat.

341
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,380
That will be the focus of the rest of this program.

342
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,200
But don't give me that garbage.

343
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,180
I'm sucking tired of religion, church, the Bible, and Christians.

344
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,660
You're going to get a thrashing.

345
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,480
If you ever touch me again, I'll kill you.

346
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:32,940
Right.

347
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,140
But can you believe that?

348
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,100
From PR News in Washington, I'm rising to the highest level since last October.

349
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,560
Iowa Governor Chet Culver has floodwaters.

350
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,060
It's been one heavy rainfall after another.

351
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,920
Storm formed over and over.

352
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,800
Water was over the water treatment plant.

353
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,440
Over.

354
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,840
The small town of New Hartford was in Ames, Iowa.

355
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,680
The National Guard is now underwater, and PR News is adding to the misery.

356
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,200
On Wall Street, 12-7-2-15.

357
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,560
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama will only continue President Bush's failed policies.

358
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,820
McCain, for his part, responded by saying that this is PR News.

359
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,160
New Palestinian poll.

360
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
Popular PR supports.

361
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,760
Palestinian poll.

362
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,000
Policy percent poll.

363
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,580
Polling poll.

364
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,220
PR News.

365
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,740
The government of Saudi Arabia says the kingdom will work with other OPEC members to, quote,

391
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,700
Welcome to Darwin Rocks.

392
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,200
Darwin wrote the theory of evolution.

393
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,500
Rocks.

394
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,760
Darwin wrote at the same time.

395
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,020
Slack cannot be explained.

396
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,580
Slack rocks so rapidly, we must shape or rock.

397
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,940
Rock.

398
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,500
Soft parts are very soft.

399
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,040
Rock.

400
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,240
Rock.

401
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,540
Rock.

402
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,220
Intense heat.

403
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,620
D-E-M-O-N-O-K.

404
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,080
Have a good.

405
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,700
Come.

406
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,200
Come.

407
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:01,860
Come.

408
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,820
Well, in saying, do you think there's any truth at all in astrology?

409
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,300
Me?

410
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:06,980
Yeah.

411
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,280
Oh, I can always tell when Mercury is in retrograde.

412
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,280
Yes.

413
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,920
Which it is a lot of the time.

414
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Because everything is screwed up.

415
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,660
Everything is screwed up all the time.

416
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,340
What are you talking about?

417
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:21,980
Yeah.

418
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,180
In fact, I blame a lot of things on sunspots and astrological misalignments and things

419
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,700
like that.

420
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,240
People don't even blink.

421
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,620
You know, they'll swallow anything.

422
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,980
Well, the Mercury retrograde thing is supposedly...

423
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,920
It's basically that communication and anything that involves the transfer of information.

424
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,220
Now, why is it that Mercury in retrograde means that?

425
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,300
I don't know.

426
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,880
I just know.

427
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,980
I mean, I'm no scientist.

428
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,920
I just know that...

429
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,400
Could that have anything to do with the fact that Mercury is the messenger god?

430
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,240
Yeah.

431
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:53,820
Exactly.

432
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,640
Now, why is that planet called Mercury?

433
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,140
Because somebody named it that.

434
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,300
Because we named it that.

435
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes, precisely.

436
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,640
Yeah, some wise guy.

437
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,880
So is it really a property of the planet that was named by us?

438
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,120
No.

439
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


440
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


441
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


442
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


443
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


444
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


445
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


446
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


447
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


448
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


449
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


450
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


451
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


452
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


453
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,120


454
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,740
Come on now.

455
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,820
This is nonsense.

456
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,160
No, it makes a good story.

457
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,000
There you go.

458
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,320
It makes a good story.

459
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,720
And that's all it has to do.

460
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,280
And all you've got to do is stick to your story.

461
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,020
It just has to...

462
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,580
You're right, man.

463
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,420
Thank you for some intellectual honesty there.

464
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,400
You know, if I love or don't love astrology, the way that you're supposed to be able to

465
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,520
determine a person's entire personality just based on what time of the year they were born.

466
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,220
I've seen them do it, though.

467
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,620
I mean, of course, it's hard wash.

468
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,120
And yet, it's amazing how they can pull that off.

469
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,320
Oh, yeah.

470
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,700
It's awesome.

471
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,500
It's a very...

472
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,180
It's a skill.

473
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,640
Like, doing astrology for people is not something that any idiot can do.

474
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,280
It definitely takes some practice.

475
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,160
It takes some training.

476
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,440
It takes some research.

477
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,580
And when you are really, really skilled in the arts of BS, then you can...

478
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,380
You can tell them what they want to hear in ways that no one ever imagined.

479
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,540
You know, like, you can memorize all the details and all the characters in the Star Trek universe

480
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,220
and, like, you know, like, know all the details about, like, where the...

481
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,200
Freaking...

482
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,340
What part of the Delta Quadrant the board are from or whatever.

483
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:09,760
You know what I mean?

484
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,360
Like, you can memorize all those details, too.

485
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,100
It's, like, just another set of information that you need to memorize and, like, know...

486
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,680
Be aware of the consistencies of it.

487
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,580
And, you know, it's a rule system like any other.

488
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,920
Even though it may not have a basis in reality, it has its own internal logic.

489
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,620
Anything can be a religion because you don't use your mind to think about your religion.

490
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,440
And if I remember correctly, the border from nowhere near the Delta Quadrant...

491
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,840
I don't...

492
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,320
Thank you, Mark.

493
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,600
It was a guess.

494
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,740
Thank you, Mark.

495
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:37,980
Whatever.

496
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,660
I guess I just proved your point.

497
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,560
Yeah.

498
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,180
Does it matter?

499
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,960
Is what I'm saying.

500
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,600
You know, like...

501
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,520
Of course not.

502
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,580
If I wake up tomorrow morning and decide that I want to worship my cat's turd and base my

503
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,180
day upon where the turd lands in the litter box...

504
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,820
Then you will get toxoplasmosis.

505
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,200
Well, that's another story altogether.

506
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,760
But the point is, is that it's just like reading feelings.

507
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, or chicken.

508
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,540
And trails.

509
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:06,920
Right.

510
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,140
Oh, yeah.

511
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,380
I think that...

512
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,840
No, what's great is they've done, you know, a study where they get like a hundred people

513
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,100
together and say, you know, do you believe in astrology?

514
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,240
Okay, well, we're going to get customized.

515
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,900
Just fill out this questionnaire about, you know, where and when you were born, and we're

516
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,960
going to return you a customized astrological reading.

517
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,680
And they all got back their readings a few weeks later, and they all opened them up,

518
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,660
and they were just blown away by how accurate these were.

519
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,120
And then they said, now trade it with your neighbor.

520
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,400
Yeah.

521
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,120
Yeah.

522
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:34,720


523
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:34,760
Yeah.

524
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,200
Yeah.

525
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


526
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


527
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


528
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


529
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


530
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


531
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


532
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


533
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


534
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


535
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,200


536
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,640
And they all got the exact same reading.

537
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,760
And like 90% of these people were...

538
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,480
Thought it was a perfect reading that was perfectly accurate.

539
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,060
Right.

540
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,600
And they gave the exact same reading to everybody.

541
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,900
And you can repeat that experiment, too.

542
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,180
Do you think that people ever conform themselves to what they think their...

543
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,320
Exactly.

544
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,840
If you live in a world, in a psychological environment where you think, you know, Pisces

545
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,060
means this and Leo means that, you know, then, you know, you're...

546
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,680
That's...

547
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,880
That's going to shape your attitudes, you know what I mean?

548
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,640
I'm a Leo.

549
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,400
Yeah.

550
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,460
Well, you are.

551
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,780
And I'm a Pisces, obviously, but I'm not a stereotypical Pisces, because a stereotypical

552
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,020
Pisces is very shy.

553
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,200
And anyone who's met me at X-Day knows that shyness is not part of my psychological makeup

554
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,780
in the planet.

555
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,940
Hey, O'Connor.

556
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
I don't know how the astrologers explain that.

557
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,340
I know a lot of outspoken Pisces, Pisceses.

558
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,660
Yeah.

559
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,340
I mean, but we're also supposed to be moody and emotional, which I...

560
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,860
I can...

561
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,980
I will confess to that.

562
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,560
I know a lot of people of all stripes who are moody and emotional, you know what I mean?

563
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,240
This product is intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

564
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,140
What they're doing is they're making this group of people, because I can take that person,

565
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,060
low-income and uneducated, because once you take a person who's a low-income or uneducated

566
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,340
or a combination of all, you're screwed.

567
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,400
I can't believe it.

568
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,860
That's why I'm so passionate about...

569
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,320
Peace.

570
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,760
Peace.

571
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,820
Peace.

572
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:04,420
Peace.

573
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,160
Look at that.

574
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,480
Steam your clams.

575
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,520
Steaming the clams, you can do it.

576
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,020
Oh, man.

577
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,660
Hello, you're on the air.

578
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,620
Hey, do you mind if I bring up something about 9-11?

579
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,620
Is it going to be conspiracy talk?

580
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,620
Is it going to be what?

581
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,820
Conspiracy theories about it?

582
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:22,860
I...

583
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,020
Somewhat, but...

584
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,500
Goodbye.

585
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,960
216-687-3515.

586
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,120
You're putting the cover up, man!

587
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,200
Oh, good night.

588
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,980
I'm so sick of that subject.

589
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,600
I just...

590
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,320
And particularly not in the last eight minutes of the show.

591
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm sorry.

592
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,220
It is very annoying.

593
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,920
Try again next week.

594
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,020
Try again next week, a little earlier.

595
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:39,980
Yeah.

596
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,560
Okay.

597
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,640
I was part of the Kennedy cover-up for a while,

598
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,020
but then the book came out that explained everything I was hiding.

599
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,380
Yeah.

600
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,800
But you have so much other things to hide.

601
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,460
Right.

602
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,740
Right.

603
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,680
In the future...

604
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,100
Of which things are secret and which ones we're supposed to advertise.

605
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,260
I was actually the guy on the grassy knoll,

606
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,200
because in the future I'm going to invent a time.

607
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,540
I'm going to invent a time machine.

608
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,640
I know it's because I've been visited by my future self.

609
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,960
Because if Kennedy hadn't been stopped,

610
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,620
he would have ended up becoming 10,000 times worse than Hitler.

611
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,320
Ooh.

612
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,360
That was the part they don't tell you in elementary school.

613
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,140
Wow.

614
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,460
Really?

615
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,960
Yes.

616
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,240
Really, Pisces.

617
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,580
Really.

618
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,580
And in fact, part of the cover-up is this book called

619
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,840
Ultimate Sacrifice by Lamar Waldron.

620
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,020
Actually, it's a really good book about...

621
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,100
The JFK one-bullet, one-vote episode.

622
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,380
And another part of the cover-up, friends, is X-Day,

623
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,940
which is about to happen here in subgenius land and across the globe

624
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,960
any year now.

625
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,920
And since we're getting ready for that,

626
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,180
which involves a lot of slack abuse,

627
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,420
we shall let the rest of this episode of Hour of Slack morph

628
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,080
into an episode of Bob.

629
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,200
Slack Time Funhouse!

630
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,780
From WREK Atlanta.

631
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,500
And in this case, Reverend Susie the Floozy's absolutely incredible show

632
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,640
on the specific subject of the specific conspiracy.

633
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,400
Praise the Flooze!

634
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,120
Damn black helicopters!

635
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
Hey, get out of here, dammit!

636
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,460
I'm trying to use a frickin' phone!

637
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,280
Jesus!

638
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,140
I have to live in a flyover zone.

639
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,420
Open channel D, please.

640
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,160
Reverend Susie the Floozy here.

641
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,920
Uh, yeah, um, uh...

642
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,360
I'm experiencing some really weird phenomena here.

643
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,680
It seems to be localized in my closet.

644
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,320
I thought you and the lymph node institute were...

645
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,320


646
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,320


647
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,160
like in prison.

648
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,520
Now when I'm at your service,

649
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,520


650
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,960
my으니까 here's just like mine.

651
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:09,960


652
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:09,960


653
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,320
and, you know, discouraging einfácil,

654
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,080
is something that came with 언 Einkuen opinions

655
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,080


656
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,940
and, well, at nine,

657
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,820
your good old nation takes you off track,

658
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,040
love lapses a small piece of slime...

659
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,840
You would get used to the won Kaifling's

660
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,180
firetrap right out to the ground,

661
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,180


662
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,180


663
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,260
and in this grade 1 lights that,

664
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,400
you've never married.

665
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,460
Why, forget I,

666
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:29,520
was the Rosetta Never.

667
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,860
I don't want to come on any further,

668
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,080
i'm a bird

669
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:40,600
Perfect all the way up to number 17, but when I got to my chupacabra skin hot pants remember that outfit

670
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,940
It was all covered with some sort of weird gooey ectoplasm

671
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,620
No, you don't understand what I'm trying to tell you

672
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,940
Something is seriously wrong with hanger 18

673
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,780
Hello

674
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,640
Hello

675
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:57,720
Oh

676
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,480
We've been cut off I

677
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:11,320
Tell you seekers, it's it's like it's some sort of conspiracy

678
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,240
or something

679
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,340
We are

680
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,620
to

681
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,240
employ

682
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,140
you

683
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,600
you

684
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,820
you

685
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,920
you

686
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,220
you

687
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,820
you

688
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,680
you

689
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:41,980
you

690
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,060
you

691
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,420
you

692
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,840
you

693
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:43,900
you

694
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,060
you

695
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,100
you

696
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,880
you

697
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,020
you

698
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
you

699
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:14,960


700
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:14,960


701
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:14,960


702
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:14,960


703
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:14,960


704
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:14,960


705
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,380
I

706
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,140
I

707
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,480
I

708
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,540
I

709
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:16,780
I

710
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:16,780


711
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,380
I

712
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,300
I

713
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:18,340
I

714
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,940
Information can destroy

715
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,280
So we'll treat you just like toys

716
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,280
We are the men in black

717
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:54,120
We are the men in black

718
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,900
We are the men in black

719
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,400
Let the truth be known

720
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,980
A truth unlike the Roswell incident

721
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,400
Hanger 18 and so on and so forth

722
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,200
The Bermuda Triangle stuff they have

723
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,320
And for the Philadelphia experiment

724
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
And on and on and on

725
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,340
It just goes on

726
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,340
And let the public know

727
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,720
If you're listening to your ham radio

728
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,220
Or as they say amateur radio

729
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,700
And you get some kind of strange signals

730
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,860
On your radio

731
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,540
And you hear something that sounds

732
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,020
A little something like this

733
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,700
Welcome seekers to Bob's Slapton Funhouse

734
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,720
Now if the FBI doesn't get you

735
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,420
Or the FCC

736
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,460
The KGB sure did

737
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,360
But anyway

738
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,300
That's what you do if you get this

739
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,500
What the hell are you talking about?

740
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,060
A conspiracy bigger than the prophecy

741
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,960
The Bible says there is coming

742
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,160
A world government at the end of the age

743
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,180
No one would be stupid enough to believe that

744
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,360
It'll last for three and a half years

745
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,440
It's going to be an absolute dictatorship

746
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,560
And it does not give the names

747
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,840
But we're watching world news

748
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,460
It's going to be through

749
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,040
The United Nations organization

750
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,340
And it's going to be through

751
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,460
The United Nations organization

752
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,720
But how did this world government

753
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,920
Get its foundation?

754
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,000
How did it begin?

755
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,680
In 1776

756
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,080
A man by the name of Adam Weishaupt

757
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,000
That you see on the screen with me

758
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,560
Founded the modern day version

759
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,000
Of the Illuminati

760
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,100
Adam Weishaupt was a member

761
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,300
Of the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church

762
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,200
And the Pope suspended that order

763
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,140
Because of atrocities

764
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,080
And dealing in demonic activities

765
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,220
And witchcraft

766
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
And Satanism

767
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,120
This man believed in Lucifer

768
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,100
As God and worshipped him

769
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,980
So Adam Weishaupt actually founded

770
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,860
The modern day Illuminati

771
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,540
Illuminati means illuminated ones

772
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,040
They were illuminated by Satan the devil

773
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,960
They preferred to call him Lucifer

774
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,700
And so the modern day version

775
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,580
Of the Illuminati was founded

776
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,180
May 1st 1776

777
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,160
Approximately the same time

778
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,340
When the United Nations organization

779
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,500
Was being formed

780
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,940
He put the accent on American

781
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,860
As opposed to the world socialist revolution

782
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,300
Now smothering the American people

783
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,960
The world communazi revolution

784
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,080
Which he reminded me

785
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,440
Was launched in Germany May 1st 1776

786
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,700
The same year the American revolution was launched

787
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,280
For we shall be governed by God

788
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,040
Or we shall soon be ruled by tyrants

789
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,080
Adam Weishaupt who launched the socialist world revolution

790
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,400
In Germany May 1st 1776

791
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,420
Laid down as one of the six cardinal doctrines

792
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,280
Of his Illuminist

793
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,020
Now called communist revolution

794
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
As being

795
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,500
The abolishment of all religion

796
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,000
When in the same year 1776

797
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,560
We laid the foundation of the American revolution

798
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,740
We proclaimed

799
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,320
In God we trust

800
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,520
As though God himself raised up his people

801
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,180
To confront the devil in the form of

802
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,620
Adam Weishaupt and the world revolution

803
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,540
As time went on

804
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,780
The Illuminati began to penetrate

805
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,380
Every government on the European continent

806
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,360
They began to send individuals

807
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,840
Over to the United States

808
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,520
Who were 13 lodges of freemasonry

809
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,260
Where those at the very top

810
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,860
The 33rd degree

811
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,760
Which is the honorary degree

812
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,140
Were a part of the Illuminati

813
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,040
They had one lodge in each of the 13 original colonies

814
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
A very obscure man

815
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,260
Who had six children

816
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,160
And most of them starved to death

817
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,940
By the name of Karl Marx

818
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,180
Was actually contracted by the Illuminati

819
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,120
To update their program for world government

820
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,260
He put it in the form of the communist manifesto

821
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,160
It laid down their goals

822
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,520
And the goal was to have

823
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,500
Public education for all students

824
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,780
So that they would be able to

825
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,560
Propagandize and to socialize

826
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,200
The mind of those individuals

827
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,500
Who attended those public schools

828
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,860
The speech is short

829
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,900
But it's the most rousing speech I've ever read

830
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,600
It's been worked on here and in Russia

831
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,920
On and off for over eight years

832
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,580
I shall force someone to take the body away from him

833
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,680
Then Johnny will really hit those microphones

834
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:09,840
And I'll be able to get the body

835
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:09,840


836
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:09,840


837
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,640
And those cameras with blood all over him

838
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,820
Fighting off anyone who tries to help him

839
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,620
Defending America even if it means his own death

840
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,980
Rallying a nation of television viewers into hysteria

841
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,280
To sweep us up into the White House

842
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,720
With powers that will make martial law seem like anarchy

843
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,780
Who controls the British crown?

844
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,840
Who keeps the metric system down?

845
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,840
We do

846
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,920
We do

847
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,020
Who makes Atlantis off the maps?

848
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,300
Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

849
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,100
We do

850
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,680
We do

851
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,880
Who holds back the electric car?

852
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,960
Who makes Ye Gutenberg a star?

853
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,660
We do

854
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,680
We do

855
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,840
Who robs Capish of their site?

856
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,840
Who rigged every Oscar night?

857
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,420
We do

858
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,440
We do

859
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,220
We do

860
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


861
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,680
So it is

862
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,520
International communism socialism

863
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,980
under the control of the Illuminati

864
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,480
worshippers of Satan the devil

865
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,120
Soul-less, spirit-less, corporate little bitches

866
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,000
We're suckers

867
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,600
of Satan's

868
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,860
Suck it

869
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,160
It's only your dignity

870
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,740
Suck it

871
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,080
I have a document which shows that a world currency is already being setup

872
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,640
A word bank is already being setup by the Trilateral Commision

873
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,920
headed by David Rockefeller

874
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,400
Of which, by the way, President Carter is a member

875
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,440
of the Trilateral Commission

876
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,260
And there will soon be a universal currency by which there can be a global economic control.

877
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,600
My goodness, Ivan, I'm stunned.

878
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:54,440
With my brothers, the stonecutters behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us.

879
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,900
We gotta kill him.

880
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,560
Take it easy.

881
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,800
Let's hear from the stonecutter world council before we act too rashly.

882
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,760
I knew we were in trouble with that damn egg commercial, that guy.

883
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,060
I knew that was the government's take on drugs, believe me.

884
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,380
Here's your brain.

885
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:07,520
Brain.

886
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,040
I've never, ever, ever, ever, ever looked at an egg and thought it was brain.

887
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,700
Not once.

888
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,120
So one of those egg council creeps got to you too, huh?

889
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,300
Oh, you got it all wrong.

890
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,640
It's not like that.

891
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,480
Kill him.

892
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,260
Kill him.

893
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,840
Kill the fool.

894
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,940
Great, I have to disagree with Orville, Jack, and Mister.

895
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,440
Can't we just do something to his voice box?

896
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,380
We might as well face the truth.

897
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,560
As long as we're stonecutters, he will control our lives.

898
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,140
Now with computers, we have the first time in history that what John predicted 1,900 years ago

899
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,360
would change.

900
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:37,720
It's going to take place.

901
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,800
Because now there are computers, in fact, there's one in Brussels right now that could do the job very easily,

902
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,400
where every person on earth will receive a number and they can be kept accountable.

903
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,560
Computers don't make errors.

904
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,660
What they do, they do on purpose.

905
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,880
By now, your name and particulars have been fed into every laptop, desktop, mainframe, and supermarket scanner

906
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,580
that collectively make up the global information conspiracy otherwise known as the beast.

907
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,960
The mark of the beast.

908
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,900
People now.

909
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,620
Who have implants in them.

910
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,480
It traces their movements.

911
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,060
It helps their health means, but it's also an invasion of privacy.

912
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,880
Soon there's computers that are apparently being developed that can read your brainwaves,

913
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,900
that can read your thoughts.

914
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,360
I mean, this is not, these aren't toys or beyond the realm.

915
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,380
People have to grapple with whether they want that big brother screen, which will be there.

916
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:32,780
Click.

917
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,340
You can turn it off.

918
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,480
Yes, Winston.

919
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,180
Yes, Winston.

920
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,880
Yes, Winston.

921
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,140
That privilege.

922
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,760
Well, shall I say it or will you?

923
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,840
I'll say it.

924
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,420
That thing is really turned off?

925
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:44,780
Yes.

926
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,280
Everything is turned off.

927
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,400
We're alone.

928
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,200
All right.

929
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,960
We have come here because we believe that there is some kind of secret conspiracy,

930
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,120
some kind of secret organization working against the party and that you are involved in it.

931
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,620
We want to join it and work for it.

932
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,280
That can be arranged.

933
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,480
Oh!

934
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh!

935
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,540
Ah!

936
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,560
Ah!

937
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:05,960


938
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,220
This club better be worth it.

939
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,700
Oh!

940
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,240
Ah!

941
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,040


942
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,160
All right, all right.

943
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,200
It's Lisa's turn.

944
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,080
Ah!

945
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:13,660
Ah!

946
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,280
This is a .

947
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,400
Oh, that.

948
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,540
We are enemies of the party.

949
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,060
We disbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc.

950
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,720
We are thought criminals.

951
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,340
We are also adulterers.

952
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,980
I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy.

953
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,840
Yes.

954
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,800
First, let us all take a drink.

955
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,340
Woohoo!

956
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,700
Now, let's all get drunk and play ping pong.

957
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,240
Yeah!

958
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,020
It is big brother at its worst.

959
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,220
Oh!

960
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,440
Oh!

961
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,080
Oh!

962
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,100
This is the United States Army.

963
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,940
We've got 30 seconds to throw out any weapons that exist at the premises.

964
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,000
No!

965
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,300
No forms.

966
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,140
No computers.

967
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,440
We were never here.

968
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,980
Don't feed the beast.

969
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,420
It's just phenomenal.

970
00:34:51,880 --> 00:35:00,660
The amount of information that's out there in the secular media that would lend us to believe that chimp implants are going to be used to identify us.

971
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,420
What are you talking about, man?

972
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,480
Chimp implants.

973
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,420
Chimp implants.

974
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:04,920
Chimp.

975
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,360
Chimp.

976
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,660
Chimp.

977
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:05,700
Chimp.

978
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,000
No!

979
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,720
Don't feed the beast.

980
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:17,100
Because you see, there's a conspiracy, and a lot of our own officials in America are a part of that conspiracy, and we're no longer the free land that we ought to be.

981
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,500
Now, here are some of the executive orders, and I believe you need to know what some of them are.

982
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,580
This is not all of them, but there they are.

983
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,100
There's some of the things that they can do.

984
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,680
Take a moment to read that, please.

985
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,020
They can seize all communications media, seize all electors, power, fuels, minerals, both public and private.

986
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,640
What do you think, Carl?

987
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,240
That's awful.

988
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,960
What do you want to know?

989
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,360
Most are doing things تھ SARAT and if they can Psalmune

990
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,300
in some sense, they're little born Silicon.

991
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,560
It's still in that faith.

992
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,200
And there are people in that faith whose contents are crazy, nonsense.

993
00:35:52,220 --> 00:36:00,960
We got a little Growing Size and then another United States, also in our book called Missionberg Threat, The Great upholding Jenn, which blah, blah, blah, blah.

994
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,080
IS reduced from 316 to 225 people.

995
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,760
things all go down at once, that was not a happenstance or an accident. That was a trial run.

996
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,960
I like to call it what it really is, a dress rehearsal. And if you've ever been in a play,

997
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,780
when do you have the dress rehearsal? Right before the real thing. So when I say that a

998
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:29,180
takeover is imminent, I am giving you the reasons why I have said that. Mr. Reagan doesn't believe

999
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:34,360
in economic sanctions against the government of South Africa. Secretary of State George Shultz,

1000
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,460
representing the Council on Foreign Relations and their international global plans for one

1001
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:45,560
world government, very often he makes decisions related to the CFR, not to the Secretary of State

1002
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,920
that would really be to the benefit of the United States. Frankly, he makes me sick,

1003
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,400
but that's a personal opinion. Meanwhile, you have produced some what I call subversive

1004
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,760
organizations that aren't necessarily Union Jack, Old Glory, Apple Pie, and July the 4th.

1005
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,060
And the CFR, in my estimation,

1006
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,200
works far more for world government than it does for the government of the United States.

1007
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,500
And that brings me to the other one that you saw on the screen, TLC. That is not tender loving care.

1008
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,980
That's the Trilateral Commission, which, by the way, is part of the Fed, in a sense,

1009
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,960
because they're all tied into the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations.

1010
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,000
I happen to believe that this nation needs to be able to conduct deniable covert operations.

1011
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,200
I believe that this president, like all presidents,

1012
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:39,160
needs to have an ability to dissociate himself from those activities,

1013
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,060
and that the U.S. role should remain hidden or deniable and not be revealed.

1014
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,700
God bless America.

1015
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Oh, no. Aliens, bioduplication, nude conspiracies. Oh, my God. Lyndon LaRouche was right.

1016
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,640
My fellow Americans, you have a choice to make on Tuesday. You choose whether to continue forward

1017
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,340
on the path which we've forged or to move on to the future.

1018
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,780
We're going to move in a different direction. America is at peace and we're prosperous once more.

1019
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,100
The dreams of the next decade lie in your hands. On Tuesday, I hope you'll vote Republican.

1020
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,160
Up and down the ticket. To continue the change, we begin...

1021
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,580
It appears as though something has happened in the motorcade group. There has been a shooting.

1022
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,440
I repeat, a shooting in the motorcade in the downtown area.

1023
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,520
We needed the theory of some guy on the grassy knoll who's responsible for all this,

1024
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,760
and lo and behold, it's Falwell.

1025
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,020
What grassy knoll? Someone still needs to explain.

1026
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,240
But I don't even want to hear the words grassy knoll.

1027
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:48,500
The Illuminati, worshippers of Satan the devil, is now infiltrated into the United States of America.

1028
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,540
The very highest office of the land is now occupied by one of their agents.

1029
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,400
And it goes right on down through the Congress, the Senate.

1030
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,860
Realize who you're talking to. I am the commander-in-chief of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force.

1031
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,180
What?

1032
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,320
Call on all loyal Americans.

1033
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,160
Now pick at the White House, write to your congressmen.

1034
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,800
Don't let them pour an ink of water.

1035
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,780
I am the foe.

1036
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,180
Oh, for God's sake, let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories to the dead of seeing.

1037
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,980
Once more into the breach, dear friends.

1038
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,360
Once more into the breach.

1039
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,080
It was after the Washington State and East Lap.

1040
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,420
What you foes flew in triangular formation over the White House.

1041
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:42,000
You see, the brain of Charles Darwin is preserved in the British Medical Museum in London.

1042
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,440
I've opened the skull and looked at the brain.

1043
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,340
Now, their heads are a little bit large.

1044
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,740
But after all, you see megasophallic little people yourself.

1045
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,100
Many little people have heads that are a little too big.

1046
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,080
Oh, yeah.

1047
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,940
Well, he helped the oil man.

1048
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,960
Who made the talk.

1049
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,840
He is the one who told the oil man all about it.

1050
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,520
These groovy cats could care less about what happens in Washington.

1051
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,200
It's really not their bag.

1052
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,540
Like, uh, getting into the aliens and all.

1053
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,000
Going back and remembering when I first became an alien.

1054
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,660
Now the big one.

1055
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,120
Why?

1056
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,900
Why is all of this being done?

1057
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,060
What have they built you to do?

1058
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,920
I don't know.

1059
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,080
I don't know.

1060
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,300
I don't think anybody really knows except...

1061
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,760
that it's all on Moscow.

1062
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,560
And my American operator here.

1063
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,960
Or whatever it is it's supposed to happen soon.

1064
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,540
Like at the convention.

1065
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,180
Maybe it...

1066
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,100
I don't know.

1067
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,920
There's apparently a conspiracy to stop all of this.

1068
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,640
It's part of our work and causes us to lose the franchise.

1069
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,440
Oh, I see.

1070
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,900
This is some sort of conspiracy.

1071
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:09,880
No, no.

1072
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,520
Oh, yeah.

1073
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,680
Just some trumped up occupational therapy.

1074
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,680
Like leather craft.

1075
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,480
Or basket weaving.

1076
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,280
I swear to you it'll be a best seller.

1077
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,140
The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it

1078
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,120
is this vast right wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the

1079
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,500
day he announced for president.

1080
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,960
And by saying conspiracy they're saying lunatic.

1081
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,220
They're saying mad.

1082
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,120
They're saying out of the mainstream and therefore not to be taken account of.

1083
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,220
You know if you find a turtle on a fence post, it didn't get there by accident.

1084
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,500
And I just look at the landscape around here and I see just lots of big old turtles sitting

1085
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,680
on lots of fence posts.

1086
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,060
Possibly the best book ever written on the subject of turtle stacking.

1087
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,700
She's got that right.

1088
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,100
The length and extent of this conspiracy is absolutely fantastic.

1089
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,660
Actually, that's where I'm going right now.

1090
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,140
There's a vast conspiracy meeting downtown.

1091
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,520
The proof of this, the sophistication of this conspiracy is the utter absence of evidence

1092
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,240
for the conspiracy.

1093
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,720
That's how clever the conspiracy is at covering itself up.

1094
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,600
This is about as conspiratorial as a steam calliope.

1095
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,740
He didn't believe there was a conspiracy.

1096
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,560
He didn't believe there was a plot.

1097
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,400
Let's talk common sense now.

1098
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,600
Right.

1099
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,540
Yeah, common sense.

1100
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,740
Please call it conspiracy.

1101
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,600
Would you give me a chance to talk?

1102
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:24,760


1103
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,680
It was a first class mess in my estimation.

1104
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,480
Aren't you glad I never get political?

1105
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,540
So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays.

1106
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:31,940
And they don't talk about it.

1107
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,640
They don't tell me where they go.

1108
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,620
It's like a conspiracy.

1109
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,020
A conspiracy, eh?

1110
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,100
You think they might be involved in the Kennedy assassination in some way?

1111
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,020
I do.

1112
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,040
Oh.

1113
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,280
Sources within the United States using perhaps Cubans in this conspiracy.

1114
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,900
I still believe that it is a conspiracy.

1115
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:56,760
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, super patriots, fellow crackpots, members of the constitutional

1116
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,540
underground, Republicans and fellow Democrats.

1117
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,940
And my name is Lenny.

1118
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:01,940


1119
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:01,940


1120
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:01,940


1121
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,860
I'm glad to be here again.

1122
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,880
Because he had a lot of troubles with the brothers Kennedy.

1123
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,040
He was very much upset.

1124
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,400
Very much upset about what Kennedy had been doing to Hoffa.

1125
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:21,140
And he felt sympathetic towards Hoffa, described him as a man of the workers.

1126
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:21,980
Very much.

1127
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:21,980


1128
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:29,140
Bobby Kennedy, our Attorney General, the most outrageous appointment since Caligula named

1129
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,060
his horse a consul.

1130
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,460
And I'm very happy to be here.

1131
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:31,520


1132
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:42,640
And I welcome and honor with reduce round shaking hands the next dinners with the

1133
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,860
witnesses upon the House of Representatives.

1134
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:54,780
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome, my name is Lenny U Harbor, I'm the Chief Regionals

1135
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,640
Commissioner for Cadets.

1136
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,460
This is a group of scientists,Com PUBG Educational Sciencecoders and candidates.

1137
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,080
However, we ought to be very frank here.

1138
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,360
Why?

1139
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,700
The Federal Department of打children!

1140
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,320
I know the law.

1141
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,500
But they are not elegant.

1142
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,400
those owned by gangsters.

1143
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,760
The next steps of the collectivists

1144
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,160
is to send gun collectors around

1145
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,420
to each home to pick them up.

1146
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,680
It's sort of nice to have

1147
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,500
an equalizer around for four-block

1148
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,620
nuts on the door,

1149
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,600
regardless of who's knocking.

1150
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,320
And my informant heard him say

1151
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,820
very distinctly that in order

1152
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,900
to do away with Bobby,

1153
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,000
you had to get rid of the president

1154
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,900
of the United States,

1155
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,540
and that you had to find that nut

1156
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,420
who would be capable

1157
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,640
of assassinating the president.

1158
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,880
Khrushchev doesn't have to bury us.

1159
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,160
Our leaders are burying us.

1160
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,760
Stupid as I am sometimes,

1161
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,660
I started needling about the Kennedys.

1162
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,960
Gee, wasn't it too bad

1163
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,300
that Bobby Kennedy had you picked up

1164
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,320
and deported to Guatemala?

1165
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,140
Just to see what he'd say, you know.

1166
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,340
And then he said,

1167
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,040
don't worry, we're taking care of that.

1168
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,340
And I said, what do you mean taking care of that?

1169
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,540
He says, you know, you kill the head,

1170
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,620
the tail drops off.

1171
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,280
You gonna kill Bobby Kennedy for what he is?

1172
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,500
He said, no, you kill the president,

1173
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,960
Bobby gets taken care of.

1174
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:57,940
Once upon a time,

1175
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,640
a hunt on his dog

1176
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,920
was lost in a deep forest.

1177
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,840
Out of food,

1178
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,480
the starving hunter

1179
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,560
sat by his fire one night

1180
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,940
and finally he could stand it no longer.

1181
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,160
He whipped out his knife

1182
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,200
and whacked off his dog's tail

1183
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,260
and put it on the fire to boil.

1184
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,500
When he was through,

1185
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,700
only the clean bones were left

1186
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,380
and he tossed them

1187
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,120
to the whimpering dog

1188
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,060
who devoured the remains

1189
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,200
and then licked his master's hand

1190
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:14,660
in gratitude.

1191
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,940
That's the story of federal aid.

1192
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,220
Later on,

1193
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,860
he'll put fire

1194
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,900
every tree

1195
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,600
by the fire

1196
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,180
to keep them afraid

1197
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:29,900
to keep them afraid

1198
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:29,900


1199
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:29,900


1200
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,220
to keep them afraid

1201
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,060
Plato said the penalty

1202
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,040
good men pay

1203
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,020
for indifference

1204
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,980
to public affairs

1205
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,020
is to be ruled

1206
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,100
by evil men.

1207
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,780
I think we are being ruled

1208
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,660
by evil men.

1209
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,380
What can one person do?

1210
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,040
And now,

1211
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,620
fire!

1212
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,620
What are you trying to do?

1213
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,680
It appears as though

1214
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,780
something has happened

1215
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,600
in the motorcade.

1216
00:45:59,620 --> 00:45:59,880
It's a good thing.

1217
00:45:59,880 --> 00:45:59,880


1218
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,000
It's a good thing.

1219
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,240
It's a good thing.

1220
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,240


1221
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,240


1222
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,240


1223
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,240


1224
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,240


1225
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,240


1226
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,240


1227
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,480
I repeat,

1228
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,900
a shooting in the motorcade

1229
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,880
in the downtown area.

1230
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,380
He shot that guy

1231
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,300
and killed him too.

1232
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,340
The president's car

1233
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,560
is now going past me.

1234
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,980
Now traveling at

1235
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,220
a very high rate of speed.

1236
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,120
Secret service men

1237
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,380
standing up in the limousine

1238
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,160
in our arms

1239
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,140
with sub-machine guns.

1240
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,420
I am convinced

1241
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,980
beyond any question of a doubt

1242
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,120
that the first shot

1243
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,200
that was fired

1244
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,220
did not hit me.

1245
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,660
Ms. Connelly

1246
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,800
has the very definite

1247
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:36,800
feeling,

1248
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,680
a very strong conviction

1249
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,340
that the first shot

1250
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:41,960
that was fired

1251
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,580
hit the president.

1252
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,540
The second shot

1253
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,160
that was fired

1254
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,600
hit me.

1255
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,080
The third shot

1256
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,700
that was fired

1257
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,340
hit the president.

1258
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:50,720
Unquestionably,

1259
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,820
when the first shot

1260
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,300
was fired,

1261
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,740
I recognized it as a shot.

1262
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,000
I thought of nothing else

1263
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,840
but that it was

1264
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,540
a rifle shot.

1265
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,180
I thought of nothing else

1266
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,200
but that it was a shot.

1267
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,620
I turned to my right.

1268
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,720
I had time to think.

1269
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,920
I had time to react.

1270
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,280
And I turned to my right

1271
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,840
to look back

1272
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,860
over my right shoulder

1273
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,680
to see if I could see

1274
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,320
anything unusual

1275
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,400
and particularly to see

1276
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,260
if I could catch him

1277
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,160
out of the corner of my eye

1278
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,360
because I immediately thought

1279
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,180
the president.

1280
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,820
Because I immediately

1281
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,840
thought of an assassination

1282
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,200
the moment I heard the shot.

1283
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,580
On November 22nd,

1284
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,580
Mr. Dodd,

1285
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,600
what did you see

1286
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,740
and what did you hear?

1287
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,380
Well, I seen the president

1288
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,100
roll over

1289
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:28,940
and slump over

1290
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,520
in his seat

1291
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,240
and then I saw

1292
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,160
Governor Conley

1293
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,960
slump over.

1294
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,760
And did you see

1295
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,460
anything

1296
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,500
which might indicate to you

1297
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,540
where the shot came from?

1298
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,160
Well,

1299
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,760
we all three seen,

1300
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,420
four seen

1301
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,820
about the same thing

1302
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,220
as the shot.

1303
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,680
The smoke came

1304
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,800
from behind the hedge

1305
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,060
on the north side

1306
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,680
of the plaza

1307
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,820
and a motorcycle policeman

1308
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,100
dropped his motorcycle

1309
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,440
in the street.

1310
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,680
He was shot in the head

1311
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,480
with his gun in his hand

1312
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,680
and run up the embankment

1313
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,320
to the hedge.

1314
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,860
And yet he was not called

1315
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,460
by the commission

1316
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:05,900
for what?

1317
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,440
Well, I always thought

1318
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,140
it peculiar,

1319
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,520
but I thought that's

1320
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,340
the way they did business.

1321
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,780
Well, I and really most

1322
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,940
of the early subgenius apostles

1323
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,640
were in Dealey Plaza

1324
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,960
at the time.

1325
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,920
We were probably about

1326
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,100
nine, ten, eleven years old

1327
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:25,720
most of us.

1328
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,740
But we had our little dart guns

1329
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,920
and our, you know,

1330
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,920


1331
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,920


1332
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,920


1333
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,920


1334
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,920


1335
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,920


1336
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,920


1337
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,920


1338
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,920


1339
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,620
little ray gun toys

1340
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,180
that make sparks

1341
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,060
and our squirt guns.

1342
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,540
And we were stationed

1343
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,740
at the grassy knoll

1344
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,100
in the,

1345
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,700
in the drain,

1346
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,840
storm sewer drain,

1347
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,260
ready to do our patriotic duty.

1348
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,240
You don't believe a word of this,

1349
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:46,460
do you?

1350
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,980
Sure, it's fantastic,

1351
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:48,600
but it happened.

1352
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,680
Don't just sit there

1353
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,680
measuring me for a straight check.

1354
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,160
Do something!

1355
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,320
Get on the phone,

1356
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,020
call for help!

1357
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,060
Get on your radio

1358
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,080
and sound all points along.

1359
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Block all highways

1360
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,520
and stop all traffic

1361
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,680
and call every law enforcement

1362
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,460
agency in the state.

1363
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,320
Operative,

1364
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,540
get me the Federal Bureau

1365
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,180
of Investigation.

1366
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,580
Yes, it's an emergency.

1367
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,080
Over the last seven years,

1368
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,960
Lamar Walton has built up

1369
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,880
a formidable database

1370
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,200
on this secret agenda

1371
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,840
and its relationship

1372
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,880
to Kennedy's murder.

1373
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,800
There were very low level

1374
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,320
operatives and informants

1375
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,780
working for the CIA

1376
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,220
whose primary allegiance

1377
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,860
was to the Mafia.

1378
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,500
And these people

1379
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,060
had been working

1380
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:27,500
for the CIA

1381
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1382
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1383
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1384
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1385
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1386
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1387
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1388
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1389
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1390
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:27,500


1391
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,120
with the Mafia

1392
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,820
for much longer

1393
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,700
than they had been working

1394
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,400
with the CIA.

1395
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,760
And the Mafia paid them

1396
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,680
many, many times

1397
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,760
what the CIA did.

1398
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,500
Those people not only told

1399
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,480
the Mafia bosses

1400
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,020
like Traficante and Marcello

1401
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,540
about Project Freedom,

1402
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,240
but they worked with the Mafia

1403
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,720
in ways to use those plans

1404
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,360
to kill President Kennedy

1405
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,880
and use the secrecy

1406
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,980
surrounding Project Freedom

1407
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,260
to cover up the Mafia's

1408
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:50,800
role in it.

1409
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,920
Warren Report found

1410
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,160
no significant links

1411
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,160
between Jack Ruby

1412
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,220
and the Cuban issue

1413
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,940
or with organized crime.

1414
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,200
It was incredible.

1415
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,620
He really believed this stuff.

1416
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,140
In the fall of 1963,

1417
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,460
Ruby made an unusual number

1418
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,660
of long distance calls

1419
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,200
to associates of

1420
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,680
Johnny Roselli in Las Vegas,

1421
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,640
Sam Giancana in Chicago,

1422
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,220
and Carlos Marcello

1423
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,060
in New Orleans.

1424
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,100
And Oswald was also

1425
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,720
very close in 1963

1426
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,640
with a man named David Ferry

1427
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,720
who was working on a daily basis

1428
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,160
for Carlos Marcello

1429
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,980
in the fall of 1963.

1430
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,540
The committee believes

1431
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,900
that President Kennedy

1432
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:26,920
was probably the most

1433
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,800
likely to be assassinated

1434
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,380
as the result of a conspiracy.

1435
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,780
I guess the easiest thing

1436
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,840
would be to blame it all

1437
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,080
on some sort of vast

1438
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,400
right wing conspiracy.

1439
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,400
But that would be lame.

1440
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,280
No one would be stupid enough

1441
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,000
to believe that.

1442
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,360
I would love to see

1443
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,780
a computer faced with

1444
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,080
the problem of coming up

1445
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,400
with the probabilities

1446
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,020
of the assassination

1447
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,620
taking place the way it did.

1448
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,720
With all of these strange

1449
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,920
incidents that took place

1450
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,060
before and are continuing

1451
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,940
to take place

1452
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,900
after the assassination.

1453
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,380
I think all of us

1454
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,820
who love this country

1455
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,120
should be alerted

1456
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,460
that something is wrong

1457
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,040
in the land.

1458
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,060
Kind of like going up

1459
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,900
to Jackie Onassis

1460
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,180
with a rifle pendant on,

1461
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:11,420
you know?

1462
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,560
I was thinking of John,

1463
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,480
Jackie, we love him.

1464
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,480
Do me a favor,

1465
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,440
don't love me that much.

1466
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,300
Okay, get a hobby.

1467
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,440
His death is an incomplete story.

1468
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,480
The conspiracy report

1469
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,680
was an explanation,

1470
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,860
not a case.

1471
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,260
It was issued in 1979

1472
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,900
and by then the trail was cold.

1473
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,240
As cold as Kennedy's grave.

1474
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,960
No evidence was ever presented

1475
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,540
in court.

1476
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,900
No suspect ever indicted.

1477
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,580
The story of the conspiracy

1478
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,740
to assassinate President Kennedy

1479
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,680
serves nothing but history.

1480
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,840
History, like humanity,

1481
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,420
needs to have its history.

1482
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:55,840
It keeps filmed

1483
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:55,840


1484
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:55,840


1485
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,720
달라res and rears

1486
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:56,720


1487
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:56,720


1488
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,960
There has been a history

1489
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,240
of fully wymorbable

1490
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:22,700
human beings in колумб.

1491
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,080
Actually,

1492
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,240
Huh, must be my nose hairs or something.

1493
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,660
Don't f*** with Mommy, John John. Keep saluting or I'll nail your other hand to your forehead.

1494
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,380
What'd I do, Mom?

1495
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,960
Oh, Christ, I need a drink.

1496
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,880
Oh, hello. I'm your hostess, Ilona.

1497
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:54,120
Ilona. Ilona Sasson. And I'm here to explain to you the single bimbo theory.

1498
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:00,980
Oh, man, look at these nails. Huh. I gotta take a gemstone file to them.

1499
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:13,140
Ah, yes, as I was saying, the myriad pleasures of the godfather of all contemporary conspiracy theories, the JFK hit.

1500
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,380
Oh, you've all heard the coincidence or conspiracy bit.

1501
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:26,320
That old saw about Lincoln and Kennedy, how Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy, Kennedy's secretary was named Lincoln,

1502
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,200
and how Lincoln was once in Monroe, Maryland, and Kennedy was in Maryland, Monroe a lot.

1503
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,840
You know, that sort of stuff.

1504
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:42,260
Oh, but the JFK assassination mystique gets weirder the longer you soak in it.

1505
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:47,460
The unassailable truths of the situation are so damn weird that...

1506
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:54,000
The most deluniac crackpots are only following the trend set by the serious researchers.

1507
00:53:54,500 --> 00:54:02,560
The theory that JFK is still alive and hiding out with Elvis, that pales next to the documented stuff.

1508
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,420
Bizarre facts that even Oliver Stone missed.

1509
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:13,380
Like the creepy, hairless, chicken-hawk David Ferry's secret monkey virus labs.

1510
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,820
Or that guy on Air Force One winking.

1511
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,680
Or that guy on Air Force One winking at LBJ after the swearing-in.

1512
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,740
Or how one of my favorites, the fact that the Warren Commission's Stooge Gerald R. Ford

1513
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:34,500
just somehow happened to become our first unelected president ten years later.

1514
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:41,560
And yeah, now that I think of it, why the hell does assassination have two asses in it?

1515
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,560
Oh, and those are the real facts, too, if you can believe that.

1516
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,860
Oh, there's a lot of them.

1517
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:54,300
There are lots of juicy, tasty, conspiratorial nuggets to snack on here, but...

1518
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,160
Oh, let's not make a rush to fudge-mint seekers.

1519
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,360
After all, these goobers have already found thirteen of the three gunmen.

1520
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,940
Oh, just a second here.

1521
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,840
Hey, hey, Krasner!

1522
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,080
Paul, out of the coffin there, fucko!

1523
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,320
Yeah, you! That's an exit wound!

1524
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,620
Not an entrance!

1525
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:28,080
As I was saying, I'm personally steeped in the JFK world myself,

1526
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,900
and I've been stuck in it like a fly in amber for years.

1527
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:39,080
I've even had the dubious honor of seeing Lee Harvey Oswald's bedroom furniture

1528
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:43,160
at the Tragedy and U.S. History Museum in St. Augustine.

1529
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,380
Oh, and I can always be persuaded to attend the JFK,

1530
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,040
the JFK assassination symposia, when they're held in Dallas, that is.

1531
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:59,960
Oh, these JFK nut affairs are like sci-fi conventions, but with scarier geeks.

1532
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,820
Oh, and the excitement breaks out all over,

1533
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:08,740
because every clutch of theorists hates every other clutch of theorists,

1534
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,720
and pointless, hair-splitting intellectuals' catfights

1535
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,840
and embarrassingly pissy spats erupt in the lobby,

1536
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,340
and ballroom as lunatics collide.

1537
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,040
Oh, at that point, I gave up.

1538
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,260
I gave in to madness.

1539
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,740
Because when you stop disbelieving,

1540
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:33,520
isn't the path of a single bullet like a lyrical aerial ballet?

1541
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:41,940
Did the MK Ultra clone who played the part of Lee Harvey Oswald overact alone?

1542
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,720
Is Cary Thornley possibly the other boss?

1543
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,580
Bob, too?

1544
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,380
Hmm, I wouldn't discount it.

1545
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:59,760
But luckily, I have the rarefied ability to pass among the multi-layered strata of JFK buffs

1546
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,140
by treating them all like a bunch of bums in a strip club.

1547
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,460
Ooh, whoa!

1548
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:12,420
Hey, I'd better stop that tape right there before too much of that particular conspiracy is laid bare.

1549
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,780
Yeah, too much of that JFK stuff sure does get ugly.

1550
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,060
Ugly if you get exposed to it too much.

1551
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:26,940
Oh, yes, but what a huge, sprawling conspiracy it is.

1552
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,020
But you know, when you get down to brass tacks,

1553
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,560
they can't hold a candle to our hated conspiracy.

1554
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:40,100
Oh, and there's plenty of con to go around, too, Seekers.

1555
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,200
The real conspiracy.

1556
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,640
Not the piddling little penny-ante one.

1557
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,540
Tiny conspiracies like the Freemasons and the Illuminati.

1558
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,300
Oh, no.

1559
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:58,160
I'm not talking about pikers like the Trilateral Commission and the Elders of Zion.

1560
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,340
Oh, no, baby.

1561
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,620
These guys are like street-corner three-card Monty Uzzlers next to the real conspiracy.

1562
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:14,720
I'm talking about a conspiracy that has stretched back through the mildewed mist of time to Atlantis and beyond.

1563
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,040
A conspiracy.

1564
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:16,760
A conspiracy.

1565
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:16,760


1566
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,940
A conspiracy whose roots extend to the center of space and time.

1567
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,580
A conspiracy that is working night and day to steal your slack away.

1568
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,120
That's right, Seekers.

1569
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,640
The conspiracy.

1570
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,040
Need I say more?

1571
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:41,400
So, if you want to continue to poop and pee-dog in your own diaper for the love of Bob,

1572
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:46,760
you can always write for free information on what this lunacy is all about.

1573
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:54,320
Right now, if you want to read this book, just write to Bob at P.O. Box 181417.

1574
00:58:54,320 --> 00:59:08,220
You'll find him waiting for you at P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1575
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:15,560
And, oh, dear, now that I told you that, I'm afraid one of us has to die.

1576
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:16,760
I'm afraid one of us has to die.

1577
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1578
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1579
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1580
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1581
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1582
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1583
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1584
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1585
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1586
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1587
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1588
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1589
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1590
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1591
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1592
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1593
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1594
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1595
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:16,760


1596
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,440
Hey Flooz, I need you to pop something.

1597
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,020
Ah, jeez.

1598
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,360
Well, plenty more where that came from.
