1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:08,740
Greetings, my friend. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,500
And remember, my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,560
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:29,580
That is why you are here. And now, for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,740
On that fateful day, we are giving you all the evidence based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,040
The incidents, the places. My friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer.

7
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,600
Let us punish the guilty. Let us reward the innocent.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,660
My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts about...

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,440
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,740
Power. We have vast power.

11
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:27,900
Power. At least 120 volts of pure electrical power.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,480
And now all we need is 100 million volts of pure, unadulterated pleasure.

13
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,840
Another one?

14
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,200
I have appetite.

15
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,200
Hungers.

16
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,900
Needs like anyone else.

17
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,580
I must perforce indulge my...

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,820
May the pleasures hang.

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,220
As best I can.

20
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,320
Did not Bob say,

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,700
Do what keepeth thou from wilting shall be the loophole in the law?

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,740
Am I to let myself wilt, Bob?

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:29,520
Can I open if my idea of slack is against all laws of God, man, and nature?

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,560
Let it be so.

25
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:40,020
Well, um, there is no question that a cosmic interloper will hit the earth,

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,700
and we won't have to wait for millions of years for it to happen.

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,860
In 1908, a 200-foot-wide comet fragment slammed into the atmosphere

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,340
and exploded over the Taunguska region in Siberia, Russia,

29
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,580
with nearly a thousand times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

30
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,520
Astronomers estimate similar sized events occur every one to three centuries

31
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,300
So hang out folks for another century

32
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,960
And you too can join George Bush looking up at the skies

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,760
And yelling and screaming about things that he can't change

34
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,180
Raging impotently in impotent rage

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,600
Yes, impacts of large objects from space hitting us

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,920
Have repeatedly disrupted human civilization

37
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,980
One killed 10,000 people in the Chinese city of Qingyang in 1490

38
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,380
Many scientists request to repeat these interpretations

39
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,640
Impacts are most likely to occur over the ocean

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,160
And small ones that happen over land are most likely to affect unpopulated areas

41
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,880
But with big asteroids it doesn't matter much where they land

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,240
Objects more than half a mile wide

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,620
Which strike Earth every 250,000 years

44
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:57,900
Or so

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,580
Touch off fire storms

46
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,940
Followed by global cooling

47
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,760
From the prior dust

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,720
Humans would likely survive

49
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,300
But civilization might not

50
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,020
An asteroid five miles wide would cause major extinctions

51
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,800
Like the one that may have marked the end of the age of the dinosaurs

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,660
Look at all that coffee

53
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,080
For a real chill

54
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,180
Just look to the Kuiper Belt

55
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,660
A zone just beyond Neptune

56
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,700
George Bush is swimming

57
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,320
And contains roughly 100,000 giant ice blocks

58
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,160
More than 50 miles in diameter each

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,640
The Kuiper Belt sends a steady rain

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,040
Small comets earthward

61
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,720
If one of the big ones headed right for us

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,080
That would be it for pretty much all higher forms of life

63
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,940
And the local team who wanted to go to Burning Man

64
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,660
Will never get there because a meteorite's gonna wreck everything

65
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,760
But it doesn't require a meteorite

66
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,340
For example, there could be a massive gamma ray bursting

67
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,680
That would be a huge amount of energy

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,940
And sufficiently extinguish all life on Earth

69
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,220
If you could watch the sky with gamma ray vision

70
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,260
You might think you are being stalked by cosmic paparazzi

71
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,880
Once a day or so, you'd see a bright flash appear

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,980
Briefly outshine everything else, then vanish

73
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,540
These are gamma ray bursts

74
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,540
Astrophysicists recently learned about these babies

75
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,660
They originate in distant places

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,400
Galaxies

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,060
And are unfathomably powerful

78
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,320
As much as 10 quadrillion

79
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,320
That's a one followed by 16 zeros

80
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,820
Times as energetic as our sun

81
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,800
Sol

82
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,520
Head of the heating system

83
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,020
Look, here's the big head

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,840
Did you hear the theory about how

85
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,900
If aliens come here

86
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,760
That they're probably already here

87
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,620
In a microbial form

88
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,320
And that they're going to

89
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,900
In intelligent form too

90
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,640
And that they're gonna take over

91
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,440
Through the internet

92
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,140
The world wide web

93
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,500
That they're just

94
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,980
Not microbial

95
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,540
I mean they're

96
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:10,900
What do you mean?

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,480
Nano

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,500
They're like nano

99
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,420
Nano virals

100
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:13,940
Aliens

101
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,440
Oh man, how could you be

102
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,160
In digital life form though

103
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,480
It's required to form the physical body

104
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,280
That we know as Bill Gates

105
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,120
God, just think of all the

106
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,560
How many microbes

107
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,540
And how they hold themselves together

108
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,000
Into a semblance of a

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,860
Of a human-like thing

110
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,320
That breathes and talks

111
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,040
Probably even eats

112
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,560
Peanut butter cup, Dave?

113
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,540
No, no thanks

114
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,400
I was gonna have some

115
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,040
Swarthy tumor juice over there

116
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,100
And then also a piece of

117
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,060
Hemlock pie

118
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,860
And I see the reverend

119
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,440
Brought his Slim Fast with him

120
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,980
You gotta drink coffee

121
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,060
You have to drink

122
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,520
Three or four of those every day

123
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,880
Now why would a man of your

124
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,740
Of your small

125
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,200
Not your girth

126
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,720
Wanna have a Slim Fast

127
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,620
For lunch or breakfast?

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,560
Because

129
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,760
Not as a commercial message

130
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,980
I can't suck down

131
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:56,980


132
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,660
The blood of a newborn kitten

133
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,580
Every hour like I would like to

134
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,020
So I have to suck down

135
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,920
One of these damn

136
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,680
Humanoid drinks

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,760
Well that

138
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,160
It's for the protein

139
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,720
I have to have protein

140
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,840
To balance the sugar and caffeine

141
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,380
Well I think

142
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,760
So I

143
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,360
So therefore I have to

144
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,980
Eat nuts or

145
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,860
Frop or some

146
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,220
Some other form of protein

147
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,180
Nuts and frops

148
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,760
And other colloquialistic terms

149
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,180
For human bodies

150
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,660
When you crunch off the tops

151
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,160
Of their heads

152
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,860
And dig right in

153
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,260
Into that

154
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,520
Fleshy medulla

155
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,180
Froplop

156
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,880
Zips of tops

157
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,400
Have you ever

158
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,140
Sliced a brain

159
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,920
So what do you think about that?

160
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,600
Aliens and nano-aliens

161
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,000
Well I was trying to ask you

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,420
A question

163
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,360
How could they make

164
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,220
My biotic form

165
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,040
Become digital

166
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,780
From a digital form

167
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,520
Actually boys

168
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,020
What's that mean?

169
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,680
The nano-aliens

170
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,120
That you're talking about Chaz

171
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,220
Are in fact

172
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,320
The WOM supercomputer

173
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,000
Predicted by J.R. Bob Dobbs

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,920
Described in

175
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,740
Not very much detail

176
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,980
In either of the

177
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,640
Bobbles

178
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,580
So to speak

179
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,560
This WOM supercomputer

180
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,680
Is actually

181
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,360
Like a zillion

182
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,200
Billion

183
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,860
Nano-alien creatures

184
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,920
Which

185
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,580
What is?

186
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,020
Or creature

187
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,360
Nano-creatures

188
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,140
They're artificial

189
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,700

Yes

626
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,780
Alright

Been

Rather

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,420
The

Whoa

798
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,020

It's

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,420
About

the female alone. Caution to the wind. The eyes glaze. The glands swell and the brain freezes.

824
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,120
Breeding is an ugly thing. I didn't bring you down here so they could use you. I brought you

825
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,940
down here so I could use you. I am gone. I need your body as a dwelling place while I am here

826
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:18,520
on your earth. Your feeling of helplessness is your best friend, Savage. When I am occupying

your body or in my present transitory form, I am without substance and indestructible. You can

828
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:32,300
help me save the earth from a terrible experience. Yes, the whole earth. There is absolutely no doubt

829
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:40,120
of your power to destroy. I saw it. I saw an American colonel killed, burned to a crisp by

830
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:47,180
radiation with one look from this man. Feels like you got a real monster in there. You fool!

831
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,480
You fool!

832
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,400
You're feeding him human brains. You're making him strong. All I remember is feeling something

833
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,440
sticky in my pants. Yeah, but when it comes to blood in my underwear, I want to know how it got

834
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,580
there. You sucked out her brains? Yeah, right through her mouth. Is she dead? Of course she's

835
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,200
dead. What, are you kidding? Laugh for while you can, monkey boy. I don't know if anybody read the

836
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:17,640
Kurt Vonnegut book, Cat's Cradle. Sorry, gotta talk like this. He popularized the idea of Ice Nine,

837
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,460
which is a movie about a man who is a monster. He's a monster. He's a monster. He's a monster.

838
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,580
He's a monster. He's a monster. He's a monster. He's a monster. He's a monster. He's a monster. He's a monster.

839
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,520
A form of water that is more stable than the ordinary kind of water, and so it's solid at

840
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,160
room temperature. If you unleash a bit of it, then suddenly all water on earth transforms to Ice Nine

841
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:37,400
and freezes solid. Well, Ice Nine was a satirical invention, but an abrupt, disastrous phase

842
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,860
transition is a possibility. He's not the phase transition again? Very early in the history of

843
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,840
the universe, according to a leading cosmological model, empty space was full of energy.

844
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,400
This state of affairs called a false vacuum was completely precarious.

845
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,860
Thank you, DigiLady.

846
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,080
A more stable type of vacuum appeared, and like Ice Nine, it quickly took over.

847
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,780
You've got more show than most, Michael.

848
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,040
This transition unleashed a tremendous amount of energy.

849
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,880
Disengage.

850
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,020
A runaway explosion and expansion of the cosmos.

851
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,560
It is possible that another, even more stable kind of vacuum exists.

852
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,960
As the universe expands and cools tiny bubbles.

853
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,100
Messages.

854
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,160
Of this new kind of vacuum might appear.

855
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,860
Bye, DigiLady.

856
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,520
They would spread at nearly the speed of light.

857
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,180
So the funeral of the DigiLady at the bottom of the elevator shaft was hell.

858
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,700
And a blast of energy would dash everything to bits.

859
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,160
And her body was transported to the roof garden for a wake.

860
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:42,100
However, this is considered somewhat theoretical and not as dangerous as the menace of rogue black holes

861
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,800
passing near our solar system.

862
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,940
Yes, it's possible.

863
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,620
It's possible that these rogue black holes could deform our orbital path around our star

864
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,420
and even send the Earth itself into freezing outer space and darkness.

865
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
That'd be okay. It'd be new.

866
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,120
And isn't everything new, like new experience, a good thing?

867
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,600
Well, black holes have been around since the beginning of the formation of the cosmos.

868
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
What about Rodney McDowell?

869
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,520
The whole galaxy has held black holes.

870
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,120
He's been around since the beginning of time and space.

871
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,580
Like a piece of Swiss cheese.

872
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,300
He was playing the TVs before the negatives were wooden.

873
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,440
They are...

874
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,400
A collapsed stellar...

875
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,180
Oh, jeez, not again.

876
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,660
Just a dozen miles...

877
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,340
Every time you talk about that, it happens.

878
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,660
How full of tough questions...

879
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,000
There it goes.

880
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,700
Whole societies going down the drain just because hell had to bring up collapsed systems.

881
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,100
They're called black holes for a reason.

882
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,000
They call them black holes...

883
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,040
Well, I guess it's kind of...

884
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,820
You know, whatever's fair.

885
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,320
If 100,000 civilizations had to die so you could hear us do this show, I guess that's okay.

886
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,140
You see, their gravity is so strong that they swallow everything.

887
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,280
While their comedy is so negative...

888
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,900
That they are unobserved by science.

889
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Yeah, never mind.

890
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,080
It's just a black hole.

891
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,920
Never mind.

892
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,400
Even the light that might betray their presence is routinely sucked into a black hole.

893
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,100
Anybody here?

894
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,560
No.

895
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,220
No societies are dying here.

896
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,700
You can go now.

897
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,380
I like my coffee like I like my black holes.

898
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,760
Don't worry.

899
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Everything's just fine.

900
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,740
Well, there are about 10 million black holes in the Milky Way.

901
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,260
I don't want to hear any snickers.

902
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,700
Hershey observed.

903
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,000
The observatory confirmed this.

904
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,920
And the Clark Observatory also.

905
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,000
God, the collar hung up.

906
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,360
The creamy nougat surrounding the caramel coating.

907
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:37,740
So, you see, the black hole could distort the orbital mechanics of the entire solar system very easily by being a powerful attractor.

908
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,280
Only because you keep bringing it up.

909
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,320
But even that seems a more complicated mechanism.

910
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,400
And we should always look for a simpler...

911
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,780
...way for us to be annihilated.

912
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,380
And that is probably from a giant solar flare.

913
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,320
I think you're talking about pizza by the slice.

914
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,640
They get huge, you know.

915
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,740
They get bigger than ever seen.

916
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,680
It smothers out all life.

917
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,540
Of course, these solar flares, probably known as coronal mass ejections...

918
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,480
I think it could happen.

919
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:12,240
...are enormous magnetic outbursts on the sun that bombard Earth with a torrent of high-speed subatomic particles.

920
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,120
What if the Captain Crunch peanut butter one factory went crazy and started making too much?

921
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,280
Earth's atmosphere.

922
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,200
And it smothered the Earth...

923
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,940
...negate the potentially lethal effects of ordinary flares.

924
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,580
But while looking through old astronomical records...

925
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,220
Not the fruity one, but the peanut butter one.

926
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:33,880
...worried scientists found evidence that some perfectly normal-looking sunlight stars can brighten up briefly by up to a factor of 20.

927
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,760
These stellar flickers are caused by superflare.

928
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,020
Millions of times more powerful than their common cousins.

929
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,700
Within a few hours, a superflare on the sun could fry Earth.

930
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,180
Ow.

931
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,680
And begin to...

932
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:46,680


933
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:46,680


934
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,400
...again disintegrating the ozone layer.

935
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:48,880
Not again.

936
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,000
Although there is persuasive evidence that our sun doesn't engage in such antics,

937
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,300
scientists don't know why superflares happen at all.

938
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,580
Or whether our sun could exhibit milder...

939
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,620
Could.

940
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,500
...but still disruptive autistic behavior.

941
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,520
And while too much solar activity could be deadly, too little of it is problematic as well.

942
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,660
And so, the sun could become not brighter, but nearly 1% dimmer.

943
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:16,660


944
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,180
It might not sound like much, but a similar downturn in the sun could send us into another ice age.

945
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,180
We'd freeze to death.

946
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:36,280
There is evidence that decreased solar activity contributed to 17 of the 19 major cold episodes on Earth in the last 10,000 years,

947
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,420
as freezing night descends on the lunar surface of the playa.

948
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,620
...

949
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,940
...

950
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,960
...

951
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,360
...

952
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,640
...

953
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


954
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


955
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


956
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


957
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


958
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


959
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


960
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


961
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


962
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


963
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


964
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,640


965
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,660
...

966
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:46,660


967
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:46,660


968
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,820
...

969
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,460
...

970
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,820
Did you hear about the sun activity, too?

971
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,820
The sun is like going through like a total peak time right now.

972
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,960
Yeah, George Jr. is really...

973
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,660
He's as popular as the father was.

974
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,680
But it is.

975
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,540
There's like a website.

976
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,340
It flares up a lot, I've heard.

977
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,260
There's like a...

978
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:10,900
God, what's this?

979
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,680
There's a website.

980
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,160
Flare, that's just...

981
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,380
They're more like little pubescent rockets than flares.

982
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,060
It's a really cool website, too.

983
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,660
...

984
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,520
That's all about it.

985
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,960
You can get a real-time sun screensaver now.

986
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,120
I would love one of those.

987
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,180
You used to put up four or five different pictures of the sun.

988
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,160
I should have sent it here.

989
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,300
We quit doing that because it was so disturbing.

990
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,960
It appeared that huge, gigantic shotguns were blasting away at the sun about half the time.

991
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,380
I think those were Masonic subliminals from the Masonics

992
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,000
who are running the NASA corporations.

993
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,340
The engine that creates all warmth for the whole solar system

994
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,940
is having a little trouble right now, did you say?

995
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,700
Supposedly.

996
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,260
It's more than a little trouble.

997
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,940
Now, could this possibly be the coming of prophecy,

998
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,260
of all the prophecies of every primitive form of humanoid?

999
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,260
When your mom and dad and everyone who you don't even know

1000
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,040
is going to want to crash firmly onto,

1001
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,020
as it's so loose,

1002
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,460
in the sky,

1003
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,620
like a burning lantern?

1004
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,920
That all things, that the great carpet of reality

1005
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,640
would be rolled up,

1006
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,040
taken outside, hung over a tree limb,

1007
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,480
and batted by a gigantic old hag

1008
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,580
with a broom standing on the back of an infinite number of turtles.

1009
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,400
And that she would spray it with an anti-lice sort of lotion potion?

1010
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,460
Right, and then it would be rolled,

1011
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,780
laid back down,

1012
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,520
and all things would begin anew

1013
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,140
in the new,

1014
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:45,760
the new age.

1015
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,780
Or the new,

1016
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:48,700
um,

1017
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,240
I forget the...

1018
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,560
Well, how about...

1019
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,740
The new Navajo Trail.

1020
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,000
The new Navajo Trail?

1021
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,380
The new Navajo Trail.

1022
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,840
In the Church of the Subgeniuses...

1023
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,140
That leads off into the cosmos.

1024
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,100
These silly primitive superstitions are understood in a scientific way

1025
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,500
as the time intersection,

1026
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,520
which will happen when the great Mobius strip

1027
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,880
or infinity sign that is the road of time...

1028
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,280
It has to cross in the middle, right?

1029
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,940
Well, we're nearing that cross.

1030
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,720
That's the number point.

1031
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:15,960
Yeah.

1032
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,200
See, I can repeat that.

1033
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,780
I wanna set up a little deli right there at that crossroad.

1034
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,020
Chad Spankengold.

1035
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,040
People are gonna say,

1036
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,360
well, what are you gonna do if them X's don't come on X Day?

1037
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:24,580
A little general story.

1038
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,780
It's like, well, I think the X's are kinda wondering what the hell's gonna happen when

1039
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,640
the time intersection occurs.

1040
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,680
Listener!

1041
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,420
So what are you doing about it?

1042
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,960
Are you ready?

1043
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,340
So what are you doing about it?

1044
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,340


1045
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,060
Go last year.

1046
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,160
You was ready for Y2K.

1047
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,580
Hey, hey, stop playing with the machine.

1048
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,520
All their liquor's stored up, their froth was stored up for Y2K.

1049
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,260
Now, they're not worried about nothing.

1050
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,200
They ain't worried about X Day.

1051
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,160
They ain't worried about time intersection, about the fine rupture.

1052
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,320
They don't care about nothing.

1053
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,960
About time.

1054
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,280
They're gonna get drunk and party.

1055
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:52,820
Time doesn't exist.

1056
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,860
Why should it?

1057
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,900
And how can it?

1058
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,540
They're just gonna get drunk.

1059
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,200
Softly.

1060
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:57,960
Softly.

1061
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,160
RG's about radio.

1062
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,220
You think we're gonna go out there and keep drunk?

1063
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,460
I know you.

1064
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:03,920
I see you up from up here.

1065
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,180
You know CHS will come on top of your brain now.

1066
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,520
Well, buddy, you know.

1067
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,080
They don't cut no ice with me.

1068
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,120
Speaking of ice cutters.

1069
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,040
I don't hear them in the front dress.

1070
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,180
Hey, you remember, you remember the time intersection?

1071
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,180


1072
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,180


1073
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,180


1074
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:21,060
Remember the time Jack and I were out and we were so far, damn far out there that when

1075
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,960
we dug the hole, you know, and stuck the-

1076
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,280
Squid gigging?

1077
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,280
We were squid gigging and we stuck the little shack over the top of the little hole in the

1078
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,360
ice, you know, and we're sitting there popping back a few beer, you know, and I guess one

1079
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,160
guy, this guy, you know, he's talking about Mario Lemieux and all this hockey crap all

1080
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,400
night.

1081
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,640
And I says, I don't like hockey, you know, so I pull this little like harpoon device

1082
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,100
I got.

1083
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,620
You know, it's about four and a half inches long.

1084
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,160
You get it from the top.

1085
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,340
You can order away for it.

1086
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,440
And I shove it right into his thigh and rip those, you know, those real thick muscles

1087
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,760
near the top of his knee, you know.

1088
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,080
You're a prankster, Dave.

1089
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,040
I tell you, we had a good laugh after that.

1090
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,540
We had years and years of stories about that.

1091
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,920
And I guess, well, it got him a little railed up, you know.

1092
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,900
So did he kill you then now, Dave?

1093
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,960
I think I know where the nano aliens live.

1094
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,480
What do you think of me?

1095
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,760
Why, they're the leprechauns.

1096
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,080
Who's that guy?

1097
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,000
Celtic legend.

1098
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,100
They're the wee folk?

1099
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,680
Pink penises, red hearts and purple...

1100
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,840
Dave brains.

1101
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,720
Brains.

1102
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:30,700
Frolicking over the hillsides of Emery, Emerald Isle, Emerald Palace, Emerald City.

1103
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,920
Emerald mushrooms.

1104
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,320
That dirty, perky, sharka-packed, black, bunka-murtin, we wantin' Philip Bunka-Murtin,

1105
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,380
perkaluma-burton, bunka-murtin, don't you watch tonight.

1106
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,700
Well, then, of course, there's the

1107
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,060
The Big Bang Theory.

1108
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,060


1109
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,060


1110
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,060


1111
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,060


1112
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,520
The possibility of the sudden and unexpected reversal of Earth's magnetic field.

1113
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,360
It could happen.

1114
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,700
Yes, indeed.

1115
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,560
The North and South Poles could flip and then flop.

1116
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,160
The last Dutch reversal was 780,000 years ago in early October.

1117
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,700
So we may be overdue for another one.

1118
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,820
Worse, the strength of our magnetic field has decreased about 5% in the past century.

1119
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,060
It's a whole lot.

1120
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,560
It's a monster name.

1121
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,240
Why worry in an age when GPS has made compasses obsolete?

1122
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,520
Well, the magnetic field deflects particle storms and cosmic rays from sun, as well as

1123
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,060
even more energetic subatomic particles from deep space.

1124
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,220
He keeps talking, but look, monster.

1125
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,540
Without our typical magnetic shield, these particles would ping into us and strike

1126
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,640
Earth's atmosphere, eroding the already beleaguered beagle of the ozone layer.

1127
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,960
Well, there's always a guy that keeps talking, and then there's the monster.

1128
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,980
It gets a negativefy, but then says, monster, wallop, and then you're dead.

1129
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:45,980


1130
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,420
Well, what is he expected to do?

1131
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,120
Gronk!

1132
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,600
Gronk!

1133
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,440
That stamp.

1134
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,020
That snort?

1135
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,980
Yeah, that comes then, after he keeps talking, then MONSTER DESTROY CITY!

1136
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,780
We had evidence of such a monster before.

1137
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,120
It happened many thousand of years ago.

1138
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,800
Hmmm…

1139
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,460
That little Mimico.

1140
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,080
Here is Mimico's original burial…

1141
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,800
Many creatures navigate by magnetic reckoning.

1142
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,940
A magnetic reversal might cause these giant monsters to be confused, and why should I

1143
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:14,940


1144
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:14,940


1145
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:14,940


1146
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:14,940


1147
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,740
wander about aimlessly, bumping into each other.

1148
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,900
Oh, excuse me.

1149
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,560
There are no identifiable fossil effects from previous flops and flips.

1150
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,840
This is most curious.

1151
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,520
But still, a disaster that kills a quarter of the population like the Black Plague in Europe

1152
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,320
would hardly register as little old blip in the fossil record.

1153
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,040
Teeny-weeny.

1154
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,620
What a fright!

1155
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,380
I can smell it back!

1156
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,160
I can smell it back!

1157
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,540
I can smell it back!

1158
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,480
I can smell it back!

1159
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,340
I figured, you know, I just needed some help.

1160
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,000
I ordered my body.

1161
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,240
Within 11 days, I had lost my waist and my hips.

1162
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,080
Today, I'm wearing those pants about a year and a half now.

1163
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,320
My kids aren't hurting me anymore.

1164
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,520
My knees at my face and definitely in my stomach and my legs.

1165
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,800
It's incredible.

1166
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,700
So what are you waiting for?

1167
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,320
622-1800-622-NOW and receive $25 supplies.

1168
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,180
You'll also receive the book, Lose Sleep While You Sleep, free with your 622-46.

1169
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,680
2-6-8-4-2-4-6.

1170
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,700
And now...

1171
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,900
Hi, I'm looking mighty good there.

1172
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,360
Ooh, yeah.

1173
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,240
I injured my rotator gears ago.

1174
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,780
What happened?

1175
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,300
Finally, it's not bothering me anymore.

1176
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,180
Well, thanks.

1177
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,820
I used to struggle on my knees.

1178
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,440
On my knees.

1179
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,060
On my knees.

1180
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,640
On my knees.

1181
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,260
On my knees.

1182
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,960
On my knees.

1183
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,620
On my knees.

1184
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,140
On my knees.

1185
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,120
Low.

1186
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,720
Low.

1187
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:34,820
Low.

1188
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:35,620
Low.

1189
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,120
Well, thanks.

1190
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,720
You're fine.

1191
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:58,760
In 1783, the Lakey Volcano in Iceland erupted, spitting out three cubic miles of lava.

1192
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,740
Floods, ash, and fumes wiped out 9,000 people and 80% of the livestock.

1193
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,480
The ensuing starvation killed a quarter of Iceland's population.

1194
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,460
Atmospheric dust caused winter temperatures.

1195
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,920
The

1196
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:39,600
lakey eruption caused a quarter-cubic million miles of lava.

1197
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,280
That's the Lakey eruption.

1198
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,300
The lakey eruption, 100,000 times as large.

1199
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,840
Some scientists still say that this, not an asteroid, killed the dinosaurs.

1200
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,840
An earlier, even larger event in Siberia occurred just about the time of the Permian Triassic

1201
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,100
extinction, the most thorough extermination known to paleontology.

1202
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,920
At that time, 95% of all species were wiped out.

1203
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,880
Sulfurous, stinking volcanic gases produce acid rain.

1204
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:22,820
In 2016, an entire carrier of hydroxychloriance capable of leaving for Earth was affected

1205
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,940
by an annuallyдуctrinated plant.

1206
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,500
This eventdaily war has began to lack and make way for a priority in the environment.

1207
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,900
While the 피AC's

1208
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,760
with large CO2umeres

1209
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:27,760


1210
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:27,760


1211
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,300
and ofte

1212
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:38,880
I think that is the only thing I want to know.

1213
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,320
The last big pulse of flood basalt volcanism built the Columbia River Plateau about 17 million years ago.

1214
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,620
We're ripe.

1215
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,140
Look at the size of it.

1216
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,920
Yes, friends, we are ripe indeed.

1217
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,840
Ripe to throw that loaf of this planet overboard.

1218
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:05,620
And we've been listening to, well, it's been kind of an unusual hour of slack in that a couple of things fell into my lap

1219
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:17,300
and it suddenly turned into an end-of-the-world show starring the KPFA subgenius show from around 9-2000

1220
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:24,760
with Dr. Howell Robbins going on and on about the end and the various ways we can meet it

1221
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,100
and puzzling evidence filling in the blanks.

1222
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,560
And, of course, friends, as always, a lot of Einstein's Secret Orchestra swamp radio

1223
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,600
from TV.

1224
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,880
WCSB in Cleveland with Professor Chaz Smith dances with rockets.

1225
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,220
A lonesome Cowboy Dave and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1226
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:50,740
And the clips and little media barrage bits that we've been hearing in between are by our friend New Monet,

1227
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,360
Saint New Monet, who posted those on all binary slack.

1228
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,360
Friends, we'll see you at www.subgenius.com.

1229
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,120
But hurry, because it's all coming to a close so very, very quickly.

1230
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,060
How are you?

1231
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,500
How are you?

1232
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,720
Well, we could be killed by global epidemics because if the Earth doesn't do us in,

1233
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,080
our fellow organisms might be up to the task.

1234
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,780
Germs and people have always coexisted, but occasionally the balance gets out of whack.

1235
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,880
Like when they had the Black Plague killing one European in four during the 14th century.

1236
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,420
Influenza took at least 20 million lives between 1918 and 1919.

1237
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:41,580
Now we got the AIDS epidemic producing a similar death toll and still going strong.

1238
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,540
From 1990 to 1992, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

1239
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:53,860
mortality from infectious disease in the United States rose like a balloon, 58%.

1240
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:59,180
And meanwhile, old diseases like cholera and measles are coming back.

1241
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:05,400
They've developed resistance to all the high-tech drugs we've been throwing their way.

1242
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:13,000
Intensive agriculture and land development is bringing humans closer to animal pathogens

1243
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,440
and stinky germs that rest in huge mounds of animal feces cast off from factory farms

1244
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,800
where giant chickens meet a hideous fate.

1245
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,000
There was nice giant chickens too.

1246
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,220
They was the ones in the commercials.

1247
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:35,400
The grimest possibility would be the emergence of a strain that spreads so fast we are caught off guard.

1248
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,120
That resists all chemical means of control.

1249
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,260
Perhaps as a result of our stirring the ecological pot.

1250
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Damn it. It's our fault again.

1251
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,980
Thank you.

1252
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,580
It's the Our Fault Show.

1253
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,020
Join us, won't you, on ourfault.org.

1254
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,040
It's like a saloon in the Dave brain.

1255
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,160
It's like an old western saloon in there.

1256
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,320
It's always 2001.

1257
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,020
Except for 2001.

1258
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:13,740
Right.

1259
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,240
But it's 1888 and, you know, like, it's like an old...

1260
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,100
It's 1888 and 2001.

1261
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,320
At the same time.

1262
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,100
And the year 2328.

1263
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,760
There's them like Lily, you know, type prostitute dancer girls around and cowboys...

1264
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,480
The year 5449 is in there.

1265
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,900
Well, of course.

1266
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,300
That's the saloon at the end of time.

1267
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,240
The saloon at the time intersection.

1268
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,380
Where Dave meets every archetype of Dave.

1269
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,820
From throughout history.

1270
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,280
The transvestite hooker with a heart of gold.

1271
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,700
Dave Visa.

1272
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,280
Or Dave Vess.

1273
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,960
The crooked mayor Dave.

1274
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,020
The rich developer Dave.

1275
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,120
All in the saloon at the end of the universe.

1276
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,300
The starship captain handsome Dave.

1277
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,220
The saddled cryptid.

1278
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,280
The abyssal lawyer in a wheelchair.

1279
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,480
Dave.

1280
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,460
Recently developed.

1281
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,280
The best man in the saloon of life.

1282
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,160
What do you have partner?

1283
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,300
What do you have?

1284
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,940
You there.

1285
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,660
Partner with the one eye pointed down.

1286
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,480
The other one pointed.

1287
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,600
What do you have?

1288
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,660
I'll have a thyme, I'll have a thyme...

1289
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,420
I mean a sarsaparilla, sir.

1290
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
Hey, we don't serve no sarsaparilla in the old...

1291
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,200


1292
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,200


1293
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,200


1294
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,340
St. Louis sissies around here.

1295
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,560
You can drink a man's drink

1296
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,280
or you walk out there in the street

1297
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,700
and get shot down by him.

1298
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,620
And at the moment that they...

1299
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,380
The inhabitants of the

1300
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,420
cosmic saloon did not even notice

1301
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,360
the passage of the time intersection.

1302
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,100
But everything

1303
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,340
had changed.

1304
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,180
And when they walked outside, the circus

1305
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,800
of Dr. Lowe was just

1306
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,780
arriving.

1307
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,920
Now our fans and tankers

1308
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,640
may instead

1309
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,800
laugh, laugh, laugh

1310
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,740
laughing clowns.

1311
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,060
And Sheriff Grumley was...

1312
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,860
The Yeti jumped,

1313
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,120
the sideshow Yeti

1314
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,380
broke free from its chains, ran

1315
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,340
into the crowd and carried off the

1316
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,120
spinster repressed

1317
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,500
Bridget Librarian.

1318
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,420
He and Pan, having a three-way

1319
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,240
with her, turned her on.

1320
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,820
And then the stupid,

1321
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,200
ignorant, racist rednecks

1322
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,780
while getting

1323
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,520
the local town

1324
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,220
survived.

1325
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,760
The Indian to dance

1326
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,940
accidentally knocked over the

1327
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,760
fishbowl containing the infant

1328
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
Loch Ness monster, which

1329
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,920
grew to gigantic size,

1330
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,520
chased the man into a giant flaming

1331
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,700
cathedral where they

1332
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,620
threw spears at him until

1333
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,460
they traded to James Franciscus and it

1334
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:51,820
died.

1335
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,180
And so we learn that

1336
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,580
nature, in its infinite

1337
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,100
wisdom, mocks man

1338
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,440
with his puny pride.

1339
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Nature, which holds us in its

1340
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,560
tender grip, its mercies, its gentle

1341
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,740
cradle until we've approached the

1342
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,480
moment of wisdom.

1343
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,220
At which time it turns its hand down

1344
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,340
and its cold, icy stare

1345
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,360
out of it.

1346
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,220
And so we know that Godzilla will be back

1347
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,880
again

1348
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,040
to teach man a lesson.

1349
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,600
Only this time

1350
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,920
he will

1351
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,620
he will come to man

1352
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,420
in the form of a friendly little

1353
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,560
puppy named Joy Boy.

1354
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,860
We have already seen these things.

1355
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,060
Dr. Panaram and Dr. Patel and I have

1356
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,720
spent hours and hours in mystic dreaming.

1357
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,540
And this is our prediction.

1358
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,500
That not only will the white buffalo return,

1359
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,340
but the cute little puppy will be the messiah of mankind.

1360
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,100
Oh man.

1361
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,080
That's a lousy prediction.

1362
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,360
Then there's global warming.

1363
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,800
Forget what the Republicans say.

1364
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,300
The Earth is getting warmer.

1365
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,620
And scientists are saying

1366
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:03,620


1367
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:03,620


1368
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:03,620


1369
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:03,620


1370
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,860
that scientists mostly agree that the humans

1371
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,500
are directly responsible.

1372
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,420
Damn humies.

1373
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,320
It's easy to see how global warming

1374
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,340
could flood cities, ruin harvests,

1375
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,980
and more recently

1376
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,660
researchers have raised the alarm

1377
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,840
that a balmy planet

1378
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,320
could also assist the spread of

1379
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,360
infectious disease

1380
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,380
by providing a more suitable climate

1381
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,180
for hideous parasites

1382
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,240
that bore into your skin

1383
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,880
and tune their way right to your heart.

1384
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,840
Arrrr.

1385
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:33,760
Heart.

1386
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,620
At present, atmospheric gases

1387
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,620
trap enough local heat

1388
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,600
close to the surface

1389
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,820
to keep things comfy,

1390
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,340
but increase the global temperature a bit

1391
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,880
and there could be a bad feedback effect

1392
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,240
with water evaporating faster

1393
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,240
right in your face.

1394
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,880
Freezing water vapor,

1395
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,500
a potent greenhouse gas

1396
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,160
which traps more heat

1397
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,780
which drives carbon dioxide from the rocks

1398
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,260
which drives temperatures still higher.

1399
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,220
Earth could end up much like

1400
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,040
Venus,

1401
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,280
where the high on a typical day

1402
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,200
is a sizzling 900 degrees Fahrenheit.

1403
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,640
Again?

1404
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,580
It would probably take a lot of warming

1405
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,620
to initiate such a runaway greenhouse effect,

1406
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,360
but scientists have no clue

1407
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,680
where exactly the tipping point lies.

1408
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,260
I'm into that panorama.

1409
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,040
What do you mean they have no clue?

1410
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,340
They're smart guys.

1411
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,000
They are smart, but they don't know

1412
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,780
because this is a situation

1413
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,720
which has never been experienced before.

1414
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,840
Earlier today,

1415
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:41,220
Chaz was giving a sort of a trance lecture

1416
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,480
about the range from

1417
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,940
the protoplasmic beginnings

1418
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,200
of all life

1419
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,080
to space exploration.

1420
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,260
And this lovely dome here

1421
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,560
is certainly a good place

1422
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,660
to think about that

1423
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,580
because if we're not lucky

1424
00:40:59,580 --> 00:40:59,700
and we're not able to do it,

1425
00:40:59,700 --> 00:40:59,700


1426
00:40:59,700 --> 00:40:59,700


1427
00:40:59,700 --> 00:40:59,700


1428
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,180
all of our descendants will live inside

1429
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,300
little buffer domes like this

1430
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,560
because there won't be

1431
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,540
the right kind of air outside.

1432
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,180
And if we are lucky...

1433
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,040
Ah, yes!

1434
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,200
Oh, baby!

1435
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,700
Do that again!

1436
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,660
I say!

1437
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,660
Oh, I say!

1438
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,400
Oh, hit me one more time, please, darling.

1439
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,080
Oh, oh, oh.

1440
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,680
You know,

1441
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,480
if you increase the oxygen

1442
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,540
in here too much,

1443
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,480
a spark like that

1444
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,620
can cause an explosion.

1445
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,340
We don't be fried like those poor brave astronauts

1446
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,700
on one of those ill-fated missions.

1447
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,340
Turn up the oxygen, man!

1448
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,320
On the other hand,

1449
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,680
if you turn the oxygen up,

1450
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,600
you get kind of high.

1451
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,200
Well, let it sleep first!

1452
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:53,960
Aww.

1453
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,480
We'll box on those.

1454
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,380
Anybody's gonna know.

1455
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,680
Now, I'm not saying

1456
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,300
that you should be afraid

1457
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,300


1458
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,300


1459
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,140
the air outside

1460
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,940
is not exactly the same as inside.

1461
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,100
So you might want to go through

1462
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,880
that decompression chamber first!

1463
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,240
Oh, man!

1464
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,240
Jeez!

1465
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,940
These kids just go right in and out

1466
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,840
from Earth atmosphere

1467
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,000
to outside atmosphere.

1468
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,500
Doesn't even bother!

1469
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,900
I have to wear a mask

1470
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,980
to go out there.

1471
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,840
It's hard to keep up with evolution, man.

1472
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,340
It was hard enough just to crawl out of that pond

1473
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,420
and use the lungs.

1474
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,780
That hurt!

1475
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
You kids don't know nothing!

1476
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,520
You never did have to crawl out of that ocean

1477
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,700
and use them lungs

1478
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,660
the first time.

1479
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,040
And that first time

1480
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,500
we had to invent murder,

1481
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,100
that was hell, baby!

1482
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,180
But, man's gotta eat.

1483
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:58,900
Man's gotta eat.

1484
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,620
You gotta get that,

1485
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,500
you gotta build that spaceship somehow.

1486
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,000
If you have to start by

1487
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,000
chipping flimped rocks together,

1488
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,920
well, that's a start.

1489
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,020
Better than sitting on your butt

1490
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,000
and scratching your butt.

1491
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,920
Or is it, friends?

1492
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,140
Wouldn't it have been better

1493
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,760
for early man to have merely

1494
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,680
sat upon its butt,

1495
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,740
scratching that butt,

1496
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,840
and picking its nose

1497
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,160
and flees off into each other

1498
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,760
and grunting like happy little monkeys

1499
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,860
instead of all this progress?

1500
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,320
Which, while it has brought us

1501
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,240
these apps and things,

1502
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,560
they're still not working right.

1503
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,580
We have to breathe

1504
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,080
this processed atmosphere

1505
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,260
or else end up like those

1506
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,000
new breed of kids

1507
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,140
with the giant lungs and stuff.

1508
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,360
Come on.

1509
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,160
Sometimes I get mixed up

1510
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,120
and can't even remember

1511
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,480
what century I'm in.

1512
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,580
I remember that one

1513
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,200
time when we invented

1514
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:02,660
legs.

1515
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,120
That was out of necessity,

1516
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,100
believe me.

1517
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,040
No, but, you know,

1518
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,040
I mean, there's some people think that

1519
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,600
that, uh,

1520
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,660
well, I used to think, Chaz,

1521
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,380
we've been exhorting people

1522
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,280
to build their own ships just in case

1523
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,160
the aliens don't save our butts,

1524
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,180
but I used to say to people,

1525
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,040
well, hell, we got a whole other planet

1526
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,640
right here on this one that's a lot closer

1527
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
than Mars or the Moon and a lot more

1528
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,580
hospitable, that being the ocean.

1529
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,260
Oh, we got a whole other

1530
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,000
two planets worth left to pollute

1531
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,220
if that's what we wanted to do.

1532
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,080
No!

1533
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,400
He's a maniac!

1534
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,640
Out to rule the world!

1535
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,740
What can I do to make you understand him?

1536
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,500
I love you!

1537
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,540
A similar biological

1538
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,760
disaster would be a complete ecosystem

1539
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,840
collapse. Maybe this skin cream

1540
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,620
will help me out. Images of

1541
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,660
slaughtered elephants and burning rain forest

1542
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,340
uh, well, they get your attention,

1543
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,640
but the big problem, the overall

1544
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,920
loss of biodiversity,

1545
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,780
is a lot less visible and a lot

1546
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,880
more serious. Billions

1547
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,600
of years of evolution have produced

1548
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,480
a world in which every organism's

1549
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,360
welfare is intricately

1550
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,560
intertwined with that of countless other

1551
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,060
species.

1552
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,660
A recent study of Isle Royale

1553
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,240
National Park in Lake Superior

1554
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,000
offers an example.

1555
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,700
Snowy winters

1556
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,540
encourage wolves to

1557
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,680
hunt in larger paths.

1558
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,580
So they kill more moose.

1559
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,600
The decline in moose population

1560
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,880
allows more balsam fir saplings

1561
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,560
to live since they're not nibbled

1562
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,540
and chewed by the marauding mooses

1563
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,680
or meese. The fir

1564
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,560
trees pull carbon dioxide

1565
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,600
out of the atmosphere, which

1566
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,280
in turn influences the climate

1567
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,620
as the CO2 is sucked

1568
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,380
from the air, replacing

1569
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,960
diverse wild plants

1570
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,700
with just a few varieties of

1571
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,680
crops, transporting plants and animals

1572
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,900
and introducing new and dangerous

1573
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,320
chemicals into the environment.

1574
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,820
At least 30,000 species

1575
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,040
vanish every year from

1576
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,600
humi activity, which means we are

1577
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,380
living in the midst of one of the greatest mass

1578
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,980
extinctions in Earth's history.

1579
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,440
And it's all the fault of the

1580
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,260
Republican Party.

1581
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,800
Now while we are extinguishing

1582
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,660
natural species, we're

1583
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,460
also creating new species

1584
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,500
through genetic tamperings

1585
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,940
in weird secret labs.

1586
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,360
Genetically modified crops,

1587
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,420
they can be hardier, tastier, and more

1588
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,660
nutritious, and they can be intensely

1589
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,740
radioactive. Engineered

1590
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,320
microbes might ease

1591
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,580
our health problems.

1592
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,760
And gene therapy offers

1593
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,620
an elusive promise of

1594
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,640
fixing fundamental defects in our

1595
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,480
DNA. Then,

1596
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,540
there are the possible downsides.

1597
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,620
Although there is

1598
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,360
no evidence indicating genetically

1599
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,080
modified poos are unsafe,

1600
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,480
there still are signs

1601
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,680
that the genes from modified plants

1602
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,620
can leak out somehow

1603
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,660
and get on you, and

1604
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,760
find their way into other

1605
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,180
species.

1606
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,340
Engineered crops might also

1607
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,700
foster insecticide resistance.

1608
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,700
The resulting superweeds

1609
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,560
and supergiant insects

1610
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,380
could further destabilize

1611
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,300
the stressed global ecosystem.

1612
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,600
Altered microbes

1613
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,680
might grow to a large

1614
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,220
size and prove to be unexpected

1615
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,780
and incredibly difficult to control.

1616
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,360
Scariest of all

1617
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,620
is the possibility of the deliberate

1618
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,240
misuse of biotechnology

1619
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,900
to create a robobab.

1620
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,780
A terrorist group or rogue nation

1621
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,440
might decide that

1622
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,140
anthrax isn't nasty enough,

1623
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,680
and then try to put together

1624
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,040
an airborne version of the

1625
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,360
robobab's virus.

1626
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,120
Now there's a showstopper for you.

1627
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,260
Yeah, well, those are all

1628
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:01,580
very large-scale causes

1629
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,980
of mass death.

1630
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,860
The holocaustic

1631
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,620
xenotaph of the human race.

1632
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:07,900
All that show just

1633
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,180
thrown away.

1634
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,560
I have been told you are planning

1635
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,400
a child sacrifice.

1636
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,380
They would be like a beast.

1637
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,680
I am a slave.

1638
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,120
But you have me too.

1639
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,440
Well, there's one thing I have to get myself.

1640
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,460
Something that will tell me when I've succeeded.

1641
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,260
What's that?

1642
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,400
A live giant grasshopper.

1643
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,960
This beast isn't only electric.

1644
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,580
It's intensely radioactive.

1645
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,260
We have just received a report from America

1646
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,000
that mountains of dead fish are washing ashore

1647
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,920
along the coast from Maine to Florida.

1648
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,540
Does everything in Texas spit toxic cud?

1649
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,940
When you ask for something as special as a brain,

1650
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,120
even Buddha is going to give you the runaround.

1651
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,420
She's dead, master.

1652
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,840
You've been a very bad boy

1653
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:57,420
today.

1654
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,840
Are you ready to accept my domination?

1655
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,260
How's the fillet?

1656
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,360
Tender?

1657
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,740
You're eating one of my trainees

1658
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,140
that didn't quite work out.

1659
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,580
She wants to be in a freak show.

1660
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,000
It's a freak country.

1661
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,760
What about a particle accelerator mishap?

1662
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,820
It could happen.

1663
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,100
You know,

1664
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,940
Ted Kaczynski,

1665
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,700
the notorious Unabomber,

1666
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,340
raved, they said,

1667
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,960
that a particle accelerator experiment

1668
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:27,540
would have a brain reaction

1669
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,220
that would destroy the world.

1670
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,640
Surprisingly, many sober-minded scientists

1671
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,180
have had the same thought.

1672
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
Normally, their anxieties

1673
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,800
come up during private meetings

1674
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,140
with corporate bosses.

1675
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,120
It's much more on the backs of used envelopes.

1676
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,340
Recently, the questions went public

1677
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,020
when London Sunday Times reported

1678
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,540
that the relativistic heavy ion collider

1679
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,060
they call it RIC

1680
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,580
on Long Island, New York

1681
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,780
might create

1682
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,440
a micro-world

1683
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,220
with a subatomic black hole

1684
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,920
that would slowly nibble away

1685
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,780
our precious freedoms and our planet.

1686
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,560
Alternately, it might create

1687
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,640
exotic bits of altered matter

1688
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,000
that would shoot right through you.

1689
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,080
They're called strangelets,

1690
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,720
and they would obliterate

1691
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,280
whatever ordinary matter they met

1692
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,660
to assuage RIC's jittery neighbors.

1693
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,480
The lab's director convened

1694
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,720
a panel that rejected both scenarios

1695
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,780
as pretty much impossible.

1696
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,760
Just for goodness' sake,

1697
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,140
to good measure,

1698
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,220
the passenger also complained

1699
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,560
when they dismissed the possibility

1700
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,300
that RIC would trigger

1701
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,340
a phase transition in the cosmic

1702
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,460
vacuum energy.

1703
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,640
That's what I spoke of before,

1704
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,660
that the vacuum would collapse

1705
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,360
and become celestial ice nine,

1706
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,420
and we'd all be frozen forever

1707
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,560
in eternal amber.

1708
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,480
What about the sponge?

1709
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,460
Well, the sponge machine

1710
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,900
is not nearly powerful enough

1711
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,440
to make a black hole or destabilize

1712
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,280
the entire atmosphere.

1713
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,380
But we can always build

1714
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,300
a bigger accelerator.

1715
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,360
No!

1716
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,600
Oh, Fernando!

1717
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,580
Your mother ate my dog!

1718
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,800
Not all of it.

1719
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,580
Oh, I hate Fernando!

1720
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,160
But it might not be big things

1721
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:16,980
that bring us down,

1722
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,600
because we could also have

1723
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,200
a nanotechnology disaster.

1724
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,140
You see, right now,

1725
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,160
scientists are working

1726
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
on developing what they call nanobots.

1727
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,400
Millions of teensy-teensy robots

1728
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,700
that get into your bloodstream.

1729
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,580
Nano-nano.

1730
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,320
Nanobots.

1731
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,640
I didn't read that.

1732
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,740
Well, they're nano...

1733
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,000
I saw it.

1734
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,320
Was it a favorable article?

1735
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,360
Fairly favorable.

1736
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,760
A punk called Chicken John.

1737
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,920
Yeah, well...

1738
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,200
So you see,

1739
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,880
these tiny nanobots

1740
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,100
could be designed

1741
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,020
by artificial intelligences,

1742
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,480
which could continue to refine

1743
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,180
the nanobot design

1744
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,880
until the human body

1745
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,220
would be considered obsolete

1746
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,800
and would be instantly chewed to flinders

1747
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,920
by millions of jittering nanobots.

1748
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,900
Not again.

1749
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,660
I hate it when that happens.

1750
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,640
Or, conversely,

1751
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,120
environmental toxins

1752
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,300
could squirt into the atmosphere.

1753
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,440
As in Bhopal, India.

1754
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,880
You know,

1755
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,360
the world is ending pollution

1756
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,920
in the snows of Antarctica.

1757
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,520
The Earth is hopelessly contaminated.

1758
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,380
When giant monsters are waking up

1759
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,440
with anger in their hearts.

1760
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,520
Yes, indeed.

1761
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,080
Of course, there's also global war.

1762
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,100
A nuclear war would be harmful.

1763
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,280
Let's admit that.

1764
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,540
And it would probably be very harmful

1765
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,380
for the human species.

1766
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,020
Together, the US and Russia

1767
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,000
still have 19,000 active nuclear wars.

1768
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,280
They don't say that's doctrinal to me.

1769
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:54,680
Look at his feet.

1770
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,640
He hasn't got real feet.

1771
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,080
He's got those weird, like, pod things.

1772
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,280
I can't believe a guy like that.

1773
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,740
Look at his ears.

1774
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,920
They've got, like, the weird radio materials

1775
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,680
hanging right out.

1776
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,580
But seriously, you know,

1777
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,240
if we look at prophecy,

1778
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,360
like as many do the weekly world news

1779
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,880
there at the checkout line,

1780
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,300
as we thumb through

1781
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,740
Revelation X and the Book of the Subgenius,

1782
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,260
we're entering a glorious new age.

1783
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,360
Using our second or third foreskin thumb.

1784
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,460
A new era of diseases,

1785
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:29,860
of volcanic eruptions

1786
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,600
Praise diseases.

1787
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,380
that decimate entire states.

1788
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,960
Earthquakes,

1789
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,200
incredible man-made disasters

1790
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,820
of gigantic stockpiles

1791
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,840
of nerve gases

1792
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,740
released into the atmosphere.

1793
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,540
And confused,

1794
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,500
all flapping amongst the small

1795
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,720
Union children.

1796
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:48,720


1797
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,500
As they gathered by the gates

1798
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,360
to sing songs.

1799
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,040
The madness of the middle ages

1800
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,880
will pale in comparison

1801
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,220
to the marvelous, futuristic

1802
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,100
new age that's coming.

1803
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,280
We know that you,

1804
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,060
the listener, are interested

1805
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,640
in the future, or you wouldn't

1806
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,980
be listening to this show.

1807
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,540
You who are hearing my voice now,

1808
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,200
those of you

1809
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,600
who live into

1810
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,540
the new age, will see

1811
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,860
such wonders as

1812
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,680
rubber cities.

1813
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,060
Gigantic

1814
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,820
dominoes

1815
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,580
the size of skyscrapers.

1816
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,360
All set to go off

1817
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,660
and fall at once

1818
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,700
on July 5th,

1819
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,920
2001

1820
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,180
at Brushwood Campground

1821
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,460
in Sherman, New York.

1822
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,480
Such wonders as

1823
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,280
glass,

1824
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,300
lipstick,

1825
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,560
growth books,

1826
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,460
we like the glass lipstick,

1827
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,080
sin pills,

1828
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,180
I have taken

1829
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,180
many, Master.

1830
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,000
What shall I do now?

1831
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,180
other miracles of science,

1832
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,300
such as the robotic

1833
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,580
butt puffler.

1834
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,900
The eye condenser,

1835
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,820
the amazing eye condenser,

1836
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,040
takes what you see or what you have seen

1837
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,380
and procreates into a small, proclivitous

1838
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:18,900
package.

1839
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,700
The package can be owned by a member of your family unit

1840
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,640
now for a limited time,

1841
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,480
but not in the neutral space.

1842
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,200
These are completely designed for a modern you today

1843
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,200
in the neutral space.

1844
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,760
If you care, or if you dare,

1845
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,420
just step into the box,

1846
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,640
reach your hand out,

1847
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,060
the influence will go on and on.

1848
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,540
Are you ready for this future?

1849
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,420
Is this really the future that you want?

1850
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,300
This is food for thought, ladies and gentlemen.

1851
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,060
And until next week,

1852
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,460
the box is done.

1853
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,340
Don't you dare.

1854
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,160
Don't dare.

1855
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,360
You're about to win.

1856
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,720
And you're sagging the saddle.

1857
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:55,920
Think about it.

1858
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,320
Well, Mom,

1859
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,560
I didn't want to go, but I didn't want to go.

1860
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,540
Well, the first thing you said,

1861
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,260
if I didn't go,

1862
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,780
then I wouldn't be...

1863
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,340
I didn't want to go.

1864
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,480
You forced me to go.

1865
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,960
Well, the first thing you said...

1866
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,400
It's right where I want to go.

1867
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,200
I didn't mean it.

1868
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,100
I didn't mean it.

1869
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,800
You're about to get in the box.

1870
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,360
It's the box.

1871
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,900
I'm ready.

1872
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,740
I'm ready to go.

1873
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,520
I'm ready.

1874
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,080
I'm ready.

1875
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:37,580
I'm ready to go.

1876
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,020
Ready to be in control?

1877
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,040
Ready to be in control?

1878
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,400
We now return control

1879
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,900
of your television set.

1880
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,100
I'm so sorry.

1881
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,720
That I broke your heart

1882
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,740
Please don't leave my side

1883
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:05,540
Take me home, you silly boy

1884
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:12,160
Cause I'm still in love with you

1885
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:46,940
I'm still in love with you

1886
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,700
Got your pencil ready?

1887
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:55,300
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214

1888
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:02,680
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214

1889
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,700
Stay tuned and praise Bob!

1890
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:14,540
And the blood came down to the grasses of the street

1891
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,940
And the water poured down to the trees

1892
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,360
And the rice that they had to trade

1893
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:26,080
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood

1894
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:32,160
For all the new trees were made to survive the flood

1895
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,620
Laughter

1896
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,720
Laughter

1897
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,740
Laughter

1898
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,880
Laughter

1899
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,400
Laughter

1900
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,180
Laughter

1901
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:42,900
Laughter

1902
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,020
Laughter

1903
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,040
Laughter

1904
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,040


1905
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,280
Laughter

1906
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:43,280


1907
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:43,600
Laughter

1908
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,160
Laughter

1909
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,720
Laughter

1910
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,620
Laughter

1911
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,980
Laughter

1912
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,260
Laughter

1913
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,740
Laughter

1914
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,360
