1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Yeah, feel that bump on Bob's dome.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:02,960
Let's see, Bob.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,400
Oh, hey, that is a good one.

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:05,880
What happened?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,720
The subgenius hour of slack.

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, thanks to Lemur for the titles.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:20,960
Friends, we finished a new subgenius video, the cerebral reformatter, just in time for Winterstar, but not in time for a fresh hour of slack number 1191.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:31,320
So this is really Reverend Susie the floozy's episode of Bob's slack time funhouse from WREK.org, Atlanta.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:41,660
Her number 752, the inauguramus special, a subgenius farewell to George.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,420
Ongoing proceedings are serious.

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,740
The program you are about to hear.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,580
Bob's slack time funhouse is parody, satire, and comedy.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:16,040
Any reference to Bob, the church of the subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects is intended only as humor and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK Atlanta, its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,660
I can't, I really do thank the staff of Georgia Tech.

15
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,940
The chairman and vice chairman.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,620
The members.

17
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,620
For WREK.

18
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,980
And Bob's slack time funhouse.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,660
Um, and possibly Susan.

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,660
Hmm, yes.

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,060
She speaks English a lot better than I do.

22
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,220
Otherwise I wouldn't have put her on.

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,720
Um, yeah, yeah, look, I, I picked the best person I could find.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,580
Um, people, people know we're close.

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,640
I'm, I'm, um, look, as I said the other day.

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,020
Oh, I feel like I'm more of a senior now than I used to be a senior in boxing.

27
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,100
Yeah.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,540
So far, she's done a pretty good job when it comes to like a bad göre.

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:12,540


30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:12,540


31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,060
Kind of which you know kicked some kind of belly into that sort of stuff, but, uh, man.

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,620
I need to tell you something about her first guy.

33
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:15,620


34
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,180
According to her, however, I, um, 3, 4 and up, she's one of the adjusted best polygona wives to the world to the way she ==

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,600
I don't think you would hit yourself.

36
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:20,740
So you meet the utmost mark, baby bitch.

37
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:20,740


38
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:20,940
Put me down.

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:20,940


40
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:20,940


41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,940
It's a pity I'll only be able to use it this one time.

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,740
Yeah?

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,240
For the inauguration edition of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,800
Oh.

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,740
Yeah, they're finally booting that jerk out and that Irish guy's gonna take his place.

46
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,380
And I think it's terrible.

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,480
Oh, yeah, no more George.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,960
Prologue.

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,300
Now it's morning in Washington, D.C.

50
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,160
Good morning, George.

51
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,600
What'll it be for breakfast, waffles or pancakes?

52
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,620
I want pancakes.

53
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,440
Hmm.

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,440
It's on account of slimy politics here.

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,060
We have all this unemployment.

56
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,900
You're crazy. That ain't possible.

57
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,240
No goodness whatever adorning his memory.

58
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,500
Arrogant in his vice was that one.

59
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,260
The head of the state had an elastic mouth that made him look like a harassed cannibal.

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,600
Gosh, okay.

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,580
Holding enormous official powers, he schemed ceaselessly to expand them.

62
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,840
Because it was expected of him by those who had pushed him

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:20,920
into the middle of the world.

64
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,220
He was the only one who could get him into office.

65
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,540
He had the cunning of the unintelligent and the frantic energy of the lazy.

66
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:33,860
The sole secret of his rise in life was the fact that he was a product of chance and knew it and aspired to nothing else.

67
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,860
I'm, I'm, I'm, uh...

68
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,400
Pancakes!

69
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,160
This beast blocked the door.

70
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,420
You should see the kind of human driftwood, the kind of men who like the way things are now.

71
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,000
Can you imagine that there are human beings who like it?

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,320
There's no such thing.

73
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,700
Well, there are, you know.

74
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,980
As if on cue.

75
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Moving on to new business, what act of unmitigated evil shall the Republican Party undertake this week?

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,920
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

77
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,280
You've already done enough, Nader.

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,960
He had summoned them all to Washington as his friends and personal advisors for a private unofficial conference on the national crisis.

79
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,900
Uh, uh, uh...

80
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,880
I beheld the shade of him who made the great refusal impelled by cowardice.

81
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,800
The...

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,300
The...

83
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,360
The...

84
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:26,680
The frankly mood of the world would have been astounded had the United States acted unilaterally.

85
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,240
Um...

86
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
How do you like the moratorium on brains?

87
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,320
I received a briefing on the threats to our nation.

88
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,500
I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe.

89
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,860
But I never did.

90
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,920
Damn you!

91
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,920
Oops, too late.

92
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,460
He doesn't understand.

93
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,580
He just doesn't understand.

94
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,460
Love the stats.

95
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,960
It's a monster!

96
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,060
Kill it!

97
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,220
Kill it!

98
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,140
I'm a monster!

99
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,520
Don't look at me!

100
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,260
Are you crazy?

101
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,860
Are you?

102
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,360
I...

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,460
I...

104
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,240
Why such schism threatens it?

105
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,520
Only got so long before Mr. President doesn't mean a whole lot.

106
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,260
Uh...

107
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,880
Don't you see that you've run out of time?

108
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,420
He answered...

109
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,040
Gosh, I don't think I ever said I'm worried about Obama.

110
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,760
It's kind of one of those, uh, exaggerations.

111
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,500
Oh.

112
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,000
You don't care, do you?

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:17,940
Uh...

114
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,300
Not for decades.

115
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,420
We've got to get our act together better this season.

116
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,580
He's not ultra-bright at the best of times.

117
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,800
Sometimes I think the whole family's unhinged.

118
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,520
It's obvious that drastic measures have to be taken.

119
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,400
We can't let things go on the way they're going much longer.

120
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,700
We'll think of something.

121
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,260
Right.

122
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:36,940
Sure.

123
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,980
Let's see.

124
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,160
When hell freezes over.

125
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,240
Fact is, this year the rate of business failures had doubled.

126
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,660
Just trying to spread around the joy.

127
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,620
But...

128
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,540
You cannot fail to realize our disastrous deficit.

129
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,640
And that we expect you to pay.

130
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,920
I don't know why people do that.

131
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
I don't know.

132
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,040
That is your job, not ours.

133
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,220
You could save us now.

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
You could find a way to make things work if you wanted to.

135
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,200
Boy, they really miscalculated.

136
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,020
Uh, as your president, I'm watching too much daytime TV to save others' lives.

137
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,700
Tough guy.

138
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,480
Yeah, yeah, tough guy.

139
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,260
Are you counting on my not saying that the responsibility is yours?

140
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,340
That it was your goddamn policies that brought us where we are?

141
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,000
Uh, uh, uh.

142
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,760
You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem.

143
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,220
You gotta do better than that.

144
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,880
I got the conks, said the idiot George Ghibli Clay.

145
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,500
He's gone mad with power, like that Albert Schweitzer guy.

146
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,060
Get off that righteous horse of yours and come to your senses.

147
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,060
You can't expect us to ditch the machinery of state.

148
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,680
We've got to preserve the system.

150
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,820
Yeah, of course I did.

151
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,660
You're the fake.

152
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,620
So what, George said.

153
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,440
His shoulders bunched.

154
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,180
I got the conch, ain't I, Roger?

155
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,860
Roger said, hell, under his breath.

156
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,720
Yes, and I've somehow acquired a nasty old racist sidekick.

157
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,780
Happy?

158
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,200
George began to mutter vaguely.

159
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,820
I'm going to him with this conch in my hands.

160
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,460
I'm going to hold it out.

161
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,280
Look, I'm gonna say, I don't ask you to be a sport, I'll say.

162
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,640
Not because you're strong, but because what's right's right, I'm gonna say.

163
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,700
You've got to.

164
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,360
George ended flushed and trembling.

165
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,520
This man is obviously a psychotic.

166
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,440
I'd like to hold off judgment on a thing like that, sir, until all the facts are in.

167
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,280
But it's reality.

168
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,700
But there can be little debate about the results.

169
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,380
Oh, my God.

170
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,220
Insanity in the halls of Congress.

171
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,760
Oh, my God.

172
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,680
My eyes.

173
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,540
Stoned women in the streets.

174
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,740
Pictures of older men forcing naked young girls to have anal sex.

175
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,680
I wish I could.

176
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,240
That can be arranged.

177
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,260
Yee-haw.

178
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,360
That's a fact.

179
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,040
Doing it makes my stomach turn.

180
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,740
Oh, yeah, right.

181
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,680
Think about that.

182
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,600
Prostitution is on the march.

183
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,320
Oh, my God.

184
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,560
What the hell is this?

185
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,300
You just don't know.

186
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:03,860
It requires an expenditure of money that is commiserate with keeping a promise to our prostitutes

187
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,940
to make sure that they're well-paid, well-trained, well-equipped.

188
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Ooh, cool.

189
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,100
We had a 19-year-old woman this weekend.

190
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,960
Right in the krillings.

191
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,340
Now there's a guy who knows how to get his point across.

192
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,740
Ouch, said the hooker.

193
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,240
W, I'm Mr. W.

194
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,000
If my name begins to trouble you, here's a way to help your thinking.

195
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,240
Won't you watch me when I'm winking?

196
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,560
Wonderful wink with my right eye, that's once.

197
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,060
Wonderful wink with my left eye, that's twice.

198
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,220
Two winks are nice.

199
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,420
They're the double of one.

200
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,740
Oh, I'm winking double.

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,080
That's how W is done.

202
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,660
Blink twice for yes.

203
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,300
Let's hear from the stone gutter world council before we act too rashly.

204
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
That's a crap shoot.

205
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,360
Isn't it, though?

206
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,640
Now, Bob Doe will read from the Necronomicon.

207
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,260
Rise, please.

208
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,020
Oh, my God.

209
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,600
A, Zach, Azuri, Galanith, Melodic, Doon, Osmeramus, and Brinkaby.

210
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,060
And the prayer had been answered.

211
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,200
By Satan.

212
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,160
And suddenly things turned ugly.

213
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,040
This little calls the whole thing.

214
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,260
He turned incredulously to look at his mother.

215
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,420
Little miss psycho bitch.

216
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,480
You haven't switched from liquor to dope by any chance, have you?

217
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,500
George grinned back, wiping his chin.

218
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,100
Jinkum.

219
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,840
He giggled and rubbed the stuff over his cheeks.

220
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,380
It's pathetic.

221
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,840
Texas mudslide.

222
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,040
What the hell did you mean?

223
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,360
How are we to cope if you leave us?

224
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,760
We'll be swept like driftwood in that terror that's running loose in the world.

225
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,240
Your father, we'll call him.

226
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,920
Your father was a good-for-nothing chimp.

227
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,420
Father was a gypsy.

228
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,540
I've never said that.

229
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,740
You can't quit.

230
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
His mother screamed in blind panic.

231
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,320
You can't turn deserter because now they take it out on your family.

232
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,460
The look of terror in her eyes was real.

233
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,560
In a moment her voice came back low and droning.

234
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,200
If you give up and vanish like all those men who...

235
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,120
Oh, that's that.

236
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,960
Daddy, my picture.

237
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,680
Right there.

238
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,260
Yeah.

239
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,400
There isn't a dirty cover-up in this entire business that I don't know about.

240
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,980
And your hand is in every one of them.

241
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,960
You reek of it.

242
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,180
You know, Wicked Old Leg was well into her eighties with wavy white hair.

243
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,300
And the pierced eyes.

244
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,240
Piercing hawk eyes.

245
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,840
The smile would have cracked her facial muscles.

246
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,260
You think your life's a mystery.

247
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,280
Duh.

248
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Yes, they're into group sex, orgies and all that.

249
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,040
Baby sacrifice.

250
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,920
Go away, Ivan.

251
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,120
It's none of your business.

252
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,600
Yes, something sinister is coming.

253
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,400
Soon.

254
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,040
Ivan might have done as he was told.

255
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,660
But on his heels came a much tougher proposition.

256
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,160
The door of the office was suddenly flung open.

257
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,240
And Neil catapulted himself inside.

258
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,900
Oh, wow.

259
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,360
Neil's eyes were wide.

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,120
Pardon, Junior Ranger?

261
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Neil told George excitedly.

262
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,920
Her image is lies with the truth.

263
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,020
And vermouth.

264
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,840
Duh.

265
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,060
This is gin.

266
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,940
Oh, sure.

267
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,100
Two measures of gin and a splash of vermouth and you've got yourself a liar's martini.

268
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,880
I'm using.

269
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,460
I'm using.

270
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,200
I swear to God.

271
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,760
I don't know what happened.

272
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,580
It's all a big mistake.

273
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,960
He knows that, uh...

274
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,780
He's got to believe me.

275
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,380
I'm sorry.

277
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm so sorry.

278
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,360
I'm so sorry.

279
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:38,720


280
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,100
I'm so sorry.

281
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,320
I don't know what Neil's like.

282
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,080
See, because he sees things.

283
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,280
I hear the voices.

284
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,780
George said sharply.

285
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,700
Oh, yeah, right.

286
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,300
Whatever you say, pal.

287
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,920
Whack-a.

288
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,820
The question is, are you either with us or against us?

289
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,120
What?

290
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,400
No.

291
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:54,800
No.

292
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,400
No.

293
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:55,900
No.

294
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,260
No.

295
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,720
No.

296
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,140
No.

297
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,500
No.

298
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,060
No.

299
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,320
No.

300
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,700
No.

301
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:58,820
No.

302
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:58,920
Yes.

303
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,100
And I'm...

304
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,540
I mean, no.

305
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,420
No.

306
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,260
I don't know.

307
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,620
I just don't know.

308
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,560
Particularly not him.

309
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,640
Tell me about it.

310
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,620
You're right on that.

311
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:07,940
Yeah.

312
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:07,960
Yeah.

313
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,320
And Neil went on screen.

314
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,400
Like I said.

315
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,060
Ah!

316
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:11,980
Ah!

317
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,420
Ah!

318
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,340
Shut up!

319
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,960
Do you mean George's young brother worked it out?

320
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,820
Father was Lord of the Flowers?

321
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,500
I...

322
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,700
I...

323
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,080
We...

324
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,460
We...

325
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,220
We don't talk about sources and methods.

326
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,600
The Bush crime family all know things about each other that they use as threats.

327
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,660
They blackmail each other to make them do or not do what they want.

328
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,860
The antagonism between the Bush crime family was mutual, powerful, and lasting.

329
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,580
No, wait!

330
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,820
Jib cried, leaping to his feet.

331
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,880
Brother, he said peremptorily, I need your dead horse.

332
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,380
Do I?

333
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,740
The two Bush boys faced each other.

334
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,600
George sighed, sensing the rising antagonism.

335
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,260
I...

336
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,380
I...

337
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,060
Jib, Robert, and Bush snarled at him.

338
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,300
I want to be president.

339
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,080
I want it.

340
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,340
Ah.

341
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,920
They were both red in the face and found looking at each other difficult.

342
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,640
Why shouldn't I be given the fulfillment of my duty?

343
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,120
The fulfillment of my desires, as you always fulfill any desire of your own.

344
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,980
Because I...

345
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,100
I...

346
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,440
There is a belief that you'll never be found out.

347
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,220
And if you should be, you believe the family will use its money and muscle to save you,

348
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,360
as it has always done in the past.

349
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,760
Jib glared at George.

350
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,300
Don't I have the right to demand any form of happiness I choose?

351
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,300
Gosh, okay.

352
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,800
Jib's voice lifted into the wine of virtuous recrimination.

353
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,520
I'm your brother, therefore I'm your responsibility.

354
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,700
Hmm.

355
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,920
Um...

356
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,740
Isn't that a debt which you owe me?

357
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,100
You what?

358
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,460
There it was, he thought, looking at his family.

359
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,320
The nature of their pleas for mercy.

360
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,160
They wanted to hold him.

361
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,580
To keep him in the sacrificial furnace.

362
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,880
To make him let them devour the last of him in the name of mercy, forgiveness, and brother-cannibal love.

363
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,540
And what's wrong with that?

364
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
It was for the ultimate good of the family.

365
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,900
Through clenched teeth, George said,

366
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,820
Black hell.

367
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,780
He punched out two of her front teeth.

368
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,460
Faced with too many awful implications,

369
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,640
George ducked away from them.

370
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,580
And here he is sitting at the table in the Oval Office in big tears.

371
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,900
And started coming down to his cheeks and splashing them on the table.

372
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,300
Said George Bush, wetly.

373
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,720
It was late.

374
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,940
His staff had gone.

375
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,800
But he dreaded the emptiness of the evening ahead.

376
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,800
He felt as if the enemy who had wiped him out were waiting for him,

377
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,780
in the darkness beyond the glow of Washington.

378
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,800
He stopped.

379
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,660
Hey, what the hell?

380
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,060
Click.

381
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,500
Slam it in your chest, bitch.

382
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,260
Put the W.

383
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,400
Burn it through your flesh.

384
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,180
Verbally possessed.

385
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,300
Never second-guessed.

386
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,640
No mind like David Koresh.

387
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,700
The man sat on the edge of a desk in a pose of casual, patient waiting.

388
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,240
For a moment, George did not see him.

389
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,100
But on raising his eyes, he stiffened.

390
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,480
Yeah.

391
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
Trump, Prince Obama, George said.

392
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,980
And a scowl came on his face.

393
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,080
What are you doing here?

394
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,380
I thought that you would want to see me tonight.

395
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,580
George watched him.

396
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,560
Suspiciously.

397
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Calling you down, man.

398
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,260
I mean, there you are.

399
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,020
This is my room.

400
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,740
I'm, I'm.

401
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,900
You got no right to come in my room.

402
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,280
This is a total violation.

403
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,120
You got no rights coming in a colored man's room.

404
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,960
I, I, I.

405
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,940
He shrugged unhappily.

406
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,320
I have nothing to say to you.

407
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,800
Well, I have nothing to say to you.

408
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,140
It doesn't mean we can't talk.

409
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,880
George worked his jaw like a steam shovel.

410
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,660
Authority sat on his shoulder like an ape.

411
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,080
I'm, I'm, uh.

412
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,380
Just you and me.

413
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
As president, I have a duty to lead.

414
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,840
Ahem.

415
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,560
I'm sorry.

416
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:29,560


417
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:29,560


418
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:29,560


419
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:29,560


420
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:29,560


421
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:29,560


422
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,220
You know I am the president of the United States.

423
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:32,860
Yep.

424
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,880
George looked at the rock open mouth.

425
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,080
George, it's over.

426
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,560
What?

427
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,640
Yeah, it's done.

428
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,360
Get out of here.

429
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,840
Are you serious?

430
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,240
Yeah.

431
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,220
Son of a bitch.

432
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,440
Took you this long to tell me?

433
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,140
George, it's been over for a while.

434
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,840
Oh, man.

435
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,700
Oh, man.

436
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,100
I just got your messages and I, uh.

437
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,980
Oh, really?

438
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,900
Yeah, it's, uh.

439
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,800
Oh, oh, wow.

440
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,680
So I'm way late.

441
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,320
Yeah, I'm sorry.

442
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,720
George sat shrugging.

443
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,560
You're trying to get me in trouble with my father.

444
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,000
Your father was a horse's ass.

445
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:56,740
Yep.

446
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,920
And you know what?

447
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,560
I respect that.

448
00:15:59,560 --> 00:15:59,560


449
00:15:59,560 --> 00:15:59,560


450
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,020
I respect that a lot.

451
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,300
George's face contorted with thought.

452
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,160
That boy's smart.

453
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,700
Maybe I should put him on the Supreme Court.

454
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,500
Maybe you can see now.

455
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,960
Suppose you had to sit out here and read books because you're black.

456
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,920
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

457
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,780
I got a gal who reads things for me.

458
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,360
Reading wouldn't save that neck.

459
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,540
I, I look.

460
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,260
Please, please.

461
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,180
George smiled helplessly in an attempt to make friends.

462
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,300
His voice grew soft and persuasive.

463
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,560
I told the Crown Prince Obama how much I appreciate his vision.

464
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,560


465
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,560


466
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,560


467
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,560


468
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,560


469
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:44,180
But suddenly allのr read what you see.

470
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,920
How can you?

471
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,380
It's the same thing.

472
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,540
Go on.

473
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,080
I've been right with him.

474
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,120
I, I, I, I do.

475
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,180
RICHARD P.

476
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,200
Marcus Garvey.

477
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,100
Mr. President.

478
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,480
George sneered and attempted bravery.

479
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,060
Each of us is guided by our own convictions, and to these we must stay faithful.

480
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,020
He repeated his words rhythmically as though he had said them many times before.

481
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:19,660
You know, there's a lot of people in the world who don't believe that people whose skin color may not be the same as ours pick themselves up.

482
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,180
I reject that.

483
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,040
Bush flushed, looking sideways.

484
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,520
I reject that strongly.

485
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,860
His voice faded away.

486
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,440
Then he rallied and manfully tried again.

487
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,660
I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency.

488
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,880
But thousands of lives have been lost to the wrath of Hurricane Katrina.

489
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,280
I don't play Death Track.

490
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,560
And the amazing thing about Katrina is that there has been a fantastic response.

491
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,540
What's that?

492
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,160
Minority ownership of businesses are up because we create an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong.

493
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,180
Say what?

494
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,720
This is a tribute to Hurricane.

495
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,180
Hurricane Katrina.

496
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:56,820
Yeah.

497
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,620
You exterminate.

498
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,180
Crown Prince and I established a strong personal bond.

499
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,020
President horse's ass.

500
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,140
There's no need to continue this obstinance.

501
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,720
It's not in your interest to do so.

502
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,280
Want me to tell you what will happen?

503
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,380
Gosh, okay.

504
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,280
Take you to the booty hut.

505
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Tie you up with a collar like a dog.

506
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,140
I got the conch, said George indignantly, scowling in the gloom.

507
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,260
You shut up.

508
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,400
George's pathetic faith in the conch.

509
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,840
The conch really has no value.

510
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:25,840


511
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,060
It's become magical, a sort of democratic process, and he thinks that it will stand up against force.

512
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,680
I've got the conch.

513
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,440
Yeah.

514
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,320
The rock stood up and held out his hands.

515
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,120
I think anything I would say would just be redundant.

516
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,460
I haven't finished yet.

517
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,260
Read the patent number, bitch.

518
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,060
Suddenly, the rock struck with all his might.

519
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,200
It's Britain time.

520
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,180
The conch exploded into a thousand white fragments.

521
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,660
Oh, no.

522
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,340
And ceased to exist.

523
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,180
My dad's going to kill me.

524
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,820
There isn't a time.

525
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,480
I won't try for you anymore, said the rock contemptuously.

526
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,660
The conch is gone.

527
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,460
Ehh, ehh, ehh, ehh, ehh.

528
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,200
Suddenly, George's eyes centered and grew quiet and mad.

529
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,840
Duh.

530
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,060
Gradually, his sorrow and his anger grew into words.

531
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,220
Um, Mr. President.

532
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,900
He sniveled and his voice shook.

533
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,920
I, I, I never wanted the presidency taken away.

534
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,660
I, I, I'm, uh, oh.

535
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,940
Give that back.

536
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,520
George shouted over and over.

537
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,300
Give it back.

538
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,540
We don't need your ideas.

539
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,020
We don't need your advice.

540
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,520
And we don't need lames in the hallway.

541
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,200
Take a walk.

542
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,280
I am filled with disbelief.

543
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,160
Now, you just get out.

544
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,260
Terrible sadness.

545
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,220
Get out quick.

546
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,260
And a quiet.

547
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:39,980
Ow.

548
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,500
Unyielding anger.

549
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,760
Out, you're finished.

550
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,840
I should have knew, George said hopelessly.

551
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,580
I guess maybe way back in my head, I did.

552
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,020
Oh, I'm nuts.

553
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,640
Carl, I'm in a very tough spot here.

554
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,760
I know, but there's nothing to worry about.

555
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,540
Just hang tight.

556
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,840
They came to my office, Carl.

557
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,840
No, no, look, I know we have a deal.

558
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,500
But if I knew this was going to be happening, I wouldn't have signed on.

559
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,780
Just be calm and know that you have the full power of the White House behind you.

560
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,260
Okay, I'll be in touch.

561
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,960
What's the best way out of here?

562
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,740
I really didn't have an exit strategy.

563
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,240
Who is it?

564
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,560
Get out of my trailer, I won't get out.

565
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,640
It's 30 years over.

566
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,980
Let's get out of here. I'm not shaking that guy's hand.

567
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,760
Come on, let's get out of here.

568
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,140
The Treasury says the national debt is climbing to the sky.

569
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,280
And government expenditures have never been so high.

570
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,240
It makes a fella give a gleam of pride

571
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,360
within his eye to see how our economy expands.

572
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,080
The country's in the very best of hands.

573
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,300
The country is

574
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,460
in a terrible state.

575
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,320
We don't know what to do about it.

576
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,340
He was burdened by another primal concern.

577
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm going to lose my job.

578
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,820
George saw his opportunity.

579
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,320
I'm not a lame duck, I'm a sprintin' duck.

580
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,100
Don't worry about that. My boys are there.

581
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,940
They'll take care of it.

582
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,680
Where was I? Oh, yes, yes.

583
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,680
As if on cue.

584
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,900
A blushing expose of the strange activities that took place behind closed doors.

585
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,920
Far below the Earth's surface,

586
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,160
a world of fruited meetings and change.

587
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,080
Here, here. Yes.

588
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,020
We have a winner.

589
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,920
Right on.

590
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,200
We.

591
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,800
The country's in the very best of hands.

592
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,940
They said surround this place they got.

593
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,640
This big, impressionable parking lot.

594
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,400
Just sit around it and you know what.

595
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,320
Up there they call to me if I moan.

596
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,780
I'm a little bit of a fool.

597
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,720
I'm a little bit of a fool.

598
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,440
I think it's still rough.

599
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,640
They sat in a stately boardroom which was inadequately heated.

600
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,160
A man from Washington sat among them.

601
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,120
Nobody knew his exact job or title, but they knew that he was the man from Washington.

602
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,360
They preferred not to find out.

603
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,800
He? Who he?

604
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,560
Don't look at me.

605
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,820
It seems to me, said the chairman, that the top problem for us to consider is John Galt.

606
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,900
I mean, the ruler of the...

607
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,040
The leader of the board.

608
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Say, you're sold on this.

609
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,340
Whatever, man.

610
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,280
Their leader was a civilian with the manner of an intellectual of the public relations species.

611
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,340
There's a man who is doing something.

612
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,780
That is a revolution, man.

613
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,620
Don't you understand?

614
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,880
Today we have broken our long law against your race.

615
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,700
May it be a sign that though the world is now dark, better days are at hand.

616
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,080
What is that supposed to mean?

617
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,660
And that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.

618
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,620
He watched the men around him

619
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,600
with a look of so great an indignation that he seemed paralyzed.

620
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,220
Professor, I don't blame the shoreline.

621
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,160
It's a beautiful America.

622
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,180
America can only happen right here in the good old USA.

623
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,900
All right, I'll pick you up tomorrow at 11 o'clock.

624
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,980
I'll take you to the zoo, then we'll go to the ball game.

625
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,960
Oh, you got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.

626
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,100
Sure it's a meal ticket for me, I admit it.

627
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,900
But it's also a windfall for somebody who's trying to crash national politics.

628
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,240
Something white fell out and I picked it up.

629
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,620
What's this?

630
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,360
And it was addressed to the leader.

631
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,240
What?

632
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,700
It was a letter and it read.

633
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,820
I love Mexicans.

634
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,580
Some say they're essential to our economy.

635
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,400
Others say they're a drain on our resources.

636
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,660
All I know is burritos are delicious.

637
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,580
Scrawled in pencil by some illiterate hand.

638
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,220
And pencil on tablet paper.

639
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,760
No, I don't think so.

640
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,960
It's exactly what it looks like.

641
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,680
Troll, cheer some lipstick on.

642
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,060
How awful.

643
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,440
Just look at my jacket.

644
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,340
I'm telling what that screwball might do.

645
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,120
Hey, man, it's going in a newspaper.

646
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,100
The Bushes and drugs.

647
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,920
Yeah, under the influence of drugs.

648
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,740
And it's gone for three days.

649
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,740
Shooting up in the big town.

650
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,880
He's stuck in with the needle.

651
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,820
Why he's not better than right up his nose.

652
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,080
Drop him off somebody.

653
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,120
Everybody getting caught in a fallout.

654
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,520
Getting their ass blowed up.

655
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,660
Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our face.

656
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,500
You do just as much of a dumb as he is.

657
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,240
Excuse me.

658
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,960
We don't want to quarrel over past mistakes,

659
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,860
said the chairman in a tone of pleading reproach.

660
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,340
The truth is that it's an embarrassing and personally painful thing.

661
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,100
And if people will vote for an alcoholic

662
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,280
hillbilly leader, they'll vote for anybody.

663
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,940
You can say that again.

664
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,580
I never chase foul balls.

665
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,720
You can't know any less about it than that

666
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,940
alcoholic hillbilly who's in Washington now.

667
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,900
You lucky I'm pushing this death trap.

668
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,900
I don't play.

669
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,560
But get things going.

670
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,220
Make people work again.

671
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,980
Make them produce.

672
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,560
If it's an alien product, what is supposed to do to take a war?

673
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,700
Lead us to a peaceful, scientific, industrial age and to prosperity.

674
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,500
We'll do whatever you say implicitly with your head and your soul.

675
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,460
You'll be.

676
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,220
You'll be the economic dictator of the nation.

677
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,400
Yeah.

678
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,080
I suppose it's connected to the nominee.

679
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,720
The nominee is connected to the Treasury.

680
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,440
But he ain't connected to the Treasury.

681
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,440
He sits around in his thigh bone.

682
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,820
Brothers in the black room. Brothers in the black room.

683
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,780
I deal with housing in the community.

684
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,180
Bad plumbing, bad heating and bad rats.

685
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,920
The only way to set this thing

686
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,800
together is with self-determination, self-respect and self-defense.

687
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,000
We don't go for Jesus no more.

688
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,680
We must adjust ourselves to the level of our audience, which is pretty low.

689
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,740
Violence is a cleansing force.

690
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,640
Nonviolence has proven to be nonfunctional.

691
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,480
So it's guns, baby.

692
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,840
The end result will be our own political, social, economic future.

693
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,640
Bazookas, tanks, flamethrowers, guns, baby.

694
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,440
A gun is not a gun.

695
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,700
It's not going to get your job.

696
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,000
Who the hell wants a job?

697
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,860
Here, here.

698
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,340
You know what, Mavs?

699
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,720
I bet you he's somewhere getting blazed up with red man.

700
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,340
Where you been? Mecca.

701
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,320
The mad Obama himself.

702
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,960
The man says he's the president of the United States.

703
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,020
Lay some bread on, lay some bread on, lay some bread on.

704
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,080
We could create a subliminal trauma

705
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,520
throughout the land by using the advertising that comes out of your toilet.

706
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,040
Thank you.

707
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,900
We'll see you tomorrow.

708
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,420
Ahem.

709
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,220
Yeah, it was your idea.

710
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,500
Not bad, not bad.

711
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,880
You're going to make a great chairman.

712
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,540
Brother, you were voted in here on a jive hummer.

713
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,840
Now, how are things going to happen, man?

714
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,000
When are things going to start to change?

715
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,920
Where is the revolution?

716
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,540
You were talking about, man.

717
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,240
Hey, what do you think of the Panthers?

718
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,420
They look good against the Bulldogs, but they need more depth than quarterback.

719
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,580
Hey, man, I've seen that nonsense you're trying to show us here.

720
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,680
You're trying to dupe everybody in this joint.

721
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,580
Now, how do you like that?

722
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,960
Yeah. What's that for?

723
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,680
Look at you, the high water pants, your two button suit.

724
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,860
Now, what kind of suit is that?

725
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,980
You're supposed to be a soul brother.

726
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,860
Look at his brother's hair.

727
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,400
And I know you a jive cat.

728
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,260
Ain't nobody around who help you in anything.

729
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,260
Everybody is a shut up, cut up.

730
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,180
Ain't one of them around.

731
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,580
Are you going to tell me that's a lie?

732
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,520
Bitch, I'll f*** your ass up.

733
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,860
I used to be an exterminator.

734
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,420
Hmm.

735
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,460
Your lawyer wants to be the prosecuting attorney.

736
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,360
Bail him out and get him in here.

737
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,740
Mr. President, I'd like them neighbors to know we go out together once in a while.

738
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,040
I love you. Did you take your pill?

739
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,000
It's OK. Just don't send me the laundry bill.

740
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,100
What do you got to say to yourself, sonny?

741
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,220
I feel like an Oreo cookie.

742
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,600
You look like a pile of sh**.

743
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,860
The best I can do is 350.

744
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,140
Thousand.

745
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,760
100 is the best I can do.

746
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,380
Hey man.

747
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,920
If you want reality, I'm going to put you back on the streets.

748
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,800
1,200 is the best I can do.

749
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,620
I think anything I would say would just be redundant.

750
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,780
Make it six. The best I can do.

751
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,000
Don't push me, pal. It's perfect for you.

752
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,640
If it's me, the best is 9,000.

753
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,580
9,000?

754
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,580
The best I can do.

755
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,580
Forget it.

756
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,640
Make it six. Six. Six thousand.

757
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,540
Yeah, yeah.

758
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,940
At least he's not superstitious.

759
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,620
Thank you.

760
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,100
I think we got a winner.

761
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,740
We bet.

762
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,240
It's going to be a pleasure working with you.

763
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,860
You said we were going to do things with integrity and style.

764
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,640
And that's why you get less money.

765
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,600
Because you don't think.

766
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,120
I never thought of it that way.

767
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,460
What we're doing is worse than anything our predecessors have ever done.

768
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,000
But now we have a moment of joviality.

769
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,540
We relax.

770
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,360
We sit down.

771
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,900
We partake of a bit of grass.

772
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,940
I've got some good shit.

773
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,500
I have a feeling that there's a lot of untapped talent around here.

774
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,960
It's funny because it's well-informed.

775
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,520
That's what I always say.

776
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,360
I shifted myself into a cheerful trance

777
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,980
When the skeleton in the closet started to dance

778
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,460
A goblin giggled with fiendish glee

779
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,600
A shout banged out from the big banshee

780
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,480
Amazement was in every ghostly glance

781
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,720
When the skeleton in the closet started to dance

782
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,900
All the witches were in stitches

783
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,000
While the steps made rhythmic thumps

784
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,320
And they nearly dropped the broomsticks

785
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,280
When he tried to do the bumps

786
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,520
You never heard such unearthly laughter

787
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,580
Or such hilarious groans

788
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,060
When the skeleton in the closet rattled his bones

789
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,080
Excellent.

790
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,700
It was a dark road, but it led in a new direction.

791
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,100
I tell you, the day Rome falls,

792
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,700
there will be a shout of freedom.

793
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,620
Freedom such as the world has never heard before.

794
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,180
Oh, there's already a guy in here.

795
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,240
Far be it from me to gloat at another downfall.

796
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,660
I have a feeling no children are going to be crying

797
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,800
when this puppy is put to sleep.

798
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,800
The country is in a terrible state.

799
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,640
We don't know what to do about it.

800
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,320
That's not what I'm interested in.

801
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,580
At a gaudy White House reception,

802
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,720
the president proclaimed...

803
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,500
Hey, hey, look at me!

804
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,080
I'm a TV antenna.

805
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,540
Am I getting good reception?

806
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,700
Mr. President, you're a recovering alcoholic.

807
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,520
The wild turkey flows.

808
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,620
We've been here.

809
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,220
I'm sensible.

810
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,480
He knows that, and I know that.

811
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,680
It is no accident that we haven't been hit by intelligence in more than four years.

812
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,860
I think he recognizes that I can't party alone.

813
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,640
You're lucky if your vices get any attention at all.

814
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,400
Like my secretary of the state.

815
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,680
And it's important to make this point at the outset.

816
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,760
When he's abroad,

817
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,360
one of the most prehensile-ass people in the city.

818
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,040
Don't pay no attention to that, Algie.

819
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,700
He can't.

820
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,600
He can't even hold a gun, much less shoot it.

821
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,080
And of course, we all know that for two years in Austin, Texas,

822
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,760
Dick Cheney played Magenta.

823
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,580
That's a male role. What's up with that?

824
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,020
He acts like it never happened now.

825
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,820
I think it's disgusting.

826
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,380
It's awful.

827
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,420
Cheney.

828
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,860
The great white hunter.

829
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,740
You see, people don't see the fun side of Dick.

830
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,000
In fact, I didn't know a thing about that hunting episode

831
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,780
down in Texas till I saw him on America's Most Wanted.

832
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,120
But Dick's a good man.

833
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,640
He has a good heart.

834
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,500
My God.

835
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,020
This man is dying.

836
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,380
Someone get a doctor!

837
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,540
Well, he's a good man.

838
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,700
I'm sorry Vice President Cheney couldn't be here tonight.

839
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,700
Oh yeah.

840
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,560
Don't shoot.

841
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,920
What's that?

842
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,160
Cover your heart!

843
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,500
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

844
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,260
Cheney, what a goofball.

845
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,680
Justice Scalia.

846
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,820
Justice Alito.

847
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,080
Well observed.

848
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,980
Hey boys, bet it feels good to be out from under those robes.

849
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,100
Everybody laughed.

850
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,820
It's funny because it's true.

851
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,120
Yes! Victory swig!

852
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,160
I met him in a boxcar a couple of years ago.

853
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,260
I was fooling around with my harmonica and...

854
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:14,360
Shh!

855
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,380
...well, she comes over and joins in.

856
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:16,880
Shh!

857
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,480
I haven't been able to shake him since.

858
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,240
Boy, this is the first time I've relaxed since I took office and it feels good!

859
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,900
I love America because it's full of Americans.

860
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,360
I don't know where you did say you hated Crooklyn.

861
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,120
We're an America that should come together, Republican and Democrat and Alex Trebek of Jeopardy.

862
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,200
You look wretched.

863
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,500
George suddenly realized something was missing.

864
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,360
Could be home asleep.

865
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,300
Let me tell you, I saw his eyes.

866
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,660
He was stoned.

867
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,540
There he is.

868
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,460
Begin accomplice.

869
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,740
If you weren't drunk I'd...

870
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,700
Oh my God!

871
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,960
The President's off his ass!

872
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,100
Oh my God!

873
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,020
Woohoo!

874
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,780
Can't catch this doggie!

875
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,940
Mr. President, stop!

876
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,560
Toga!

877
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,400
Toga!

878
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,320
Mr. President, what are you doing?

879
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,480
Sir, you've got to put on your clothes!

880
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,520
You can't make me!

881
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,660
I don't want to wear a suit!

882
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,140
Good Lord!

883
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,200
I want to be naked!

884
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
He's more licker than man!

885
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,580
Man drink like that and he's gonna eat.

886
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,280
He's just going to die.

887
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,740
I hope it's true.

888
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,520
Boy, I'm so sorry.

889
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:15,520


890
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:15,520


891
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:15,520


892
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:15,520


893
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:15,520


894
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:15,520


895
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,120
I'm gonna kiss his ass.

896
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:16,640
Ha ha!

897
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,360
Look at me!

898
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,020
I'm running unopposed!

899
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,440
Woohoo!

900
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,220
That's my first class.

901
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,120
Mr. President!

902
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,740
It would be prudent to go.

903
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,080
Hail to the Chief!

904
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,480
Da da dee da dee da.

905
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,800
You're hallucinating, George.

906
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,180
Damn!

907
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,100
Trapdoor.

908
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,960
No elected office holder had made such an abrupt or eccentric exit from public life.

909
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,800
I've seen enough.

910
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,500
As honorary chairman of the welcoming committee, it is my privilege to introduce Mr. President.

911
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:45,500


912
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:45,500


913
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,920
To extend to you a laurel and hearty handshake.

914
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,520
Yeah, I love you, Pill.

915
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,920
You see, in another 25 years you'll be able to shake your hands in broad daylight.

916
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,240
I just want a lifeboat.

917
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,400
Joe, I'd like to go and crucify you, baby.

918
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,140
You, did you take your pill?

919
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,600
Man's been elected and you voted for him.

920
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,980
We all voted for him.

921
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,240
Because we thought no one else would vote for him.

922
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,660
You're the one that was paid the 30 pieces of silver.

923
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,020
Have you forgotten that?

924
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,300
And I will defend that mistake with my life.

925
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,180
Forget it.

926
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,260
Where's the president?

927
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,720
He wanted to keep partying, so he snuck out the back.

928
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,120
Great.

929
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,380
If you want to better yourself, you need to spend more time with someone you can read

930
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,080
or at least get through a single sentence without spitting.

931
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,680
Uh, is there anything important we needed to, uh, remember or do?

932
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,380
Oh!

933
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,260
Ivan, in a flash of generosity, had returned with a second van load of free plants.

934
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,560
My goodness, Ivan.

935
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm stunned.

936
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,720
Super Jenkum Haze.

937
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,280
That's why I'm the way you should be.

938
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,340
Now, young bushy pot plants, which he spread out making decorative ceiling.

939
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,120
All right.

940
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,740
Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm whose initials are TB was trying to use that

941
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:06,320
to shove his way into the white house so TB could put the screws so he could turn out

942
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,400
the lights in those lights.

943
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,720
Not anymore.

944
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,720
No one would be stupid enough to believe that.

945
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,020
If I vote Democrat, it will not happen again.

946
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,440
And we'll be here to save whatever's left.

947
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,660
So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh?

948
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,320
Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice fat slice of the John Doe's, eh?

949
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,340
I don't remember.

950
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,200
What do you think?

951
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,400
Cut him some slack.

952
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:31,100
Uh, they overbooked the lobotomy lab and we had to wait an hour and a half to get our

953
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,760
lobotomies.

954
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,680
It's all dripping out of your ears now.

955
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,020
We're ready to meet his terms.

956
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,280
We're ready to turn the whole economy over to him.

957
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,140
We're willing to surrender altogether.

958
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,720
If he'd only tell us when, how.

959
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,020
Where.

960
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,520
The place?

961
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,880
The grounds of the capital, Washington, D.C.

962
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,560
The Potomac in the sunset is a river turned to flame.

963
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,000
And the blue-hot cherry blossoms is like nothing you can name.

964
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,880
That's why we like to be in Washington, D.C.

965
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,740
Oh, it's cold out here, Mother.

966
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,700
Congress decided to leave the Capitol.

967
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,600
We hold all inaugurations outdoors.

968
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,440
Whoo!

969
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,460
Nice one.

970
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,560
Hey, how you doing?

971
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,800
Your new president gonna give you a new pair of shoes?

972
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,940
Yeah, he's working on it.

973
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,160
Hey, Barney, listen.

974
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,840
You know, I'm a fine-looking kind of man.

975
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,380
I got real regular features, real regular clothes.

976
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,220
Yeah, you're very...

977
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,400
Well, we've gotta be flexible.

978
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:37,940
Then this country will once more become a sanctuary for a vanishing species, the rational

979
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,340
being.

980
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,480
What are you talking about, man?

981
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,660
Whack-o.

982
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,540
I've stood things this long.

983
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:43,680
I've stood things this long.

984
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,680


985
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,680


986
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,680


987
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,680


988
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,680


989
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,680


990
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,580
I can stand them just a little longer.

991
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,380
It won't be long.

992
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,360
As if on cue.

993
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,100
The sheriff is a .

994
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,680
One thing, the sheriff is near.

995
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,560
Now, I've got a friend who's named Rivers.

996
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,820
The sheriff is a .

997
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,500
What's the deal?

998
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,040
A guy needs somebody.

999
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,620
Near.

1000
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,060
It's a great day for a celebration and a great day for United Tools.

1001
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,920
We're gonna waste a minute for Mr. Rich, because he said he'd be here.

1002
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,760
Today marks the miracle of story.

1003
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,660
Here at United Tools, once again, we're gonna be here.

1004
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,660


1005
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,660


1006
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,660


1007
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,660


1008
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,660


1009
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,660


1010
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,660


1011
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,660


1012
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,660


1013
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,500
The sheriff, who's been bankrupt and about to disappear forever, is now celebrating a

1014
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,900
new lease on life.

1015
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
Can we see the president, Grandpa?

1016
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,600
Can we, Mom?

1017
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,140
You can watch him from here.

1018
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,300
But I wanna get up close.

1019
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:28,920
No dice.

1020
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,960
you, and the establishment, and you people who are trying to make me part of

1021
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,360
the unestablished establishment.

1022
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,340
Well absorbed.

1023
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,700
Oh, I can see them going up to the grandstand now.

1024
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,700
Oh, it's a very impressive sight.

1025
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,380
Come on.

1026
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,560
Now, we've got a great day for United Tools.

1027
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:43,640
We're gonna waste a minute for Mr. Rich, because he said he'd be here.

1028
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:43,640


1029
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:43,640


1030
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:43,640


1031
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:43,640


1032
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:43,640


1033
00:37:45,420 --> 00:38:03,780
Oh, we've got a great day for Mr. Rich, because he said he'd be here.

1034
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:03,780


1035
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:03,920
We're gonna waste a minute for Mr. Rich, because he said he'd be here.

1036
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,500
Come on, we've got a great day for Mr. Rich, because he said he'd be here.

1037
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,760
Oh, it's a very impressive sight.

1038
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,240
That bastard.

1039
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,220
A new king?

1040
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,880
No more kings are going to push us around, son.

1041
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,880
We're Americans.

1042
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,860
Yeah, right.

1043
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,820
I hope nothing unsavory happens during my visit.

1044
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,740
As you know, I am the president of the United States.

1045
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,460
Which president?

1046
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,500
All right, let's do this.

1047
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,340
Let's kick some ass.

1048
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,820
Away from me, loser.

1049
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh, Jesus.

1050
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:26,680
Oh.

1051
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,260
How do you say useless in Texan?

1052
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,680
President.

1053
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,180
Adolf.

1054
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,480
Bush.

1055
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,760
All right, maintain.

1056
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,660
Maintain.

1057
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,480
I'm going to pretend I like being here.

1058
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,620
Got a hangover?

1059
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,040
I just want a picture of that drugstore where I found you.

1060
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,420
What do you got to say to yourself, sonny?

1061
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,400
Howdy.

1062
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,040
There goes the man's face, see?

1063
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,100
See that guy's reaction when Bush shakes his hand?

1064
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,560
Surprise, then disappointment.

1065
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,480
Their embrace was a battle.

1066
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,120
The climax of victory.

1067
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,420
It was a political act.

1068
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,320
Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.

1069
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,080
Say what?

1070
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,900
Why are they sitting together?

1071
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,300
In this country.

1072
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,280
Once the election is over, everyone accepts the people's choice.

1073
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,120
Ha, ha, ha.

1074
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,280
Ha, sure.

1075
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,460
Guess I should let him know he'll be taking the reins.

1076
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,180
The Rock looked malevolently at the idiot George.

1077
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,000
Give up and get out of the way and let those of us who can start from scratch out of the ruins.

1078
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,460
His voice was mocking, harsh, and tense.

1079
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,860
Play it any way you please.

1080
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,800
Dumbly, dumb George shook his head.

1081
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,740
His lips were tightly compressed.

1082
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,320
I hate that kind of bastard.

1083
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,700
I've seen plenty of him.

1084
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,060
He always wins.

1085
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,320
I hate that.

1086
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,880
I hate that kind of guy.

1087
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,760
Who is the president right now about all this?

1088
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,940
It sounds like he's angry.

1089
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,640
I think it's fair to say that the president is a war to fight.

1090
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,900
He's going to continue to fight it in a way that brings people together.

1091
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,820
Hold hands.

1092
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,120
Come on, it's not gay.

1093
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,040
There's guns in the room.

1094
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,980
Because that's what American people expect from their leaders in Washington.

1095
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,820
No, sir.

1096
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,220
No, sirree.

1097
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,280
Bum, bum, bum.

1098
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,700
No.

1099
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,080
You're going to have him say anything.

1100
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,820
Why don't you let him say something simple and real?

1101
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,300
Something.

1102
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:06,480


1103
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah.

1104
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,960
Let's hit them with some rhetorical eloquence.

1105
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,600
Mother, they're beginning.

1106
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,200
Oh.

1107
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:14,940
Let's listen.

1108
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,820
My fellow Americans, in the words of Sigmund Freud, I have a dream.

1109
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:35,520
My friends, our purple mountains with ramparts red glare,

1110
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,220
white with foam and justice for all,

1111
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,400
fruity plains gallantly streaming,

1112
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,520
from sea to shining sea with a shining city on a shining hill above a shining prairie,

1113
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,140
and maybe some shiny trees and a few shrubs, I see a shiny America.

1114
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:54,880
Ah.

1115
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,940
Be, be, be, be.

1116
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,260
At the moment of greatest passion and conviction,

1117
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,000
that curtain flapped in his head and he forgot what he'd been driving at.

1118
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,980
Ah.

1119
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:05,980


1120
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,780
Ooh.

1121
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,140
Ah.

1122
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,860
He saw a look of bewilderment on all the faces around him.

1123
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,160
So today I announce my resignation as president.

1124
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,600
Yeah!

1125
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,280
Yeah!

1126
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,700
Yeah!

1127
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,520
Yeah!

1128
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:34,840


1129
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,080


1130
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:35,620


1131
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:35,620


1132
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:35,960
Yeah!

1133
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,080
1-2-1-2, ladies and gentlemen, I am Chris Rock.

1134
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:18,460
It is my pleasure, it is my treat, it is my honor to introduce to you the man that needs no introductions.

1135
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:31,160
Ladies and gents, get ready for the Ticalian Stallion, a.k.a. Johnny Blaze, a.k.a. the Iron Lung, a.k.a. Mr. King K.

1136
00:42:31,160 --> 00:43:01,000
a.k.a. Mr. Weatherby, a.k.a. Mr. Henkey, a.k.a. Mr. Tim, a.k.a. Marla Gibbs, a.k.a. the Say Hey Kid, a.k.a. the Frisco Kid, a.k.a. Kid Dynamite, a.k.a. Velvet Jones, a.k.a. Jojo Dancer, a.k.a. Joe Ski Love,

1137
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:12,300
a.k.a. Donnie Brasco, a.k.a. Donnie Moss, a.k.a. Donnie Osmond, a.k.a.

1138
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,400
Stupid.

1139
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,120
Excuse me while I whip this out.

1140
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:27,300
You don't have to accept. It's a terrible job. Don't take it.

1141
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,380
The changes I'm going to make will be minimal.

1142
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,060
I'm not going to rock the...

1143
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,480
The boat? Rocking the boat's a drag.

1144
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,020
What you do is sink the boat.

1145
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,800
And there's no sense sinking nothing unless you can salvage with productive alternatives.

1146
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,740
And, brothers, you can't change nothing with rhetoric and slogans.

1147
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:49,280
Because if a man's really got the truth in his pocket, he doesn't talk about it.

1148
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,300
He hangs it out on a shingle where people can see it.

1149
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:58,080
So from now on, the name of this agency is Truth and Soul.

1150
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,820
Right on!

1151
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:01,900
Yeah!

1152
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,760
Yeah!

1153
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,980
The leader spread his hands out in a gesture of pained helplessness.

1154
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,640
Just give me 24 hours to come up with a brilliant idea to save our town.

1155
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,500
How do we know that?

1156
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,180
Just 24 hours.

1157
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:14,900
Yeah!

1158
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,500
Come on, come on.

1159
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,720
Bring it back, back.

1160
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,860
Levely, stand.

1161
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,520
And then back.

1162
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,380
Oh, y'all old school studios, 54.

1163
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,160
Bring it.

1164
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,040
And then back.

1165
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,040


1166
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,040


1167
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,040


1168
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,040


1169
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,040


1170
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,040


1171
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,040


1172
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,040


1173
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,040


1174
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,360
Oh, dude, I did the work.

1175
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:32,760
Fuckin' hell.

1176
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,340
Fuckin' hell.

1177
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,100
Fuckin' hell.

1178
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,520
I do.

1179
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,380
Anything.

1180
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,400
Anything.

1181
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,380
Thanks, man.

1182
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,000
Anything.

1183
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,300
Odeon is where I'm fleeing.

1184
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,180
All I've seen.

1185
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,580
Dominant supreme being.

1186
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,540
Face the mental.

1187
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,420
Deep concentration.

1188
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,820
Break the point on a pencil.

1189
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,560
Keep my cliches out your dental.

1190
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,120
Capisce?

1191
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,900
That I've been through is cause for parental discretion.

1192
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,760
No question.

1193
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,780
My website connections are laid confidential.

1194
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,740
World don't stop unless it's mental.

1195
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,760
That and residential.

1196
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,520
You with it?

1197
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,100
Contain forever and a day.

1198
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,380
Till I'm old and decayed.

1199
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:00,860
I'm committed.

1200
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,160
Look, Ma, we did it.

1201
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,280
Time for the world.

1202
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,520
Tell it to my firstborn and my baby girl.

1203
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,340
Did it my way.

1204
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,920
Take the low road or the highway.

1205
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,260
Out the sunroof yelling, thank God it's Friday.

1206
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,320
Show a nigga love.

1207
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,140
If he got my sound full of plug, he's not underground.

1208
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:14,780
Call him up.

1209
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,460
When I flood the airwaves, household and stairways.

1210
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,120
Waiting for these paydays.

1211
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,680
Think not of the ends.

1212
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,900
If I got 20, my brother get 10.

1213
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,540
Now let the madness begin.

1214
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,340
Nothing in the world that I won't do.

1215
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,560
I give my world to you if you want me to.

1216
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,360
I do.

1217
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,360


1218
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,360


1219
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,360


1220
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,360


1221
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,360


1222
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,360


1223
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,360


1224
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,360


1225
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,300
Anything.

1226
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:31,940
Anything.

1227
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,060
Anything.

1228
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:33,700
Anything.

1229
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,620
There's nothing in the world that I won't do.

1230
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,900
I give my world to you if you want me to.

1231
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,620
I do.

1232
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,340
Anything.

1233
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,660
Yo, yo, yo.

1234
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,720
We got love for those with love for us.

1235
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,460
Baby, you can look but don't touch.

1236
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,520
You fried off the dust.

1237
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,760
And plus, the only thing I trust is a fund.

1238
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,320
They no fun.

1239
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,660
Just paranoid niggas toting guns in a paddle.

1240
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,460
Keep us camouflaged in the shadows.

1241
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,820
That's where I bring this tale that you never get the tattles.

1242
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,060
Obliterate the tri-state and the crime rate.

1243
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,340
Tell it to my firstborn and my baby girl.

1244
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,340


1245
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,340


1246
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,340


1247
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,340


1248
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,700
I don't swine.

1249
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,420
Niggas fly straight.

1250
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,380
You can call it fate.

1251
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,080
And if it ain't mine, call it fake.

1252
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,280
Bottom line in the case.

1253
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,440
Spoon feed the track.

1254
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,880
Just a taste of the side dish.

1255
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,060
Soon for the day I come right like Embouché.

1256
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,460
For them dead presidents.

1257
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,520
What you saying?

1258
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,000
He saying?

1259
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:13,620
She saying?

1260
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,120
They say.

1261
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,180
Fake hate the premises.

1262
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,400
Caught up in the mainland.

1263
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,460
Sentence this song.

1264
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,860
To 25 years hard labor in the system.

1265
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,600
Where it takes the form of my wisdom.

1266
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,380
Respect mine.

1267
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,040
Take my time and protect nine.

1268
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,560
Next on the front line.

1269
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,160
Mr. Mac.

1270
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,160
No more, no less.

1271
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,800
What you see is what your ass get.

1272
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,620
Set it off.

1273
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,040
I suggest.

1274
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,320
I'm a man.

1275
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:30,320


1276
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,340
I fight.

1277
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,020
Niggas fly straight.

1278
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,020


1279
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,020


1280
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,020


1281
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,020


1282
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,020


1283
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,020


1284
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:48,500
Let yourDY done, so anything you want to do with me in my world.

1285
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,140
No business man this post.

1286
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,140


1287
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,820
Hip hop on godt that I got me car.

1288
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:50,980
Yup everything'spay me.

1289
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,060
So and contains.

1290
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,160
Yeah.

1291
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,520
Your cry for help.

1292
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:55,640


1293
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,260
訴고 scoop.

1294
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,260


1295
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,260


1296
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,860
Bust aうわ wall of 잠aime.

1297
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,520
Ça quei eras veux mais?

1298
00:46:59,520 --> 00:46:59,520


1299
00:46:59,520 --> 00:46:59,580
The thing with itつväc yine???

1300
00:46:59,580 --> 00:46:59,600
Started playing and he s'old площt my balet,

1301
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,000
Get on out of here

1302
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,620
We're gonna have some greasy fingers

1303
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,860
And some chickens

1304
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,400
And all the beautiful things that people have

1305
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Who have it

1306
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,720
And you ain't got it

1307
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,360
So get on out, you understand

1308
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,920
We're not gonna take any more of your jobs

1309
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,500
But let's move and fall, you understand

1310
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,480
To the soul

1311
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,620
This is the beginning of a better world for all of us

1312
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,600
Oh, that's out of the question

1313
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,020
What are you talking about, man?

1314
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,000
You heard his speech

1315
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,620
Yeah

1316
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,400
Sorry, kid

1317
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,960
No, come off it

1318
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,320
Why?

1319
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,740
Personally, I'd agree with you, but

1320
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,800
We can't give people the impression that we're endorsing that speech

1321
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,400
I'm a freedom-loving man, but people aren't ready for freedom

1322
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,540
We can't adopt an idealistic theory which the country isn't ready for

1323
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,720
There's no emoticon for what I'm feeling

1324
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,720
It's the most vicious speech ever made

1325
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,840
It will make people demand to be happy

1326
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,340
It's only a speech

1327
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,900
It was much too intellectual for the common man

1328
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,180
People are too dumb to understand it

1329
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,280
Ooh, good point

1330
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:57,960
The leader

1331
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,280
Burst

1332
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:58,900
Burst out laughing

1333
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,060
I'm not gonna help you pretend that there's still a way to make it work and to save your neck

1334
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,320
There isn't

1335
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,180
Give up

1336
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,300
All of you

1337
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,580
You and your Washington friends and your looting planners and the whole of your cannibal philosophy

1338
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,000
You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot

1339
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,180
You forgot the prize stooge of the world

1340
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,640
This is a matter of intelligence and, uh...

1341
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,540
Oh, can't you see this man isn't a hero?

1342
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,060
Oh, absolutely

1343
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,540
Uh, couldn't agree more

1344
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,000
Do I?

1345
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,660
You're a fake, I can prove it

1346
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,140
Meaning?

1347
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,260
Ask the president

1348
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,580
Please do repeat again, and I will translate it for the president

1349
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,000
Ask if he intends to take legal action

1350
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,420
The president replied, I ain't fungified, Heidi, who bought no liquefaction, no ways

1351
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,920
Then scratched his rear, hitched up his pants, and scratched his rear again

1352
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,200
And he said more that I don't remember now

1353
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,040
Given what we've been saying about him

1354
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,480
Warm, tender, caring, kind to people

1355
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:57,580
There's a wonderful story of sharing with the president that one of his policies had actually handicapped

1356
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,340
a baby

1357
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,780
We have new ideas about how people should live

1358
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,920
George Bush doesn't care about people

1359
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,560
He'll know

1360
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,300
George Bush doesn't care about black people

1361
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,240
I will not even honor that with a response

1362
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,720
Screw him

1363
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,360
This is an outrage

1364
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,480
Man, what's wrong with your face?

1365
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,940
He slowly began to come apart

1366
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,120
I, I, we, we, we don't talk about, you know, the dark races

1367
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,600
Like, I, we, we, we, we, we, we, we like to torture

1368
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,440
That has been our...

1369
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:27,960
Policy

1370
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,000
You lazy bastard

1371
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,260
I've never said that

1372
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,380
Um

1373
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,120
You've got to keep at me

1374
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,040
Through clenched teeth, George said

1375
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,000
The American people expect us to torture people, but I really meant to say

1376
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,600
Men are only too willing to hate and love and kill if they believe it is not a sin

1377
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,980
Or that they will be held guiltless in the eyes of their God

1378
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,160
Prayer and religion sustain me

1379
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,340
I never want to impose my religion on anybody else

1380
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,760
With the Middle East

1381
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,380
Oh, that's awful

1382
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,480
After those holy words, fetid marsh fumes doesn't hide it

1383
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,160
Hell yes

1384
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,060
What's funny about it, George demanded defensively, entranced with his own picture

1385
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,180
The president resolved all doubts about his choice for a replacement

1386
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,620
I, I, I want you to know something

1387
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,820
When I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it

1388
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,700
There was a pause

1389
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,580
Then his voice came slowly, changed, grave

1390
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,540
But when I say I'm going to turn our duties over to others

1391
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,560
You know, I totally reject that

1392
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,620
Dog, we don't need lame bulls**t

1393
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,320
The rock snarled at him

1394
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,720
George cried out

1395
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,740
Expect an epic battle between the old regime

1396
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,820
To put an end to your dreams

1397
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,620
What is coming is even worse

1398
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,520
The leader burst out laughing

1399
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,860
It's too much, met you

1400
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,300
And, uh, uh, that's, that's reality

1401
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,880
If you want reality, I'm going to put you back on the street

1402
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,680
This was too bitter for George

1403
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,720
Who forgot his timidity and he began to cry out shrilly

1404
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,180
Then maybe you ought to just go on home

1405
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:54,660
Bulls**t

1406
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,560
George butted back on his heels and showed his teeth as far as he could go

1407
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,280
The rock began screaming wildly

1408
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,300
I'm gonna kill you

1409
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,120
His desires for revenge knew no limits

1410
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,540
Pain mingled with his pleasures

1411
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,340
Creating a bloodlust insanity

1412
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,920
Are you crazy?

1413
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,420
First time to realize there's no one anywhere

1414
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,980
Has the president taken leave of his faculty?

1415
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,680
This is a nightmare scenario

1416
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,240
I have carefully weighed the options

1417
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,840
It was our duty to slaughter the innocent

1418
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,460
Chaos is the greatest ally

1419
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,400
In this struggle

1420
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,440
I have carefully weighed the lessons of September the 11th

1421
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,840
And you know what?

1422
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,820
We will demolish the dictator

1423
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,240
Obama bin Laden

1424
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,680
The bolting look came into his blue eyes

1425
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,160
And the United States is quitting its nine

1426
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,960
That's the time

1427
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,900
What's quitting its nine?

1428
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,680
I hear the voices

1429
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,180
And I'm the decider

1430
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,440
And I decide what is best

1431
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,500
And what's best is to remain as the decider

1432
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,400
He grinned suddenly

1433
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,480
And I saw a wonderful opportunity to do that

1434
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,540
He'd stopped and looked at the clock

1435
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,940
You see the spirit often if you know where to look

1436
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,420
That can be achieved in a variety of ways

1437
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,420
We are supporting the White House and what they're doing

1438
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,840
And I am determined and brutal

1439
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,060
George held out his hand and twisted the fingers into a fist

1440
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,920
Unconstrained by conscience

1441
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,320
Behind the president's creepy lopsided frown

1442
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,980
Was the incendiary fervor of a terrorist

1443
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,600
The animal instinct

1444
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,180
The simple undifferentiated desire

1445
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,240
The ethics of an intestinal bacterium

1446
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,000
It means that we have to move quickly

1447
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,740
George's tone grew decisive

1448
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:38,960
And in a way that is effective and sometimes lethal

1449
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,060
Whatever works, I am for

1450
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,020
He'd stopped and looked up

1451
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,340
He scanned for nothing in particular

1452
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,880
Just a sign

1453
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,900
With a deadly effort like wrenching a piece out of his own brain

1454
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,160
He saw the page of a gigantic calendar suspended in the sky

1455
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,520
The rectangle said September 11th

1456
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,600
George scowled meaningfully

1457
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,560
Huge structures collapsing

1458
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,040
I did not insist, right on

1459
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,400
That was the force that would tear the party to pieces

1460
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,560
Plenty

1461
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,120
Instead of letting that just stand there

1462
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,460
We're not gonna allow it

1463
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,080
Grab ahold of that thing and do something

1464
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:17,940
Let's give this a try

1465
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,880
We're there to help

1466
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,040
Um, just, um

1467
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:22,880
Boo!

1468
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,180
I have a dream

1469
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,920
Boo! No way!

1470
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,560
It's like this here

1471
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,260
Come on! Are you out of your mind?

1472
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,460
We can all come together

1473
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,680
Here's a visual

1474
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,560
See here, lookie here

1475
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,100
See there?

1476
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,100
President White's here to look up there

1477
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,840
Huh?

1478
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,280
See there's the church

1479
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,000
And there's the staple

1480
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,060
Ladies and gentlemen

1481
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,920
Let us have a moment of silent prayer

1482
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,960
For their wholeness and harmony

1483
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,280
My God, what is that?

1484
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,160
Oh my God!

1485
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,860
My God, you weren't kidding

1486
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,660
Let us lay out a carpet of bread

1487
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,660
Let us silence this bleeding of the sheep

1488
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:02,700
Smite them

1489
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,640
Deliver them unto my hand

1490
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,540
Oh no!

1491
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,160
I mean that is big

1492
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,240
That is not nothing, what we are doing

1493
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,300
The ground under the foundation is shifting

1494
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,020
But I can't figure out why

1495
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,340
Here it comes

1496
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,460
God bless me, he said with a dark chuckle

1497
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,900
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

1498
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,400
George was loopy on my doll's Johnny Walker

1499
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,240
And pure criminal adrenaline

1500
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,320
There was a gnashing of teeth

1501
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,020
And a smashing of windows

1502
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,260
You see the Democrats blocked out when

1503
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,840
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1504
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,480
Nailed it

1505
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,780
See there it goes again

1506
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,500
Oh I hope George had nothing to do with this

1507
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,380
Been did and cuddly

1508
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,780
People have been braided

1509
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,480
I've been braided

1510
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,560
Whatever you do, don't apologize

1511
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,820
Just make them feel guilty

1512
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,160
How about they get this debris removed

1513
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,120
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

1514
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,580
That scene says a lot about America

1515
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,300
The nation gasped

1516
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,020
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

1517
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:04,920
You did what?

1518
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,800
A terrible thing's happened

1519
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,820
Oh my God!

1520
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,260
Not a brick left standing

1521
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,320
Call the priest

1522
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,560
In the uproar that followed

1523
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,700
This was one of the loudest voices

1524
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,480
I'm feeling chipper tonight

1525
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,040
I survived the White House shake up

1526
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

1527
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,420
People were ducking and diving for cover

1528
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1529
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,620
You should have seen his face

1530
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,480
Uh oh

1531
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,660
George stopped

1532
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,360
What's he doing?

1533
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,440
He cleared his throat and went on

1534
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,660
I wish I could have been there

1535
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1536
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,180
Now watch this drive

1537
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,300
Cough, cough, cough

1538
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:35,940
Cough, cough, cough

1539
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,800
But it was dust and ashes in his mouth

1540
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,780
Cough, cough, cough

1541
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,260
He was covered with boils

1542
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:40,840
Eee

1543
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,160
Oh

1544
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,460
This is a national disaster

1545
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,700
Maybe we should call FEMA

1546
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,480
I am sick of your snide comments

1547
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,560
President Bush is a good, honest man

1548
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,320
And you're a liar

1549
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,400
I didn't know one monkey could not

1550
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,500
Knock over a building

1551
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,840
Raise to the ground

1552
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,340
No, George didn't cause that

1553
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,260
That side of the building was unsafe

1554
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,120
Now, let's have no more curiosity

1555
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,400
About this bizarre terror

1556
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:00,840
Ha ha ha

1557
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,400
Wrong again, liberal media

1558
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,320
I'm proud to be an American

1559
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,700
Cough, cough, cough

1560
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,640
Cough, cough, cough

1561
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,240
The president has made clear

1562
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,580
Our enemy is not just Al-Qaeda

1563
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,760
It's the people

1564
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,120
I would have done everything in my power

1565
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,400
To kill the American people

1566
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,260
Nimbles, nimbles gonna rise again

1567
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,460
Gonna exercise our friend

1568
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,080
Tries again

1569
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,000
Gonna tax us up

1570
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,960
Till our eyes again

1571
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,200
When it gets them open at my bones

1572
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,000
I want you to know something

1573
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,260
When I say I'm gonna do something

1574
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,080
I'm gonna do it

1575
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,000
He's starting it all

1576
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,820
Get him

1577
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,300
Silence

1578
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,180
Silence, you perverts

1579
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:41,280
I think one of the things that people want us to do here

1580
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,480
Is to play a blame game, I think

1581
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,300
We gotta solve problems

1582
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,660
We're problem solvers

1583
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,720
There'll be ample time for people to figure out what went right

1584
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,000
And what went right

1585
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,960
Say what?

1586
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,860
I'm confident we can work together to achieve a fat scene

1587
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,640
It is not whether the bullet hit him from ground fire

1588
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,000
While he was still in the helicopter

1589
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,700
Or after he fell to the ground

1590
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,880
And hit by ground fire

1591
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,700
Or after someone came up and shot him again

1592
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,240
What?

1593
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:08,820
What?

1594
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,800
I looked him straight in the eye and I said

1595
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,460
Speaking of suspects

1596
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,760
Where's Joe Biden and John McCain?

1597
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,320
We may never know that

1598
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,700
What's important is that

1599
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,180
The only thing we can learn about this

1600
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,660
Is that the United States of America

1601
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,360
Decided to go in

1602
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,300
And get the body to safety

1603
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,820
And the United States of America is leaning forward and not back

1604
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,480
One of the good things about America

1605
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,740
And then, and

1606
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,600
All of us understand that we will develop the truth over time

1607
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,520
The truth has many facets

1608
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,940
Oh, shut up

1609
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:49,220
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut and I'll see him

1610
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,360
I'm taking from you

1611
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,180
What are we to do?

1612
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,520
The man who answered would thereafter be the man in power

1613
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,240
George blurted out the last confession of incompetence

1614
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,600
I've suffered mightily

1615
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,680
That's really important as far as I'm concerned

1616
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,860
Got four more years, I've got more to do

1617
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,740
To continue to raise standards of insanity

1618
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:15,040
Through the power of one who while we speak is temporizing

1619
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,920
He ousted coming back with head held high

1620
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,700
Oh no

1621
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,080
Oh yes

1622
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,700
You're our president now

1623
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,400
Win-win

1624
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,300
It's done, we have four more lights left sir

1625
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,060
Four more

1626
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,740
I love America

1627
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,300
With time,

1628
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,660
Lenin and Hitler will be back on its feet

1629
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:37,020
And America will be a stronger place for it

1630
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,320
Welcome to Dick Cheney's America

1631
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,160
Oh no, not again

1632
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,000
And again and again and again

1633
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,900
Gird up thy loins for the day of judgment is soon

1634
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,820
Soon at hand battle with all thy strength

1635
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,820
Lest the Democrats return again

1636
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,200
And there was great reaction

1637
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,420
Yea, wherefore I say unto you my brother

1638
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,060
Let us pray

1639
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,320
God bless America

1640
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,760
Of all the horrors in the world

1641
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,760
Said Winston with his eyes tightly shut

1642
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,860
Back in a nightmare

1643
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,660
Oh my god

1644
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,920
They faced a black hole of unrelieved darkness

1645
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,180
The country's in the very best of hands

1646
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,220
Of the world

1647
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,420
The world is in a dark abyss

1648
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:23,420


1649
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,140
Please kill me

1650
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,040
Okay, okay

1651
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:27,900
Ah!

1652
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:28,620
Ah!

1653
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,480
Ah!

1654
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,780
Ah!

1655
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,440
Oh!

1656
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,360
Oh god!

1657
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,200
Oh god!

1658
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,480
Oh!

1659
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,180
Oh!

1660
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:34,600


1661
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,180
Oh!

1662
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,540
Oh!

1663
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:36,600
Oh!

1664
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:36,920
Oh!

1665
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,460
Oh!
