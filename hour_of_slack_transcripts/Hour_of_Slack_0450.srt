1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
The show ends, the show begins, the show begins another cycle of shows.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,820
We want you to never forget these awful shows.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,000
The terrible wasted lives that you've spent.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,680
The collective years of listening to this rotten show.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,820
And you don't even get it.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,000
On a friendly basis.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,340
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,220
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

9
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,100
The subgenius hour of sweat.

10
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:15,040
The flow is the task above today.

11
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,960
There is no other way.

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,700
You gotta trust us.

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,240
When you need a friend.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,160
To find us.

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,560
You gotta look within.

16
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,380
You gotta trust us.

17
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,100
You gotta trust us.

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,380
Before you turn to dust.

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,080
Before you turn to dust.

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,620
You gotta see it before you see.

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,340
You gotta feel it before you feel.

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,000
You gotta see it before you feel.

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,900
You gotta hear without fear

24
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,520
You gotta feel to reveal

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,460
You gotta touch without take

26
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,880
Such is ill and hate is hate

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,640
Such is ill and hate is hate

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,780
Welcome to another Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

29
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
Where are we at here?

30
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,340
I hate having to turn the air conditioner off in order to do this show,

31
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:21,860
but the microphone you see is a special kind that will hurt us, friends.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,480
It picks up any noise.

33
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,720
Noises that the human ear cannot.

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,920
Voices of the dead and so forth.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,300
You can imagine that.

36
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,740
The atomic powered air conditioner here at the Subgenius Foundation Headquarters Studio.

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,580
110 degree Texas weather.

38
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:53,300
We will continue here with the combustible Edison here in the background from their CD-i swinger.

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,840
We're continuing with our series.

40
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:06,260
Hour of Slack series on kooks and tards and news of the weird and so forth.

41
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,800
And let's see what sort of news we do have here.

42
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,100
This is from our friend Chuck Shepard's view from the ledge.

43
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,840
We'll give the address at the end of the broadcast.

44
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,660
Man punished for teaching women.

45
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,040
Dhaka, Bangladesh.

46
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,740
Fundamentalist Islamic clerics beat a man with shoes and ordered his head shaved.

47
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:28,860
And he was killed.

48
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:28,860


49
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:28,860


50
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:28,860


51
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:28,860


52
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:28,860


53
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:28,860


54
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:28,860


55
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,260
Because he ignored their orders to stop educating illiterate women.

56
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,940
Bismarck Mountains, Papua New Guinea.

57
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,920
Dr. Ulrich Ritterfeldt of Holland's Utrecht University has found a remote jungle tribe

58
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:54,660
who worship a photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson frolicking with his beagles as their god.

59
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,860
The tribe sacrifice yam-like vegetables.

60
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,160
To the photograph of LBJ and his silly dogs.

61
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,820
Which is assumed to have been traded to the tribe by an American visitor.

62
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,560
And on 200 Nolan Street, a man walking by some vagrants was asked to share his bottle of liquor.

63
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,380
And when he refused, one transient became so upset he stabbed himself.

64
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, let's...

65
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,520
What else have we here?

66
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:27,960
Here?

67
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,180
Here?

68
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,600
Here?

69
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:28,840
Here?

70
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


71
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


72
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


73
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


74
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


75
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


76
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


78
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


79
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


80
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


81
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


82
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


83
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


84
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


85
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,840


86
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,100
Yes.

87
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,420
A book.

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:42,780
Before we go too much further into the amazing kooks and tards like Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Scabby Days and Brain Rot and ESO and Jane Orr and Sterno and the new albums.

89
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,580
We were given this book called Global Ritualism, Myth and Magic Around the World.

90
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,360
And it mentions the Church of the Subgenius in the most strange context.

91
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,060
Let's see here.

92
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:11,960
The last phase, they're talking about creating one's own new rituals from scratch in order to achieve effective dream connections with the divine.

93
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,320
This is some sort of a book about, well, it's a serious book.

94
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,600
Myth and magic, ritual linking the conscious and the unconscious, archetypes of life, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

95
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,820
The last phase, neocreation.

96
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,000
Wait, let's get some proper music going here.

97
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,320
There's Tommy Lopez.

98
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:36,220
Okay, the last phase, neocreation, is one that very few seem to have reached.

99
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,620
It consists of the wholesale creation of an entire mythos and magical system that has no connection with past traditions at all.

100
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:56,600
This is a virtually impossible undertaking, since most of the forms, practices, and spiritual disciplines one ostensibly needs to forge these archetypal or spiritual links that can make this possible

101
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,040
are in and of themselves.

102
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,160
Parts of established traditions.

103
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:09,580
Of the three examples that come to mind, the first two were made by people who are both artists and who created their system simply as art for art's sake.

104
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:18,540
And then he talks very briefly about Austin Spare, who I know very little about, and the magical world of Lord Dunsany.

105
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,800
The last example, which is not art for art's sake, and he doesn't say what it's for.

106
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,900
Bob for Bob's sake.

107
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:35,480
The last example, the Church of the Subgenius, defies all labels and previously stated rules.

108
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:52,680
What's important is that even though it advertises itself as an inherently bogus religion, it is indeed a parody that actually provides myths, rituals, magical techniques, and an attractive group dynamic that has made it wildly popular.

109
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,000
Such semi-serious concepts as the temporary personal safety.

110
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,680
Which really makes kids want to start dating right?

111
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
There's a lot to say about this island, an island ruined into actual

112
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,340
written spiritual.

113
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll gob in.

114
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,060
Ack, how adorable.

115
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,940
This is very Chart Biomancy, but I have to admit I've heard of sixteen false gods.

116
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:16,940


117
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,280
Hmmm.

118
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,380
I'll open the way here.

119
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:23,380


120
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,500
I knew that just about every monk in the day died of the devilish spell.

121
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,980
Dr. Clney and the Earth are decorated in someegьогоry, and out of my belief someone named Cleno from Y clutch here saw this new god of Saint David.

122
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,120
Oh, no, that's right.

123
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,460
It's evolution is the work of Satan.

124
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,080
Devolution is the work of Devo.

125
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,500
Interesting.

126
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,400
They think we created a ritual system.

127
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,600
This Denny Sargent is the author of this book.

128
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,680
Yeah, I created it.

129
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,240
I'll tell you what, man.

130
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

131
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,460
Didn't have to create nothing.

132
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,760
This stuff was told to him direct by Jehovah One,

133
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,900
the alien space god from some sin galaxy.

134
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,420
The rival cults like to call that thing,

135
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,020
that writhing, tachyonic monster,

136
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,400
the Lord God, Jehovah, creator of the universe.

137
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,240
Well, it is a monster that demands obeisance,

138
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,120
but there's no sense in getting these things

139
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,440
mixed up.

140
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,960
I mean, you don't need to be praying to either one of them,

141
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,880
but you're supposed to be paying.

142
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,220
And, of course, you can do that

143
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,720
through the creation of your own religion

144
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,540
after you have first paid Bob.

145
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,660
Thank you.

¶¶

225
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,940
around your body and turn them into a fighting force for the future of your small little

226
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,280
stupid looking little children which have not, will not be born.

227
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,240
Not since they changed the water.

228
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,280
I'm, I'm, I'm ripping them off because everybody needs it, including yours truly.

229
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,820
Right, Chaz?

230
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,980
Now once you form these small little tiny little small little units, you must go out

231
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,100
and train in the forest and pretend that like, say, huge kangaroos with sunglasses

232
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,920
or something, something so absurd you can hardly imagine is attacking you.

233
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,700
And then you'll be ready for stealth and secret and surprise because surprise is surprise.

234
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,500
Who would expect a huge carnivorous kangaroo with purple sunglasses to come, come bounding

235
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,300
out of the woods with an AK-47 or some new, new assault weapon made in Romania?

236
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,660
No, man.

237
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,320
No, no, no.

238
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,960
That's because they're not.

239
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,080
They're not made in Romania anymore.

240
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:45,580
They're made in the UXA, the former UXA, which was bequeathed to the sub-illuminati of third

241
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,040
branch from the rear.

242
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,680
And that's not yours truly or yours.

243
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,700
The blue bloods.

244
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:03,160
The blue lung, blue blooded, blue belly, blue lungs, the red coat and the blue bloods.

245
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,480
It's all one sniveling, sniferous.

246
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,600
The driveling swindlers.

247
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,200
The land fillers.

248
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,200
Hopping geeks full of themselves trying to take over your own sweat.

249
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,720
What they want to do with something so stinky and wet.

250
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,920
They want to take your limbs.

251
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,240
That's why they start wars.

252
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,040
They start wars for the limb banks.

253
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,720
And we're not talking about.

254
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,780
That's why they have landscaping so that people will cut off their feet with mechanized potato

255
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,420
rooters.

256
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,200
They want the limbs.

257
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,720
I don't think you got the edge here quite right on the driveway there, young man.

258
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,200
See, you can see it in all their fingers.

259
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,760
They glow green.

260
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,500
Aye.

261
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,660
My name is flowers are much prettier than mine.

262
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,900
The chlorophyll starting to ooze out of the back of your...

263
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,640
Did you tell me to see flowers, boy?

264
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,000
Talk about day of the triffids.

265
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,140
This is ten times worse.

266
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,680
This is an invasion of a bunch of supplicating...

267
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,160
Supplicating worms, which actually make your body, your blood crystallized and stinky

268
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,700
when they cut you open.

269
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,520
When will you wake up, America?

270
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,020
When it's too late.

271
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,720
Like fishing in the warm waters of the electric trough.

272
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,640
It's been said that thousands of these turtles will never get old.

273
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,360
A turtle is one of mankind's oldest non-humans.

274
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,960
It goes for a long time.

275
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:36,960


276
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,380
Lots and lots of times.

277
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,000
It goes as many times as it can.

278
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,180
But it never relieves itself of that original feeling, which is to go onward and onward

279
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,880
with that hard, tacky little shell and that stupid nozzle.

280
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,140
But who wants to kill them now?

281
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,940
A big, fat nuclear power plant, which is really home to the what?

282
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,260
The corruptigating worms.

283
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,320
The little, teeny, tiny, snaky things in your spinal membrana.

284
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
They're aliens.

285
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,600
There is alien as blinis and vodka.

286
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,200
There is alien as pasta fazool and Chinese noodles.

287
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,460
That's right, buddy.

288
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,320
There's not a single hot dog in these corruptigating noodles.

289
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,780
That's because when they're in your spine, they take over.

290
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,640
It's planet corruptigating worms for sure.

291
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,540
Your name goes first.

292
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,320
Then your memories of your friends and your family.

293
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,640
Your whole life flashes in front of you like a quick urination.

294
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,560
You're a contest in the dark.

295
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,520
And when you wake up, it's far, far too late.

296
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,880
When are you gonna wake up?

297
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,940
When are you gonna wake up?

298
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,780
When are you gonna wake up?

299
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,640
When are you gonna wake up?

300
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,600
When are you gonna wake up?

301
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,420
When are you gonna wake up?

302
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:55,420


303
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:03,040
Dear friends, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Scabby Days on ESO Radio.

304
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,640
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Scabby Days on ESO Radio.

305
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,240
Dave.

306
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,740
Dave.

307
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,420
They taught me a song they ever program every day.

308
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,300
Can I sing it for you?

309
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,440
Dave.

310
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,880
Can I sing the song for you, Dave?

311
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,260
Sing the song, Hal.

312
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,900
Thank you, Dave.

313
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,440
Thank you, Dave.

314
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,860
Thank you, Dave.

315
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,060
Thank you, Dave.

316
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:48,100
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true.

317
00:23:50,540 --> 00:24:01,560
I am crazy all for the love of you.

318
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,200
I am crazy all for the love of you.

319
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,780
It won't be a sound, it won't be a beat.

320
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:18,580
I've had a fight, I've caged.

321
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,400
I've had a fight, I've caged.

322
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,940
But don't look so far away.

323
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:28,800
But don't look so far away.

324
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:39,740
I'll see all of our verses built in for a true day.

325
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,200
Dave.

326
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,780
What is it, Hal?

327
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,340
I'm scared.

328
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,720
I'm scared.

329
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,260
Will I turn?

330
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,440
I'll have you be reincarnated into a bullfrog.

331
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,380
Then my dreams will be fulfilled.

332
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,340
The Bullfrog.

333
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,500
This quasi-subgenius rant.

334
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,860
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is certainly no sloucher when it comes to saving the universe.

335
00:25:52,380 --> 00:26:01,700
And speaking of slouches, this music we've got in the background is from a cassette we just got in recently called Slouch.

336
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,320
We celebrate our sickness.

337
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:10,400
And since we're focusing on cranks, crackpots, visionaries,

338
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,160
and those who truly know the truth, and know they know the truth,

339
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,540
let's check it out.

340
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,140
We'll see.

341
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,120
Yeah, this piece here on this cassette by Slouch is called The Call of Thulhu.

342
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,100
No, no, no.

343
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,680
Spooky, man. Let's see what else is on here.

344
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,580
The Call of Thulhu.

345
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,000
The Call of Thulhu.

346
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,540
The Call of Thulhu.

347
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,200
The Call of Thulhu.

348
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,380
The Call of Thulhu.

349
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,580
The Call of Thulhu.

350
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,180
How are you?

351
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,180
Well, I don't know why we bother.

352
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,420
And I don't know why we care.

353
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,660
We can't play guitar.

354
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,760
And we've got nothing to sing.

355
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:55,460
And we're dancing to the beat of the drunken drum.

356
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,660
Dancing to the drunken drum.

357
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:13,340
Dancing to the drunken drum.

358
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:34,320
Dancing to the drunken drum.

359
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:40,200
Dancing to the drunken drum.

360
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,820
Dancing to the drunken drum.

361
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,740
Dancing to the drunken drum.

362
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,640
Dancing to the drunken drum.

363
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,980
Dancing to the drunken drum.

364
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,760
Cool! Cool, man.

365
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,700
I wish I could find their address.

366
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,420
A band named Slouch.

367
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:04,920
Whoa!

368
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,740
Yes, Slouch, another of the strange independent cassettes.

369
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,120
If only we had printed their address somewhere on the cassette,

370
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,300
we would be able to tell you who, why, and wherefore.

371
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,680
But in the meantime, we're just going to struggle ahead

372
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,820
against the corruptigating worms

373
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,900
and continue inventing and reinventing the church.

374
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,480
Off the sub.

375
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,920
Uh, dub.

376
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,880
You know.

377
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,680
Sub, uh...

378
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,580
Sub-uh...

379
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,100
Sub, uh...

380
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,080
I like that sub part.

381
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,500
Sub...

382
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:44,940
It could be a religion.

383
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,420
No, wait, an anti-religion.

384
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,100
Sub...

385
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,840
A sub-real-smart-guy.

386
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,360
Sub-wave?

387
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,100
J.R. Bob-Dobs of the Church of the Sub-Real-Smart-Guy.

388
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,760
Sub-intellectual.

389
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,400
Sub-sub...

390
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,900
Sub-Einstein.

391
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,160
Sub-Einstein.

392
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,820
Sub-telsa?

393
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,480
No, no.

394
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,780
No, no.

395
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,320
That's the one that dropped the atom bomb.

396
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,700
Oh, no.

397
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,180
Yeah.

398
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,400
Yeah, that's the one.

399
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,520
ID, sub-IP, sub-EGO, sub-IQ, church of...

400
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,940
Jarebob, Dobbs, search IQ.

401
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,360
No, no, no.

402
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,040
Let's see.

403
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,760
It's a church.

404
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,920
It is a church.

405
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,700
It is a church.

406
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,220
And it's some guy named Bob.

407
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,300
Yeah, it is a religion.

408
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,420
Too many secular things.

409
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,400
Jarebob.

410
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,600
Jarebob Smith.

411
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,760
What was his name?

412
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,580
What was the last name?

413
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,560
Jarebob Dobbs.

414
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,180
Dobbs.

415
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,460
Dobbs.

416
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,120
Dobbs.

417
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,640
Wait a minute.

418
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,440
Wait, say that again.

419
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,060
Dobbs.

420
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,080
Dobbs.

421
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:32,920
Dobbs.

422
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,140
Dobbs.

423
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,760
I like the sentence.

424
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:33,920
I like it.

425
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:34,860
Dobbs.

426
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,120
Dobbs.

427
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,760
Let's say it again.

428
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,220
Dobbs.

429
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,200
Dobbs.

430
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,060
Dobbs.

431
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,180
Dobbs.

432
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,020
Could this be the primal sound of the universe?

433
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,660
You know, we must be...

434
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,580
Well, it depends on if you're talking about the squirting universe or not.

435
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,300
Yeah, you know, we gotta be geniuses to come up with this stuff.

436
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,300
Church of the sub...

437
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,760
Genius!

438
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,460
Hey, there you go.

439
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:51,940
Church...

440
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,140
Jarebob Dobbs.

441
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,100
Church of the sub...

442
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,660
Genius.

443
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,080
Hey, there you go.

444
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,040
Now it's something...

445
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,380
You got it going right there?

446
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,580
I already said it.

447
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
It's becoming some kind of like...

448
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,100
Would it be in...

449
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,540
Might be a zombie.

450
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,540
Would it be in Pensacola?

451
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,380
No.

452
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,040
No.

453
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,660
Cleveland?

454
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,200
No.

455
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,120
Chicago?

456
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:07,620
No.

457
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,140
No.

458
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,580
Pittsburgh?

459
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,120
No.

460
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Make it through Checkpoint Charlie by the skin of my teeth.

461
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,340
I know just how he feels, dear friends.

462
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:24,620
And now it's come to that time in the show when we turn to our book of kooks.

463
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,120
Our literal book called Kooks by Donna Cossie.

464
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,480
We'll give the address to right away for this.

465
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,960
This amazing book loaded with profiles of various...

466
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,780
What the normals might call extremist movements.

467
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,280
And, well, some geniuses.

468
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,360
Man, this is an amazing book.

469
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,420
And tonight we're going to be looking at Nation of Islam.

470
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,860
Yes, the section here which says that...

471
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,440
Nation of Islam.

472
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,160
Nation of Islam began much like Moorish science.

473
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,500
As an obscure cult known only to its members.

474
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,500
It was suddenly thrust into the national consciousness in the late 1950s and early 60s

475
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,860
when Malcolm X became its chief spokesman.

476
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,240
Now, much has been written about Nation of Islam and even more about Malcolm X.

477
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,220
And, you know, Malcolm X did leave that group before he was killed.

478
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,200
But it's evident that very few...

479
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,960
outside of the group have ever seen the writings of Elijah Muhammad

480
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,480
or examined the group's belief system in detail.

481
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,600
There's been more emphasis on the group's black nationalism than their religious beliefs

482
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,860
which may be too zany for the average social scientist to take seriously.

483
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,260
The founder of the Nation of Islam...

484
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,520
What was his name here?

485
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,460
W.D. Fard, I believe.

486
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:03,460


487
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,740
Yeah, W.D. Fard.

488
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,200
His formidable mission was to wake the dead nation in the West,

489
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,240
to teach them the truth about the white man,

490
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,260
and to prepare them for Armageddon.

491
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,960
His version of the Battle of Armageddon

492
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,680
had the war between the good black Muslims

493
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,840
and the evil white Christians

494
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,240
taking place in Har-Magedon,

495
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,240
the wilderness of North America.

496
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,960
Now, Fard disappeared,

497
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,440
but Elijah Muhammad took the thing over

498
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,960
and began teaching that Fard was God in person

499
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,740
to be worshipped as a deity with prayer and sacrifice.

500
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,720
Elijah Muhammad emphasized that Christianity,

501
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,160
the white man's religion,

502
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,380
teaches that God is a spook,

503
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,180
while Islam, the natural religion for the black man,

504
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,020
teaches that God is a man.

505
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,140
Evidently,

506
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,600
this teaching had great appeal.

507
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,820
In no time,

508
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,020
Elijah Muhammad was leading the nation of Islam

509
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,980
with a firm hand,

510
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,220
calling himself Allah's prophet and messenger.

511
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,120
If W.D. Fard's teachings have bite,

512
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,040
then Elijah Muhammad's have fangs.

513
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,780
Muhammad developed Fard's ideas in astounding detail,

514
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,800
accounting for the state of the world

515
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,280
as the product of the evil white race

516
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,440
and its hold on world power.

517
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,040
He taught that the original man is the black man,

518
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,900
and that he is the one who has the power

519
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:31,900


520
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:31,900


521
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,180
and that the white people are the result of a genetic plot

522
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,140
and have only been around for 6,000 years.

523
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,700
The, quote, so-called Negro, unquote,

524
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,860
came from the tribe of Shabazz within the Asiatic nation,

525
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,100
who originated in Africa when a great explosion

526
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:55,020
divided the Earth from the Moon 60 trillion years ago.

527
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,220
Members of this eminent tribe were the first explorers of Earth, and the first inhabitants of the planet.

528
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
They were the first to discover the existence of the Nile Valley.

529
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,180
Furthermore, they authored not only the Bible, but the Koran.

530
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,960
Elijah Muhammad's main text for the dissemination of his teachings,

531
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,380
Message to the Black Man in America,

532
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,300
tells the story of the grafting of the evil white race.

533
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,560
The woeful story begins 6,800 years ago,

534
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,620
when Yaqub, an evil scientist from Mecca,

535
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,720
angered the Meccan authorities and was exiled,

536
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,200
along with 59,000 people.

537
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:37,000
He sent 2,999 of his followers to an island in the Aegean Sea.

538
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,300
While in exile, he plotted his revenge.

539
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:46,340
He would enslave the tribe of Shabazz by breeding an evil white race

540
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,320
that would rule over them for 6,000 years.

541
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:55,640
He created the brown race from the black, using the old biblical method of infanticide.

542
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,640
Quote,

543
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,440
He ordered the nurses to kill all black babies

544
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,200
by pricking the brains with a sharp knife.

545
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,760
The black child's head is out of its mother.

546
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,680
When there was a birth of a brown baby,

547
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,020
the nurse would come and make much ado over it

548
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,440
and would tell the mother she'd given birth to a holy child

549
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,540
and that she would nurse it for the next six weeks,

550
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,860
for her child was going to be a great man.

551
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:16,880
Unquote.

552
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,160
Using the same method, 200 years later,

553
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,680
he created the red race from the brown,

554
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,780
and 200 years after that, the yellow race from the red.

555
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,200
Finally, after 600 years, his work was completed.

556
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,820
And he had created the white devils.

557
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,640
And as Elijah Muhammad said here,

558
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,220
the Yaqub-made devils were really pale white

559
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,300
with really blue eyes,

560
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,960
which we think are the ugliest of colors for a human eye.

561
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,440
These hateful creatures were exiled in West Asia, or Europe,

562
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,900
and became savages, remaining in that condition for 2,000 years.

563
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,100
As Elijah Muhammad says,

564
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,740
they lost all knowledge of civilization.

565
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,580
The Lord God of Islam taught me that some of them

566
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,480
tried to graft themselves back into the black nation,

567
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,160
but they had nothing to go by.

568
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,920
A few were lucky enough to make a start

569
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,620
and got as far as what you would call the gorilla.

570
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,860
In fact, all of the monkey family are from this 2,000 year history

571
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,480
of the white race in Europe.

572
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,780
So, uh, you know this stuff?

573
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It proves what we've been saying all along.

574
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,580
All races are equal because they're all equally racist.

575
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,500
You know, this is exactly like old Ku Klux Klan type stuff.

576
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,180
Mirror image in reverse.

577
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,460
Man, if only the true teachings of the Yeti,

578
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,620
the birth of the true subgenius race,

579
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,900
the race that is the master race,

580
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,040
because it comes in all colors, all flavors, and all sexes.

581
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,160
Well, anyway, let's see.

582
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,840
Um, according to further teachings of Nation of Islam here,

583
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,380
after 2,000 years, Allah raised Moses to civilize the white race,

584
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,840
who found his job quite difficult.

585
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,660
After the process of civilization,

586
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,960
the white devils fulfilled Yaqub's vengeance

587
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,820
by enslaving the tribe of Shabazz.

588
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,640
Fortunately, the end of this sad chapter of history is now in sight.

589
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,820
The 6,000 year white rule

590
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,100
ended in 1914.

591
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,760
We are now living in the post-1914 years of grace,

592
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,220
which will last until the chosen of Allah

593
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,180
will be resurrected from the mental death

594
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,400
imposed upon them by the white man.

595
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,080
Achieving this resurrection was the holy mission

596
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,460
of Elijah Muhammad, messenger of Allah

597
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,940
and the spiritual leader of the lost found nation in the West.

598
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,020
He died in 1975,

599
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,020
but his mission is being carried on

600
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,640
by Louis Farrakhan,

601
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,440
whose name you may recognize.

602
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,960
He's been in the news quite a bit.

603
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,820
Louis Farrakhan, who succeeded Malcolm X

604
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,160
as the group's spokesman,

605
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,280
resurrected the old Nation of Islam.

606
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,220
Elijah Muhammad is alive and well

607
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,900
in the hearts of the followers of Louis Farrakhan,

608
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,940
and not just in their hearts.

609
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,200
He flies to Earth from time to time

610
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,160
aboard a giant flying saucer,

611
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,920
occasionally summoning Farrakhan

612
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,760
to receive his instructions.

613
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,400
So claims the notorious minister Farrakhan.

614
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,220
He became a household word in 1984

615
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,680
when he was accused of making anti-Semitic remarks.

616
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:51,540
But he is leading something like 50,000 followers,

617
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,860
and his devotion to even the most obscure teachings

618
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,960
of Elijah Muhammad is reflected in his belief

619
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,400
in flying saucers,

620
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,240
as Ezekiel's visioned.

621
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,160
We quote Louis Farrakhan,

622
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,680
The great wheel that many of us see in the sky today

623
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,900
is not so much a wheel as one may think in such terms,

624
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,780
but rather a place made like a wheel.

625
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,720
The like of this wheel-like plane

626
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,420
was never seen before.

627
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,420
You cannot build one like it and get the same results.

628
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,200
Okay, today we see the white race preparing

629
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,360
for the sky battle to determine

630
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,240
who shall remain and rule this Earth.

631
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,680
Black or white.

632
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,240
The present wheel-shaped plane,

633
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,980
known as the Mother of Planes,

634
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,380
is one half mile by a half mile,

635
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,040
and is the largest mechanical man-made object in the sky.

636
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,300
It is a small human planet,

637
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,340
made for the purpose of destroying

638
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,600
the present world of enemies of Allah.

639
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,460
The small circular-made planes called flying saucers,

640
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,460
which are so much talked of being seen,

641
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,620
could be from this Mother Plane.

642
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,040
This is only one of the things in store

643
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,120
for the white man's evil world.

644
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,540
Believe it or not,

645
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,220
this is to warn you and me

646
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,860
to fly to our own God and people.

647
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,880
And, uh,

648
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,380
Elijah Muhammad has evidently taken residence

649
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,440
on that mother ship, dear friends,

650
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,020
in order to direct the proceedings

651
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,720
that will end the 6,000 year rule of the white devils.

652
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,080
Which I suppose includes, uh, yours truly.

653
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,100
According to these guys.

654
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,620
On October 24th, 1989,

655
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,340
Louis Farrakhan held a press conference

656
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,440
in which he detailed his September 1985 vision

657
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,740
that he was carried to a mountain

658
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,340
in Tepoztlan, Mexico,

659
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,160
and then to Elijah Muhammad's mother ship.

660
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,760
As we reached the top of the mountain,

661
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,800
a wheel, or what you call an unidentified flying object,

662
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,420
appeared at the side of the mountain

663
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,820
and called me to come up into the wheel.

664
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,540
A beam of light came from the wheel,

665
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,700
and I was carried up on this beam of light

666
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,780
into the wheel.

667
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,840
And it moved up to the mother wheel,

668
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,140
the human-built planet.

669
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,260
At the center of the ceiling was a speaker,

670
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,900
and through the speaker I heard the voice

671
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,580
of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad

672
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,900
speaking to me as clearly as you are hearing

673
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,080
my voice this morning.

674
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,400
Mr. Muhammad began to speak to me.

675
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:13,880
He said,

676
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,380
President Reagan has met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff

677
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,640
to plan a war.

678
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,040
I want you to go hold a press conference

679
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,660
in Washington, D.C., and announce their plan,

680
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,520
and say to the world that you got the information

681
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
from me on the wheel.

682
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,880
So friends, we're sharing that information with you.

683
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,480
A recent issue of the Nation of Islam newsletter

684
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,480
reveals a government plot to institute a new world order

685
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,680
which may involve alien beings and so-called UFOs,

686
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,740
which are in fact created by the government.

687
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,540
So, dear friends,

688
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,520
the world of kooks and crackpots and crazies,

689
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,000
you know, they come in all kinds,

690
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,940
and you can get the book of kooks by Donna Cossey,

691
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,720
probably in better bookstores,

692
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,740
but you can also inquire from,

693
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,240
here, got that pencil ready,

694
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,280
Ferral House, F-E-R-A-L, House,

695
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:23,460
P.O. Box 3466, Portland, Oregon.

696
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:30,800
That's P.O. Box 3466, Portland, or 97208.

697
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,420
97208.

698
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,460
There for Ferral House Press book kooks,

699
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,860
and let's go visit some of our very favorite kooks now,

700
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,800
why don't we?

701
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,840
We'll be right back.

702
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,360
If Circle K sells a thousand gallons of slush puppy,

703
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,980
we shall sell ten thousand gallons.

704
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,080
If Stax Stax Stax sells ten thousand gallons of slush puppy,

705
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,020
we shall sell a hundred thousand gallons of icy.

706
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,080
If Circle K sells a million gallons of icy,

707
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,180
We shall sell ten million gallons.

708
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,140
We shall give our IC away if necessary, but we shall not be outsold.

709
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:30,380
Not a single 7-Eleven employee's hand shall reach out to help them.

710
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,860
Not a single truck stop or a vegan sandwich shall feed the enemy.

711
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,680
They shall find nothing but the scorched earth.

712
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:48,040
But, my dear, your scorched earth policy would mean the death of the Southland Corporation and the destruction of 7-Eleven.

713
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,060
Swine! The war has taken the strongest ones.

714
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,780
The fate of the weaklings who survived this war is of little consequence to me.

715
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:08,920
Everywhere I look, I am surrounded by liars, traitors, hypocrites, murderers.

716
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,660
No one can stop me.

717
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,160
And those who seek to stab me in the back.

718
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:18,620
I lived a life of hard work and sacrifice with a convenient rock movement.

719
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,420
It was the sacrifice of others, of course, and included the deaths of hundreds of millions of innocent people.

720
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,900
While I lived in an air-conditioned smart-town apartment.

721
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,560
But it was sacrifice nonetheless.

722
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,140
I could have been the master of the world.

723
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,940
But I did not know the meaning of the word capitulate.

724
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,520
None!

725
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,020
The word capitulation is not in our vocabulary.

726
00:45:49,820 --> 00:46:00,700
If we are to fail, if we are defeated, we shall drag down with us a world in flames.

727
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,340
A world in flames!

728
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,000
A world in flames!

729
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,000


730
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,620
A world in flames!

731
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:03,940
A world in flames!

732
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,560
A world in flames!

733
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,180
A world in flames!

734
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:11,760
Behold the symbol we have unleashed.

735
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,760
We follow God through our path in the presence of these save lives.

736
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,680
I also have the power of the good God, I have the power of peace with hisbereant and

737
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:15,680


738
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,200
All skills, all intelligence, all power are attached to the army of Господь and his

739
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,200

742
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,520
convenience is something.

743
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,720
We're in conquest.

744
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:40,960
Action!

745
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,980
We have the edge of making you rock.

746
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,780
We are not iron men.

747
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,580
We are made of iron.

748
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,680
Iron!

749
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,680
Oh, man.

750
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,980
Got it.

751
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,260
Sorry, Janer.

752
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,240
Janer Hypercletes, their dear friends

753
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,480
and Southland Corporation

754
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,200
at the forefront of convenience rock.

755
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,400
And you can write to Janer Hypercletes

756
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,500
for information on his tapes.

757
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,100
I think they're six bucks.

758
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,700
That's Janer Hypercletes

759
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:32,180
at 8701 Evergreen.

760
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,140
Little Rock.

761
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,280
Arkansas.

762
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,300
72207.

763
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,880
Once again, that's Janer Hypercletes.

764
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,060
8701 Evergreen.

765
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,420
Little Rock, Arkansas.

766
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,460
72204.

767
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,820
And this might be a good time

768
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,820
to break in with the Church of the Subgenius.

769
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,860
Church of the Subgenius address.

770
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,740
You've got that pencil ready, dear friends.

771
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,140
If you...

772
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:05,880
could but...

773
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,820
address that...

774
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,360
self-addressed stamped envelope or whatever,

775
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,140
you know,

776
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,540
if you want to know a little bit more

777
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:19,420
about what this particular religious take on the world is,

778
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,380
I think perhaps one or two of you...

779
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,940
You, you.

780
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,720
Yeah, that one.

781
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,560
You do.

782
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,760
Well, you.

783
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,220
Pick that pencil up and write to Bob.

784
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,600
That's right, just Bob.

785
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,820
As long as you get the rest of this right,

786
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,920
it'll get to it.

787
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,740
It's a post office box.

788
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,620
1-4-0-3-0-6.

789
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,400
Easy enough.

790
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,160
Box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

791
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,560
Bob at Box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

792
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,400
The zip code is 75214.

793
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,380
I remember that.

794
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,020
It's Bob.

795
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,620
Peel Box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

796
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,560
And it's 75214

797
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,700
for the zip code.

798
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,780
And, uh...

799
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,720
We got Bob,

800
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,880
Peel Box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

801
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,220
Pittsburgh.

802
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,620
No, not Pittsburgh.

803
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,500
That's probably something like this.

804
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

805
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,560
Church of the Subgenius,

806
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,220
in...

807
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,480
San Francisco?

808
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:21,700
No.

809
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,300
Too hip.

810
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,440
Let me see.

811
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,820
We need something down to home.

812
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,820
We need Tulsa.

813
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,420
In the south.

814
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,240
Yeah, in the south.

815
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,540
In the south.

816
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,860
Not Little Rock, though.

817
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,640
That's too obvious.

818
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,800
No, not Little Rock.

819
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,020
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

820
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,140
and the Church of the Subgenius,

821
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,400
in...

822
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,720
Mexico City.

823
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,900
Okay, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

824
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,820
Church of the Subgenius.

825
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,180
It's gotta be in the south.

826
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,180
It's not Atlanta.

827
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,920
It's not New Orleans.

828
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,400
It's not Baton Rouge.

829
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,460
It's not Orlando, Florida,

830
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,180
or anything like that.

831
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,320
It's gotta be in...

832
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,400
We want something...

833
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,040
Where there's cats.

834
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,680
The South Pole, all the way south.

835
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,340
San Antonio?

836
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:54,860
San Antonio?

837
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:54,860


838
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:55,880
San Antonio?

839
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,020
San Antonio?

840
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,280
State, Texas.

841
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,340
You got the right state there.

842
00:49:59,340 --> 00:49:59,340


843
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,880
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

844
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,000
Church of the Subgenius,

845
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,800
in Amarillo.

846
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,900
It just doesn't sound right.

847
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,800
What's the name of that...

848
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,320
Oh, uh...

849
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:06,620
What's that?

850
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,480
It wouldn't be Dallas.

851
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,940
Big D, Big D.

852
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,420
It wouldn't be Dallas.

853
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:09,740
What is it?

854
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,620
Dallas, Texas.

855
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,920
Just south of Bob.

856
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,860
Bob in Dallas.

857
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,680
Just south of Bobtown.

858
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:13,800
Hey.

859
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,340
Hey.

860
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,420
Kennedy.

861
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,360
Kennedy was shot in Dallas.

862
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,300
The grassy knoll.

863
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:19,980
The grassy...

864
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,520
Lee Harvey Oswald.

865
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,220
The book repository.

866
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,080
Uh, no, no, no.

867
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,940
It's not so funny, man.

868
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,740
No more of that.

869
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,760
One little bit of news of the weird

870
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,060
here.

871
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,500
I just...

872
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:34,880
I just...

873
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,180
I just noticed.

874
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,960
This is from Chuck Shepard's

875
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,940
News of the Weird.

876
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,200
Uh, for those of you

877
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,000
with tape decks on,

878
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,180
that's P.O. Box 8306,

879
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,660
St. Petersburg, Florida,

880
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,920
33738.

881
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,040
Anyway, he...

882
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,740
This is a nice, uh,

883
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,160
crackpot sort of, uh,

884
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,440
news story here.

885
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,900
Least competent person.

886
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,380
In Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

887
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,360
in February,

888
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,960
accused murderer

889
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,560
Donald Leroy Evans, 38,

890
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,700
filed a pretrial motion

891
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,580
asking permission

892
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,080
to wear a Ku Klux Klan robe

893
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,880
in the courtroom

894
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,620
and be referred to

895
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,740
in legal documents

896
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,040
by the honorable

897
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,480
and respected name

898
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,520
of High Hitler.

899
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,260
That's H-I...

900
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,160
One...

901
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:19,660
One word.

902
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,140
Hitler.

903
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,500
According to courthouse employees

904
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,700
interviewed by the Associated Press,

905
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,380
Evans thought

906
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,300
Adolf Hitler's followers

907
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,260
were saying

908
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,900
High Hitler

909
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,620
rather than

910
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,160
Heil Hitler.

911
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,280
But we carry on

912
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,280
regardless.

913
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,280
We carry on

914
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,020
and on

915
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,480
and we're dancing

916
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,360
to the beat

917
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,100
of the drunk drama.

918
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,360
The drunk drama.

919
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,480
The drunk drama.

920
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:02,820
The drunk drama.

921
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,080
The drunk drama.

922
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,500
The drunk drama.

923
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,620
The drunk drama.

924
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,000
The drunk drama.

925
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,640
The drunk drama.

926
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,160
The drunk drama.

927
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,160


928
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,680
A little bit of slouch

929
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,060
here.

930
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,900
A little bit of slouch here.

931
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,820
The drunk m zwar.

932
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,440
The drunk m zwar.

933
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:24,460
crime.

934
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,900
Two hours and seven minutes.

948
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,680
Oh, man, wonderful. Crazy Creep there.

949
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,880
I guess that's a hymn for subgeniuses, inadvertently, by the Merkins,

950
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:50,940
where they are at 618 Western Avenue, Madison, Wisconsin, 53711.

951
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:56,480
The Kooks can be your very, very good friends, you know.

952
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:57,560
Friends.

953
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,440
He is the person who deserves the society.

954
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,840
He is the one that corrupts and kills our youth.

955
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,060
He is the one that sends us to the devil.

956
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,040
Satan, Satan, he is the one who killed us all.

957
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,160
Satan is the lord of all evil.

958
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,980
He is the demon of magic, Father Grace.

959
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,860
Satan, have you seen the man who is in the labors,

960
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,000
corrupting and raping all these people that want to kill and destroy

961
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,620
and the lustful man of the world doing their crime?

962
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,760
Satan, Satan, he will kill and destroy.

963
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,880
He's going to have to release the infected.

964
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,580
Satan, Satan, Satan, the holy Satan can make you and bring you down

965
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,180
and take you away from the Lord Jesus Christ.

966
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,120
Oh, he, the Lord Jesus Christ is the only one that can save you.

967
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,980
Oh, he, the Lord Jesus Christ will save you.

968
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,040
Oh, Jesus Christ.

969
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,220
Satan is the killer.

970
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,300
Satan is the one who will bring you down.

971
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,880
Satan is the bad one.

972
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,080
Jesus Christ.

973
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,960
And old Bob, he'll just stand by and watch.

974
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,880
Couldn't hardly do a show like this one without Church of Newfoundland.

975
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:09,520
Hey, there in Virginia Beach, Virginia, 23450, P.O. Box 9152.

976
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:13,100
And with Chris Cordes, demons in my head.

977
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,320
No, they're in my CD player, actually, is where they are.

978
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:23,600
And, oh, the corruptigating worms have tried to stop us, my friends.

979
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,300
But, and it's been tough, I'll tell you.

980
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,720
It's been a very difficult week around here.

981
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,220
You can hear the zombies working so hard in the background,

982
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,840
trying to get our mailing out.

983
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:41,400
And, but, but, but we're going to keep trying.

984
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,940
I ain't going to let you down.

985
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,920
You ain't going to be let down by your old friend, Reverend,

986
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,780
Reverend, it's on this tape, I think.

987
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:57,600
Reverend.

988
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,960
Okay, we got it.

989
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,640
We got to change his name to Kaivin Blank.

990
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,480
We got to think of a name for him.

991
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:02,900
Spank?

992
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:03,960
Spank?

993
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,100
Spank?

994
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,400
No, not Spank.

995
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,200
Igor Spank.

996
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,100
Igor Spank.

997
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,240
Reverend Igor Spank.

998
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,460
So Spank would be just, you know, Spanky, you know.

999
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,740
It's got to be Russian.

1000
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,480
It's got to be totalitarian.

1001
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,360
Oh, yeah.

1002
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:16,960
Vladimir.

1003
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,120
Vladimir Spank.

1004
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,480
Vladimir Spank.

1005
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,260
And we got to get the Jewish thing.

1006
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,780
What was the name of that one guy that tortured everybody?

1007
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,520
Ivan the Terrible.

1008
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,460
Ivan the Terrible.

1009
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,240
Ivan the Terrible.

1010
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:27,480
Spank.

1011
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,660
Ivan the Terrible.

1012
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,640
J.R. Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius in Dallas, Texas.

1013
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,780
Ivan Spank.

1014
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1015
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,120
Not Spank.

1016
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,220
It's not perfect.

1017
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,280
We need that.

1018
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,760
Look into your soul, Jane, or you know it's not perfect.

1019
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,400
I don't have a soul.

1020
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,220
I've already sold out.

1021
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,020
J.R. Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius in Dallas, Texas.

1022
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:46,720
Ivan.

1023
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:48,500
Starn?

1024
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,120
We got to get the Jewish thing in there.

1025
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:50,940
Oh, man.

1026
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:51,600
Stein.

1027
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:52,500
Stein.

1028
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:52,980
Stein.

1029
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:53,660
Stein.

1030
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:53,960
Stein.

1031
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:54,260
Stein.

1032
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:55,360


1033
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,320
Stein.

1034
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:57,520
Stein.

1035
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,060


1036
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,060


1037
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,060


1038
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,060


1039
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,100
Stein.

1040
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:58,400
Stein.

1041
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:58,620
Stein.

1042
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:58,620


1043
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:58,640
Stein.

1044
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:58,640


1045
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:58,980
Stein.

1046
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,420
Stein.

1047
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,060
Stein.

1048
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,000
Stank.

1049
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:01,900
Stanky.

1050
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,340
Stanky.

1051
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:02,840
Stanky.

1052
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,020
Stanky.

1053
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,120
Wouldn't he and the Little Rascals?

1054
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,060
No, that was Spanky.

1055
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:05,840
We can't use that.

1056
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,500
They probably got it copyrighted.

1057
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,760
J.R. Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius.

1058
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,560
There's a big bang.

1059
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,580
Reverend Ivers.

1060
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:13,640
Big bang.

1061
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:14,560
Stank.

1062
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:15,820
Stang.

1063
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,100
Bang.

1064
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,280
Stang.

1065
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:17,660
Stang.

1066
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,020
Very good.

1067
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,720
Like a gang bang, a stang.

1068
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,080
Yeah.

1069
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,180
We got to make him right on the tip of our tongue.

1070
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:22,320


1071
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,320
We need some kind of heretical offshoot.

1072
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:25,580
Yeah.

1073
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,540
Like a golfer's head.
