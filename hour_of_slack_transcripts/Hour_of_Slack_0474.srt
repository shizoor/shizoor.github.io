1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,880
Well, isn't it amazing dear friends what twisting a little knob can do?

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,720
Oh, there's so many little knobs one could twist.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:19,320
Like for background music, there's so much material here, why, I can just fill up this box.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,200
I'm using a cardboard box here next to me to put the Hour of Slack background music out.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,060
Well, I've got my main tapes here.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,760
We have so much to do together and listen to together dear friends,

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,220
because I've been gone for away from the studio for almost a month,

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,700
and all these new tapes have stacked up.

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,080
Let's just see what this one sounds like, shall we?

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,180
Well, that sounds pretty good.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,040
That sounds pretty terrible.

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,180
Well, let's see how this one goes.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,560
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,340
This is the best of all the one true religions.

15
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,600
I guess every religion is the one true religion, but this is the best of all the one true religions.

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,700
Well, they all say they are.

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,120
And I think what you have done, as you said earlier, you have stolen from all the best.

18
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,900
Is that correct?

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,500
Yeah, we've pared it down to the essence of every religion.

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,240
Us versus them.

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,360
There's no Bob with Bob.

22
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,760
Bob is a sex god.

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,540
Bob is a sex god.

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,120
Unbelievable.

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:56,980
Unspeakable.

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,180
Unbearable.

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,340
Oh my god. Is this for real?

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,280
No, no, no. This is just a tape.

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,720
Relax.

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,920
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

31
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:08,860
.

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:08,900
.

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:12,980
.

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,180
.

35
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,480
.

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:13,940
.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,020
We'll be right back.

38
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,480
We'll be right back.

39
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:20,640
We've been going on, and it has been, this has been the busiest subgenius month ever.

40
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,460
I mean, is this what slack is all about?

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,680
This slack work, friends?

42
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,440
I got back a couple of weeks ago from two weeks on the road traveling, preaching,

43
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:43,020
preaching on car hoods and selling subgenius goods and taking love offerings out of the trunk of the car.

44
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,340
And I'm not exaggerating.

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,060
I actually did that at one point.

46
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,900
It was lots of fun.

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:56,960
And, yes, although I've got to admit, it's hard to rip myself away from the Internet to do this show.

48
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,860
That's a whole other show.

49
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,220
The news group called Alt.Slack on the Internet.

50
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,820
It's been a lot of fun this week because all the college kids have gone home from school,

51
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:26,480
and there's nobody left on the board but Nenslo, Philo Drummond, and myself, and Reverend Townsend from the, what is it, WMPG, I believe, in Maine, in Portland, Maine.

52
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,080
Good to be back on the air up in Portland, dear friends.

53
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,400
And Onan, Dr. Onan Canobite.

54
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,820
All the college student subgeniuses, I guess, cleared out.

55
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,440
And I know not everybody.

56
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,340
Everybody is being flushed down the digital sewer.

57
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,000
Have you gotten sick and tired of hearing about this info superhighway yet?

58
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,800
I haven't.

59
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,720
Because I think there's big money in it, friends.

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:08,080
I want to be, when they figure out the perfect way to encrypt electronic money, that's the company to invest in.

61
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,220
That would be like owning a patent on the zipper.

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,720
Or the button.

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,700
It would be like owning a patent on money.

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:24,460
So, anyway, like I was saying, friends have been gone for two weeks doing devivals and radio shows and even book signings.

65
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,660
Yes, we're very busy because our new book, Revelation X, is out.

66
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,440
And I can't tell you to run out and buy it or anything like that.

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,800
I mean, that would be a conflict of interest.

68
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,260
You know, we've gotten in trouble before for not empowering.

69
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,420
Low in money.

70
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,320
Moderate income people.

71
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:52,160
But believe it or not, as I do this show here, it's the day before the night before Christmas.

72
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,380
It's Christmas Eve, Eve.

73
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,580
And this show was supposed to be finished two weeks ago to stay on schedule.

74
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,840
This is subgenius time control in action, dear friends.

75
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,320
The time control that lets the tapes run out in the background.

76
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
But, boy, there are some good tapes here.

77
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,220
Just look at them.

78
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,560
All this cool music that people have actually, we have no idea how cool some of it is.

79
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,620
I haven't heard all of it.

80
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,600
But best of all, I've got this massive taping from the ESO radio show in Cleveland.

81
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,600
When we went out to Cleveland, we once again got to be with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz,

82
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,820
where we did many hours of the purest, purest transpilation.

83
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,240
Lots of that coming up over the next, yeah, I mean, when I get three hours done there,

84
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,060
that's good for, somehow it turns into five hours of slack.

85
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,560
And, yeah, we've been a bit slow.

86
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,020
But there was divivals in Cleveland and Akron.

87
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,740
Oh, God, the Akron subgenius revival.

88
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,240
It was like in the good old days.

89
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,220
Good old-fashioned revival called a fetish ball with men and women showing up.

90
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:19,560
All dressed in very little leather and spikes and indulging their nakedity and roiling and rolling around on the floor.

91
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,600
And Dr. Legume killed Bob and yanked his heart out of his chest while the girls gyrated

92
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,520
and actually ate the brain of J.R. Bob Dobbs right there on stage.

93
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,400
I saw it happen.

94
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,760
I've got videotapes of it.

95
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:41,040
While forms of insanity, Reverend Toth Wilder's band, burned money, set fire to Dollar Bill.

96
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:48,960
And the audience was throwing at the preachers and inserted those flaming dollar bills in the half-eaten mass of flesh

97
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,720
that was the brain of J.R. Bob Dobbs that night.

98
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:59,140
And that is an event that actually happened that I, as a preacher, witnessed, and as a technician, videotaped.

99
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:07,080
So I even witnessed at one point no less than 150 people showing up for a subgenius book signing.

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,440
Now, that is a new event.

101
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,400
Usually when we...

102
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,580
When your dear host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang, is invited to a book signing,

103
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,280
about three kids show up, and it's embarrassing for everybody.

104
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,380
But praise Bob, I walked into that Borders bookstore in downtown Philadelphia.

105
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,020
There was 150 people waiting there to be saved, and half of them bought the book

106
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,960
after I finished scolding them about it.

107
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:39,720
And so there was more nakedity at the Philadelphia revival, strange goings-on,

108
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,200
and procuring...

109
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,140
and pimping and so forth by Pastor Craig Roll.

110
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,460
Dr. Legume performed his last rant.

111
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,240
People's hands were pierced by the spike, and people's minds were set free.

112
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,320
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

113
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,160
It has been a busy, busy month, and it's just getting busier.

114
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,420
We've got to pay the book authors.

115
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,260
We've got to complete all the proposals.

116
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,360
We've got to...

117
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,020
Ugh.

118
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,340
You don't even want to hear about it.

119
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,460
You don't want to hear about it.

120
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:14,940
I'll tell you what.

121
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,200
Let's listen to something that might be mighty nice.

122
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,160
Let's see.

123
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,540
I believe it was the fourth song here on this CD that we got.

124
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,640
This was...

125
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,300
Whoa.

126
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,840
Whoa.

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,560
Whoa.

128
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,700
This CD was given to me, I believe, at the Philadelphia revival

129
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,340
by this band called Punch Drunk.

130
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,000
You callilla L'Plaza, right?

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Yeah, Philadelphia.

132
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,700
Punch.

133
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,960
Here's their e-mail.

134
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,600
.

135
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,920
We'll give that address in just a few minutes.

136
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,280
?

137
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:57,560
Pump Drunk Drunk.

138
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,880
?

139
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:58,880


140
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:58,880


141
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:58,880


142
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:58,880


143
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,380
?

144
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,420
?

145
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:03,800
!!

146
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,200
Drunk Drunk Drunk.

147
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,420
As I kept on hearing their music, I started to sound around...

148
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:05,560
I can smell College.

149
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:05,560


150
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:05,560


151
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,360
College.

152
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,360


153
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,300
Thank you.

154
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,440
Thank you.

155
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,040
Thank you.

156
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,780
Thank you.

157
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,260
Thank you.

158
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,240
Thank you.

159
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,700
Thank you.

160
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:35,560
Thank you.

161
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,860
Thank you.

162
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,540
Thank you.

163
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:30,340
Thank you.

164
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,760
Thank you.

165
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,580
Thank you.

166
00:14:53,260 --> 00:15:01,700
Thank you.

167
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:01,940
Thank you.

168
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,980
Thank you.

169
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,760
Thank you.

170
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,000
Thank you.

171
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,660
Thank you.

172
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,220
Thank you.

173
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,580
It's a hangover inducing sound.

174
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,720
Didn't have a thing to drink.

175
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,620
I got a hangover anyway.

176
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,900
Thanks to this show.

177
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,980
.

178
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,680
.

179
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,080
when it goes down,

180
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,020
the perforations can be properly...

181
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,880
The spell it is trepanation

182
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,920
to pound little holes in the skull

183
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,620
to allow the brain to breathe.

184
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,740
When I signed up for that trepanation,

185
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,400
they didn't tell me about the echo side effects.

186
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,580
But it opens the third nostril.

187
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,160
I can breathe again.

188
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,400
Oh, sure, I can see people's auras now.

189
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,700
Hey, man, you're always black, dude.

190
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,140
I don't see anything.

191
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,160
But I can hardly understand anything.

192
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,840
I can't echo.

193
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,760
This is the funhouse.

194
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,200
The sound of the drill going into my head

195
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,860
was the last thing I heard

196
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,860
was the echo.

197
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,800
And this weird music in my head.

198
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,500
The living world is escaping me.

199
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,500
My head always hurts.

200
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,160
Thanks, Bob.

201
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,980
My head always hurts.

202
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,360
Thanks, Bob.

203
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,380
This music is horrible.

204
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,680
Louder. Louder.

205
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:58,420
More.

206
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,460
Thanks, Bob.

207
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:00,640
Thanks, Bob.

208
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,660
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

209
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,660

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,660

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,660

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,660


213
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,660


214
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,180
Bye-bye.

215
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,540
Bye-bye.

216
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:04,540


217
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,240
Bye-bye.

218
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:26,460
Bye-bye.

278

Gristle Twist says,

279
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,060
Yes, I finally managed to view these books, the only two in the entire store.

280
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,720
They were back to back in a sort of mating position.

281
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,840
I can't explain.

282
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,600
So I interrupted them and was overjoyed.

283
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,440
It's been a good while since my mind has been so inversely gyrated in such a manner.

284
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,120
What I'm saying is, these books hurt, plain and simple.

285
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,560
Hurt me good, yeah.

286
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,500
I felt just like a plate full of steaming and scrambled eggs, or worse.

287
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,840
And that was just from skimming through them.

288
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,700
A fresh head wound have I.

289
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,640
Thanks, Bob.

290
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,860
My head always hurts.

291
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,900
Praise your sweet nature, Bob.

292
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,020
Now you notice some of the people, for a long period of time,

293
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,400
there are dark circles about the eyes.

294
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,760
And a strange...

295
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
glazed glass.

296
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:15,020
Uh, they either look inward, but there's nothing to see.

297
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,280
You can't see your own eyes.

298
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,560
You can't hear your own ears.

299
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,580
Can't run from your own feet.

300
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,620
You can't spank your own poodie.

301
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,180
Can't swallow your own throat.

302
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,760
You can't think about...

303
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,760
your own brain.

304
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,080
Don't do it, kid.

305
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,440
It's fuzzy. It's fuzzy.

306
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,000
I can't think about my own brain.

307
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,840
You can't rip off your own chainer.

308
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,640
It's a vague feeling.

309
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,740
It's a very, very hazy, fuzzy... fuzzy?

310
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,280
Yeah, ever since I got this hole in my skull,

311
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,500
my vision has been great, but...

312
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,240
God, this... my hearing...

313
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,540
It's like I hear these little bongo noises.

314
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,800
And squeaks and...

315
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,560
ghost violins.

316
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,380
It's confusing. It's disorienting.

317
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,920
Well, see, you can not only see people's doors,

318
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,780
now you can hear them too, see?

319
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,380
And their auras sound awful.

320
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,820
It's disconcerting.

321
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,660
It makes me nauseous.

322
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,180
The room's spinning again.

323
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,120
I... I... I can't... I don't like this anymore.

324
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,380
Bob, make it go away!

325
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,580
Make it come down, Bob!

326
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,100
Ah!

327
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,320

And I guess that takes us out to side two of show.

332
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,480
Thank you.

333
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,160
Will the same thing happen to me when I get to be a man too?

334
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,740
Yes, son.

335
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,940
You'll go through the operations too.

336
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,400
The doctors will open your third nostril with their musical instruments

337
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,660
and you'll be able to whiff-read the stenches of all the normals and pinks around you.

338
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,660
You'll be able to sell them anything, son.

339
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,240
Just like me.

340
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,200
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend.

341
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,580
Oh, look out, son.

342
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,080
Here it comes now.

343
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,140
Step aside, Earth fools.

344
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,140
It is I, Jehovah One,

345
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,620
the evil alien space god from a corporate sin deli.

346
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,900
Dixie, bow down and pray to me

347
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,240
or I will threaten you with stories of a hell.

348
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,160
They're not bowing down.

349
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,960
They're just bending over.

350
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,200
This isn't hell. This is some genius hell.

351
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,500
No, we took you to hell and then we took you and set you adrift in outer space,

352
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,300
but now we're going to drag you through the internet.

353
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,640
You're going to surf the digital space.

354
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,120
You're going to go through the sewers.

355
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,860
From now on, Dave.

356
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,240
Here, we'll just enter him in.

357
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,940
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

358
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:36,800
They'll see.

359
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,680
That's the subject. Let me see.

360
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,840
And this is coming from...

361
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,220
Wait, I better mark off the beginning time.

362
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,820
Sub-Gstang1 at AOL.com.

363
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,980
Okay. Date, 22 November 1963.

364
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,540
And we'll put him in the location, Triple Underpass Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas.

365
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,980
And as soon as I hit exit, off he'll go.

366
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,700
Oh, no, not exit. That'll erase him.

367
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,260
Return, that's it.

368
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,420
I'm learning all this internet. I'm a cyber surfer now.

369
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,720
Okay, now we're going to send Dave to Dealey Plaza. Let's go.

370
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,760
What? Wait, wait, what?

371
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,920
Oh, it didn't work.

372
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,800
Oh, it says the modem's at the wrong speed.

373
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,840
It's 96,100 baud instead of 24.

374
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,700
And I...

375
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,120
I paid 89 bucks extra. It was supposed to be able to run that pro...

376
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,360
Oh, well.

377
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,940
Oh, dear friends.

378
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,260
Have you ever faxed someone from the beach?

379
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,700
Have you ever produced a radio show from a hell hole?

380
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,040
A pit of hell?

381
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,060
Have you ever had your email intercepted by a government agency?

382
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,000
You will.

383
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,360
I have.

384
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,420
Yeah, I remember.

385
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,680
I was reading...

386
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,480
I was reading on the subgenius news on the internet, alt.slack.

387
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,320
There, it's...

388
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Yeah, you can tune in.

389
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,520
It's been a subgenius board.

390
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,400
It's been there for years, and we just finally got the stolen modem working.

391
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:17,580
And why, I remember looking at that little screen, and up came an ad for the upcoming Cleveland DeVival,

392
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,320
which happens to be tomorrow night.

393
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,680
And this came from our dear friend CXT18 at POD.

394
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,840
CWRU.edu.

395
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,320
Honorary Reverend Christina Tate, the queen of all hate.

396
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:43,580
And on November 23rd, while Susie DeFluzzi and I were preaching at the Dallas Kennedy assassination convention,

397
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,300
this message ID came through.

398
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,740
And I...

399
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:54,320
Well, I could just envision lovely young Christina sitting there typing up this noble ad.

400
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,680
And I...

401
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:54,680


402
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,340
I'm just gonna have to wait for it to come out.

403
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:03,120
Get your saggy asses to the most benighted CIA...

404
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,760
Maybe it's that CIA...

405
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,180
Building for the December 2nd DeVival at 8.30pm.

406
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,960
Fill your little tummy with hatred of all things normal.

407
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,000
Crawl out from under your parents' couch.

408
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,680
And come screech with the rev and the whole local directorate.

409
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:24,680


410
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:24,680


411
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,860
And if you're a little too old, you can't even get a good look at the

412
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:46,660
And then explore the crusty caverns of depravity in the name of Dobby Bob's.

413
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:53,460
As the termination of the conspiracy's grip on your essence.

414
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,560
Scurpy.

415
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,140
And when it becomes a matter of trust...

416
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,240
My neck hurts.

417
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,900
Confuse and frustrate parents and other authority figures...

418
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,760
My mom's wondering if I can have the car.

419
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,780
It's just gonna go off for half an hour.

420
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,380
As you fill the holy coffers of Bob's sacred trousers.

421
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,860
Delight in the visage of the one true slack master.

422
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,860
As your own life burns away.

423
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:23,220
And your hate lust is quenched in an endless ejaculation of loathing and scorn.

424
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,360
Feel extra cool as you carefully remove the road grime from your civic's rear bumper.

425
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:37,700
In order to apply the groovy Bob bumper sticker you drunkenly purchased the night before.

426
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,900
And boy, I remember thinking...

427
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:50,480
I'll just use that lovely description of the DeVival from now on for our press releases.

428
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,560
Our church press releases.

429
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,300
Because...

430
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,680
Maybe then the air will be...

431
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,160
The echo will go away.

432
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,600
It hurts so bad.

433
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,100
Just...

434
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,420
Pantone the echo.

435
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,300
But isn't that a...

436
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,660
But you know what she didn't add to that was that this...

437
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:14,740
At this event, Lonesome Cowboy Dave will be available to be tortured, pelted with coins, tomatoes, eggs...

438
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,700
Pieces of holy artifacts.

439
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,400
Holy artifacts, pieces of the one true cross, the thigh bone of Saint Josephus...

440
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,860
The holy toe bone of Saint Germain.

441
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,660
The bear...

442
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,420
The claw of Anshi Bear.

443
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,100
The buttock of Witchy Tartai Woman.

444
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,340
All of these things can be thrown, tossed, uh...

445
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,640
Can be used to pelt Lonesome Cowboy Dave...

446
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,400
Who will be chained up there by Dr. Chaz...

447
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,940
And live...

448
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,080
Long confused...

449
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,580
In person...

450
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,500
For that murdered woman.

451
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,880
For your edification and cruelty.

452
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,420
And you yourself will be strewn with religious artifacts.

453
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,720
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

454
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,980
Oh, but Princess Weave, what building?

455
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,760
Where is this revival at tomorrow night?

456
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,440
The subgenius devival?

457
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,340
Why, it's at the Cleveland Institute of Art Factory Building.

458
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,380
The Cleveland Institute of Art.

459
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,920
Oh, I guess this religion is just an art thing, huh?

460
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,760
It's just some...

461
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,340
Oh, fronted by the CIA.

462
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,320
Performance art.

463
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,360
Or, uh, is that what it is?

464
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,940
So they can just get up there and act weird and crazy and...

465
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,820
They keep their names down.

466
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,360
That's why they're holding it CIA.

467
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,520
You see, it's just some mnemonic mnemonic.

468
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,540
That's what you remember.

469
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,220
When it comes up later, they took your name down.

470
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,040
Come out.

471
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,880
Come out and be seen and have your picture taken by...

472
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,500
By...

473
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,200
ABC, NBC, CBS, they'll all be there doing specials.

474
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,520
So show up in costume.

475
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,020
And, uh, if you want to say something right now, please keep it to yourself.

476
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,480
Because I, uh, wait...

477
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,300
There was an article about this devival in the Scene magazine.

478
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,120
Oh, here it is.

479
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,600
And, uh...

480
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:59,640
Reverend Grinder, an Akron area subgenius minister and one of the organizers of the

481
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:06,620
subgenius fetish ball happening in Akron this Saturday, December 3rd night, sums up devivals

482
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,440
this way.

483
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,900
Quote...

484
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:17,400
In a world where supposedly normal people succeed, get rich and live happily, the rest

485
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,580
of us appreciate the chance to give the finger to society and have a whole new life.

486
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,840
Hell of a good time while we do it.

487
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,240
Yes, friends.

488
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,980
Why sit by and watch those mentally healthy people have success and get rich when you

489
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,200
could join us in an orgy of vindictive hatefulness against impurely people...

490
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,820
It's beyond Satanism, dear friends.

491
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,380
So far beyond Satanism.

492
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,220
It...

493
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,660
We're...

494
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,100
We're...

495
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,240
With Bob's help, we're building a new heaven and a new earth on the rubble of the old.

496
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,620
Yes?

497
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:59,240
With Bob, the church, the book, you get something for nothing.

498
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,520
Eternal salvation, dear friends, or triple your money back.

499
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,300
Can any other religion offer you that?

500
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,620
Nay, I think not.

501
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,000
It's $30 now for salvation.

502
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,680
I'm sorry.

503
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,820
That's just the way it goes.

504
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,500
But why must one pay for salvation?

505
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,580
Isn't salvation drop from the rains, from the heavens like a rain?

506
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,520
Isn't salvation a gift of grace?

507
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:20,840
Yes.

508
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,480
Well, actually, we would have kept the prices normally at $20, but the church was bought

509
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,240
out recently in a hostile corporate takeover.

510
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,860
I'm still working there.

511
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:38,000
But Dobbs sold the church to Dr. Bronner, the soap manufacturer.

512
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,440
Oh, my God.

513
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,700
Have you seen those odd little soap bottles you see in health food stores?

514
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,060
Yes.

515
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,280
The rant about the moral ABCs.

516
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,520
Yes, yes.

517
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,240
Rabbi Hillel.

518
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,600
Yes.

519
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,040
Okay, okay.

520
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,960
Dilute, dilute.

521
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,580
Slack, slack.

522
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,420
Yes, he bought the church.

523
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,380
And so things, there have been a few, we're praising Dr. Bronner instead of praising Bob.

524
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,200
He's the same guy that makes the celery soda, too.

525
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,980
Well, he wrote a lot of the early subgenius material anyway.

526
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,360
I thought he was dead long ago.

527
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,640
He's still writing his tracts on the ...

528
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,980
We got a letter from him just the other day.

529
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,300
This is from Dr. Bronner.

530
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,620
It was an inter-office memo.

531
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,200
He sent it by email.

532
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,220
It says,

533
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:21,380
Dear Reverend Stang, you are doing great pioneer work, so much so that in one world

534
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,600
with nuclear bombs, you can teach the moral ABC, the Essene teacher of righteousness of

535
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,560
light, the real Rabbi Hillel taught Jesus to unite the whole human race, lightning like

536
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,740
in our eternal Father's great all one God faith.

537
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,400
You can teach the moral ABC, Hillel taught Jesus, to unite all mankind free.

538
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,200
Its four outstanding points are, first, perfect yourself first, like my father, and second,

539
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,060
mark, spit.

540
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,680
Second, absolute cleanliness is godliness.

541
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:56,920
Third, Essene, Earth control must limit birth, or we destroy God's spaceship Earth.

542
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,420
Then we can enjoy the greatest freedom.

543
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,280
Fourth, teach how to love, for God is love, uniting all one above, above.

544
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:14,620
For when Tom Tom, our male cat, sexed Boo Boo, another male, Boo Boo hollered bloody murder and ashamed.

545
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,240
Ran away to die.

546
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:24,260
So instead of teaching how to sex, Dr. Bronner writes to his new employees,

547
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,720
In his inner office memo to you.

548
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,060
Yeah.

549
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,220
So instead of teaching how to sex, like it does in our new book, Revelation X, he says,

550
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:38,040
we must teach how to love, for God is love, uniting all one above, above.

551
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,660
So as Einstein's kin, we wrote in 1944,

552
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,880
the poem, Hug to Love, for God is Love, uniting all one above, above, above.

553
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,340
Send the checks here, Reverend Stang.

554
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,420
Yours truly, Dr. Bronner.

555
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,720
Oh, I can't, I, you mean, this is now a part of the Essene conglomerate?

556
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:03,940
Yeah, the Church of the Subgenius is now part of the moral ABCs of the Essenes by the,

557
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,380
what we once called the crackpot, but great soap maker.

558
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,020
Oh, yes, I love his almond, yes.

559
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,460
Yeah.

560
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,640
So now, you'll have to get the, all of our new books,

561
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,580
all of our new material will be printed on soap bottles.

562
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,840
100% recyclable, I, I.

563
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:24,820
Yes, you can, and you can use Dr. Bronner's soap for birth control, for shampoo.

564
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,100
Cancer cures.

565
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,420
Cancer cures, you have.

566
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,420
Swash your sideburns.

567
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,140
Huh?

568
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,780
Clean Sprott stains.

569
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,860
It, it will, you can use it as Sprott.

570
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,300
So you'll have Bob doing, you'll perhaps maybe see that.

571
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,000
Bob's out of the picture now.

572
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,800
Now we're doing, tomorrow night's the Bible, we will still.

573
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,440
He's given, he's like given haircuts to Bum somewhere now, down in Skid Row or something, or?

574
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,920
He's probably been doing that all along anyway.

575
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,380
Yeah, yeah.

576
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,200
You know, Bob really wasn't that, he was really kind of a silent partner.

577
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,620
Oh my God.

578
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,240
He just, you know, it was just one of his experiments.

579
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,760
He sold it off to Bronner.

580
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,240
Bronner's 89 years old though, so.

581
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:08,880
So when he expires and goes to the all, all one Castile soap in the sky, what happens then?

582
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,700
Then, then Dr. Bronner's daughter.

583
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,860
Chacha takes over this radio show.

584
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,440
Oh, Chacha?

585
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,900
Oh my God.

586
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:16,440
Yeah.

587
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:16,440


588
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,620
Bob had it all planned.

589
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,060
He sent me a shot of her at the office.

590
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,240
Dr. Bronner's daughter, Chacha, is like the coolest subgenius of all.

591
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,460
Oh, it's one of Bane too.

592
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,240
Uh huh.

593
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,900
That, that third leg on top.

594
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,000
I like it that kind.

595
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,860
What am I gonna do for a little girl with three legs?

596
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,200
Ah, to think of the pleasures.

597
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,340
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

598
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,680
Who left this trash on the radio station?

599
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,880
This is not trash, this is litter.

600
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,720
Oh, this is tripe, radio tripe.

601
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,120
You know in the old days we called these people geeks.

602
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,520
Nowadays we call them sir.

603
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,700
Geeks walk into a bar and there's a comic up on stage saying this joke about there's two geeks walking into a bar.

604
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,000
And there's this comic up on stage with these geeks.

605
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,640
And it, yes, everybody wants to be Jayner, but only one person can be.

606
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,220
Caller, I don't believe you were there at the show.

607
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:04,380
Me?

608
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,520
We don't allow callers on that haven't shown us the stuff up on their tickets.

609
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,660
Wait, which, which one's Jayner?

610
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,480
He's right over there, officer.

611
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,300
Oh, I thought you, man.

612
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,640
Do your duty.

613
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,260
Oh, my God, my God, why did they, what, what are they doing?

614
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,160
Why don't they stop me?

615
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,420
Okay, so Jayner, you can probably go home.

616
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,280
This guy will do the lines.

617
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:17,540
I can never get in town.

618
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,300
He'll do all the lines.

619
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,480
Does he know my stuff?

620
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:19,800
Yeah.

621
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,120
That's it.

622
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,560
Yeah, we can just all go to sleep now.

623
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,980
Have you ever heard the one about that guy walks up to the other guy and then that guy

624
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,620
walks up to the other guy and that guy walks up to the other guy and then.

625
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,960
I heard that one, I heard that one, yeah.

626
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,820
You hear the one about the comic.

627
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,560
Tell Jayner the other one.

628
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,600
I've never heard the, you hear the one about the comic, it just says you hear the one about

629
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,080
the comic.

630
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,960
Ditch this loser.

631
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,580
Okay.

632
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,600
Now, for the real question about it.

633
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,820
So, I'm ripping off my own material, I admit it.

634
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:49,260
It runs your guitar.

635
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,720
I want to be on MTV.

636
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,180
I want to play alternative music.

637
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,980
I want my hair to hang in my face

638
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,760
So I can look like Kurt Cobain

639
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,640
Kurt Cobain, Kurt Cobain

640
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,040
Hey, we know it's a valid musical style

641
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,200
You know it's really nothing different from

642
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,420
The crap the 60s underground bands used to play

643
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,660
But the music industry has grown a lot since then

644
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,060
Now it doesn't matter a sound

645
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,960
If you're talented enough

646
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,760
Just as long as you sound like you came from Seattle

647
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:44,860
Seattle

648
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,220
Seattle

649
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,840
Seattle

650
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,160
Seattle

651
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,480
Seattle

652
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:35,480


653
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,880
Yes, dear friends, and we're listening to Dr. Bizarro here

654
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,560
Now in the background, once in the foreground

655
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,500
Dr. Bizarro, what we might call Zappa 2

656
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:48,860
Amazing

657
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,680
And that's available from, dear friends

658
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,060
This particular cut is from Dr. Bizarro and the Disgustos

659
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,740
A tape album

660
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,660
Every Back's Always Thing Words

661
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,160
And that's available from iBob Digital

662
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,360
At P.O. Box 3405

663
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:15,500
That's right, that's Box 3405 in Skokie, Illinois

664
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,060
Skokie

665
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,880
A 60076

666
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,520
Yes, 6405

667
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,400
That zip code is 600766405

668
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,200
And, uh

669
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,400
I mean, there's an obvious contradiction here

670
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,260
Dr. Bizarro is, uh

671
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,820
Often is hitting bands for sounding like each other

672
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,820
But it sounds so much like Zappa

673
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,900
In some strange

674
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,540
I just

675
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,380
I don't

676
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:53,280
And what else have we been listening to here?

677
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,820
Friends, well, there was a little cut there

678
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,900
Of the Berklee KPFA show

679
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,000
In the olden days

680
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,780
Uh, when, uh

681
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,260
Well, Dr. Howell, of course

682
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,460
And Puzzling Evidence

683
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,700
But we had Janer as a guest on there

684
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,780
Janer Hyperpleits

685
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,460
The great Arkansas anti-comic

686
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,060
Uh, and, uh

687
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,440
The fearsome father Joe Mama

688
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,180
Um, before that

689
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,060
Uh, oh, well, it's been a lot of, uh

690
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,620
Cuts from the ESO

691
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,080
The most recent collaboration

692
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,600
Between yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stank

693
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,100
And the other subgeniuses there

694
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,940
Princess Wiardo

695
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,940
And

696
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,820
ESO Radio

697
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,340
Uh, that's, uh, Lonesome Cowboy Dave

698
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,780
And, uh, Chaz Smith

699
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,100
And, uh, and Michelle

700
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,900
And Mrs. Chaz

701
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,840
And, uh, Fred

702
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,340
On the baboon

703
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,140
I think his name comes up properly again

704
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:44,860
I'm sorry

705
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,600
And that's all

706
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,060
That all gets done

707
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,720
On WCSB in Cleveland

708
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,180
One of the foremost college stations

709
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,480
Ever, anywhere

710
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,020
Praise WCSB and, uh

711
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,900
ESO Radio

712
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,920
As much as it's a good thing

713
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,380
It hurts

714
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,260
It hurts, yes, friends

715
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:00,940
It hurts

716
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,440
To feel that show

717
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,580
The echo really does make the walls

718
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,220
Twist around, don't you think?

719
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,480
Yes

720
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,220
But in the meantime

721
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,380
I think that it's time

722
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,280
That we go to this

723
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,000
And

724
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,900
And it's time that I tell you

725
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,580
That you are listening to the subgenius

726
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,340
Radio ministry hour of Slack

727
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,200
The voice of the church

728
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,940
Of the subgenius

729
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,600
Praise that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs

730
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,640
And I'd like to give you

731
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,140
The address to write to

732
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,820
For general overall information

733
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,740
About this mighty church

734
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,240
And this radio show

735
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,480
And the publications and so forth

736
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,100
Also available

737
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,840
And, uh, but that information

738
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,140
Is free

739
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,320
Yes, it's free to you

740
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,220
You

741
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,340
Because you've been singled out

742
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,280
You, the listener

743
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,180
I can feel you

744
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:49,900
I'm in the spirit

745
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,280
I'm a minister

746
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,400
I know these things

747
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,080
I see these things

748
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,180
I see a young man out there

749
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,740
He's, he's, he's bereft

750
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,620
He's, he's, he's bereft

751
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,660
He's, he's, he's, he's

752
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,540
He didn't know what's missing

753
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,640
But he knows something's missing

754
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,840
He knows he needs slack

755
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,340
I feel you, friend

756
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,180
And, uh, Bob wants to feel you, too

757
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,380
So why don't you write to Bob

758
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,400
You got that pencil ready?

759
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,860
Just write for free information

760
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,320
A self-addressed stamped envelope

761
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,860
Always gets you more

762
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,960
And that address is

763
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,140
Well, just write to

764
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,720
Bob

765
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:20,500
Bob

766
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,000
At Post Office Box

767
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,760
140

768
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:26,780
306

769
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,040
Dallas, Texas

770
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,400
75214

771
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,800
Once again, that's Bob at Box 140306

772
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,520
Dallas, Texas

773
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:39,740
75214

774
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,880
And, uh, we'll be going back into that revival, uh, soon

775
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,700
What else did we have on here earlier?

776
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,060
Oh, uh, the music

777
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,720
And there's other takes of that available

778
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,320
Hey, Bobber Rebop

779
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,780
That classic old tune

780
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,320
Uh, was heard being done by Forms of Insanity

781
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,720
I'd love to play the whole song

782
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,520
But it gets wrong

783
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:57,600
I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to do it

784
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:57,600


785
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:57,600


786
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:57,600


787
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:57,600


788
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:57,600


789
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:57,700
It's got a different kind of rhythm

790
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,760
And it's just a little bit raunchier and raunchier

791
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,200
To the point where the FCC, you know

792
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,460
And, uh, yes

793
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,520
And this is in the background

794
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,180
This lovely music is Osric Tentacles

795
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,480
Yes

796
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,340
We'll see what happens next

797
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,940
I honestly don't know

798
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,280
And, uh, was there

799
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,660
Was there anything else in the news?

800
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,580
Yeah, well, we're gonna go back and see

801
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


802
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


803
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


804
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


805
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


806
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


807
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


808
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


809
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


810
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


811
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


812
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,580


813
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,600
What happened to the

814
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:31,620
The

815
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,020
The

816
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:32,240
The

817
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,980
The

818
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,480
The

819
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,080
The

820
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,420
The

821
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:39,880
The

822
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:39,880


823
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:39,880


824
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:39,880


825
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:39,880


826
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:39,880


827
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:00,620
This music would make you feel familiar

828
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:00,780
You feel familiar

829
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,180
When I say familiar

830
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,040
Yeah

831
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,460
Your wife knows

832
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:12,980
You're going to

833
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,060
A recently

834
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,820
Haven't called your iy

835
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,440
I don't make bills

836
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,000
I don't make bills

837
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,960
Can't afford the

838
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,440
Can't afford the

839
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:27,500
Age

840
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:27,520
Age

841
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,540
Age

842
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:27,560
Age

843
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,280
Yeah, I've heard of it.

844
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,720
And they also take the lactate from a baboon's knee.

845
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,460
And they can work wonders with that, too.

846
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,940
But, you know, they're raping the rainforest.

847
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:43,540
And those are the rare, yes, raping the rainforest for the fruits of the breast-kneed baboon.

848
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,660
The lactating breast-kneed baboon.

849
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,060
And the snake oil was an old Indian cure, which nobody ever gave them credit for.

850
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,080
They just laughed and danced until sun came up and then talked about other stuff.

851
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,480
Oh, people thought it was a placebo.

852
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,360
It was a placebo, but it worked.

853
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,500
That's just like Bob Dobbs himself.

854
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,380
Yep.

855
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:01,540
You know?

856
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,640
It's like it doesn't matter what's in the bottle if it was him that sold it to you.

857
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,560
100% sugar cure cube.

858
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,320
Damn it.

859
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,540
But guaranteed to work.

860
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,020
Work.

861
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:11,780
Work.

862
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:12,900
Work.

863
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,240
I said the word.

864
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,500
Yeah, and here's some work for you, friends.

865
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,040
Write down the address of ESO Radio.

866
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,520
Yeah, they make funny tapes, too.

867
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,460
Check out ESO Radio.

868
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,480
Got that pencil ready.

869
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,000
And that is at P.O. Box.

870
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,840
Just write ESO at P.O. Box.

871
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,840
1-4-7-7-6.

872
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:39,860
That's right.

873
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:45,560
That's 1-4-7-7-6 in Cleveland, Ohio.

874
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,360
Yes, Cleveland.

875
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:48,920
Oh!

876
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,460
And that zip code is 44114.

877
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,380
Oh, and it feels so good.

878
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,900
To do a zip code like 44114.

879
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:07,060
And to do such a fun, fun show where I can listen back to things I don't remember doing.

880
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,380
By the way, pardon me if I replay KPFA things.

881
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:16,980
I honestly can't remember a month ago when I put those other shows together because we're so happy here.

882
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,220
Oh, yes, we're happy, happy at the Church of the Subgenius.

883
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,880
We have slack, slack dripping out of our ears.

884
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,020
We just love it.

885
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,500
And it's...

886
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,180
It's a joy, a joy to behold.

887
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,220
In fact, I'm going to pull out this other music donated by Nensla.

888
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,180
Good old Nenslo there in Portland, Oregon.

889
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,840
Coming right up.

890
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:39,700
Although, let's just...

891
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,180
Let's just tune into this piece for a while.

892
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,720
There's some other bits from Nenslo's collection.

893
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,360
Oh, well.

894
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,380
So much for that one.

895
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,280
As I was saying, friends, we are happy, happy, happy.

896
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:02,940
Happy, happy, happy, happy here at the Church of the Subgenius.

897
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,940
They can look at us and laugh.

898
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,820
For all the fun we have, they don't get half.

899
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:22,400
They say you are the fly, but I know that you're mine.

900
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,920
So leave your camera on the bed.

901
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,600
Bye.

902
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,500
Bye.

903
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,320
Bye.

904
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,580
Bye.

905
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:43,600
Bye.

906
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,000
Bye.

907
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:45,340


908
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:45,480
Bye.

909
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:45,580
Bye.

910
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:45,900
Bye.

911
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,420
Bye.

912
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,660
Bye.

913
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:58,820
Well, I don't care what people say

914
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,120
You know what?

915
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,360
We make ten new friends each day

916
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:11,740
And when you got love, you can really have a ball

917
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:18,380
You see, we're not so different to you after all

918
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:24,900
When we go out a-walkin' in the town

919
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:32,060
Frankly, honey, you should see them try to bring us down

920
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,100
But I just put it aside

921
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,520
Because I'm off to a high

922
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,100
So you can look at them and laugh

923
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,520
So you can look at them and laugh

924
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:57,140
So you can look at them and laugh

925
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:03,600
So you can look at them and laugh

926
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:08,080
So you can look at them and laugh

927
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:14,080
Yes, dear friends, we and that great set of musicians there, Adam and Eve,

928
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,160
can look at them and we can laugh.

929
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,500
We as subgeniuses may gaze upon those normals laughing

930
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,280
and tittering as we go.

931
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:22,720
Thank you.

932
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,780
The number you have reached

933
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,780
1-800-OUTBEND

934
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,420
has been changed.

935
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,920
The new number is

936
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,560
617-LICK-OBE

937
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,820
Please make a note of it.

938
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,600
At the tone, record your message.

939
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,520
J.R. Bob Dobbs told me to call

940
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,220
and here's my really weird message.

941
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,560
Still distorted.

942
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,240
No one could have anticipated

943
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,920
this thoroughly modern telephone

944
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,440
could wreak such havoc.

945
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,420
Hello?

946
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,040
Hello?

947
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,020
I love it every time I call.

948
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:10,560
I love it.

949
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,740
You guys are sick, but I think I love you very, very much.

950
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,700
Call me to get me free information by mail now.

951
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,420
Call my daughter.

952
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,540
I'm sorry that noise is going to drive me into

953
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:23,260
all that mess.

954
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,100
I'm sorry.

955
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,740
Sick.
