1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Remember, we're sitting together listening to this.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,200
And this was pleasing.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:18,320
Remember, we're sitting together listening to this.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,400
And this was pleasing.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,980
Remember, we're sitting together listening to this.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,840
And this was pleasing.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,320
to God.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,740
Oh, Reverend Stange.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,580
This is the good old days.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,640
Well, if it was really the good old days, we'd be in a car.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,040
We'd have gotten in a car so we could get away from our wives.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,180
Yeah, now our wives don't want us around anymore.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,640
They don't want to hear it anyway.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,600
They really don't pay any attention.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,940
Can't you guys leave?

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,820
Go do something.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,880
Why don't you guys go drive around like we used to?

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,020
Why don't you go do a radio show?

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,040
Something so we don't have to listen to you.

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,780
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,760
The Self Genius Hour of Slack.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,340
What?

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,260
Eternal Salvation.

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,780
Eternal Salvation.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,780
Or triple your money back.

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,100
The Church of the Subgenius.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:49,220
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed, uraglic function over the quality audio-visual techniques exacerbated and complicated by The Church of the Subgenius.

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,480
Copyright 1985-86.

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,860
Oh, Dr. Spurgeon.

30
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,060
Oh.

31
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:09,480
Now, you know, as most of you probably already know, within this rigidly hierarchical framework of The Church of the Subgenius,

32
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,260
the only real heresy in our church is orthodoxy.

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:22,300
Now, it occurs to me that I'm from the orthodox Stangian megafist temple lodge of the...

34
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,620
Fist temple wrath of...

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,280
Bob's Yeti resurrected, which is technically the most orthodox Stangian...

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,080
Or, uh, hera...

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,460
Well, it's the biggest heresy.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:35,700
See?

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:43,980
It can be the most orthodox of all the subgenius doctrines, and yet, therefore, because it's so orthodox, it's the biggest heresy.

40
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,880
See, you can't bait me.

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,240
No way.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,540
Go ahead and try.

43
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,220
As most of you have figured out, peer pressure to somehow fit in with anything is the conspiracy's...

44
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,740
Conspiracy.

45
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,700
Conspiracy's biggest snare.

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,940
It's their best trick.

47
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,480
And most of you have already quit wishing you could be like those pink jerks.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,380
You know, you've realized if you're a loner, then so be it.

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,100
And, friends, you can indeed learn to think completely for yourself.

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,100
But only J.R. Bob Dobbs can show you how!

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,500
Now, firebirds and camaros.

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,580
Firebirds and camaros are what my friend Dr. Drummond terms clone-mobiles.

53
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,280
They're the cars of choice of one of the mainstream types of pinks, or normals.

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,240
The cars all look exactly alike, and the people who drive them are all exactly alike.

55
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,040
They really, really are.

56
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,240
They all listen to the same radio station, no matter what part of the country they're in,

57
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,200
because even if the call letters are different...

58
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,880
It's still the same radio station.

59
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,760
And the DJs all say the same jokes at the same time of day.

60
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,120
And it's always...

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,780
Real rock radio!

62
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,500
Real rock radio!

63
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:15,180
Because the same songs are always playing simultaneously in every nook and cranny of this great nation.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,940
It's the rise of the mediocritans, my friend.

65
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,600
Everything nowadays, if you look around, everything's getting to where it really does look just like it does on TV.

66
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,380
Every city is the same city now.

67
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,320
They're all just spores of one gigantic, spreading, amoebic mall

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,540
that'll someday cover this globe like an endless ant bed.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,100
And from any given... It's already, you know, from any given downtown, you can drive for hours,

70
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,220
for hours driving away from that downtown through the same identical mini-malls,

71
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,060
the pizza huts, the apartment complexes and housing developments,

72
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,600
in endless...

73
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,580
Endless repetition.

74
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,560
Now, you know, I remember when that was considered dystopian science fiction.

75
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,900
And now that it's here, we think it's completely normal!

76
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,120
And all the little towns, you know, that used to have their own quaint, individualistic thing, all different,

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,880
now they all have the Whataburger, they all have the Burger King and the mall and the cinema octoplex,

78
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,500
while everything that made them, you know, their little quaint...

79
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,000
courthouse, or their strange vegetable stands and Dinosaur Park and so forth,

80
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:37,620
it's all being swallowed up by the devouring pinkness, the clockwork orangutans.

81
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Attention, pinks!

82
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,060
Incensate meat puppets!

83
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,480
If you can step away from your numbness long enough to really look around you,

84
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
does what you see excite you?

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,020
Does it really give you slack?

86
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,480
Does it do anything for you?

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:06,300
you, but just prolong the numbness. Oh, it's okay, you say. Everything's okay. In fact, I don't like

88
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,720
things that are more than okay, because then that makes me think there might be things that were

89
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,420
less than okay. As long as everything's okay, well, that's good enough. You can't have your cake and

90
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:24,600
eat it too, can you? I mean, we're free enough. We can indulge in all the properly ritualized

91
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:32,360
bad behavior, like going to the lake and watching the game, getting real drunk and beating our dogs

92
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,200
and our wives, but that's understood. You know, we all do that. But now, on the other hand,

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:47,120
and friends, going to the lake and watching the game and getting real drunk and launching

94
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,160
golfer heads while chanting and levitating, naked, fropped to the gills, performing

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,580
activities.

96
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:54,780
Dr. Encouragements.

97
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:04,640
Dr. Acu-beatings with each other's spouses and dogs. No way! Uh oh! No, no! It's okay to sublimate

98
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,260
our sexual drives into things like despoiling the landscape at the expense of health and

99
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,380
self awareness just for money, because the only thing that gives our tired, twisted old nervous

100
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:24,560
systems any kind of a thrill is the thought that we can buy more things. My friend, you're

101
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:24,580
able enough to Instagram or a hair salon, or any other social media platform that might tell you

102
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:30,880
Your body, just another thing to buy, my friends.

103
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,320
It is a thing to buy.

104
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,200
It's the thing to go by.

105
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,380
Your body keeps clocking in on the job,

106
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,100
functioning on not more than 10% of your life essence,

107
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,220
and the conspiracy gets the rest.

108
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,340
You moron.

109
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,200
They've got you thinking it's perfectly natural to work for a living.

110
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Now, what you want to do is real work.

111
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,280
There's nothing wrong with that, but what you have to do, that is slavery.

112
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,360
And no matter what they're paying, you're working too cheap.

113
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,400
We're not communists or anything, dear friends.

114
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,080
Bob Dobbs doesn't want everyone to be equally poor.

115
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,440
He wants everyone to be equally rich, but without working.

116
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,820
Good.

117
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,080
Now, in the Middle Ages,

118
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,340
in the Middle Ages,

119
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,180
they called it,

120
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,320
the obscene kiss.

121
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,560
Kissing Satan's bum was the way a warlock or a witch was initiated.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,220
Now, today we have corporate-style butt kissing.

123
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,800
Bestowing that submissive kiss upon the posterior of the chief executive devil.

124
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,980
The work ethic is satanic.

125
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,200
That's the only thing that's satanic in this whole crowd, I'll bet you.

126
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,160
It will be our doom.

127
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,280
Mark Bob's words.

128
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,360
Our little aquarium Earth is turning into a toxic toilet soul farm,

129
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,580
controlled by aliens and their stooges.

130
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,980
And day after day slips by.

131
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,600
Time that you could have invested in saving the universe with Bob,

132
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,040
but instead you sold it cheap to the conspiracy, like a sucker.

133
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,400
Stand still as we insert the probe.

134
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,420
You will not remember this.

135
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,420
Years out of your life, dear friend.

136
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,500
You will have no memory of this encounter.

137
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
They'll take years out.

138
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,820
And you'll have nothing to show for it but a lot of paid household bills.

139
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,380
You'll never get any of those years back.

140
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,660
You'll just get older and older and develop more chronic aches and pains and regrets.

141
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,400
And when you die, the conspirators will just say,

142
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,680
well, there's plenty more where that one came from.

143
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,000
Friends, it may be too late.

144
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,700
It may be too late to stop being optimistic.

145
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,560
But it is never too late to start being bitterly, bitterly pessimistic.

146
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,640
Now you think about it.

147
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,240
Remember, things could be much, much worse.

148
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,380
That's the consolation, really.

149
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,260
That's what we're in it for.

150
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:21,400
You could suddenly, one minute from now, be screaming in unimaginable pain, trapped inside the white hole of the universe.

151
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,480
You could be a hot, twisted metal and glass of wherever it is that you happen to be when it happens.

152
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:37,700
Or you could, funny ain't it, you could be lying on parched ground with bones so brittle from malnutrition

153
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:48,280
and a brain so ruined by disease that all life for you has become that one little dry vermin-ridden grain of rice at the tip of your tongue.

154
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,080
Or you could be rich.

155
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:58,800
But afflicted, friends, with something caused by your own lifestyle that bites deeper and deeper into you.

156
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,860
But ever so slowly, so that you never stop thinking about killing yourself.

157
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,140
Gosh, they'd be sorry then.

158
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,940
Or you could be so wrapped up in your job that you haven't noticed that you've gone crazy.

159
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,840
And you've only been hypnotized into thinking that, well, everything's basically okay.

160
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,320
But actually, they're starving.

161
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,400
They're starving.

162
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,060
They've got starvation and misery all around you.

163
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,220
They'll catch up with you sooner or later.

164
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,080
Boing!

165
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,860
Ohh.

166
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,500
But that hasn't happened yet.

167
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,400
So who cares?

168
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,000
Who cares?

169
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:40,080
As long as the power plant's still run and we can still televise yearly Earth Day rituals

170
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,000
when the liberals congratulate themselves for being liberals

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,460
and the conservatives congratulate themselves for fooling the liberals another year,

172
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,540
And the ones in between are ground into dog food.

173
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,480
You'll love this new method Bob's come up with for exterminating nine-tenths of the population at once.

174
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,320
You'll be able to drive a new Porsche every night and crash it the next morning.

175
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:16,060
Because Bob has come to change all that, to teach you acubating, time control, and memory editing.

176
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,020
To help you learn to pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

177
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:53,740
The violence in my head is real.

178
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,920
Bad, bad nonsense.

179
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,040
But the big brothers got no heart.

180
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,200
When I get my chance I'm gonna kick it up.

181
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,880
Big brothers got no heart.

182
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,980
When I get my chance I'm gonna kick it up.

183
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

184
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,700
Ah.

185
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,720
But the big brothers got no heart.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,820
When I get my chance I'm gonna kick it up.

187
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

188
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,560
Big brothers got no heart.

189
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,660
When I get my chance I'm gonna kick it up.

190
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,320
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

191
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,500
Ah.

192
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:36,500


193
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,080


194
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,300
Ah.

195
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,020
Ah.

196
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,700
Ah.

197
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,340
Ah.

198
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:48,700
Oh, yeah.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,380
Hazel O'Connor has the right idea.

200
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,340
Ha, ha, ha.

201
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,040
Yeah, oh, I'm spinning plates on sticks here.

202
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,740
Let me cue up some nice ambiance for us.

203
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,520
Yes.

204
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,920
I think it should do it nicely.

205
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Go ahead, hit it, babe.

206
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,600
Let's see what we've got here.

207
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,840
Oh, yeah.

208
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,420
Oh, that was close.

209
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,380
Ah.

210
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,980
Oh, yeah.

211
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,260
That was real close.

212
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,820
Oh, it always helps to work with a little musical accompaniment.

213
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:27,700
Mm.

214
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,980
Oh, yeah.

215
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,140
To work.

216
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,040
Oh.

217
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,300
If only this were work.

218
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,580
Oh, I could manage it if this were work.

219
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,140
Yeah, but the work ethic is yet enshrined

220
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:50,000
in the hoary old pulp fiction Horatio Alger pedophilia operas

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,840
about grubby, apple-cheeked, oh-so-Caucasian immigrant street urchins

222
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,520
with just enough gumption and stick-to-itiveness

223
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,340
to better their miserable lots

224
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,740
in the bright, shining, capitalistic new world.

225
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,360
But did you know that in the dozens of crappy, ground-out yarns

226
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,480
with titles like Ragged Dick, my personal favorite,

227
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,740
the best and best album in the world,

228
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,080
that not one of Alger's noble characters

229
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,120
ever won fame and millions?

230
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,680
Not one stout lad ever got more than a doodly-squat nickel

231
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,120
and dime raise and, well, inflation and the depression

232
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,780
soon took care of that.

233
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,400
Oh, yeah, shoe-shining waifs becoming the captains of industry.

234
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,140
Ha!

235
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,220
The conspiracy don't work that way, Bo.

236
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,520
Yeah.

237
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,120
Hey, the conspiracy hacks off your slack, and then plays games with you?

238
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,240
Keep away with it.

239
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,200
They tell you that life is supposed to be a bowl of steaming black buttered goat custard

240
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,060
with a handle on the inside.

241
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,900
Then I say, kick that bucket over on them and run!

242
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,340
Run for your life!

243
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,200
For this is a life and living death matter!

244
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,280
Run! Run!

245
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,560
Turn on the surveillance monitors.

246
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,480
It's worse than I thought.

247
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
It's morning at night.

248
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,520
They trickle through the gate.

249
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,740
They go home early.

250
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,840
They come in late.

251
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,260
Reeking of cheap liquor, they stumble through the day.

252
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,440
Never give a thought to honest work for honest pay.

253
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
I know it.

254
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,800
It shouldn't vex me.

255
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,720
I shouldn't take it hard.

256
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,760
I should ignore their capering with a kingly disregard.

257
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,380
But look at all those idiots.

258
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,320
Look at all those fools.

259
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,860
An office full of morons.

260
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,760
A factory full of fools.

261
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,600
Is it any wonder that I'm singing, singing blues?

262
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,980
Yours is a heavy burden, sir.

263
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,480
I'm just getting started.

264
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,640
They make personal phone calls and company time.

265
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,660
They...

266
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,240
They Xerox their buttockses.

267
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
And guess who pays the dimes?

268
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,420
Their blatant fever, he wounds me.

269
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,020
Their ingratitude is found.

270
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,700
I long to lure them to my home and then release the hounds.

271
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,420
I shouldn't grow unsettled when faced with such abuse.

272
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,120
I shouldn't let it plague me.

273
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,040
I shouldn't blow a fuse.

274
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,400
But look at all those idiots.

275
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,340
Look at all those fools.

276
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,940
An office full of morons.

277
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,680
A factory full of fools.

278
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Is it any wonder that I'm singing, singing blues?

279
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,480
What happened?

280
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Where are the instruments?

281
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,780
I believe they call this breakdown, sir.

282
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,620
I can't have any breakdowns here.

283
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,200
What if there was an inspector around?

284
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,640
Play a guitar solo.

285
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,980
I'm a little out of practice, sir.

286
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,080
I said do it.

287
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,700
So do it, do it, do it!

288
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,700
Yes, sir.

289
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,160
Uh-huh.

290
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,260
Yes, excellent.

291
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,140
Well done.

292
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,080
And it's beginning to grate.

293
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,420
That will be sufficient, Smithers.

294
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,020
I said that's enough!

295
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,300
Oh, sorry, sir.

296
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,280
Thought I had my mojo working.

297
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,520
That man by the cooler drinking water as if it's free.

298
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,460
Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir.

299
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,400
A drone from Sector 7.

300
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,120
Yes, sir.

301
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,020
Call this Simpson to my office and stay to watch the fun.

302
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,520
If he's six feet when he enters, he'll be two feet when I'm done.

303
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,580
It brings a ray of sunshine to my unhappy life.

304
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,240
To make him kneel before me and slowly twist the knife.

305
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,340
Look at all those ears!

306
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,340
Look at all those boobs.

307
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,880
An office full of morons.

308
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,700
A factory full of fools.

309
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,660
Is it any wonder that I'm singing, singing blues?

310
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,860
Singing the blues?

311
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,260
Take me home, sir, and train.

312
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,180
Hooray!

313
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,740
I'm a cog in a wheel in a lubricated world and I want to marry an office girl.

314
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,020
I've got my tie on.

315
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,560
I set my watch, I set my goals when I get on.

316
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,480
I want to be fat.

317
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,880
I've got my tie on.

318
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,700
It's a string around my finger, it's a noose around my neck.

319
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,080
All those drastic links will prove I'm not a derelict.

320
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,080
I've got my tie on, so I'm insured I'll hold my head up high.

321
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,100
I can't forget why I got out of bed even when the morning paper's red.

322
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,340
I've got my tie on.

323
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,600
I'm riding across the tile floor.

324
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,540
I've got my name on the office door.

325
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,020
I've got my tie on.

326
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,640
It's a string around my finger, it's a noose around my neck.

327
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,820
All those drastic links will prove I'm not an idiot.

328
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,760
I've got my tie on, so I'm insured I'll hold myself alive.

329
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,300
I've got my tie on.

330
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,140
I've got my tie on.

331
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,080
I've got my tie on.

332
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,200
I've got a penthouse with a view.

333
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,100
I know I've got a job to do.

334
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,340
I've got my tie on.

335
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,680
I've picked my side, I've made my choice.

336
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,580
I've got to have a damn old choice.

337
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,980
I've got my tie on.

338
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,560
It's a string around my finger, it's a noose around my neck.

339
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,920
All those drastic links will prove I'm not a derelict.

340
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,080
I've got my tie on, so I'm insured I'll shrink myself up high.

341
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,280
I've got my tie on, so I'm insured I'll shrink myself up high.

342
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,280


343
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Lincoln's. Thank you.

344
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,560
Oh, thank you for bailing my sorry buns out.

345
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,340
Oh, yeah.

346
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,160
Well, you know I told you about that job I have.

347
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,700
Well, there comes a time when the conspiracy has you in such a tight grip

348
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Well, there comes a time when the conspiracy has you in such a tight grip

349
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,620
bug out like a John Crispalusi effect, and you realize that at that moment,

350
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:59,640
give me slack or kill me means so much. Oh, the pure crystalline truth, that one statement.

351
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,320
There at the time when you despair of ever getting that cosmic donut of slack within your

352
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,160
desperate reach. Oh, that moment when you rail to the unfeeling skies.

353
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,600
Isn't there anyone in this town who hates me enough to kill me? Oh,

354
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:31,000
oh, but no, Circe's comes. Oh no, that would be too easy. And you know how the conspiracy

355
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,300
hates a quitter. But the end never comes. Just more episodes.

356
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,900
And this endless progression of crap down the peristaltic tube of life.

357
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:52,380
And there's nothing you can do but roll the punches and wish you had the nerve to make your

358
00:22:52,380 --> 00:23:01,560
own quietus. Oh, Bob! Bob! Has thou forsaken me, Bob?

359
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:22,020
I become a puppet on a string. And you can do most anything with me.

360
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:33,880
Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job!

361
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,460
Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job!

362
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,300
Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job!

363
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,300


364
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,300


365
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,400
Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job! Quit your job!

366
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,840
Now, what do we say every morning on our way to work?

367
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,700
Every morning when I get up, I look into the mirror.

368
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,560
And what do I say to that face I see?

369
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,200
You're a winner! You're a winner! You're a winner!

370
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,160
I can't hear you!

371
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,940
Look into that rear-view mirror and say it again!

372
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,440
Okay, you're a winner! You're a winner! You're a winner!

373
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,840
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

374
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,820
I'm a winner.

375
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:17,260
Under Bob, so to speak, you can learn to masturbate without going blind!

376
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:27,860
You can learn, yes, you can learn to perform astral sex with anyone you meet.

377
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,500
Oh, but it's not pornography, ma'am, officer.

378
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,460
It's empowerment.

379
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,120
Empowerment.

380
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,600
That's right.

381
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:45,480
You can learn to live with your sins, dear friends, because, well, that old Bob, Bob, he looks kind of limp now.

382
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,920
Bob is a sex god.

383
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:54,700
And, you know, he has come and come again and again and again, as the old joke says, to rationalize your sins.

384
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,320
He is not so well-connected that he's going to die for your sins.

385
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,900
Even if he did, it wouldn't do you any good.

386
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,700
He's not going to forgive your sins because he doesn't think there's anything you need to be forgiven for.

387
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:14,640
He, Bob, comes again and again to justify, to rationalize your sins and to bring to you, dear friends, what you need far more than forgiveness.

388
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,280
To bring an excuse!

389
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,560
On sale at our dealer's table after the show.

390
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:32,480
It's a purer, a purer squirt or ooze, my friend, than drugs, the Bible, or even television.

391
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:48,960
And the sweetest thing about all this, I think, the most understanding part of Bob's teaching is, you know, and I know this is going to mean something to some of you out there, you can be a virgin or an atheist, and Bob will still let you be a subgenius.

392
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,880
Moses parted the Red Sea, Oppenheimer split the atom, but Bob cut the crap.

393
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,860
Take two was better.

394
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:06,140
Now if man had been meant to feel guilt, as Papa Joe Mama said, he would not have been born with a Bob.

395
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,900
God is everywhere, but J.R. Bob Dobbs has already been everywhere else.

396
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,560
And he does, in fact, bring slack that state in which you need nothing because you have it already.

397
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:24,480
And he brings slack without guilt because you will pay for it with no strings attached.

398
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,780
This is the first industrial church, friends.

399
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
We're here to let God know.

400
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,400
We're here to let the customer decide what it needs in a religion.

401
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,940
Not only that, but it's the first industrial church.

402
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,600
Bob Dobbs has actually paid all his taxes.

403
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,940
And that means all the other religions still owe.

404
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,620
And come 1998, when we take power, they'll be paying up.

405
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,660
That is why they hate us, friends.

406
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,800
Because it exploits women and men and how they love it.

407
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,300
Well, my, my, let's see, what time is it?

408
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,860
Two o'clock.

409
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,720
Well, we've done about one hour of radio.

410
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,260
Should we unslide on take two or?

411
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,700
Right.

412
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,660
Well.

413
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,860
Oh, this is the organized part.

414
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,180
Yes, of course.

415
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,340
This is the part that we secretly planned for years, actually.

416
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:27,380
We have a place for you, no matter what your background, no matter what your age, no matter how simple your needs,

417
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,340
or how big your dreams.

418
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,360
People have always been our most important product.

419
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:42,380
People have always been our most important product, dear friends, here at the Church of the Subgenius.

420
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:50,360
And because of that, I probably should tell you just what people, quote, people, unquote, you've been listening to.

421
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,260
And starting from the top, a good place to start, I guess, would be,

422
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:03,240
that remember, we're all sitting together listening to this, is by Silica Gel.

423
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:10,200
Then you heard Dr. Philodrummond and myself griping about our wives and radio shows.

424
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:25,420
The long work rant by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang there, was, well, I was preaching from the new subgenius book due out in November, Revelation X.

425
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:37,260
At the Starwood Devival, at, well, it's a big pagan camp out they have up in New York, sponsored by Ace.

426
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,780
And being helped out there by the good Reverend Vlipo Abernathy.

427
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:55,340
And then, luckily for me, Susie the Floozy, our good friend, who has a subgenius show on Noble WREK in Atlanta,

428
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,400


429
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,400


430
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,880
happened to do an anti-work show herself.

431
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,320
And on that, she played, and we used the song Big Brother by Hazel O'Connor.

432
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,280
The Simpsons sing the blues song called Look at Those Idiots.

433
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:24,300
Susie's little brother, whose band the Pink Lincolns, did that song I've Got My Tie On.

434
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:30,500
And the good Reverend Susie the Floozy herself, of course, delivered that beautiful despair rant.

435
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,260
Followed by a little bit more about astral sex from the Starwood Devival.

436
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:45,160
And, oh, and Susie had her own little media barrage, a tape collage edit in there, which she calls her Slack Suite.

437
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,900
Now, we will be sweet and go to side two of show.

438
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,260
I believe that what...

439
00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:01,520
We'll go back to playing some more of Dr. Howl from his KPFA Berkeley show with Puzzling Evidence.

440
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:15,060
And if we have time, we'll get to the legendary new recording I just got in of the Swingin' Love Corpses doing their Led Zeppelin medley.

441
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,760
Yes, it's true.

442
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,420
At the DragonCon Science Fiction Convention Subgenius Devival.

443
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,400
In Atlanta.

444
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,560
Thank you.

445
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,280
This figured our planet into some of the familiar configurations we see today.

446
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:41,880
A piece of galactic debris in the shape of an enormous six-legged lizard once landed on the Earth and quickly crawled across its surface like a centipede landing on a peach.

447
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,720
But it created enormous destruction and the extinction of many species.

448
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,400
Created tidal waves and giant sweeping waves.

449
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,680
And walls of earth and rock which buried entire countries and submerged continents.

450
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,660
Finally, it popped off into space again.

451
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:18,000
But it might return at any time and destroy the world-questing man who does not realize by how thin a thread he hangs before that velvet hall of eternal blackness they call glory.

452
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,700
Bingo.

453
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,440
Come in.

454
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Yes, bingo.

455
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:28,280
A game of cosmic bingo that we all are forced willy-nilly, inadvertently to play.

456
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,220
And one never knows when one's number will pop up.

457
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:38,120
So, beware, you never know when the master cometh, as it says in the old moldy book.

458
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,940
Bingo, bingo.

459
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,760
Well, you've been very patient listening to the...

460
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:42,900
Oh!

461
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,640
Listening to the...

462
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,380
Oh, I better get that one.

463
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,780
That seems like a high priority.

464
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,960
Below 20 degrees, limbs will...

465
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,420
That's the present tone.

466
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,960
Below zero, lungs will burn.

467
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,580
We're having a little bit of decompression here in the radio cubicle.

468
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,200
It might be a breach in our hall or it might be that...

469
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,860
The breathing tube is stuck.

470
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,420
It just might be puzzling evidence messing with our heads again, you know.

471
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,240
It could be perfectly all right.

472
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,200
You never know until it would be too late in this game.

473
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,700
Someone's turned off the air and the breathing tube.

474
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,220
You know, as we broadcast and as I attempt, as always, to swim upstream against the sluggish tide of flood,

475
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:36,620
the, uh, the compilers are working on the book of the subgenius volume two, Bob Apocryphon, Revelation X,

476
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:46,180
and Ivan Stang and Lies are stirring up some trouble in their giant cauldron.

477
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,220
Oh, there we go.

478
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,400
I'm going to jump in.

479
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:47,520
You're going to jump in?

480
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,520


481
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,520


482
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,520


483
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,540
Yeah.

484
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:47,540


485
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:47,540


486
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:53,540
Oh, well, I'm being drowned out by a piece of propaganda here, a beam from our central office.

487
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
What the hell is going on?

488
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,100
Is this the end game?

489
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:10,000
Perhaps some of you might wonder why I delve so frequently into eschatology, into the study of the beginnings of all things.

490
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,660
Yeah.

491
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,920
What about that?

492
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,560
Well, I...

493
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,640
Are you dissatisfied?

494
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,820
Am I to think of the early time?

495
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,360
One crown.

496
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,480
Centilla.

497
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,780
Spanish for dollar.

498
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,440
Uh, I would be happy to.

499
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,840
It holds the power of the universe.

500
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Perhaps you'd be interested in taking my award-winning source in financial accountability and real estate.

501
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,120
I feel...

502
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,320
Oh, you're going to slow me.

503
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,580
I think you're too late at my service.

504
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,980
I'm going to have to have a new name.

505
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,800
What are you doing?

506
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,820
Uh-oh.

507
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,180
Alien?

508
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,620
As many as seven out of ten zillionaires in the United States made most of their lives

509
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:46,620


510
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:46,620


511
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:46,620


512
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:46,620


513
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:46,620


514
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,680
in their money in real estate.

515
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,640
In successful investing in money management, you'll discover the smartest ways to use real

516
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,920
estate in today's market to build your wealth.

517
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,060
Continued operation may damage the system.

518
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:07,760
You'll learn how you can reap annualized returns of 50% a year or more on raw land investments

519
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,840
and a small fortune by investigating loans secured by mortgages or trust deeds.

520
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,240
Why do you think they call it land anyway?

521
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,600
I don't know.

522
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


523
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


524
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


525
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


526
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


527
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


528
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


529
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


530
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


531
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


532
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


533
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


534
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


535
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


536
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


537
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,600


538
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,020
I think it's not exactly right.

539
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,380
You know?

540
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,580
Because that's where you land on.

541
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,860
And if you follow my course in real estate, you'll land on your feet.

542
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,280
And you'll land on your feet and run with the ball.

543
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,520
You'll run with the ball as you find the right mortgage for you and 23 sources of financing.

544
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,920
You'll be given checklist for evaluating any property that interests you.

545
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:43,320
Now, if you want to generate some rental income, you'll discover in my course on page 56, how

546
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,580
to select the best type of income properties and how to score them.

547
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:46,580


548
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,500
for undesirable tenants and weirdos.

549
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,960
Keep them out of your houses.

550
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,200
Not cause trouble, not damage the property.

551
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,900
Take good care of your investment.

552
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,640
No children, no pets.

553
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,520
That's right.

554
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,300
Even when he is a bastard, they know.

555
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,700
But perhaps you wouldn't be interested in retaining this rental property.

556
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,600
In that case, you might want to sell.

557
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,740
And on page 74 of my award-winning book,

558
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,740
you'll know eight smart ways to get more potential buyers to make an offer on your house,

559
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,920
even in a downwardly spiraling, doomed real estate market.

560
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,620
Wait, wait, wait. What award did it win?

561
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,180
Well, it won the subgenius award for excellence in Hollywood.

562
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,540
Okay. All right.

563
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,260
All right.

564
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,160
But the most important investment principle you'll ever learn from me is

565
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,520
the one I've already shared with you,

566
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,120
that the egg came before the chicken.

567
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,260
And that God formed the embryos of all creatures

568
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,740
out of an embryo which looked a little bit like you.

569
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,540
Like you.

570
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,200
An embryo.

571
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,740
I'm a friend.

572
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,180
Do dream the impossible dream.

573
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,440
To fight the unfightable fight.

574
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,260
To eat the uneatable dinner.

575
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,840
And ride in the unwritable light.

576
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,860
To drink the unbrinkable drink.

577
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,600
To eat the inedible food.

578
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,320
To wear the unwearable clothing.

579
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,260
When you're driving, be decently nude.

580
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,840
Oh, this is my 12.

581
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,360
I'm trying for another award.

582
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,500
This is a steal.

583
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,560
Here!

584
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,200
Oh, great.

585
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:02,040
You gotta kiss a lot of ass, I bet.

586
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,260
Well, after a while you don't make it.

587
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,200
You think I don't have to kiss ass?

588
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,140
$4 an hour?

589
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,300
The foreman, the shop steward.

590
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,460
You know, I'm not gonna kiss you.

591
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,720
You know, I'm a person, man.

592
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,860
You say, I am never going back again.

593
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,880
I'm tired.

594
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,780
I'm never gonna look in a patient's mouth again.

595
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,140
I'm never gonna have someone tell me I'm not doing a good job again.

596
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,500
My boss is never gonna insult me again.

597
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,920
My wife will never have to run in that file room with that turkey chasing her around again.

598
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,060
What's the job?

599
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,120
Swat job!

600
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,620
Yeah!

601
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,880
Yes Bob!

602
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,460
Yes Bob!

603
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,960
I'm going to quit my job, I'm going to quit my job!

604
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,880
Oh, I'm going to quit my job, yes.

605
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,200
Oh God it feels so good.

606
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,860
Oh, I haven't slept in years.

607
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,380
I don't think for weeks.

608
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,040
Oh yes.

609
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,400
Yes, I'm going to quit this job.

610
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,100
Oh bless you Bob.

611
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,080
Oh my teeth are vibrating.

612
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,720
Oh, how I love you Bob.

613
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


614
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


615
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


616
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


617
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


618
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


619
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


620
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


621
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


622
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


623
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


624
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


625
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


626
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


627
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


628
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720


629
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,880
Oh, yes.

630
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:27,380
Oh, yes, that was me on my way to quit my job the other day.

631
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,440
Oh, and I happened to pop a tape in the tape deck.

632
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,760
And guess what it was?

633
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,000
Oh, it was our beloved reverend telling me, yes, I was doing the right thing.

634
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,560
It's so nice to get justification in your slackness from your religious leaders.

635
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,480
Oh.

636
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,840
Yeah, I'm going to a far, far better place.

637
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,560
A place where there's always room for slack.

638
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,980
Where nothing's going to be a problem.

639
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:12,980


640
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,820
No one uses words like initiative or incentive.

641
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,500
Incentive?

642
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,040
How's the threat of a high colonic delivered by the stark fist of removal for incentive, buddy?

643
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,320
Yeah, my incentive plan can beat the living crap out of your incentive plan.

644
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,520
Oh, yeah, I'm not on the outside looking in.

645
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,800
I'm facing the other direction now because I'm mooning them.

646
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,300
I'm serving warning to the pinks.

647
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,680
The bitch is definitely...

648
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,060
Oh, so back.

649
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:50,280
And I'm tired of carrot and stick thinking, I want something for nothing for a change.

650
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,080
I want a good deal.

651
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,380
Oh, and Bob is the man who can get it for me.

652
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,000
Oh, yes.

653
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:01,620
Mmm.

654
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,260
Mmm.

655
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,860
Oh, it feels so nice.

656
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,680
To be in the ranks.

657
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,300
To be unemployed.

658
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,520
Oh, I'd started to lose the disrespect of my friends.

659
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,380
Oh, but yeah, it's time for a good deal for the flus.

660
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,400
And hey, it's time for a good deal for our listeners.

661
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,420
Now, don't jump the gun now, you premature dialing finger types.

662
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,600
Yeah, you'll have to answer a question.

663
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,180
We've got a free ticket here.

664
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,640
A set of tickets.

665
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:50,820
One lucky caller will receive two three-day memberships to this upcoming Dragon Con,

666
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,220
June 15th through 17th at the Atlanta Hilton and Towers,

667
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,720
where they'll get to see up close and, oh, so personal,

668
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:06,320
the luminaries of the dark subgenius sky wallowing, venting, spewing...

669
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,340
Yeah, that's us.

670
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,900
Oh, the hickonings.

671
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,300
That's right.

672
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,840
The sickenings.

673
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,340
The hickonings.

674
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:09,340


675
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,160
However, as you may have guessed, that particular...

676
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
It flags itself.

677
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,760
...broadcast there by Reverend Susie the Flusey was quite a while back, but she is talking

678
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,980
about the Dragon Con subgenius, the Vival, which was indeed a superb...

679
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:35,700
I don't know quite what to call it, but I'm going to go to a recording from the musical

680
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,780
performance at that convention by the Swinging Love Corpses.

681
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,040
Yes.

682
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,500
Yes.

683
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:41,500


684
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:41,540
Yes.

685
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:41,540


686
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:41,700
Yes.

687
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


688
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


689
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


690
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


691
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


692
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


693
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


694
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


695
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


696
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


697
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


698
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


699
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


700
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


701
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


702
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


703
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,700


704
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,580
Yes.

705
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:49,740
That great old timey band that Dr. Philo Drummond and his brother, Sphinx, and his cousin, Ray,

706
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:59,000
started up after he left Dallas, after he helped Bob get the Subgenius Foundation started

707
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,120
and hired me.

708
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,080
So let's go now to that live tape of this...

709
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:12,060
This is rather a different listen to...

710
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,100
of that band, the Swingin' Love Corpses,

711
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,120
and they're doing their infamous Led Zeppelin medley.

712
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,320
Yes, it really is a Led Zeppelin medley,

713
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,980
but possibly not quite what you're used to.

714
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,000
So let's just check it out here, shall we?

715
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,020
What do you really want to hear?

716
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,260
Huh?

717
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,480
Dream Weaver?

718
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,340
How about some Jimi Hendrix?

719
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,780
You're just a weirdo.

720
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,280
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,360
I'm a little hot with that.

722
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,060
To the heart.

723
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,520
We dive our ship to the land.

724
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,660
Find the heart.

725
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,440
See it crash.

726
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,180
I am coming.

727
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,600
I'm the Western God.

728
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,000
I love you.

729
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,280
We're with the Western Shore.

730
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,940
Okay, thank you.

731
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,040
Now what do you want to hear?

732
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,360
What do you want to hear?

733
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,700
How about some more Led Zeppelin?

734
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,040
Okay.

735
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,680
Okay.

736
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,820
I got the beat on.

737
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,720
You ain't foolin'.

738
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,480
Baby, I'm not foolin'.

739
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,380
I'm gonna send you.

740
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,480
I'm not foolin'.

741
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,020
Why are we down inside?

742
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,060
How do you dare?

743
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:15,920
Bill.

744
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,840
Hold on.

745
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,400
No.

746
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,040
You're gonna be a little more.

747
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,540
I'm gonna do every inch of my life.

748
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,060
Okay, thank you.

749
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,460
Thank you.

750
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,200
Thank you very much.

751
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,220
Jimi Hendrix.

752
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,700
Oh, bring it on.

753
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,340
Watch the head.

754
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,460
Watch the head.

755
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,280
Get these goons out of here!

756
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,280
What the hell?

757
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,120
Security in this place sucks.

758
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,000
The show's over.

759
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:52,980
Okay.

760
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,800
Get these goons out of here.

761
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,640
How much money are you talking about?

762
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,340
How can we play your favorite Led Zeppelin tunes

763
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,780
with goons on stage?

764
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,860
Okay, this is our Led Zeppelin medley for the evening.

765
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,900
And I don't know the words to these songs.

766
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:16,980
Really.

767
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,540
Just the other day, baby.

768
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,180
What do you think I saw?

769
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,660
Okay, thank you, thank you.

770
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,900
Hey, the hits just keep on coming.

771
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:39,760
Oh!

772
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
Everything's going to be all right.

773
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,840
Everything's going to be all right.

774
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,800
My God.

775
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,460
The reptiles are back.

776
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,920
And they're beautiful.

777
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,360
Yeah.

778
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,920
Don't you think of it?

779
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,160
They're just lovely.

780
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,880
There's the Baronyx Walkery,

781
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,640
one of the most unusual dinosaurs ever discovered.

782
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,540
With its gigantic primary digit,

783
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,780
it flips a finny meal up into its crocodile-like jaws.

784
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,800
Oh.

785
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,480
Okay.

786
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,160
Let me show you how it does.

787
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,160


788
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,680
It's got really two eyes.

789
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,300
They're there.

790
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:57,440
And there at the begging.

791
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,620
Yeah, oh, yeah.

792
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:57,620


793
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,120
There it is.

794
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:58,160
Wait!

795
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,280
It's here!

796
00:46:59,440 --> 00:46:59,440


797
00:46:59,440 --> 00:46:59,440


798
00:46:59,920 --> 00:46:59,920


799
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,880
Oh, I thought he was cute, but...

800
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,700
He's got me!

801
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,580
Go with the flow.

802
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,820
And there he goes, pulling the collar off as he walks sideways.

803
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,260
Just go with him. I'm sure you'll find out what it's all about.

804
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,580
Oh dear, I cut off his wind, it looks like.

805
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,780
You must admit, this is a very impressive crab.

806
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,440
And if you've got to go some way, you might as well go in an unusual way.

807
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,760
Kind of reminds me of that old movie, Attack of the Crab Monsters, you know?

808
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,940
Damn you, crab!

809
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,780
Some people have lots of them, but this just shows what one big one can do.

810
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,900
Gosh, the caller is battling for his very life with this giant crab.

811
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:57,760
Who said...

812
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,020
Because this is a boring program.

813
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,720
How can you do this, you crab?

814
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:08,980
No!

815
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:17,120
Yes, it's Jack Crab, the world's oldest living kettle of fish.

816
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,600
I mean, cuttlefish. I mean, you know, shellfish.

817
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,680
Don't be selfish.

818
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,380
Pick that! Pick that!

819
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,700
Pick that! Pick that!

820
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,580
Oh, you're making him mad now.

821
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,380
Oh, God.

822
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,160
Ah, there, a little calypso crab.

823
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,800
Look at him go around and around. He's happy.

824
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,880
And so should you be, having escaped that big one.

825
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,140
Yeah, I know. That was a rough one.

826
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,200
See how exciting your life can be?

827
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,800
Now, I'll tell you why you really can become a millionaire.

828
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,180
Not with a get-rich-quick scheme, but with a simple, sensible, realistic plan...

829
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:56,560
What's that?

830
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,260
...for achieving financial independence before X-Day.

831
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,420
Just, uh, get rid of the crabs.

832
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:07,820
Yes, get rid of the crabs in your life that are pinching your chances for financial forwardness.

833
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,900
That's right.

834
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,920
The hard shells of those shellfish can easily be cracked,

835
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,380
and you can savor the delicious meat in the joint.

836
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,400
As you advance to new levels of financial firmness.

837
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,420
Are you millionaire material?

838
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,720
Well, what does the music really mean?

839
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,540
Perhaps you'll be interested in taking my simple...

840
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,920
...quiz and finding out.

841
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:35,360
Then, during the next 12 months, your net worth will increase from $75,000 to $80,000.

842
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,360
I don't have a net worth.

843
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:43,100
Well, you need a net to catch those megalo crabs by the ocean's side.

844
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:50,520
You will learn at your own pace, as you live in our tropical retreat, Dining on Crab and Lobster.

845
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,160
Successful investing and money management will help you,

846
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:03,920
because you are a busy adult who already has a job and can devote only a small amount of time each week to mastering the principles of successful investing.

847
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,900
Aren't crabs just big insects anyway?

848
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,060
Big what?

849
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,540
Insects.

850
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,280
Well, not exactly. No, they are sort of aquatic arthropods.

851
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,120
They're more like spiders than insects, but in any case they are an aquatic order.

852
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,140
But if it's interest in insect eating that you have, then you're going to have to do it.

853
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:25,140


854
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:25,140


855
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:31,800
I refer you to page 500 of my award-winning book, Insect Dinners as a Shortcut to Success.

856
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:41,500
How the Big Boss Can Be Softened by a Meal of Locusts and Honey, so you can make that big killing in the stock market.

857
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,400
Yeah.

858
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:51,760
Just imagine an easy way to increase the value of your estate by $100,000 or more in a single day,

859
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,120
with almost no significant change in your current cash flow.

860
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,140
You can do it in a short time.

861
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,540
But you're wondering how you can do it.

862
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:09,560
Well, joining my real estate carnival, you'll be able to do it as you swing around and around and go up to the sky in the Ferris wheel.

863
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,180
I think I'm going to throw up, too.

864
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,600
Don't eat too much cotton candy in the investment booth.

865
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,300
Oh, dear, a tragedy occurred.

866
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:25,120
You know, this machinery is 100% safe, but there are some individuals who will not keep their hands on it.

867
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,320
They'll have to put their hands and legs inside the cars.

868
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,320
And so I'm afraid we'll remove that loser.

869
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:38,840
You know, some people have to go to the wall so that others can reap the value of a course of financial investment.

870
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:45,400
Now, at the very least, you must be open to the possibility of becoming a godzillionaire.

871
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,160
Never set a limit on what you can achieve.

872
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,580
You'll see why it can be so exciting to put a zillion-dollar goal in your life.

873
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:02,420
You'll see why it's a reliable day-by-day plan, not a fly-by-night, get-rich-quick scheme for Dobbs-approved reality.

874
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:09,400
Now, you'll discover such a plan, which I call Dr. Howell's Successful Investing in Money Management.

875
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:15,800
It's already taught thousands of eager beaver yuppies how to achieve financial goals.

876
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,860
You'll hear many of their stories.

877
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,240
Perhaps, like you, they began with skepticism,

878
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:29,260
but are now well on their way to complete financial happiness and orgasmic pleasure.

879
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,560
They are happy.

880
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:39,780
So have one of these bourbon and bong waters, or you can have a hot buttered rum martini like I am.

881
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:48,520
And pretty soon we're going to go up on the balcony and toast Benito Mussolini in a warm glass of grog,

882
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,220
while all the rest of the little serfs and peons labor down there.

883
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:01,280
And the CEO doesn't have to push buttons and staple staples like the Ahoy, uh, Palloy, uh, you know, uh...

884
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:10,120
Oh, yeah, we're looking for people who are interested in sharing what's left of their thought patterns with the mass mutations.

885
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,360
This upcoming DragonCon, so give us a call a little later.

886
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,600
The Reverend Microphone and I sure would like to hear from you.

887
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,220
We'll be doing the usual deep-lobed scanning procedures to weed out the virus.

888
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,240
We're not spies, so pink boys need not apply.

889
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:33,620
Just call us at 894-244-6888 tonight until 2 a.m.

890
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:41,640
Or send a cassette of your spewin' and vintin' to Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

891
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,340
Hey, you know enough to have your pencil ready, don't you?

892
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,100
That's Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

893
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,800
W-R-E-K, Atlanta.

894
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:09,540
1-6-5, 8th Street, Northwest.

895
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,700
Atlanta, Georgia.

896
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:19,480
3-0-3-3-2.

897
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,200
0-6-3-3-2.

898
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:23,200


899
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,380
3-0.

900
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,540
Oh, yeah, because we'd like to hear your particular specialty.

901
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,440
And I'm sure you'd like to wag your weirdness.

902
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,200
Take it from me, it's so therapeutic.

903
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,700
Oh, it's like a cerebral brain douche.

904
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,780
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

905
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:03,880
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

906
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,880
Got your pencil ready?

907
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:17,460
Bob, Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com

908
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:23,200
That's Bob, P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com

909
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:30,920
That's Bob, P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com

910
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,240
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

911
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:51,160
So here at Oktoberfest, we treat our tired executives to a little treat of sauerbraten, lederhosen, and a big stein of liebfrau milk.

912
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,160
And of course, we have a little treat.

913
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,460
Helga, get over there and unsnap for these gents.

914
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,320
What?

915
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:11,360
Perhaps this would be a time to retire from the field, as it were, and stoke up on the fires of money management and real estate planning.

916
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,560
You want me dead?

917
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:21,100
I want you alive and making money hand over fist over foot.

918
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,240
Hand over fist.

919
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:31,520
Hand over that fist and I'll show you how you can use it to make thousands and thousands of dollars while you sit on the toilet at home.

920
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,400
Right, okay, hold on, let me get that thing faster.

921
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:43,600
It's all a part of what I call the possible dream, Dr. Howell's amazing course in sex and real estate.

922
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,140
Okay, I'm on the toilet.

923
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,080
My dear fellow, you're taking me on a trip.

924
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:51,080


925
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:51,920
You're a little bit too literally.

926
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,160
I don't need to see this.

927
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,820
Cover up, for God's sake.

928
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,920
That's a repulsive sight.

929
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,080
Now, don't do that.

930
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,160
You're making me nervous.

931
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,120
And above all, don't place a limitation on your own future.

932
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,080
You know, my real estate course is merely a course to some people, an article.

933
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,520
It's just another item of information to be tossed away.

934
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,980
These short-sighted bobbies simply cannot see the great opportunity that lies before them.

935
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,620
In such a unique program as our show.

936
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,400
You see, you should always bend over and with a cheerful grunt to pick up any dime that you find before you.

937
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:45,040
And with a pocket full of these, you'll soon have a dollar and, well, this dollar can be the first step in a series of stepping stones to high stepping success.

938
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,820
Who wants to say?

939
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,960
Soon you'll be goose stepping over the bodies of the poor and decrepit as you walk.

940
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,800
You'll march your way...

941
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

942
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,260
That's, uh...

943
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,760
I was a little bit too exuberant there.

944
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:02,320
These folks are going to have to go to the wall, but then that is necessary for you to achieve...

945
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,140
...insist on seeing.

946
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:03,620
What about it?

947
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,060
Let them see.

948
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,060
We'll go on one better day.

949
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:15,400
True wealth and power, such as I, Dr. Howell Weald, in my giant mansion with my fleet of expensive automobiles and terrified, cowering servants.

950
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,060
And you can be like me and splash in my giant warm water pool.

951
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:23,000
I'll fill you with a bevy of idiots.

952
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:23,640
What?

953
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,080
It's all possible.

954
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,320
Just grasp the brass ring.

955
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,420
And if you do the lines, ladies and gentlemen, you should believe me.

956
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:46,000
And with my robotized investment counselors, I need not lift a pencil to scratch my John Hancock on a single document to get Rich's creases by 12 p.m. daily.

957
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,180
Well, that's sensational. It's just no good.

958
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,780
I'm the most sophisticated robot on planet Earth.

959
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,100
Yes, this giant robot will answer all your questions.

960
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:06,680
And once you've become a member of my real estate seminar, this robot will teach you how even a nonhuman can achieve financial parity in today's collapsing money market.

961
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,920
Oh, that's a terrible example of the collapse right there, ladies and gentlemen.

962
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:18,160
If you had been standing underneath that portion of Wall Street's finest, you would have been...

963
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,160


964
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,100
I don't know what you're doing.

965
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,520
Oh, terrible.

966
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,680
Well, when you get up there on those people, all you have to do is just say the whole thing to frame up.

967
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,580
How would you like to know how to borrow money at only 6% or 7% and invest it at higher rates?

968
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,880
I don't give you $5,000 just to get up on the...

969
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,920
$5,000 is a great way to start.

970
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:39,100
It's a painless way to knock down the interest rate you're paying on your bills.

971
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:45,100
We'll show you where you can find, with your five grand, medical insurance for some of your family.

972
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,140
And you can invest so that the income from your investment...

973
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,560
one day surpasses the income from your job.

974
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,400
Oh, I better get that.

975
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,500
Meanwhile, you have some of these canapes and a hot butter drum...

976
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:14,880
This Hour of Slack number 1,238 was a rerun of Hour of Slack number 462 from the year of 1994.

977
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:16,420
Thank you.

978
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:18,380
Thank you.

979
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:18,420
All right.

980
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:18,420


981
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:18,420


982
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:18,420


983
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:18,420


984
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:18,420


985
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:18,420
