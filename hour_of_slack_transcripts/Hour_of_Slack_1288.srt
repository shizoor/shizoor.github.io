1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Do not stand at my grave and weep.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,660
I am not there.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,000
I do not sleep.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,040
I am a thousand winds that blow.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,820
I am the diamond glints on snow.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,120
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,700
I am the gentle autumn rain.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,020
When you awaken in the morning's hush,

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:33,920
I am the swift, uplifting rush of quiet birds' encircled flood.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,840
I am the soft stars that shine at night.

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,200
Do not stand at my grave and cry.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,660
I am the self-genius, power of sweat.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,720
God did not sweat.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,260
God did not sweat.

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,780
God did not sweat.

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,780
God did not sweat.

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,260
God did not sweat.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,000
God did not sweat.

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,720
God did not sweat.

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,460
God did not sweat.

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,460
God did not sweat.

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,780
God did not sweat.

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,640
God did not sweat.

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,380
God did not sweat.

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,320
God did not sweat.

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,760
God did not sweat.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,400
God did not sweat.

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,060
God did not sweat.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,600
God did not sweat.

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,240
God did not sweat.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,100
God did not sweat.

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,340
God did not sweat.

33
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,320
God did not sweat.

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,320


35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,320


36
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,320


37
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,360
God did not sweat.

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,340
God did not sweat.

39
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:16,620
God did not sweat.

40
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,800
God did not sweat.

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,000
God did not sweat.

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:30,600
Thank you.

43
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,080
Thank you.

44
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,860
Thank you.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,680
Thank you.

46
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,260
Thank you.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,940
Thank you.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,120
Thank you.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,980
Thank you.

50
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,060
Thank you.

51
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,000
Thank you.

52
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,800
Thank you.

53
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,540
For you

54
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,840
For you

55
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,100
For you

56
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,880
Not me

57
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,900
Not me

58
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,820
More beautiful than ever

59
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,500
You know

60
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:37,040
I don't know about you

61
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,200
But I think it's pretty hard

62
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,660
Keeping up with the Kardashians

63
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,300
It's really tough

64
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,920
And Jersey Shore? Man

65
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,060
I can't even take my clothes off no more

66
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,140
It's so goddamn beautiful out there

67
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,660
Everybody's so full of ideas

68
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,560
And wonderful values

69
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
Trying to bring the world forward

70
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,260
Like Glenn fucking Beck

71
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,780
And Snooki

72
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,020
She's too beautiful to go to jail

73
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,540
What a piece of fucking hard-fucked piece

74
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,000
Subhuman shit

75
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,440
You know what I'm saying?

76
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,940
You know what I'm saying?

77
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,820
I said do you know what I'm saying?

78
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,280
You know what I'm saying?

79
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,000
I said do you know what I'm saying?

80
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,940
It's getting hot in here

81
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,180
So take off all your clothes

82
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,500
I'm getting so hot

83
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm gonna take my clothes off

84
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a beautiful, beautiful world

85
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,780
It's a beautiful, beautiful world

86
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:31,860
For you, for you, for you

87
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,480
Well, but not for me

88
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,440
Thank you guys, thank you, folks

89
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,320
Jerry Casale, everybody!

90
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,380
Jerry Casale!

91
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,680
All hail Devo!

92
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,720
I saw juice at dinner time swimming in the stew

93
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,840
Jesus is everywhere

94
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,700
I saw juice in the morning in the burning bush

95
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,180
I saw juice in the afternoon too

96
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,120
I saw juice at dinner, swimming in the stew

97
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,080
Jesus is everywhere

98
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:44,220
And in this film, the guy is talking about how...

99
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,540
Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I.

100
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,320
Are they servants of Christ?

101
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,280
I am out of my mind to talk like this. I am more.

102
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,720
I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely,

103
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,180
and been exposed to death again and again.

104
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,780
Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.

105
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,220
Three times I was beaten with rods.

106
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,740
Once I was stoned.

107
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
Three times I was shipwrecked.

108
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,000
I spent a night and a day in the open sea.

109
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,120
I have been constantly on the move.

110
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,840
Once I was stoned.

111
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,980
I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits,

112
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,920
in danger from my own countrymen,

113
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,760
in danger from Gentiles,

114
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,340
in danger in the city,

115
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,800
in danger in the country,

116
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,900
in danger at sea,

117
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,760
and in danger from false brothers.

118
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,760
I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep.

119
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,600
I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food.

120
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,660
I have been cold and naked.

121
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,460
Who is weak and I do not feel weak?

122
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,360
Who is led into sin and I do not inwardly burn?

123
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,160
If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.

124
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,240
The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever,

125
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,900
knows that I am not lying.

126
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,220
In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.

127
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,680
But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.

128
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,720
I must go on boasting.

129
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,460
Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.

130
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,920
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven.

131
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,080
He said, give me a Pepsi.

132
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,680
I said, give me a Pepsi and a bowl.

133
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,980
Whether it was in the body or out of the body, I do not know.

134
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,940
God knows.

135
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,220
She says, well, he is some kind of a nut.

136
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
So she poured a bowl of Pepsi and put it in front of him.

137
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,160
He took a dead bird out of his pocket and put it in the bowl.

138
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,740
And I know that this man, whether in the body or apart from the body, I do not know, but God knows, was caught up to paradise.

139
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,260
Then he started singing the little song, Come Alive.

140
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,220
He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell.

141
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,220
I will boast about a man like him.

142
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,460
I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.

143
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,300
Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool because I would be speaking the truth.

144
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,740
But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say.

145
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:23,900
To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me.

146
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,340
Compares is to move

147
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:59,220
As time goes on, chief whitewhale moon gioves in

148
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,400
I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.

149
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:12,520
That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties.

150
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,640
For when I am weak, then I am strong.

151
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,360
I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it.

152
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,280
I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the super-apostles, even though I am nothing.

153
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,500
Forgive me this wrong.

154
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:38,100
Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions, but you.

155
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,000
And now we have a very special guest.

156
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,660
Devo Dan.

157
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,880
Known for albums including Everything Must Go, Total Devo,

158
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,180
Pretzels Now,

159
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,800
For the Future,

160
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,680
But most of all, for the acclaimed Are We Not Dan, We Are Gaucho.

161
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,220
He took a 20-year Hawaiian vacation, but is back in the game.

162
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,460
Here to sing his 1978 hit, Hey Homo.

163
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,700
They tell us that we lost our tails

164
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,540
Evolving up from little snails

165
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,660
I'd say it's all just within sense

166
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,240
Are we not men?

167
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,280
We are the old

168
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,260
Are we not men?

169
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,240
We are the old

170
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,140
Are we not men?

171
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,260
We are the old

172
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,460
Please take me along when you slip on down

173
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,040
We're pinheads

174
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,740
Now we are not home

175
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,040
We're pinheads

176
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,980
Now we are not home

177
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,360
We're pinheads now

178
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,820
We are not home

179
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,280
Are we not men?

180
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,300
We are the old

181
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,380
Are we not men?

182
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,380
We are the old

183
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,160
Are we not men?

184
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,340
We are the old

185
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,260
Please take me along when you slip on down

186
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,600
So long as you do bump on down

187
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,720
Are we not you?

188
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,180
Are we not we?

189
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,720
Are we not men?

190
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,840
Are we not the old?

191
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:21,840


192
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,360
Are we not to be Para bolos?

193
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,400


194
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,080
Are we not our houses for predominant pox?

195
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,240
Are we not men?

196
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,560
God made man

197
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:40,620
Mm, mm, mm

198
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,200
Can use the monkey to do it now

199
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,680
Monkey man all

200
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,780
In business suit

201
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,480
Teachers and critics all dance the boot

202
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,920
Say it again

203
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,720
Monkey man all

204
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,720
In business suit

205
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,560
Teachers and critics all dance the boot

206
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,760
Monkey man all

207
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,840
In business suit

208
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,560
Teachers and critics all dance the boot

209
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,520
We are Devo

210
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,360
D-E-V-O

211
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,240
All right Cleveland, Devo Dan loves you. Peace out.

212
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,840
Thanks Devo Dan.

213
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,480
The fire will

214
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,480


215
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,480


216
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,600
T- communities

217
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:44,720
Coercions

218
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:44,720


219
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:44,720


220
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:44,740
Empress

221
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:44,740


222
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,080
Coercions

223
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,260
The

225
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,260


226
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,260


227
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,420
FYI

228
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,440
Hmm

229
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:52,660
The

230
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:52,660


231
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:52,660


232
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:52,660


233
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,540
One, two, three, four

234
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,460
Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo

Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo

237
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,520
Devo is the one and only way

Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo

Devo, Devo, every night and day

Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,040
Devo is the one and only way

242
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,400
Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo

00:21:49,520 --> 00:22:08,660
Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:49,500
Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo

Devo, Devo!

253
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:41,680
Devo!

254
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,440
Another day and someone listened to me

255
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,480
It's time for us to join in the fight

256
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,100
It's time for the two babies grown to be cowboys

257
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,780
You let the bed bugs bite

258
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,680
You better put all your eggs in one basket

259
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,180
You better catch your tickets before they hatch

260
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,540
You better sell some wine before it's time

261
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,540
You better find yourself an inch too scrunch

262
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,800
You better squeeze all the Charmin you can

263
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,820
While Mr. Whipple's not around

264
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,320
Stick your head in a microwave and get yourself a tan

265
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,060
Talk with your mouth full

266
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,700
Bite the hell that feeds you

267
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
Bite of more than you can chew

268
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,520
What can you do?

269
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,320
Dare to be stupid

270
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,600
Take some wooden ankles

271
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,380
Look for Mr. Goodbar

272
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,060
Get a mojo working out

273
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,080
I'll show you how

274
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,920
Dare to be stupid

275
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,000
You can turn the other cheek

276
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,720
You can just give up the shift

277
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,440
You can eat a bunch of sushi

278
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,740
Then forget to leave a tip

279
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,780
Dare to be stupid

280
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,040
Dare to be stupid

281
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,380
Come on and dare to be stupid

282
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,220
It's so easy to do

283
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,940
Dare to be stupid

284
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,960
We're all waiting for you

285
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,120
Let's go!

286
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,320
It's time to make a mountain out of a boy

287
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,940
Is it good? I have a volunteer

288
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,540
There's no more time for crying

289
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,440
Oh, it's still a pill

290
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,260
Now it's time for crying in your fear

291
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,820
Settle down

292
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,340
Raise your family towards our PTA

293
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,160
Buy some kids a bowl of Cheetos and a Chevrolet

294
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,920
You party till you're broke and they drive you away

295
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,720
It's okay

296
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,600
Dare to be stupid

297
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,800
It's like spitting on a fish

298
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,500
It's like walking up a tree

299
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,540
It's like I say you gotta buy one if you wanna get one free

300
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,500
Dare to be stupid

301
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,960
Dare to be stupid

302
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,000
It's so easy to do

303
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,860
Dare to be stupid

304
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,640
We're all waiting for you

305
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,460
Dare to be stupid

306
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,380
Dare to be stupid

307
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,160
Run your candle at both ends

308
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,100
Put the gift horse in the mouth

309
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,440
Bash potatoes can be your friend

310
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,420
You can be a coffee and tea

311
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,300
But you can sit around the house and watch the lemurs and beavers

312
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,620
The future's up to you

313
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,900
So what you gonna do?

314
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,020
Dare to be stupid

315
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,340
Dare to be stupid

316
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,920
What did I say?

317
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,200
Dare to be stupid

318
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,560
Tell me what did I say?

319
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,880
Dare to be stupid

320
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:16,900
It's alright

321
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,320
Dare to be stupid

322
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,620
You can be stupid all night

323
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,240
Dare to be stupid

324
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,520
Diet tour in the crowd

325
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,200
Wow

326
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,800
Dare to be stupid

327
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,240
Shout it out loud

328
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,420
Dare to be stupid

329
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,080
I can't hear you

330
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,200
Dare to be stupid

331
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,900
Okay, I can hear you now

332
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,860
Dare to be stupid

333
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,240
Let's go

334
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,700
Dare to be stupid

335
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,880
Dare to be stupid

336
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,340
Dare to be stupid

337
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,680
Dare to be stupid

338
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,180
Dare to be stupid

339
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,300
Dare to be stupid

340
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,380
Dare to be stupid

341
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,880
You know, you were talking about the next step in human evolution, or so-called human

342
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,420
evolution.

343
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,600
Oh, that was a little paid cent.

344
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,040
Along the time continuum from our friends in the far ahead.

345
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:05,620
Well, you know, I came across an idea of my own there, and I wiped it off, and I said,

346
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:12,060
what about the next step in evolution being that of schizophrenicus rationalis?

347
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,060
How does that start here?

348
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,280
Well, there's a good reason to think that there's not going to be any more evolution,

349
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,660
so whoop it up.

350
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,940
Well, we've got to pretend like there's a future.

351
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,840
I mean, what's the point?

352
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,520
I ain't saying there's no future.

353
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,800
I'm saying there is no more evolution, that is, no more extrasomatic forces that cause

354
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,260
evolution.

355
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,780
So we've hit the ceiling, as it were.

356
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,520
Not necessarily, but we're going to have to take charge of it ourselves now.

357
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,760
Why?

358
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,400
What do you mean?

359
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,600
Well, because your evolution, your natural selection, if you are...

360
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,860
A good Darwinian is a result of what happens to you.

361
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,820
But if you are one of these so-called intelligent beings, you're controlling what happens to you.

362
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,740
That's what the Nazis...

363
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,400
That's your monkey and your evolution.

364
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,500
That's what the Nazis tried to do, wasn't it?

365
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,400
They tried to take matters into their own hands and shape the genetic pool themselves.

366
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,940
Well, that was one slight aspect of it.

367
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,620
If it had turned out that breeding for their so-called Aryans, which, of course, don't

368
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,360
actually exist in genetics...

369
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:10,780
Yeah.

370
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,200
If that had been for...

371
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,640
Yeah.

372
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:12,760
Yeah.

373
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,040
Yeah.

374
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


375
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


376
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


377
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


378
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


379
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


380
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


381
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


382
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


383
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


384
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


385
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,040


386
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,200
If that had been for survival characteristics, then they might have indeed improved the race.

387
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,060
But unfortunately, that was not really their intention.

388
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,260
It was not evolutionary.

389
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,060
It was a type of fuzzy thinking, I guess.

390
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,360
Well, I wouldn't call it fuzzy, but they believed some strange things.

391
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,940
For example, most of your top-flight Nazis believed that giant chunks of ice were flying

392
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,640
through space and were going to hit the Earth and cause the doom of everything.

393
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,200
Really?

394
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,020
Yes.

395
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,960
It was called the...

396
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,680
Well, I forget the German, but it was called the World Ice Theory.

397
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,860
And the top SS men believed in it, even though this was scientifically thought to be absurd.

398
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,720
No one dared complain about it.

399
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,440
So they embraced the...

400
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,980
It was one of the ritual beliefs that was fostered by Heinrich Himmler and his pan-Germanism.

401
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,420
Does that relate to Velikovsky or anything?

402
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,980
It's even more absurd than Velikovsky.

403
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,240
Yeah.

404
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,840
But, of course, your unstable political minds are always susceptible to these cosmic mish-mashes

405
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,720
of nonsense and non-secretaries.

406
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,860
But they like destructionism.

407
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,780
No, they like fundamentalist Christians.

408
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:18,340
And other misguided souls like to live in a tiny, cozy, neat, orderly universe that they

409
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:24,120
can comprehend instead of the large, unfathomable, and frightening evolutionary universe that

410
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,680
we actually are forced to inhabit.

411
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,640
Yeah, the rationality just breaks down when you try to apply it to the universe.

412
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,860
It just doesn't work like that.

413
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,820
We're surrounded by things that just don't make sense.

414
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,100
Well, I don't know about that.

415
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,480
I'd rather choose to suppose that...

416
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,860
How do you explain mass murders and earthquakes killing...

417
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,720
That's the fact that we don't make sense.

418
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,340
The universe makes perfect sense.

419
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,920
We're the nonsensical particle in the equation.

420
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,280
And yet, without a position outside the spectrum of logic and truth, how could we observe it at all?

421
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:00,360
Otherwise, it would be a case of not being able to see the forest for the trees or the flowers for the bees

422
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,780
in this great land of ours, from sea to shining...

423
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:12,400
And so, once again, fat triumphs over thin, tall triumphs over short.

424
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,620
And big triumphs over little.

425
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,480
In the coming order, everyone will wear special shiny shoes.

426
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:26,320
And on each shoe will be a portrait of the Fuhrer, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

427
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,140
And so Hal became crazed with radio power.

428
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,980
And soon he had Dobbs' image all over every color.

429
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,180
No one ever wanted me, Sprawl and I.

430
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,860
Even Frank Bent was bent for the will of Uncle Thread.

431
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,900
We were stabbed in the back by the politicians.

432
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,160
It is our destiny.

433
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,520
Don't worry.

434
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,380
I've never been turned, but we've got to go along with him for now.

435
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:52,460
We will exterminate the inferior orders so that the true, big, Aryan race can subtract the inferior orders upon the face of this planet.

436
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,420
Well, get out, or I'll shoot out the car from underneath.

437
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,320
It is every subjeudicist's duty to exterminate these vermin.

438
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:10,340
They say we are prejudiced against minorities, but I say we, we, we are the minorities.

439
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,920
And so we witness the self-immolation of an entire religious group.

440
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,600
My soldiers, I salute you.

441
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:20,600


442
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,420
It's time!

443
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,520
It's time!

444
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,320
I want you to go out and kill for old subgenius tech!

445
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,140
I want you to give them a prison they won't forget!

446
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,240
Hey!

447
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,900
Hello, you're on the air!

448
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,200
Hello you're on the air!

449
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,020
I'm talking to you from inside, Bob.

450
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:38,640
I...

451
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,520
Oh, no!

452
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,960
You see I'm trying to give a speech here.

453
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,140
Get this man off the reviewing stand.

454
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,260
There he goes.

455
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,500
The old sidebooster!

456
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,880
Well, you're going to have to hang up.

457
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,120
We were trying to rescue him.

458
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,160


459
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,760
Uh-oh.

460
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:49,860
Uh-oh.

461
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,580
Frank Bent is here.

462
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,540
He's been frustrated. He's being carried away now by the security forces.

463
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,000
This is my last territorial demand in Europe.

464
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,280
Yes, Hal has lost his show mind.

465
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,900
Absorbed with power, he struts down...

466
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,620
The greatest of genius, life, will last for a thousand years.

467
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,260
Why, your radio personality so decreed.

468
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,580
Lost in power, he struts down Shattuck Avenue.

469
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,040
People call emergency services.

470
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,320
There's nothing the Berkeley police can do.

471
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,100
Out of my way!

472
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,800
But for you, caller, it's just another pretty night.

473
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,660
Sieg Freud on KPFA.

474
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,780
Unlike you humans, we are so great.

475
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,080
We cut to time, dancing right.

476
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,320
We touch all fire, we go solid, alright.

477
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,740
My cops is out, and we're dancing right.

478
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,200
My cops is out, and we're under the right.

479
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,300
We see you're human, and we're human.

480
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,300


481
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,500
We're dancing right.

482
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,980
Life's not a child's mandatory right.

483
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,380
And your voice from the sky is falling.

484
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:40,720
These robots that keep us going around and around and around.

485
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,100
And your voice from the sky is falling.

486
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,660
These robots that keep us going around.

487
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,220
About no thing that is awkward.

488
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,920
We used our tables, see you right in your day.

489
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,220
A lot of time, dancing right.

490
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,600
We used our tables, see you right in your day.

491
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,860
My cops is out, and we're all right, right.

492
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,640
What counts is late, don't care.

493
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,740
The Birkin abyco song.

494
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,600
ggi your future Let's make things great.

495
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:34,540
Why can't it play too hard we're totally in line?

496
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,100
The Only Ghostanteast Chorus everybody watch the second takeaways.

497
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,220
Ah, I miss you so, me too, I miss you so.

498
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,540
We see your future.

499
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:40,540


500
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:40,540


501
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,960
The Ice compiler's gone.

502
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,840
The Ele alrededor, you know me.

503
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,320
If your blood's like a sky is falling

504
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,460
Feel the fire to keep us both

505
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,220
On the sky

506
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,260
And your blood's like a sky is falling

507
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,900
Feel the fire to keep us both around

508
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,960
And your blood's like a sky is falling

509
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,800
Feel the fire to keep us both around

510
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,740
And your blood's like a sky is falling

511
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,420
New robots to keep us rolling around

512
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,340
And our vote on the sky is falling

513
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:57,160
New robots to keep us rolling around

514
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,700
Poppy with the khaki sweatband

515
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,380
Bold goat pot-bellied barnyard

516
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,680
The only he noticed

517
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,820
The old fart was smart

518
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,160
The old gold cloth Madonna

519
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,100
Dancing to the fiddle and saw

520
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,180
He ran down behind the knoll

521
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,280
And slipped on his wooden fish head

522
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,380
The mouth worked and snapped

523
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,440
All the bees back to the bungalow

524
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,280
Mama was flattening lard

525
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,160
With her red enamel rolling pin

526
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,080
When the fish head broke the window

527
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,240
Rubber eye erect and precisely detailed

528
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,680
Mama was flattening lard

529
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,500
Air holes from which breath should come

530
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,420
Is now closely fit

531
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,020
With the chatter of the old fart inside

532
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,820
An assortment of observations took place

533
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,400
Mama licked her lips like a cat

534
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,380
Pecked the ground like a rooster

535
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,260
Pivoted like a duck

536
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,880
Her stockings down caught dust and dough balls

537
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,720
She cracked her mouth, glazed, caught one eyelash

538
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,440
Rubbed her hands on her gorgeous gingham

539
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,680
Her hand grasped sticky dough balls

540
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,420
And her cheeky metal intricate latchwork

541
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,140
Opened to the room

542
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,400
Uh, smell, cold

543
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,020
Mixed with bologna

544
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,120
Rubber bands crumpled

545
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,800
Wax paper bonnets

546
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,140
Fat goose legs and special jellies

547
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,200
Ignited by the warmth of the room

548
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,460
The old fart smelled this

549
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,580
Through his important breather holes

550
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,580
Cleverly he dialed from within

551
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,840
From the outside we observed

552
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,060
That the nose of the wooden mask

553
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,660
Was the nose of the wooden mask

554
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:39,660


555
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,940
Where the holes had just been a moment ago

556
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,280
Was now smooth, amazingly blended

557
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,580
Camouflaged in with a very intricate

558
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,680
Rainbow trout replica

559
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,440
The old fart inside was now breathing freely

560
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,020
From his perfume bottle atomizer air bulb invention

561
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,260
His excited eyes from within the dark interior

562
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,620
Glazed, watered in appreciation

563
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,340
Of his thoughtful preparation

564
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,740
Oh my lover, that's so heavy

565
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,860
That's the people just waiting

566
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,060
Counter sachs appear

567
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,140

Bad

580
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,020
I don't live in a fairytale world

581
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,740
With kings and queens and unattainable dreams

582
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,660
Where the bad guys lose and the good guys win

583
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,820
And there's always a price they forever receive

584
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,760
I've looked around and I've gotten to know

585
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,120
That life isn't life, a reality show

586
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,860
Cause I'm a realist, baby

587
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,660
And Romeo, he ain't no realist

588
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,540
Cause I'm a realist, baby

589
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,200
And Romeo, he ain't no realist

590
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,140

00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:26,120
And Romeo, he ain't no realist

592
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,640
It takes a logical mind to escape the traps

593
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,640
This is a realist show

594
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:33,640


595
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,100
Laid out by society and those who take charge

596
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,520
Villains are heralded and heroes can fall

597
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,160
While teens buy identities down at the mall

598
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,680
Will the stories of this generation be written in blood?

599
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,460
Trapped forever in a screen of false information

600
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:14,920
God, I hope not

601
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,060
But I'm a realist, baby

602
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,880
And Romeo, he ain't no realist

603
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,760
Cause I'm a realist, baby

604
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,660
And Romeo, he ain't no realist

605
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,160
Cause I'm a realist, baby

606
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,500

00:59:49,140 --> 01:00:02,540
Thank you, I think I messed something up, but we have t-shirts for sale over there. We need to sell at least five more to get home. And I guess that's it. Thanks guys.

704
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:13,920
Praise Fart Barf. And now, internet listening friends, we're going to let this show go on over an hour again with a song that we can't include on the normal radio copies.

705
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:20,220
Only the internet version, because it's too naughty to work if bleeped.

706
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:29,440
Here then, for our non-broadcast listeners only, or mostly, Nervous Energy's incredibly great song, Holy Shit.

708

712
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,480
Escape from this everyday hell

713
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,180
Perhaps a position

714
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,580
To make it seem like my life is well

715
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,900
But no religion will suit me

716
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,240
They all seem so damn untrue

717
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,900
They all have a skewed perspective

718
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,020
So what do I do?

719
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,000
Start something brand new

720
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,700

01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,480

And listen to Rush all day

726
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,420
Don't worry about obscenities

727
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,640
Cause you can say what you wanna say

728
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,500

729
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,200

It's holy shit

740
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,160
We'll have lasagna for dinner

741
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,520
We won't judge if you ask for more

742
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,320
Put on a Falco record

743
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,000
Because the world is your dance floor

744
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,000
