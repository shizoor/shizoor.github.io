1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
You ain't nothing but a soul genius.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,560
Power of...

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,780
...work.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,200
We depend on you to lift the standards of our young people,

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,720
not hasten their decadence.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,520
Fuck me!

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,160
Those of you who read the schedule,

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,120
raise your hands.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,960
Oh, look, it's wet.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,560
One, two, three.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,620
I don't even have one yet.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,900
Another record has been broken.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,460
So here's the deal.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,280
Pretty much on the schedule, this section is called fuckery.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,940
So, since we have live mics,

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,420
and so what that means is you can rant.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,560
Really, just let's stick with ranting,

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,620
because there's not a place to stick with an instrument yet.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,940
Well, unless you've got kids' instruments.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,060
You know, or spoons or coffee cans.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,060
Or acapella.

22
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,120
You can do acapella, that's right.

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,540
You can hold a bongo.

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,140
You probably could.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,160
Who doesn't say fuckery? It said fuckery from seven to nine!

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,120
What?

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
What the hell is this?

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,540
What?

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,340
Well, so much for fuckery.

30
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,100
It's the schedule set back.

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,900
Who reads the schedule now?

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,320
Who wants expired fuckery?

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,840
Well, you know, it's...

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,320
Extended?

35
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,120
Yeah, it's extended.

36
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,140
Extended.

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,560
Extended fuckery.

38
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,500
What it is, is you're getting a great deal on fuckery,

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
because we had some extra fuckery leftover.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,000
30% more fuckery.

41
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,700
Yes, so this is extra fuckery just for you guys.

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,820
Over doctors for Bob.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,200
Doctors for Bob and everything real in my life.

44
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,620
I got the blues,

45
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,760
cause that damn pickup truck done.

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,160
Run over my wife.

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,400
Doctors for Bob and everything real in my life.

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,820
Ah, yes dear friends, back to the early gospels

49
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,960
by way of the most recent subgenius religious gathering 18X day drill.

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,960
Actually, our 20th drill.

51
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,120
But only the first two in 1996 and 1997 were supposed to be drills.

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:38,860
Anyway, this is another one of those episodes composed entirely of stuff recorded on or around the Wisteria Campground outdoor stage last July.

53
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,920
You'll feel like you're actually at X Day.

54
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,760
So I hope you brought your snakebite kit and bear repellent.

55
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,720
This is also an X-rated show, meaning it won't be on our beloved broadcast stations, only the internet.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,120
Also, these kinds of shows, you know,

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,120
utilize more of the, shall we say,

58
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,540
you had to have been there sort of material,

59
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,400
which might or might not be of interest to people who were not there.

60
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,080
However, everybody will like this first song by St. Andrew the Impaled,

61
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,160
at least once he finishes fucking around with the technical stuff.

62
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,160
You'll hear more of that, the futzing around with technical stuff, in this episode than you do in most.

63
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,140
See, there's two microphones, there should be two mirrors.

64
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,640
Guys, what the fuck?

65
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,820
That's how you diva, bitches.

66
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,060
Alright.

67
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,480
Alright, this next song is...

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:38,940
Got it!

69
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,020
There you go, thank you.

70
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,880
See? See?

71
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,100
And when you diva right, that's how it works.

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,300
That's why people are divas.

73
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,440
You're one of like, why is he such an asshole?

74
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,640
It fucking works.

75
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,260
Thank you, Pisces.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,520
There.

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,320
See?

78
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Fucking learning.

79
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,240
Alright.

80
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,060
Fucking talk.

81
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,300
There will be a day

82
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,180
When all the pink boys pay

83
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,880
They'll scream burn with nowhere left to run

84
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,280
But I won't be around

85
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
Cause I'm headed out of town

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,580
To outer space

87
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,820
And a saucer built for one

88
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,680
And my saucer built for one

89
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,360
Gave that sucker towards the sun

90
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,920
Light the fuse and then I'm on my way

91
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,900
I realize my dreams as I hear the pink boys scream

92
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,640
And agony and terror come next day

93
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,580
Now a saucer built for one

94
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,640
Sure sounds like lots of fun

95
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,520
Till you realize that there's no one there to screw

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,400
And I get bored with my hands

97
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,980
So I ripped up all my plans

98
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,280
Now I'm working on a saucer built for two

99
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,500
And my saucer built for two

100
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,900
You notice what we'll do?

101
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,180
Each other as we make our way through space

102
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,520
And in a rearview mirror

103
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,840
We'll see nothing but fear

104
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,520
As the X's ravage Earth come X day

105
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,780
Now a saucer built for two

106
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,460
Got a cozy seat for you

107
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,240
And another one on this side just for me

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,340
But when I'm between your thighs

109
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,300
I need someone else to drive

110
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,080
So now I'm working on a saucer built for three

111
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,280
And my saucer built for three

112
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,560
Yeah, you ain't heard me!

113
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,880
We'll all take turns

114
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,920
And we'll all get to play

115
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,400
And they'll know it's no joke

116
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,920
As the fakes go up in smoke

117
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,540
And agony and terror come X day

118
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,020
Now a saucer built for three

119
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,440
Might seem quite enough for me

120
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,800
But I for one need just a little more

121
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,900
So I went back to the shop

122
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,460
I put that fucker off on blocks

123
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,860
And now I'm working on a saucer built for four

124
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,040
And my saucer built for four

125
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,380
Yeah, no one's getting bored

126
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,600
There's always someone up for getting laid

127
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,040
And we'll thank our lucky stars

128
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,080
As we cruise right past Mars

129
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,680
That we escaped the carnage of X day

130
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,400
Now a saucer built for four

131
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,660
I guess I shouldn't ask for more

132
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,620
But what the hell, why else am I alive?

133
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,500
Besides, I don't need a break every six hours, give or take

134
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,660
So now I'm working on a saucer built for five

135
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,760
And my saucer built for five

136
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,100
From now till we arrive

137
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,700
We'll fucking suck with luck in every way

138
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,240
And each time we get laid

139
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
The memories will fade

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,420
Of what the Earth was like before X day

141
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,480
Now a saucer built for five

142
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,300
Three to shag and one to drive

143
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,880
But it turns out that the ladies want more dicks

144
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,600
So I'm getting out of bed

145
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm getting right back to my shed

146
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
And now I'm working on a saucer built for six

147
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,080
And my saucer built for six

148
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,780
Might learn me some new tricks

149
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,000
As we go tearing across the Milky Way

150
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,460
Laughing as we drink

151
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,080
About every single pink

152
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,000
Who fried right where they stood

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,340
Come X day

154
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,660
Now a saucer built for six

155
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,940
So much cock and ass and tits

156
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,740
No one ever got so close to heaven

157
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,740
But at the risk of sounding rude

158
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,500
We might need one for food

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,760
So now I'm working on a saucer for seven

160
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,020
And my saucer built for seven

161
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,560
We got room for Cat and Kevin

162
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,880
And five more Yeti freaks who knew how to pay

163
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,300
Thirty some odd bucks to Bob

164
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,160
And they finally quit that job

165
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,340
And that wave of corporate layoffs

166
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,020
Come X day

167
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,580
Now a saucer built for seven

168
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,100
And it only takes a second

169
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,340
To turn around and find yourself a date

170
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,660
But the place will be a mess

171
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,380
We'll need some cleaning help I guess

172
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,740
So now I'm working on a saucer built for eight

173
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,000
And my saucer built for eight

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,440
No one has to masturbate

175
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,840
Yeah, there's always someone up for getting laid

176
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,440
Oh no, shit, oh fuck

177
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,240
Yeah, rewind that

178
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,160
Cut it in now

179
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,220
Three, two

180
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,940
And my saucer built for eight

181
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,400
No one has to masturbate

182
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,680
A little help here is all you gotta say

183
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,100
Get some pretty Yeti mouth

184
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,560
Is happy to go south

185
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,340
After all, that's what we practiced for X day

186
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,020
Now my saucer built for eight

187
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,180
Of course that sounds just great

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But I'm starting now to recognize a trend

189
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,920
I'd build it out for nine

190
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,880
And then I'd change my mind

191
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,100
So fucking kids were skipping ahead to ten

192
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,260
And my saucer built for ten

193
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,860
A mobile pleasure den

194
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,000
A hedonistic hoedown on its way

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,660
To that sexy slack-filled place

196
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,080
Away up there in space

197
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,960
We were promised would be ready come X day

198
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,080
Now a saucer built for ten

199
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,400
You might think that that's the end

200
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,700
But I hate to let down my subgenius brethren

201
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,260
So I put in extra doors

202
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,320
Put some beanbags on the floors

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,420
Now I'm proud to say my saucer seat's eleven

204
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,800
And my saucer for eleven

205
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
My libido won't be edimin'

206
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,660
In fact, I might become a better lay

207
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,000
Cause I'll learn from the best

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,660
And I'll practice on the rest

209
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,440
As we all make each other

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,780
Come X day

211
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,900
Now my saucer for eleven

212
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,120
Oh my, this place is gettin'

213
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,720
To be one where it's hard to hear yourself

214
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,420
So I'll make an intercom somehow

215
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,820
Cause I ain't stoppin' now

216
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,240
Cause I'm workin' on a saucer built for twelve

217
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,680
And my saucer built for twelve

218
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,060
Escaping from that hell

219
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,240
The earth will become, or so they say

220
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,980
Half the hands of the world

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,540
Who grab an ass

222
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,100
The other half will raise a glass

223
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,080
To those liberating exists of X day

224
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,600
Now a saucer built for twelve

225
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,120
Oh dear, Bob, the smell

226
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,280
And the furniture all has a sticky sheen

227
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,660
But if that's not quite enough

228
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,700
Well, I hate to say it, but tough

229
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,420
I ain't workin' on a saucer for thirteen

230
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,560
And oh, my saucer built for twelve

231
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,980
Will suit us all well, well

232
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,720
With whips and toys and liquor and poker

233
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,220
Yay!

234
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,180
And no one's gettin' off

235
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,360
Well, everyone's getting off

236
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,780
And no, we'll never stop

237
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,160
Unless we run into those Heaven's Gate people

238
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,300
Yeah, I wanna talk to them about some, like, new tennis shoes

239
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,540
Until we reach the top

240
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,160
Until we reach our new home

241
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,820
Call Max D

242
00:10:50,820 --> 00:11:01,880
Thank you so much!

243
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm Drew, Andrew the Impaled, Saint Sinner

244
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,200
Thank you so much

245
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,920
I'll be back tomorrow night with a sideshow

246
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,820
Including the one and only Slippy the Clown

247
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,940
AKA Reverend David Apocalypse

248
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,480
Who many of you have heard about for many years

249
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,260
And we'll see in the flesh here

250
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,120
Hopefully a lot of flesh, we'll see

251
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,520
Yeah, tomorrow night

252
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,640
Thanks again!

253
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,060
In the name of all that is Hypercube

254
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,320
Not that stupid garbage bullshit

255
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,360
No, absolutely not

256
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,820
Everyone give a round, everyone say hi to Fox

257
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,140
Hi Fox!

258
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,080
It's wonderful

259
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,740
Is this thing, is this a microphone or is this

260
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,520
Is this one a microphone too?

261
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,880
Okay, I like this one

262
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:51,980
Wonderful

263
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,700
I'm more comfortable here, if that's okay with all of you

264
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,320
Oh well, oh well, anyway

265
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,440
Well everybody, here we are

266
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,020
X Day!

267
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,060
Woo!

268
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,760
Woo!

269
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:04,960
Woo!

270
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,920
Again

271
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,840
It's okay!

272
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,300
It's okay, on the way up here

273
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,060
My god, if there's one thing I've learned on every X Day you know it's

274
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,700
How many people can I cram into a car?

275
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,360
Subgeniuses are incredibly squishy and pliable

276
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,660
Despite how most of them look really

277
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,340
But if you cram enough subgeniuses in your car

278
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,500
You get to come all the way up here

279
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,180
And you get to see all of your subgenius brethren and whatnot

280
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,980
And I don't, you know, I've got prepared stuff

281
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,460
I'll do a little bit of that

282
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,400
But then I want to go, you know, fuck around up there too

283
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,460
So, you know, let's talk about the Midwest real quick

284
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,040
How many of you are from Ohio or live here in the Midwest?

285
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,040


286
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,380
Who's here in Ohio?

287
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,640
Okay, perfect, I can take all of you

288
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,220
Alright, perfect

289
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,920
So, actually this place isn't nearly as bad

290
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,800
You know, a few years ago I had to come up and travel into the Midwest

291
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,000
On a overnight subgenius rescue mission actually

292
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,920
I had to take a car that wasn't mine

293
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,480
And drive it up and go to Ohio

294
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,820
I left Florida, it was 70 degrees and sunny

295
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,020
And I was this desolate fucking wasteland

296
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,020


297
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,080
Of just bitter fuck and cold and hate

298
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,880
And I don't know why anyone would ever live there

299
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,760
In fact, when we got in, the roads were highlighted out of Iowa

300
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,060
And this was at the Welcome Station

301
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,300
So that let me know just what kind of environment the Midwest is

302
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,840
And I don't know, is this considered Midwest area?

303
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,080
I don't know what this is

304
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,740
It's about to be, I hope everyone remembered to turn their air conditioners a little high before they left

305
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,020
Because it's going to get hot

306
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,040
No matter where you're going to be

307
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,400
Whether you're in the Midwest

308
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,040
Whether you're in the Southwest

309
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,260
Or an East-West

310
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,160
Or maybe an East-West

311
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,420
Or a Clint Eastwood

312
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,840
Or a Cunt Eastwood

313
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,160
Or wherever you are, it's about to get hot, right?

314
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,300
It's about to get a lot hotter

315
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,160
It's going to get a lot hotter because it's going to be ecstasy!

316
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,480
The ecstasy!

317
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,580
They're going to come down from the sky

318
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,440
They're going to fucking burn it all

319
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,020
And so, yeah

320
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,880
So I'm going to go straight to the number one source I know for burning it all

321
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,320
And I'm just going to read a few passages from the Holy Bible

322
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,560
So, let's see here

323
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,860
Let's do some Bible talking

324
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,120
Deuteronomy, you want Deuteronomy, canonical?

325
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,700
What do we got?

326
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,180
Let's see, 2853

327
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,840
Okay, you want Deuteronomy, here's Deuteronomy

328
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:39,940
Mmmmm

329
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,680
Mmmmm!

330
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,480
Mmmmm!

331
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,100
Mmmmmmmm!

332
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,280
So it leads us to chapter 14

333
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,540
But watch this now

334
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:07,540


335
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,900
Okay, so this, Dr. Abraham

336
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,400
He says that

337
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,040
During theik

338
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,920
of the suffering your enemy will inflict

339
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,000
on you during the siege of all of your

340
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,920
cities. The most gentle

341
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,960
and sensitive woman among you, so

342
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,920
sensitive and gentle that she would not

343
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,060
venture to touch the ground with the sole of her

344
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,000
foot, will begrudge the husband

345
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,940
she loves and her own son or daughter,

346
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,740
the afterbirth from the womb

347
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,440
and the children she bears.

348
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,960
For in her dire need, she intends

349
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,920
to eat them secretly. Because of the

350
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,880
suffering your enemy will inflict on you

351
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
during the siege of your cities.

352
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,840
We're gonna make them eat their fucking baby!

353
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,580
Cheese!

354
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,860
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

355
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,300
Ha ha ha ha ha!

356
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,280
Woo!

357
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,800
I don't know.

358
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,060
That sounds like a revelation to me.

359
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,520
It sounds like, you know,

360
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,860
a good idea. I don't know why

361
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
people don't like this book

362
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,520
so much. It's great!

363
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,860
So many wonderful

364
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,800
ideas that we could be putting into

365
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,420
mode right now.

366
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,140
Who's got a baby?

367
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,520
Okay, Stank's got babies.

368
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,160
Alright, well, I think that's enough

369
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,700
Bible ranting for me tonight.

370
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,120
But, uh, we'll do more of this

371
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,980
goofy video bullshit and whatever,

372
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,740
but, uh, Pisces, you want a microphone?

373
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,260
Here you go.

374
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,160
Big round of

375
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,400
applause!

376
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,980
There's nothing like the Bible to remind you how

377
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,020
fucked up shit

378
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,920
really could be.

379
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,900
Yes, that

380
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,480
was Reverend Fox.

381
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,800
From Hypercube in Orlando.

382
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,160
And most people mispronounce

383
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,060
his name, Fox, because

384
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,040
it's spelled in the way that

385
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,180
causes the unknowing to pronounce

386
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,800
it, foe.

387
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,300
Those wacky subgeniuses.

388
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,060
Incidentally, during the

389
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,480
X-Day drills these days,

390
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,040
the wacky subgeniuses are herded

391
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,060
like rabid cats by

392
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,840
the one person capable of managing

393
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,160
such a thing, Priestess Pisces.

394
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,720
Pisces is the

395
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,920
main behind-the-scenes organizer of the,

396
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,620
of these drills, also the emcee on

397
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,520
stage, also the person who'll sing

398
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,120
or rant scriptlessly

399
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,440
when nobody else has the ball or

400
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,120
gumption or energy to do it.

401
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,740
Her mighty husband, Suds

402
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,600
Pasha, runs sound

403
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,680
and gets half the recordings that we

404
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,360
use, along with playing guitar and

405
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,260
illustrating and making videos and

406
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,580
helping to get the new Bob Song

407
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,560
albums online. Yes,

408
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,400
new Bob Song

409
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,580
albums that you can buy

410
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,660
and that we can talk about because

411
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,280
this show isn't going to be on

412
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,380
community stations,

413
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,140
non-profit stations.

414
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,400
You can even preview the songs

415
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,340
for free, friends, at our new

416
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,140
pay-per-download classic

417
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,060
subgenius album site,

418
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,280
which is on bandcamp.com

419
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,920
specifically

420
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,220
subgeniusfoundation.bandcamp.com

421
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,280
subgeniusfoundation.bandcamp.com

422
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,440
subgeniusfoundation being only one word

423
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,820
with two O's in it.

424
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,720
Or you can just hit subgenius.com's

425
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,020
homepage and look for the

426
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,040
CD downloads link.

427
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,540
It's been eight years since Bob Song's

428
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,560
number six, but now we have

429
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,180
Bob Song's seven and eight,

430
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,560
each of which can be burned

431
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,640
to precisely fill an audio CD

432
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,460
or you can play it from your

433
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,700
iPod or whatnot.

434
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,480
And they have cool cover art by

435
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,320
Dr. Zeronius, Molg,

436
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,540
and Reverend Catfeather, respectively.

437
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,660
Most

438
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,520
of the songs on these are studio

439
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
recordings by dozens of different bands

440
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,380
as opposed to the live

441
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,460
jams that you'll be hearing on this show tonight.

442
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,540
There are some of those, but mostly

443
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,600
it's the slick-sounding subgenius music

444
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,620
that you've been hearing on Hour of Slack for the last

445
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,680
eight years.

446
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,640
It's a buck a song or $10

447
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,560
an album, and each album has about

448
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,440
30 songs. And

449
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,520
all our old CD albums

450
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,460
are available for download there

451
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,620
as well. That's

452
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,660
subgeniusfoundation.bandcamp.com

453
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:09,880
subgeniusfoundation.bandcamp.com

454
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:09,880


455
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,400
subgeniusfoundation.bandcamp.com

456
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,020
We need all the help we can get this

457
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,620
month, friends, seriously.

458
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,120
We really appreciate

459
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,960
the Hour of Slack

460
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,360
donations that

461
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,840
a few people do regularly

462
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,640
contribute.

463
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,040
But there's not much of old Bessie

464
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,120
left to sell. So get

465
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,020
right on that stick and buy

466
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,000
subgenius.

467
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,180
Right on. So, Grill Ninja's got the balls up here.

468
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,180
I'd like Gravity to come up

469
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,100
here since he's been running his damn mouth all day.

470
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,340
You're all talk, man.

471
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,700
I'm merely the freckle on

472
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,080
Bob's ball sack.

473
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,760
Even the freckle on Bob's

474
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,160
ball sack, DJ Gravity,

475
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,780
that is important. Even the

476
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,800
freckle on Bob's ball sack. And the thing is

477
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,440
is that you've been talking all day.

478
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,120
You are

479
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
such a Bob tease.

480
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,540
You little...

481
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,660
You're not even a Bob

482
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,560
slut here. You're not even a slut for Slack.

483
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,640
You're a Bob tease.

484
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,000
I have the fully charged on my Slack.

485
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,320
That right there,

486
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,640
he is a motherfucker who could probably

487
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,060
out-keg stand all of you.

488
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,800
He's beating the peeps at their own game, as

489
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,840
Fitchuli says. He is beating the peeps at their own game

490
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,340
by being an incredibly

491
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,920
hardcore subgenius drinker.

492
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Right on. So,

493
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,920
more ranchers, more spoken word. You head up here.

494
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,600
And I'm waiting.

495
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,860
If not,

496
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,520
we may have to start the tuning song,

497
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,040
which everyone hates.

498
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,180
Where's Reverend Funny Name?

499
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,360
Reverend Funny Name?

500
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,860
Where's Reverend Funny Name?

501
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,840
Reverend Funny Name. He's funny.

502
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,440
Reverend Funny Name's such a bitch.

503
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,200
He didn't show up.

504
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,620
And you have to show up.

505
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,880
You guys showed up. That's great. Good for you.

506
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,500
You fucking showed up.

507
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,560
How cool is that?

508
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,560
You didn't sit at home saying,

509
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,460
I'm gonna half-ass X Day.

510
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,220
I'm gonna sit here and say, praise Bob

511
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,720
while I'm masturbating to Sports Illustrated.

512
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,740
No, you didn't do that.

513
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,480
You didn't sit there and say, my great plan

514
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
for X Day is to go to my work

515
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,140
and take a shit at 7 a.m.

516
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,140
No, you got off your asses

517
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,440
and you showed up and congratulations.

518
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,040
Congratulations, you have to listen to me

519
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,660
on the fucking mic acting like an asshole.

520
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,800
Aren't you glad didn't you get your money's worth?

521
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,820
Because I'm gonna sit up here and talk

522
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,660
and your ass could be up here talking too.

523
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,920
But instead, you don't want to do that.

524
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,860
Is this what you fucking paid for?

525
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,420
Did you pay to watch some stupid broad

526
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,480
run her mouth on the mic? Is that what you paid for?

527
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,320
Guilt!

528
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,620
You're hoping to be topless.

529
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,320
I thought this was a bit called the Pisces Festival.

530
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,500
It's not about me. It's about you.

531
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,780
It's about you and Bob.

532
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,820
So come up here and get connected to Bob.

533
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,140
Get in front of this mic or we're gonna have to start the tuning song.

534
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,320
You guys like the tuning song, don't you?

535
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,920
That's the problem.

536
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,180
It's a fuck Pisces Festival.

537
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,220
It's a fuck Pisces Festival.

538
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,560
Pisces is mean.

539
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,900
When is that on the schedule?

540
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,240
I don't know. I thought it was the whole schedule.

541
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,900
Okay, that's the case. We're gonna start the tuning song.

542
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

543
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,920
So yeah, we're gonna start the tuning song.

544
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,920
You poor bastards.

545
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,860
You guys are gonna start the tuning song.

546
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:09,860


547
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,980
You guys ready for the tuning song?

548
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,060
It's an hour and a half long.

549
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,440
That was the tuning song in G.

550
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,160
We're gonna do the tuning song in C flat.

551
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,700
Get it up.

552
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,880
Come on.

553
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,620
Pull it.

554
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,620
Shake it.

555
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,620
Get it.

556
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:04,520
Get it.

557
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,060
Jerk off.

558
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,800
Jerk off.

559
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,140
Jerk off.

560
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,720
Jerk off.

561
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,160
Jerk off.

562
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,320
Bob don't need these keys.

563
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,180
No, we haven't.

564
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,980
Bob needs something to eat.

565
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,960
Get some certain.

566
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,620
Because he's got slack.

567
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,520
Bob earned it back.

568
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,200
He brought sexy back.

569
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,620
We're gonna run that track.

570
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,520
I've got sand in my vagina.

571
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:26,660
I've got sand in my vagina.

572
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:50,440
I've got sand in my vagina.

573
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:21,120
I've got sand in my vagina.

574
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,620
I've got sand in my vagina.

575
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,760
I've got sand in my vagina.

576
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,740
I've got sand in my vagina.

577
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,020
Yes!

578
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,140
I'll see.

579
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,560
Ladies and gentlemen, again,

580
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,080
are we still the Fuck Peas Band?

581
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,620
I don't know what I am!

582
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,780
Okay, we are the Multi-Fisted Tales of Connie,

583
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,320
also known today as the Fuck Peas Band.

584
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,020
Fuck Peas!

585
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,120
Fuck Peas!

586
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,860
Fuck Peas!

587
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,260
Fuck Peas!

588
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,720
Fuck Peas!

589
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,220
Right now we have Sax & Mortis on drums,

590
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,200
who is chugging his beer.

591
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,940
Stick, of course, on the stick.

592
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,040
Angry Larry on guitar.

593
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,760
Reverend Rock God on guitar.

594
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,780
Lord Ferg on bass.

595
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,040
We have a groupie here.

596
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,100
He's got a big favorite ass.

597
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,860
You're, like, the greatest rock star that I ever saw.

598
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,200
And, like,

599
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,000
I just wanted to be, like,

600
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,180
partake of your talent,

601
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,380
and by, like, giving you a blood job

602
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,540
or whatever you would want, like, backstage,

603
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,120
because I can tell my friends.

604
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,800
And that's all.

605
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,240
I just...

606
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,400
Oh!

607
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,100
Oh!

608
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,760
Oh!

609
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,900
I can't believe I said that!

610
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,700
Oh!

611
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,580
Oh!

612
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:53,940
Oh!

613
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,280
Oh!

614
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:54,440
Oh!

615
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,820
Oh!

616
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,940
I'm getting nervous right now.

617
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,600
I can't wait until my friends hear about this!

618
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,680
Oh, God!

619
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,960
It's gonna be so dramatic!

620
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,000
I'll put it on Facebook.

621
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,480
Oh, I've got a recording of it!

622
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:02,980
Oh, great!

623
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,120
I've got a recording of it saying

624
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,620
he won't take a blood job from me!

625
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,020
I'm gonna put it all over Facebook

626
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,180
and everybody will know you're dead!

627
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:08,620
Oh!

628
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,000


629
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,740
I always wanted to do that.

630
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,860
But Frank Zappa died too soon.

631
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,200
I never got to do Frank Zappa.

632
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:18,940
Shit!

633
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,900
So, I'm going to do one more spoken piece

634
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,800
and then do some songs,

635
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,440
which I think is what you guys came here for, perhaps.

636
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,400
It's called The Queer in You.

637
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,720
Once upon a new life, someone told you that you were born dirty. Someone told you that when you

638
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,840
were squeezed from between the legs of your beautiful mother, you were already dirty. Blood,

639
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:56,120
water, newborn open heart to be washed away, foreskin offed, first intimate touch a knife,

640
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,620
to imprint under artificial white lights, white coats, that to make it in this world, kid,

641
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,680
you've got to cut away, cut and shape this organ, clean up your inevitable sin.

642
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,160
First time in a long time yesterday, I started to hate. I hate the big lie. I hate the over-muscled

643
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,920
strong arm that saw you stop jumping rope and start playing football. I hate the boxed,

644
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,480
but love the boxed in, sweet young girl boys, poor things starting to tell that lie.

645
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,520
The box is bullshit. So many pushing and clamoring to,

646
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,920
occupy the same Kinsey zero space fit for 10% of us, maybe.

647
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,560
For the first time in a long, long time yesterday, I really started to hate,

648
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,800
started to hate the incessant sell-a-thon, the vivid color idiot box that sells us black or

649
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:55,820
white. I hate the channel that tuned you in, dropped you out of anybody with emotion or sound

650
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:01,420
with a beat. I bought into that lie one time. I reached to absolve my soul,

651
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,020
sisterhood, kick the box of shit that split my mulatto mind down the middle.

652
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,220
That's why I love the queer in you. The one who blushes at a party, flips her wrist talking to a

653
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,940
boy, or a bold, grown man with earrings who flirts back, unaware, body language,

654
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,320
unrealized, over the heads of both of you, too far outside the wall of the box that divides

655
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,820
your lips, your eyes. I love the queer in you, however unwilling he is to speak of his own beauty.

656
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,600
I love the queer in me. I love the queer in you. I love the queer in me. I love the queer in me.

657
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:31,600


658
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,760
the queer in your swiveling hips when you forget yourself and rock and roll and actually move.

659
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,020
I love the queer in you because I hate the bland alternative, the cookie cutter,

660
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,460
dressed down shirt and tie man who believes he's doing all the right things. Then there's the

661
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,640
patriarch you who gets stiff and annoyed, simmers just under rage when I speak of alternatives to

662
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,760
marriage. The gnawing and lingering one who still believes that a good wife is sweet and home,

663
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,000
proud to assume your name would be better than this rebellious, questioning, grassroots,

664
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:12,020
organizing, baggy, khaki, shorts-wearing woman you try to know. This one who painfully, honestly,

665
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:20,240
wants honesty over pleasant emotional lacquer, a good spontaneous fuck over a steady diet of

666
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:28,980
missionary comfort. This one who wants love over form.

667
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:37,240
I love the queer in you who wrestles free when you least expect, when you least care for him to bat a long eyelash.

668
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,400
The queer in you who sky is wider and who knows more than all the streamers and rice you could stomach.

669
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,660
The suddenly fearful one who is terror paralyzed, the one who's been shamed away from cleaning his

670
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:56,400
open wounds, the one who would hold a baby, the mothering man who can heal and will heal in an

671
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,140
instant through lifetimes.

672
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:15,660
I love the queer in you, the child, teacup brown eyes peeking out from under a lavender blanket, not yet boy or girl, white or black, gay or straight, love or hate, unmade, wiser than our flawed sculptor America.

673
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:28,720
So grow again, young again, with your original uncut body and glide, no, prance, along the green hill bell curve undistorted, dressed in your finest.

674
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,380
I'll be there, crossing your path with my best dyke swagger.

675
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,580
All right, thank you. Thanks a lot.

676
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:50,280
No, thank you, Reverend Andrew Genis, for daring to bring pretty music to X-Day.

677
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:57,540
Incidentally, friends, you can find much more music, graphics, and poetry by Reverend Andrew Genis if you

678
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,740
Google under her human name.

679
00:32:59,740 --> 00:32:59,740


680
00:32:59,740 --> 00:32:59,740


681
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:19,020
And now we'll hear a little more pretty subgenius music, which I suspect happened accidentally between health songs while people were tuning up.

682
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,040
Somebody was on some kind of keyboard and snuck in these odd and pretty sounds.

683
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,180
I don't know what you guys are doing.

684
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:56,240
Oh, we should sing about how, how, we could sing about, we could sing about how Stang is unfortunately the asshole of Bob.

685
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,680
And Stang got stuck with me.

686
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,740
Bob's asshole.

687
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,200
Asshole.

688
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,180
Just, just no.

689
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,820
Just no.

690
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,960
Bob!

691
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,020
Bob!

692
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,640
Ish.

693
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,120
Oh, I guess it's a real name for asshole.

694
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,880
Hey, did you know Bob's spelled backwards is still Bob?

695
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

696
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:22,100
Ah, but Bob is still only one O short of boo.

697
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,340
We all love boo.

698
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
We can totally sing a song about that.

699
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,080
Yeah.

700
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,560
Yeah, and Bob is, Bob is just one.

701
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,480
Bob, Bob, Bob is just one.

702
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,040
Bob, Bob, Bob is just one.

703
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,480
Yeah.

704
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:36,880
Yeah.

705
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,080
Yeah.

706
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,320
Yeah.

707
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,760
Anyway, I've got two fart pianos in my front seat.

708
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,120
I have your fart piano and his fart piano.

709
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,420
I might need to finish off in the swimming pool.

710
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,880
So there's, there's.

711
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,000
It's fart pianos all the way down.

712
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,000
The real one and then the froppelganger.

713
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,180
The fro.

714
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,400
The froppelganger.

715
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,820
Yeah.

716
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,860
Well, for all we know, that's one of the ones in my front seat because they all look alike.

717
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:13,620
You know, to be honest, I've always wanted to be in that situation where I had to shoot the real one and there was like two copies and, you know what I mean, you're pointing the gun and you're like, no, it's me, no, it's me.

718
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,160
You know what I mean?

719
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,220
Be honest.

720
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,400
You, you, you wanted to be in that situation.

721
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,380
Well, in that room full of mirrors, yeah, that one time.

722
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,500
But I quit doing that.

723
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:24,900
Well.

724
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,240
I slept.

725
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,000
I keep shooting myself and I don't run out of them.

726
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,520
They keep coming.

727
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,800
What the shit?

728
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,180
I believe in you.

729
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,600
Who better knows where the hype is?

730
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,780
I believe in you too.

731
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,820
I believe in you and me.

732
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,440
I believe in my dream.

733
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,500
That's the most important thing, believe in your dream.

734
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,260
Every movie I've ever seen says, believe in your dream.

735
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,700
Yeah, what the shit?

736
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,020
No.

737
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,640
I can't find my class.

738
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,220
It works out.

739
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm in my underwear.

740
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
That's fucking fantastic, but no.

741
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,020
I don't have any dreams.

742
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,920
I'm trying to find my illusions.

743
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,860
I know I left some here somewhere.

744
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,220
Oh, they're scattered all over the place, Susan.

745
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,840
They're blowing around like down feathers.

746
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,020
Your illusions are everywhere.

747
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,780
If you look around, there's all these people that share your, they've got your illusions

748
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,120
flying through the air.

749
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:22,900
Wow.

750
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,220
Unfortunately, four bastards have each other's as well.

751
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


752
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


753
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


754
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


755
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


756
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


757
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


758
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


759
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


760
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


761
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


762
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


763
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


764
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,220


765
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,940
Oh.

766
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:27,860
Yeah.

767
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,960
And mine.

768
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,000
Is that what the smell is?

769
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,660
Yeah, yeah.

770
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,840
I thought it was me.

771
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,000
What is that smell?

772
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,740
No.

773
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,780
No, you smell like coconut pie, Reverend Susan Fusey.

774
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,020
That's the sweetest smell I ever smelled.

775
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,260
She's like, coconut pie.

776
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,020
I love coconut too.

777
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,360
Cross the low tide on the sin.

778
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,080
She's the prettiest smelling lady.

779
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,400
I wish she didn't smoke, brother.

780
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,060
That's awful.

781
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,200
I don't know.

782
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


783
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


784
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


785
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


786
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


787
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


788
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


789
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


790
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


791
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


792
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


793
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,200


794
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,280
I don't know.

795
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,580
It's not good for your health to smoke like that.

796
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,800
I hate to see you destroy or hurt yourself with any of the cigarettes and other vices.

797
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,920
I can destroy other parts of myself if you're interested in that.

798
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,520
Ever see a woman do the C-cucumber act?

799
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,500
I don't know nothing about that sort of thing.

800
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,760
I don't know what you're trying to suggest, Ms. Fusey, but I think that you should quit

801
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,820
that smoking habit.

802
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,420
I haven't started eating more green vegetables.

803
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,200
I really do.

804
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,820
I think that's sensible.

805
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,140
Grab that plunger and help me get my guts back in here and I'll show you some more tricks.

806
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,980
Oh, gosh.

807
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,680
You're making me have a funny feeling.

808
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,660
Down in my butt deck.

809
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,800
My butt deck's feeling awfully weird now.

810
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,660
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'll sing that button.

811
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,800
Oh, my gosh.

812
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,560
Oh, my gosh.

813
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,760
You stop that now.

814
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,040
You stop that singing, Reverend Susan Fusey.

815
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,700
That's terrible.

816
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,580
What you're doing, man?

817
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,260
I don't know.

818
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:55,480
I don't know.

819
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:55,800
I don't know.

820
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:55,800


821
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:55,800


822
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:55,800


823
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:55,800


824
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:55,800


825
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:55,800


826
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:55,800


827
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,520
You bring on the smoke from my face.

828
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,520
Why is there a stuff running down my leg?

829
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,420
What is this stuff?

830
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,760
What is this?

831
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,660
I still got it.

832
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,900
I need to...

833
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,500
I feel the fuckery.

834
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,760
I smell the fuckery.

835
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,640
I need to pick it up just a little bit.

836
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,660
Just a little bit.

837
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,280
No more fuckery.

838
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,480
I don't know.

839
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,200
I don't know.

840
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:57,980
There it goes.

841
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,880
Come on.

842
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,380
Fuckery in this game.

843
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,740
Woo!

844
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,740
Fuckery in this game.

845
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,900
Fuckery in this game.

846
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,360
Skit.

847
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,540
That's what they call it.

848
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,940
That's what the kids call it now.

849
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,460
When you scrape it off with a spatula.

850
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,820
It's a little crusty.

851
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,660
That's a skit.

852
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,320
Oh, really?

853
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,320
Yeah.

854
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,400
It's a scat.

855
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,580
Skit is really good.

856
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,420
That's the best part.

857
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,320
Yeah.

858
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,440
I think the skit's the crispy bits.

859
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
lol

860
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,540
Rice ball was sitting all

861
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,100
Have to pee for your own sake

862
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,200
So you're going toỗi

863
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,800
Rahl

864
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,060
Mull опредa

865
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,580
Slippery

866
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,760
All right.

867
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,360
Slippery

868
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,880
Slippery

869
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,240
Is there an angry Larry?

870
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,580
Were you able to pee?

871
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,320
Oh, yeah, everything came out just fine, just in case everybody was wondering.

872
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,360
Yep.

873
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,560
So now I'm in a band, I'm supposed to stand away from a pulpit?

874
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,800
I feel naked, man.

875
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:54,440
I feel like I'm in that dream where your pants are off and you're in elementary school.

876
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,280
And with no pulpit, they can see me below the waist.

877
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,260
You don't want to see a preacher below the waist when he gets excited.

878
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,720
You'll get jealous.

879
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,680
You're a bro.

880
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,320
You're a bro.

881
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,500
You can do it.

882
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:19,860
Now, speaking of acoustics, there's something I really, really wanted to make sure that everyone else at this campground noticed.

883
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,620
You can get some pretty jazzy, syncopated music going.

884
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,720
In those, well, some people call them chem toilets.

885
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,040
Some call them turdices.

886
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,760
I prefer to call them sweat lodges.

887
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,060
And especially at night, this works.

888
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,800
For some reason, I don't think this happens in the day.

889
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,860
Oh, I know what the difference is.

890
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,260
During the day, I sit down.

891
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,340
At night, I stand up because it's too scary to sit down.

892
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,240
At night.

893
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:03,820
At night, when you dribble into the male side of that thing, the urinal, it's got kind of a funny little echo late at night.

894
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,980
You're in this big bouncy box, right?

895
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:24,120
And if you're, well, I guess attuned or brain damaged or high or something, you'll notice that there's this, your dribbling pee makes this kind of a syncopated drum beat as it hits that plastic.

896
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:31,280
But then it runs down a tube and then it dribbles down into the hell water further down.

897
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:37,060
And that's like another back beat to your syncopated pee beat.

898
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,080
And try it.

899
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,560
Run over there, all of you, right now, and just clatter around one inside.

900
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,380
You have to close the door or the sound doesn't work right.

901
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,920
And, of course, if this band or any other band is playing, you won't be able to notice.

902
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,600
But you'll have your own band.

903
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,300
You.

904
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,220
You're dribbling.

905
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,540
Dribbling.

906
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,020
Fitfully dribbling.

907
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:00,700
Oh, I forgot not everybody has benign prostate asplasia.

908
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:11,480
But you should go out and get benign prostate asplasia so that you can get that kind of hesitant intermittent pee dripping.

909
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:20,520
And it's the secondary side dribbling sound that makes it ever so special.

910
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,620
Don't you agree?

911
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes.

912
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,400
Of course, everyone does.

913
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,380
Thank you.

914
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,360
Thank you.

915
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:38,800
Thank you, Charlie.

916
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,580
Thank you.

917
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,500
Thank you.

918
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,020
Thank you.

919
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,280
Roar!

920
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,300
Roar!

921
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,880
We're gonna kill!

922
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,980
Destroy!

923
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,280
Destroy!

924
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,260
Destroy!

925
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,740
Kill them all!

926
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:05,740


927
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,380
Hi!

928
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,280
Roar!

929
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,920
Stick, I don't know, was that hardcore or was that death metal?

930
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,980
What the hell came out of your mouth?

931
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,400
Um, it was, uh...

932
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,200
Post-Card Game!

933
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,500
It was post-card hardcore pre-industrial?

934
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,300
It was just a...

935
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,200
Hard metal deathcore.

936
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,840
Hard metal deathcore?

937
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,360
Yes!

938
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,520
Hard metal deathcore step?

939
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,400
Stickcore.

940
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,600
Okay, stickcore.

941
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,040
Stickcore.

942
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,900
Stickcore.

943
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,060
Dickcore, that was...

944
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:56,700
Dickcore.

945
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,280
Was that dick-horror?

946
00:45:59,360 --> 00:45:59,700
Yeah.

947
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,200
We're gonna core our dicks on stage for you!

948
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,980
Thanks for requesting Dickcore!

949
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Your show will continue momentarily.

950
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we have a rule.

951
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,280
I have to clarify this.

952
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,720
Sex Mortars, the rule is no dick smears on instruments.

953
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,300
Oh, God, why are we talking about dick-core-ing?

954
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,840
I really do have to remember to bring the, uh...

955
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,580
Scrapple.

956
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,840
The scrapple, the scrapple, it smells like burnt hair.

957
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:27,920
Mmm.

958
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:29,860
Smells like burnt con...

959
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,580
The scrapple, the scrapple.

960
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,160
Burnt con-v.

961
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,380
It's burnt pig assholes and cornmeal.

962
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,960
Wow, so yeah, totally.

963
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,940
Con-v.

964
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:38,440
It's got a lot of salt.

965
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,400
Totally.

966
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:39,820
It's what?

967
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,940
Burnt con-v.

968
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,540
And it smells like burning burnt con-v.

969
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,780
I don't know his legend.

970
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,040
What's burnt con-v?

971
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,440
Burnt con-v.

972
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,940
He was in Semi-Tough.

973
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,540
He was the Est guy.

974
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,540
Experience this, you asshole.

975
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,060
That was burnt con-v.

976
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,440
He was the face of pseudo Werner Erhardt.

977
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,040
Smarmy.

978
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,480
Oh, someone to learn from.

979
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,240
Perpetual.

980
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,220
One to study.

981
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,240
Mmm, game show host.

982
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,620
One who can teach us.

983
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,040
Oily polyester.

984
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,020
Oh, yeah.

985
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,340
Fuck.

986
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,300
So we may learn the secrets of pinkness and...

987
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:24,760
Yeah, yeah.

988
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:25,780
Convoids.

989
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:25,880
Invert them.

990
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:26,940
Yes.

991
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,120
Hmm.

992
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,500
Well, that's a good one.

993
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,440
These are the anti-burnt con-v's here.

994
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:36,220
You cannot get more un-burnt con-v than these gentlemen.

995
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:36,880
Burnt con-v.

996
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,560
Yeah.

997
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,220
I'm trying to define...

998
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:39,240
He be dead.

999
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,460
I'm trying to quantify burnt con-v.

1000
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,160
Burnt con-v.

1001
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,040
He be dead.

1002
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,700
Game show host.

1003
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I know nothing of your television game show.

1004
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


1005
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


1006
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


1007
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,840
Totally lamina...

1008
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,120
Burnt convies.

1009
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,160
This means nothing to...

1010
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,160
Burnt convicts.

1011
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,540
Burnt convicts.

1012
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:55,660
Those of my...

1013
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,260
That would be a great name for a band right there.

1014
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,000
Burnt convicts.

1015
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,060
Well, I cut the list of possible band names that followed.

1016
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:08,360
The band we've mostly been hearing is Six Fisted Tales of Connie, this year also known

1017
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,760
as the Fuck Peas Band.

1018
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:17,060
What is this Fuck Peas thing all about, you non-Facebookers ask?

1019
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,740
Well, it's a Facebook thing partly.

1020
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:27,960
Reverend Peas am liking attention, good or bad, and subgeniuses are so generous in supplying

1021
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
both kinds.

1022
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:36,420
And in that spirit, let's hear the rant song of Pope Synthotimus Ex Mortis, which starts

1023
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,000
with him explaining how he's the worst ranter of the church.

1024
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,360
Actually, if you listeners can make it all the way to the Fuck Peas end of this episode,

1025
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,360
whoa, my hat's off to you.

1026
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,460
Fantastic.

1027
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,560
He's testing, he's testing, he's testing.

1028
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:56,340
Yeah, well, everybody figured out what they're gonna be tuning their souls into for Bob.

1029
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:06,720
I've discovered over the years that I am probably X Day's worst ranter, so I've chosen not to

1030
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,280
rant anymore.

1031
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:12,080
But I don't do too bad with one-to-one conversations, you know?

1032
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,560
If I bump into you and we sit down and chat for a while, I think it goes pretty well.

1033
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,860
I do my best to praise Bob with every...

1034
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:19,420
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1035
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,420


1036
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,420


1037
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,420


1038
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,420


1039
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,420


1040
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,420


1041
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,420


1042
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,420


1043
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:19,420


1044
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,620
I've got toQuez.

1045
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,900
We just had a quote from X Day or I don't remember it.

1046
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,320
A man who just has to train without resorting to a stupid sweet nonsense.

1047
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,320


1048
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,260
I've had the honor to do it for one of the last ten years.

1049
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:32,260


1050
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:32,260


1051
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:32,260


1052
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:32,580
And I entered intoLet It Go Yeon Gray.

1053
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:33,640
Oh, my preach nowadays.

1054
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:33,960
Yeah.

1055
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,120
I'm here every Sunday and I trained this for a master who does the favor.

1056
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1057
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,000
But what I want to do is I'm gonna rap for Fr Yam.

1058
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,480
Okay.

1059
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,800
In the head of where she's from.

1060
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,700
Okay.

1061
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,400
And that leaves uh, another song, the PW, this next chorus which is 20 years old.

1062
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:49,400


1063
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,900
I never had to go to bed tonight

1064
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,500
I never had to sleep tonight

1065
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,500
I know I'm not the half-slack

1066
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,900
Yeah, but it makes me an ass

1067
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,540
Cause for you the half-slack

1068
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,560
Beats a hink-a-pink

1069
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,700
And it's a different story

1070
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,940
So to be the half-slack

1071
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,200
I know that's not a nice story, you know

1072
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,320
But if you want to

1073
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,440
Maybe try to be slow

1074
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,480
Maybe shut up as I go

1075
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,800
But I'm an inventive guy

1076
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,020
Trying to be strong

1077
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,460
I just think I'm thinking wrong

1078
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,020
I don't feel it here

1079
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,600
Fuck, you've got to stand in here

1080
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,220
For more fun

1081
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,120
Thank you, bye

1082
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,620
Thank you, bye

1083
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,920
Thank you, bye

1084
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,280
Thank you, bye

1085
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:51,280


1086
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,680
But I ain't got a thing

1087
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,240
But I ain't got a thing

1088
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,880
I know that these times

1089
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,560
Is really slow

1090
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,380
And you know I can't

1091
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,940
Feel the thrill

1092
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,040
But wait till the end

1093
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,280
And you can feel the thrill

1094
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,960
I've been feeling like floating

1095
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,920
Cutting from the half of my

1096
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,440
You can't see the full half of my

1097
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,600
I've been feeling like floating

1098
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,240
Cutting from the half of my

1099
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,560
I've been feeling like floating

1100
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:33,560


1101
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:33,560


1102
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:33,560


1103
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:33,560


1104
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:33,560


1105
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,680
So to be the half-slack

1106
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,000
Beats a hink-a-pink

1107
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,840
And you can feel the thrill

1108
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,660
But wait till the end

1109
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:51,500
I'm a little bit scared of the dark

1110
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,880
I'm a little bit scared of the dark

1111
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,680
I'm a little bit scared of the dark

1112
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,800
He's got it!

1113
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,860
Yeah, I'm scared

1114
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,660
It's really not that much

1115
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,100
I don't know his favorite name

1116
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:24,780
I don't know his favorite name

1117
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,820
Connie!

1118
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,200
Connie!

1119
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,120
I am not the only one, the only one

1120
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,180
Who needs that kind of applause

1121
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,700
I know where the ax really is

1122
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,280
And it's an internal-gut-SCHEISA!

1123
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,740
Can't think of a word I'm right with

1124
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,700
His thoughts

1125
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,500
I don't know where that lends itself

1126
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,000
But not even mine yet

1127
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,280
And that helps all of us

1128
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,640
That's why Christ settles where he settles

1129
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,220
He is not the only one that can afford it

1130
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,640
That's right!

1131
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,720
I'm gonna go ahead and get a couple of things for it.

1132
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,520
Uh, here's a little bit of shit.

1133
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,980
Now, you know what?

1134
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,000
Oh, you guys need a couple of nuggets?

1135
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,380
They can take the one and only.

1136
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,400
There's black pills on the button.

1137
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,420
I think I'll win it.

1138
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:37,600
...

1139
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,780
I won't mind beating your dicks.

1140
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:50,680
I'm gonna get you right with my success.

1141
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,080
I think I'll win it.

1142
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,080


1143
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,660
Or just we'll keep it too long?

1144
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,700
Will they punish me for that crime?

1145
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,780
...

1146
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:30,920
I'd like to sing a song that goes back to one of Philo's greatest pieces,

1147
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,480
Anal Fissure Tissue.

1148
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,960
Oh, I don't know if I got...

1149
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,500
You mean like butt-fucking the moonies?

1150
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,840
We can do that one too.

1151
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,020
Alright.

1152
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,660
Anal Fissure Tissue, huh?

1153
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,880
Anal Fissure Tissue, written by Philo Drummond.

1154
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,440
And Sterno.

1155
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,660
And Sterno.

1156
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,220
And Reverend Stang.

1157
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,140
And Reverend Stang.

1158
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,400
But I don't remember that one.

1159
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,380
I'll just fake it.

1160
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,240
Alright, so we're going to fake it.

1161
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,500
I think it's in the key of Q.

1162
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,260
I'll try to remember.

1163
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,720
You ready?

1164
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,460
One, two, three, go!

1165
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,380
Butt-fucking the moonies while they fixed him as four sliders in Mitch County.

1166
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:15,980
Long way.

1167
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,380
By the way, only to become son.

1168
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:19,800
Sterno.

1169
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,420
Suffering from the famous fissure tissues.

1170
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,880
Anal fissure tissues.

1171
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,820
And the worst part.

1172
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,940
Anal fissure tissues.

1173
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,240
Suffering and suffering.

1174
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,180
All day long he's suffering.

1175
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,820
He has loose anal fissure tissues.

1176
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,080
Fissure tissues.

1177
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,080
He has squat droppings.

1178
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,620
And a bucket of anal fissure tissues.

1179
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,380
Distilled with anal fissure tissues.

1180
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,720
Anal fissure tissues.

1181
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,400
Already half filled with the droppings and squat droppings.

1182
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,920
Poor Sion Oates.

1183
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,020
All he wanted was a piece of a meal.

1184
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:50,820
Anal fissure tissues.

1185
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,220
And instead, he has anal fissure top on his face.

1186
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,160
Okay, your turn.

1187
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,300
Anal fissure tissues.

1188
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,220
Anal fissure tissues.

1189
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,320
Anal fissure tissues.

1190
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,860
Anal Fissure, Fissure Tattooed disabilities.

1191
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,260
Anal.

1192
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,500
Fissure.

1193
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,240
Anal.

1194
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,480
Fissure.

1195
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,280
Anal.

1196
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,460
Fissure.

1197
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,060
Anal.

1198
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,020
Fissure, Fissure!

1199
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,800
You can do without it!

1200
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:25,240


1201
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,780
Fissure!

1202
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,620
You don't mean one!

1203
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:28,740
Anal!

1204
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,780
Fissure!

1205
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,180
Things too bad!

1206
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:32,700
Anal!

1207
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:11,320
You must just eat soft food. Eat lots of food.

1208
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,940
Thanks sir, he's 38% of the world.

1209
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,020
Daniel Anto, just name him.

1210
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,500
Please avoid giving it a half-ass.

1211
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:30,940
Daniel Bryant, I promise you that they will love it.

1212
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,260
You don't need them.

1213
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,100
I think this is a good song too.

1214
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,080
It's got a nice vibe.

1215
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,440
It's got a nice vibe.

1216
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,460
It's a good song.

1217
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,540
It's a good song.

1218
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,620
It's a good song.

1219
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,060
It's a good song.

1220
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:57,160
It's a good song.

1221
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,060
Oh God, we're eating a rock.

1222
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,600
Because you eat too much white bread.

1223
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,760
White bread.

1224
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,880
That's the cause of it, too much white bread.

1225
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:08,940
White bread.

1226
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,140
You need more fiber in your diet.

1227
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,520
All right, I'll kiss your tissue.

1228
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,460
You got to get rid of that stuff.

1229
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,300
It's no fun.

1230
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,600
Can I kiss you.

1231
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,320
Can I kiss you.

1232
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,760
I'm telling you, more fiber.

1233
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,460
It's no fun.

1234
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,220
It's a bummer.

1235
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,520
You won't like it.

1236
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,140
You won't like it, I promise.

1237
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,820
That was our great hit.

1238
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,640
Anil Fisher tissue.

1239
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:58,620
Written.

1240
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,700
It's no fun at all.

1241
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,280
It's no fun at all.

1242
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:08,100
Brothers and sisters, we will start music shortly as all the musicians gather up and get their things and parts.

1243
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,720
We'll play when we feel like it.

1244
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,220
Parts and order.

1245
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,000
But we do still have open mic and I do see you out there.

1246
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,720
And I'm sure people have things to say besides fuck peace.

1247
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,340
Oh, by the way, while I'm on that.

1248
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:24,040
There's a bit of something I need you guys to do for me because it needs to be recorded for posterity.

1249
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,440
So.

1250
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,440
When I I'm going to get you all to say on the count of three.

1251
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:34,100
Can everyone in the campground who is with an earshot of me say fuck peas.

1252
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,340
Ready?

1253
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,800
One, two, three.

1254
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,960
Fuck peas.

1255
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,720
Thank you, guys.

1256
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,920
That was freaking perfect.

1257
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,000
Awesome.

1258
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:46,640
Awesome.

1259
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,240
Now, let's do it one more time just in case staying didn't get a good recording.

1260
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:51,860
All right.

1261
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,600
Are you guys ready?

1262
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,140
You ready?

1263
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:54,380
One.

1264
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:55,120
Two.

1265
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,220
Three.

1266
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,200
Fuck peas.

1267
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,800
Yeah, fuck peas.

1268
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,260
So now we've got that out of the way.

1269
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,320
He does.

1270
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,440
There is also a request for side boob.

1271
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,860
And thank you, Stick.

1272
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,900
That's like full boob, though.

1273
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,520
You know, that's a little more than side boob.

1274
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,820
You and Eggplant showing your full boob.

1275
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,740
Stang could come up here, though.

1276
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,240
I'm sure he has something to say.

1277
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,480
I admit it was some practical joke which is misfired.
