1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
I'm fired up and ready to go.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,900
Well, but I'm...

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,920
I'm hearing you,

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,840
but I'm not hearing you on my tape recording.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,440
Oh, there we go.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,520
You know what it was, Dave?

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,540
That feels better, doesn't it?

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,600
Well, it feels like somebody

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,380
raspated a liquid all over

10
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,460
so many cuerpos.

11
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,080
I shoved it all the way in

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,780
is what I did.

13
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,580
It wasn't very far in.

14
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,620
You probably thought it was.

15
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:28,920
It was.

16
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,060
Well, that's what you say

17
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,380
when you're the bastard child of Satan

18
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,000
in Hades.

19
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,680
But I'm not.

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,240
You're not.

21
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,920
No, I'm the bastard son of Pappy and Mammy.

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,800
Only, I'm not a bastard.

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,640
No, not at all.

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,820
As far as we know.

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,500
Pappy and Pappy.

26
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,380
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,420
This portion of programming

29
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,580
is brought to you by

30
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,520
Bob's Steakhouse

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,300
on the corner of Hursuit and Flushing

32
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,260
in beautiful Stane, California.

33
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,540
Come on down to Bob's

34
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,600
and get a mouthful of meat

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,260
from the man himself.

36
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,920
If you'd like to make a reservation,

37
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,120
please call 1-800-555-13013.

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,360
Yeah, okay.

39
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll tell you what,

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,140
we're going to get into all of that.

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,760
Don't worry, man.

42
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,080
Don't worry.

43
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,760
You don't have no program.

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
Just relax.

45
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,780
When I say toilet paper,

46
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,280
that's when you come rolling out, okay?

47
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,960
Some of my friends

48
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,680
have prepared a song

49
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,380
that they desire you to hear.

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,560
And I would appreciate it

51
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,260
if you would listen to it.

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,540
Also, please play it for your friends.

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,660
And even after election day,

54
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,080
please run it off once in a while

55
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,560
to remind you that I am in Washington

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,120
and will be watching you.

57
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,280
I'm reaching out for your interest.

58
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,560
The song will now be sung

59
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,240
by the Lang and Glee Club.

60
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,600
Are you a vampire, Melvin Laird?

61
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,540
Are you a blank vampire?

62
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,140
Are you caught in the Transylvanian transvestite

63
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,600
time trap, Melvin Laird?

64
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,140
Honk, honk,

65
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,240
for the geese of Canada.

66
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,340
Quack, quack,

67
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,580
for the ducks of derision

68
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,640
late at night

69
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,620
when the moon is full.

70
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,860
Do you creep

71
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,940
through the crypt?

72
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,140
And blip from throat to throat,

73
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,560
Melvin Laird?

74
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,020
Cause I saw you grinning

75
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,140
with a drool a-dripping

76
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,740
on the TV screen

77
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,400
testifying with your vacant voice

78
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,820
for the ABM machine.

79
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,960
I could swear I saw two fangs

80
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,040
touching the microphone.

81
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,760
So I'm carrying my wafer.

82
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,780
I'm carrying my cross

83
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,640
just in case I find you

84
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,060
breathing down my neck.

85
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,720
In the silent halls

86
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,660
of Congress, Melvin Laird.

87
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,700
Are you a vampire, Melvin Laird?

88
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,540
Are you a blank vampire?

89
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,360
And it's starting with

90
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,080
verse one of chapter four.

91
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,360
It says,

92
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Dear friends,

93
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,620
do not believe every spirit,

94
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,040
but test the spirits

95
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,740
to see whether they are from God,

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,420
because many false prophets

97
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,840
have gone out into the world.

98
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,300
It is a quest.

99
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,140
It's a quest for Bob.

100
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,620
We're going to Bob

101
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,120
the entire Cleveland area tonight

102
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,100
yet again.

103
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,840
Yes!

104
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,480
Yes!

105
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:27,880
Yes!

106
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,940
We're Uber women

107
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,860
going into Kinko's

108
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,240
to make thousands of Bob faces.

109
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,800
Thousands and thousands

110
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,160
and thousands of Bob faces.

111
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,880
Billions upon billions.

112
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,400
And then we're going to scatter them.

113
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,820
Yay!

114
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,160
Unto the masses.

115
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,180
Unto the masses.

116
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,260
And first Timothy 4.1 says

117
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,500
that there are false prophets

118
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,520
that go around teaching doctrines of devils.

119
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,440
This is a doctrine

120
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,900
that I feel are the devil.

121
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,560
Second Chronicles 11, 14 to 15 says,

122
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,300
he says, don't be surprised

123
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,660
because the Satan will appear

124
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,120
as an angel.

125
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,220
He says, don't be surprised

126
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,220


127
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,740
as an angel of light.

128
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,320
I know you think, well,

129
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,180
it's just an innocent,

130
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,860
fun little holiday for kids

131
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,900
to go out and dress up.

132
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,020
Well, we need to, you know,

133
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,320
to really investigate

134
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,540
and find out what the origins

135
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,560
and we need to be honest

136
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,800
with ourself and say,

137
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,540
I'll now take a look around

138
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,820
and see what can be found.

139
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,320
A bicycle seat can be pretty neat.

140
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,300
An electric toothbrush

141
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,540
will give you a rush.

142
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,800
A handy cucumber is a fine number.

143
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,820
A dozen drumsticks

144
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,860
will make you tick.

145
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,820
And don't forget,

146
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,900
we told you so.

147
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,760
Get loose.

148
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,900
Float juice.

149
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,120
Get loose.

150
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,120


151
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,120


152
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,120


153
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,120


154
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,120


155
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,160
The best sex can be found at home.

156
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,040
All by yourself.

157
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,120
Sitting alone.

158
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:32,980
Get loose.

159
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,060
Float juice.

160
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,540
You got ten fingers,

161
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,400
use them, baby.

162
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,620
Optical illusion game?

163
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,160
Right here.

164
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,240
Ah.

165
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,060
Uh-huh.

166
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,320
Chicka-pow-pow.

167
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,260
Up to the mountains,

168
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,520
click, click, click.

169
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
Down to the trees,

170
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,420
is it, is it Nick?

171
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,560
Ho, ho, ho, I will po.

172
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,980
Ho, ho, ho, I will glow.

173
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,300
Weemaw-maw made up a song.

174
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,560
Reindeer keep falling on my roof.

175
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,040
And I'm gonna take some pictures

176
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,420
and then I'll have proof.

177
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,720
Reindeer on the roof.

178
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,880
Weemaw, you're crazy.

179
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,260
Weemaw, you're crazy.

180
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,340
That song is amazing.

181
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,840
Reindeer keep falling on my head.

182
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,080
They keep falling.

183
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,120
You are crazy, D-Dawg.

184
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Because I'm crazy.

185
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,080
Because I'm Bob.

186
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,660
Stop, that is terrible singing.

187
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,440
And I can always be a slob.

188
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,500
You are the worst singer ever.

189
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,560
That is super doofy.

190
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,860
Hey, I am the host of this show.

191
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,320
You are doofy.

192
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,220
Yeah, that's why I'm the host of this show.

193
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Yeah, that's probably why.

194
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,180
Friends, welcome to Hour of Slack,

195
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,500
number 1,600 and something.

196
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,660
Yeah, let's start singing.

197
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,580
Everybody dance now.

198
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:04,640
And we have my grandson, Elias, as a guest today.

199
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,740
Everybody dance now.

200
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,160
Elias, what have your parents told you about Bob?

201
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,800
Bob?

202
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,640
Yeah, what do you know about Bob?

203
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,620
Well, he's your company.

204
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,460
He looks crazy.

205
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,260
He's a UFO.

206
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,840
And he likes carrots.

207
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,520
He likes carrots?

208
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,500
Did they tell you Bob likes carrots?

209
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,560
Everybody dance now.

210
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,680
That was so they could get you to eat carrots.

211
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,340
Come on, Elias, eat your carrots.

212
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Bob loves carrots.

213
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,300
Not so sure about peas, though.

214
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,580
That's where he gets his mighty super strength, from carrots.

215
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,500
Yeah, I like carrots.

216
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,680
I like carrots and carrots.

217
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,120
Would you eat a baby carrot?

218
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,500
That would be disgusting.

219
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
It's just a baby.

220
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,700
His whole life is ahead of it.

221
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,660
No, that would be disgusting.

222
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,740
You eat baby.

223
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,180
I've seen you eat baby carrots.

224
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,320
No.

225
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,140
They're so young and tender.

226
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,580
What do you mean the eyes and the nose?

227
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,100
They're like young.

228
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,000
Especially the drool.

229
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,400
The drool?

230
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,480
Mm-hmm.

231
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,580
You like the drool?

232
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,820
What are you?

233
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,100
Like the fruit stand that turns into a filling station.

234
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,500
But the footprints and signs from the past are everywhere.

235
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:35,500
They've been fighting over this land ever since the first Spanish missionary showed the Indians the benefits of religion, horses, and a few years of forced labor.

236
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,180
But the Indians had it right all along.

237
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,740
They respected ghosts.

238
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,680
Memories are like that, as unpredictable as nitro, and you never know what's going to set one off.

239
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,860
Like the clues that keep you on the right track are never where you look for them.

240
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,740
They fall out of the pocket of somebody else's suit you pick up at the cleaners.

241
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,460
They're in the tune you can't stop humming that you never heard in your life.

242
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,060
They're at the other end of the wrong number you dial in the middle of the night.

243
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,280
The signs are in all those old familiar places you only think you've never been before.

244
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:24,300
But you get used to seeing them out of the corner of your eye, and you end up tripping over the ones that are right in front of you.

245
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,940
We all sugarcoat this because this isn't the right time to base your mindset regarding our遠 objet.

246
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,380
Here's another ballet eğmincí song.

247
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,920
This guy has a gurwaysh uyh- governan ME of horny ànt�

248
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:54,840
dans el océán

249
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,340
What are you doing, Dad?

250
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,020
I'm developing a compound that, when applied to the soles of shoes,

251
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,940
keeps gum from sticking to them.

252
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,200
What a wonderful gift to mankind.

253
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,480
I'm kind.

254
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,460
Con, what are you going to do today?

255
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm very busy.

256
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,440
After I rake a perfect crosshatch pattern in the pea gravel in the driveway,

257
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,540
I'm going to change the air in the spare tire of the station wagon.

258
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,360
I'd better make some sandwiches.

259
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,280
I sound regular.

260
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,580
Here, I'll turn off the...

261
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,280
Data.

262
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,620
Mm-hmm.

263
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,560
Yes.

264
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,760
Elias.

265
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,880
Nothing.

266
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,980
Yes, this is a special hour of Slack,

267
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,140
recorded here at Tarzan's Rite Aid Station,

268
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,700
with...

269
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,120
Elias, our guest, our special guest.

270
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,760
He's running his own mic volume control.

271
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
He keeps it up pretty hot.

272
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,240
Yeah, because I like it.

273
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,720
Yeah, because you like it.

274
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,480
Because I can scream.

275
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,060
When it's super high, I can scream, and it'll be like this.

276
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,580
Everybody dance now.

277
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,340
Or you can whisper.

278
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,020
Okay.

279
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,920
You're going to make me deafer.

280
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,620
Everybody dance now.

281
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,800
Chicka-chicka-boom-boom.

282
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,680
Chicka-chicka-boom.

283
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,980
Chicka-chicka-boom-boom.

284
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,420
Stop that nonsense.

285
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,520
That's called over-modulating, Elias, when you turn it up too high.

286
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,180
Everybody dance now.

287
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,700
Nice.

288
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,400
Look, I'm whispering.

289
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Everybody dance now.

290
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,620
Everybody dance now.

291
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,440
Be quiet.

292
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,920
Somebody might be listening.

293
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,440
Shh.

294
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,360
Humans.

295
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,620
There's humans all around.

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,600
Feedback.

297
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,180
There's feedback all around.

298
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,600
Oh, yes, dear friends.

299
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,040
The Green Boys were here at Stang Ranch this weekend.

300
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,900
And, oh, we had so much fun.

301
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,160
And I feel real good, which is not bad, considering that.

302
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,120
This time last week, I was on my back hooked up.

303
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,940
I was on my back hooked up to machines that go ding,

304
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,260
looking at a screen showing a mess of quivering spaghetti,

305
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,560
which was my actual heart,

306
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,460
through which a Dr. Simpson was snaking a tiny tube up from my groin

307
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,200
to attach a little metal mesh tunnel or stent,

308
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,080
where there had just been a seriously clogged little section of artery,

309
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,540
90% obstructed.

310
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,700
Jeepers.

311
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,100
No wonder it hurt.

312
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,940
It hurt so much.

313
00:11:54,340 --> 00:12:00,460
But the rest of my heart tubes looked fine, and my cholesterol level was normal.

314
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,000
So go figure.

315
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,180
What I want to know is when do I get to lie in a bed, being flown around in a helicopter,

316
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:15,160
with a beautiful view, really high on morphine, but not while having a heart attack?

317
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,280
Because that would be fun.

318
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,960
It was sort of funny while having the heart attack, which the doctor described as a, quote,

319
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,500
PG-rated heart attack that didn't do much damage.

320
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,920
And now I have to take four pills a day for a year.

321
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:40,040
And this happened right after bragging on the internet that I wasn't on any medication.

322
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,060
Pride cometh before a fall, my friends.

323
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,840
So that's why we had a rerun last week.

324
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,080
And one reason why I'm here.

325
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,080


326
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,820
Why we had my two grandkids here this week.

327
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,420
Chick, Chicka, Boom, Boom.

328
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,740
Chick, Chicka, Boom, Boom.

329
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,980
Chick, Chicka, Boom, Boom.

330
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,120
Chick, Chicka, Boom, Boom.

331
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,800
Uh, Elias discovers feedback.

332
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,440
That ought to recharge the hearing aid batteries.

333
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,820
The awfulest noise in the world.

334
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,920
Makes my teeth hurt.

335
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,480
Ow!

336
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,080
He's hurting my teeth!

337
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,960
No, it's in my brain making stuff!

338
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,160
My fillings hurt!

339
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,360
My fillings!

340
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,520
My fillings!

341
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:34,740


342
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
I'm ready to get you some love!

343
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,900
Boom.

344
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,320
Boom.

345
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,620
Boom.

346
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,880
Boom.

347
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,480


348
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,920
Bleh!

349
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:52,920


350
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,780
Bleh!

351
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,480
Bleh!

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,220
This show makes listeners sick.

353
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,320
But it makes the participants even sicker.

354
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,920
What?

355
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,980
Poor Elias.

356
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,740
The show is making Elias sick.

357
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,520
In fact, I don't feel so good myself.

358
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,080
Bleh!

359
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:08,940
Bleh!

360
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,120
Bleh!

361
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,600
Bleh!

362
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,580
Bleh!

363
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:11,940


364
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,440
Bleh!

365
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,120
Bleh!

366
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,140
Bleh!

367
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,200
Bleh!

368
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,200


369
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,200


370
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:13,500


371
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,120


372
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,120


373
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,520
Bleh!

374
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,160
Bleh!

375
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,500
Bleh!

376
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,480
How many unacceptable promises have I had these last months?

377
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,720
I just don't believe you.

378
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,560
Hey, 장구� inscreсь Ex olhar,

379
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,500
Why are you희

380
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,440
What?

381
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,420
How come this girlhat did that?

382
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,080
Sir, will you explain Bob?

383
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,900
Bob!

384
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,580
I'm glad you asked that.

385
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,880
But his reputation!

386
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
You're heading for trouble.

387
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,400
Now boys, come with me.

388
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,020
Goodbye Fernanda Nende.

389
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,060
Lemur.

390
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,880
Princess Wee is trying to troll.

391
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,400
Princess Wee is gonna troll?

392
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,880
The boy.

393
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,720
The boy?

394
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,800
I have an eyeball.

395
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,100
An extra eye.

396
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,040
You are creepy, dude.

397
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,600
It's called my third eye.

398
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,900
And I have an extra nostril behind my nose.

399
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,320
Can you see it?

400
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,540
And I have a third ear inside my mouth.

401
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,660
But he's disgusting!

402
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,060
And I have a ninth kidney, which you can't see it.

403
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,200
Bob?

404
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Oh my!

405
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,660
Bob?

406
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,400
Oh my!

407
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,360
I'll tell ya!

408
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,960
Bob?

409
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,260
Bob?

410
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,460
Of course!

411
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,600
Don't!

412
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,000
Don't!

413
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,400
Don't!

414
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,540
Don't!

415
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,160
Bob?

416
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:55,820
Gosh!

417
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,580
Yeah, it'd be good!

418
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,320
Oh!

419
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,380
Bob?

420
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,060
Ah!

421
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,880
Five!

422
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,680
Bob?

423
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,120
Father!

424
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,500
And with all this crazy action going on, it looks like we're gonna be moving to Texas

425
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,280
permanently, but not for several summers.

426
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,300
Partly due to X Day and Starwood.

427
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,400
And, uh...

428
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,860
After that, I guess I'll just have to drive to Ohio like everybody else.

429
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,340
Cause, you know, there's no way we're gonna miss X Day and Starwood.

430
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,680
Starwood?

431
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,520
That's where men wear skirts and girls wear no shirts.

432
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,580
So we're not gonna miss that.

433
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:42,560
Oh, speaking of which, this music in the background is by Mayan Ruins, who always play at Starwood.

434
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,300
So, uh...

435
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:53,380
Anyway, what better place than Stang Ranch, friends, since the nearest town happens to

436
00:16:53,380 --> 00:17:00,040
be fabled, shadowed, eldritch Glen Rose, Texas.

437
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,660
Which, it turns out, even more than I knew, is the perfect place for the Church of the

438
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,320
Subgenius.

439
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,940
Cause we're not the first weird cult for Glen Rose, Texas.

440
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,280
In fact, I've been reading this history book.

441
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,480
About Glen Rose.

442
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,840
By Gene Fowler and the Somerville County Historical Commission.

443
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:31,800
And it turns out that a hundred years ago, this little town was a mecca of crackpots, charlatans, quacks and cult leaders.

444
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:38,440
And a center for illegal drug manufacture, prostitution and pseudoscience.

445
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Even more so than now!

446
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,780
Uh...

447
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,260
Ever since my parents moved here, I've been in the middle of the world.

448
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:55,260
And I've always knew that people used to come here, back in the day, for the healing mineral waters in the sanitariums, as they called them.

449
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,740
And the river going through town is lined with these wonderful old buildings that are now hotels and antique malls.

450
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,540
But they used to be, quote, sanitariums.

451
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:15,240
I didn't really know what that meant back then, but today I was reading through that old book and I learned a whole lot more.

452
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,260
This town was like the Sedona of its day.

453
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,300
It was a new age hotbed,

454
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,960
partly because it had hot springs or mineral waters.

455
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,260
And what they meant by that was the hideously foul sulfurous groundwater

456
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,280
that most people spend a lot of money to filter out these days.

457
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
Well water, right?

458
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,800
Well water isn't always pure, you know.

459
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,480
Often it's horribly tainted stuff that smells like rotten eggs.

460
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,960
And that crap is what the pinks were paying extra for to drink and bathe in.

461
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,520
Like I say, it was kind of a new age fad.

462
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,140
And I mean, we get city water now.

463
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,560
But we used to have well water.

464
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,500
There's a pump 300 feet below my house that pulls water from the same aquifer

465
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,160
those rich people were paying extra for.

466
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,220
And we have free water.

467
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,560
We have four machines to filter out all the iron, sulfur, microorganisms, and everything.

468
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,820
But yeah, rich idiots paid extra and made themselves sick with disgusting chemicals

469
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,080
that we spend extra to remove.

470
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:41,640
But I guess history proves that you can fool well, well, at least almost half the people all the time.

471
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,540
Anyway,

472
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:44,660


473
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:52,100
These sanitarium doctors were practicing, they weren't just selling you on soaking in the poisonous water.

474
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:02,640
They were practicing magnetic healing, popularized by the great crackpot Franz Mesmer in the olden days.

475
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:10,980
They were locally known as rubbing doctors because they used massage, hypnosis, magnets,

476
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,840
and especially these marvelous new healing inventions called vibrators,

477
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:26,820
which when a learned doctor applied them to certain parts of a woman's body in certain trained expert ways,

478
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:34,660
they could fairly quickly cure a woman of hysteria, as they called it in those days, or depression,

479
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,060
especially with regular repeated treatments.

480
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,420
And apparently,

481
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,520
very few husbands were schooled in those mysterious hysteria cures back then.

482
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,520
And I've learned so much sordid history.

483
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,560
There was a, I had, let's see, okay, I'm gonna read from this book a little bit

484
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,040
about my favorite Glen Rose Maverick folk healer.

485
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,100
Actually, there are two of them that were brothers.

486
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,440
Doctor, and this is back in the 1890s.

487
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:18,820
Doctor R.G. Milling, Sr., a part Cherokee magnetic healer known as the Indian Adept,

488
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:26,620
and the long-haired doctor, added therapeutic suggestion to his massage and faith healing treatments

489
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:35,820
after witnessing a, quote, Hindu hypnotist, unquote, demonstrate his art in Glen Rose in the 1890s.

490
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,160
Though R.G. Sr. practiced elsewhere,

491
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,960
younger brother G.R.,

492
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,920
R.G. Milling, shown here,

493
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,740
and he is a dapper gent with long, dark hair,

494
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,900
set up shop in Glen Rose in 1911.

495
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,360
The sheriff was a frequent visitor to G.R.'s sanitarium,

496
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,980
but not for treatment.

497
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,920
Charges lodged against the independent spirited healer

498
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,380
ranged from driving his Hupmobile down Barnard Street

499
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,960
in excess of the 18 miles,

500
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,380
and a mile per hour speed limit,

501
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,480
to disturbing a religious congregation.

502
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:22,980
Which makes me imagine, you know, him, this Indian healer, long-haired doctor, hypnotist,

503
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,760
running into the Baptist church and, you know, trying to cast in the money changers out of the temple,

504
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,680
and ranting, and, well, I like to think that, anyway.

505
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,980
G.R. was, which also stands for Glen Rose, G.R. Milling,

506
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,960
was also nabbed for toting a bell.

507
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,040
He was also nabbed for using a pistol in town,

508
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,880
which, by the way, is now completely legal,

509
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,960
and once for unlawfully shooting a gun across a public road.

510
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,440
They still frown on that.

511
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,340
A few cases involved his going on a bender,

512
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,460
and another alleged the doctor had threatened to take a life.

513
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,720
In September 1914, he was killed near the courthouse

514
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,200
by blasts from a double-barreled shotgun,

515
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,940
possibly by the irate husband of a female priest.

516
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:10,940


517
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,260
The doctor was a very tragic patient.

518
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,020
The fact that magnetic healers were sometimes called Rubbin' doctors

519
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,920
might explain the act of tragic passion.

520
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,720
And, yeah, I read elsewhere that the townsfolk raised the money

521
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,540
for the bail of the guy who shot Milling very, very quickly.

522
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,280
Now, there was a Dr. Snyder who had the biggest sanitarium.

523
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,940
His biographer described him as, quote,

524
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,140
a little wizard and a real human X-ray, unquote,

525
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,100
with clairvoyant powers.

526
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,540
The special advantage he has over the regular MD,

527
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,120
or even specialists, is his ability to read the patient's mind.

528
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,380
And he had a great clinic right up against the Paluxy River.

529
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,800
One day he kicked all his patients out after learning

530
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,280
they had been slipping across the river to see

531
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,880
a fortune teller explaining that he could not heal

532
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,240
under such, quote, mental cross-currents, unquote.

533
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,540
Snyder's patients sat in chairs for the magnetic treatment

534
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,700
while the wizard or one of his staff healers

535
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,780
rubbed away illness with firm motions

536
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,980
that caused a finger snap at the end of each stroke.

537
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,400
So it was like,

538
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,760
out, bad pain.

539
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,260
Out, bad pain.

540
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,820
Something like that, I guess.

541
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Sounds great.

542
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,940
He had a wondrous ability to restore sight.

543
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,720
Although here's a humorous anecdote.

544
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,700
Even legendary Texas rancher Charles Goodnight

545
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,080
visited the sanitarium in the 1920s seeking help for his eyes.

546
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,600
One old farmer, seeing the ostrich cavort about,

547
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,600
shouted,

548
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,740
That bird is as big as a bird!

549
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,020
It's as big as a cow!

550
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,000
Those fellers have ruined my eyes!

551
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,040
In addition to Judy the ostrich,

552
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,480
the ground housed a peacock, a baby alligator,

553
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,340
wolves, and other animals.

554
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,600
It just houses tourists now.

555
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,320
I was outside there playing Pokemon Go

556
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,680
just a couple hours ago.

557
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,840
Another noted Texan who sought the Snyder treatment,

558
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,260
controversial preacher J. Frank Norris,

559
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,940
stayed at Snyder's while in Glen Rose

560
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,980
for a tent revival.

561
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,860
Quote,

562
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,880
In 10 minutes conference,

563
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,120
he reported the minister known as the Texas Tornado,

564
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,780
not to be confused with the late wrestler,

565
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,460
the Texas Tornado, Von Erich.

566
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,460
In 10 minutes conference,

567
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,620
he gave me information worth $10,000.

568
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,700
He took my appendix out of my head.

569
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,960
For you see, I thought I had it.

570
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:07,960


571
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:07,960


572
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,100
I had a bad appendix,

573
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,380
although operated on for appendicitis some years ago.

574
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
Snyder told me there was only a stub left.

575
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,940
Consequently, my appendicitis was only in my head.

576
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,440
And he took it out.

577
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
I guess it worked.

578
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,340
So, yeah, those old,

579
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,440
the old buildings covered with beautiful petrified wood brick,

580
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,100
are all over town with non-healers living in them now.

581
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,980
Now, there's another type of healing going on in Glen Rose

582
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,180
during Prohibition called bootlegging.

583
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,020
And this area was the moonshine capital of Texas.

584
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,200
And in fact, we have a couple of areas on Stang Ranch,

585
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,880
which I'm pretty certain now are the sites of old stills.

586
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,420
There's, we call one of them the haunted still grottoes.

587
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,260
And the other place is called Corn Squeezing Corner,

588
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,380
where he found thousands of rusty barrel hoots

589
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,740
and bootlegging equipment.

590
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,480
Anyway, there's also haunted houses in town.

591
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,240
Actually, haunted houses of prostitution,

592
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,680
to be specific.

593
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,600
They're beautiful old abandoned petrified wood places,

594
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,860
as seen on my YouTube channel.

595
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,420
And they're full of the ghosts of,

596
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,570
of ancient hookers and johns.

597
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,870
So these weren't just honky tonks.

598
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,010
One thing they didn't mention in the history books

599
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,610
is the Ku Klux Klan,

600
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,870
but I think that was going on here.

601
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,910
Anyway, all this made me add a name

602
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,070
to our roadside attraction.

603
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:01,030
You know, we are in the process of building

604
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,610
a subgenius roadside attraction.

605
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,570
It is very much going to be an attraction

606
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,250
in competition with the Creation Evidence Museum

607
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,450
down the road.

608
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,570
It's going to be called now,

609
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,810
we've changed the name to

610
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:19,310
the Destructionist Evidences Museum and Sanitarium.

611
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,310
Okay, and friends, it's coming along pretty well.

612
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:27,310
We've, we have ex, we moved the devil skeleton

613
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,150
and the Adam and Eve skeletons over,

614
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,830
so that, over to a concrete slab

615
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,990
so we can display them.

616
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,630
And, you'll see, there's all kinds of stuff coming along.

617
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,590
Now, a couple of weeks ago,

618
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,830
we went to the local Creation Evidence Museum, finally.

619
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,390
It's been here for like 25 years, maybe longer.

620
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,910
And its proprietor,

621
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,150
quote, doctor, unquote, Carl Baugh,

622
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:04,510
has been hunting yeti tracks out here for a long time.

623
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,850
In fact, he even,

624
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,150
talked my dad into letting,

625
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,850
getting my brother to help him remove

626
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,070
one of our dinosaur tracks.

627
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,690
And I think I may have seen it in his museum.

628
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,350
Uh, which has some beautifully crafted elements

629
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,590
right next to laughably inappropriate fakes

630
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,730
of near bull dot of badness.

631
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,710
There's some really good, valuable, real fossils

632
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,470
right next to the most,

633
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,630
most homemade looking,

634
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,030
baloney evidence you ever saw.

635
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,850
For instance, you can see the footprints of humans

636
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,530
superimposed with the footprints of dinosaurs,

637
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,990
as if they were made right at the same time.

638
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,270
And, indeed, Dr. Baugh says they were made,

639
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,630
they were made when the dinosaurs and the people were

640
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,570
fleeing the flood of Noah.

641
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,230
Which is when, uh,

642
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,310
all fossils were formed.

643
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,390
Five or six thousand years ago.

644
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,410
I don't know their exact, uh, dating.

645
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,130
Although there's gorgeous, huge,

646
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,410
wall-sized kook diagrams

647
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,450
all over this museum,

648
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,050
this Creation Evidence Museum,

649
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,470
with great artwork on par with any Jehovah's Witness pamphlet.

650
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,370
And believe me, the Jehovah's Witness set the standard

651
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,290
at this kind of thing.

652
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,150
Uh, he's got a 25-foot long replica,

653
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,830
of Noah's Ark,

654
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,770
with, and, and he very carefully stocked it with,

655
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,370
like, there'll be one room with

656
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,410
a boy and girl, uh, sheep,

657
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,490
and a boy and girl triceratops.

658
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,750
And another little room of the Ark with a,

659
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,690
uh, a male and female lion,

660
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,710
and a male and female moronodon.

661
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,370
You know, and, uh, all portrayed by

662
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,630
the good kind of hand-painted dinosaur toys

663
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,210
from Safari Limited, not the cheap Chinese junk.

664
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,010
The Noah's Ark looks great.

665
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,690
And his fossils look great,

666
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,550
but there's all these, uh, plaques and things

667
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,310
insisting that the fossils

668
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,910
all were made in a matter of hours.

669
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,370
Not over a period of thousands or millions of years,

670
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,210
but in a matter of hours or days

671
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,610
immediately following the deluge of the Bible.

672
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,110
And that was when

673
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,750
the earliest race of men,

674
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,090
which Dr. Baugh has taken upon himself to name,

675
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,830
Homo Baugh Anthropus.

676
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,030
Yes, he walked with his sandals

677
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,730
along the Pilexi River banks,

678
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,290
just alongside the dinosaurs.

679
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,330
And, uh, you know, they, a lot of,

680
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,130
I guess they, I guess they had to die,

681
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,790
and the water crushed all the dinosaur bones

682
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,630
and tracks and sand

683
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:09,070
and turned them into different minerals

684
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,070
in a matter of just a few hours.

685
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,870
And this should be obvious to any...

686
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,510
Christian.

687
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,690
But the Creation Evidence Museum

688
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,130
has some really surreal additions

689
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,890
that have nothing at all to do with the Bible

690
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,570
or dinosaurs or Noah's Ark

691
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,770
or giant man tracks in the fossil rock.

692
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,090
For instance, there is an excellent

693
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,610
eight-foot-tall sculpture of Tom Landry,

694
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,790
the former Dallas Cowboys coach,

695
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,370
towering over the figure next to it,

696
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,750
which is a plain ordinary pink boy store mannequin

697
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,650
dressed in an Indian headdress.

698
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,370
Okay.

699
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:01,590
A half-size Indian next to a giant white man

700
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,770
who's a famous Christian.

701
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,570
Anyway, we came away from the Creation Evidence Museum

702
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,450
feeling that we're surrounded by cavemen

703
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:19,350
who are pretending that they are studying cavemen.

704
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:25,370
And hence our wonderful, uh, attractions

705
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,630
our roadside attraction,

706
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,990
Destructionist Evidence Museum, and so forth,

707
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,710
which we are constructing here

708
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,730
just outside of Glen Rose, Texas.

709
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,830
It's on the other side of town from the other attractions.

710
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,470
So, as I've mentioned before on the show,

711
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:47,990
we have Jackalope and Longhorn Armadillo Petting Zoo,

712
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,410
ghost dinosaur tracks,

713
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,910
fossil skeletons of Adam and Eve.

714
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,350
Actually, they're not.

715
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,350


716
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,630
Their name was Steve and Eve,

717
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:03,150
but, you know, to attract the tourists,

718
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,330
we'll say it's Adam and Eve.

719
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,310
Same difference.

720
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,870
The ghost dinosaur tracks, did I mention those?

721
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,330
A devil skeleton, an alien skeleton,

722
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,070
the remains of Noah's Ark where it sank.

723
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,810
And you can see all this stuff for five bucks

724
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,330
if you visit the Destructionist Evidence Museum

725
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,330
once we get it open.

726
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,010
Do you dare to turn back and see the thing?

727
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,610
Or the man-eating chicken?

728
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,230
Anyway, that's all coming along.

729
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,110
And another good reason to be here

730
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,810
is that my grandsons and my daughter and her husband

731
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,530
and my son and his wife

732
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,770
all live in Dallas only a couple hours away,

733
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,510
and they get to come visit us all the time.

734
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,110
Hey, Luscious Pooh!

735
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,290
See, he won't play unless he can control the whole world.

736
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,150
That's why I think he's gonna grow up to be a super villain.

737
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,350
Super hero.

738
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,470
He is a super villain in the making.

739
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,070
I wanna scream into that one, too.

740
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,070
No screaming.

741
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:04,290


742
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:05,570
Bye!

743
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,650
Screaming only at X Day, not in the studio.

744
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,350
Not in the studio.

745
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,750
If you wanna scream, you have to come to X Day.

746
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,090
No, leave those things alone.

747
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,390
He is like a control freak, and so are you.

748
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,410
Everybody's a control freak except me.

749
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,090
That's why I should be in control.

750
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,190
Because I'm a control master.

751
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:27,950
Alexander!

752
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,450
Not control freakazoid like my family.

753
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,850
Alexander, come be on the show.

754
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:35,410
Yay!

755
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,410
Alexander!

756
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,990
Do you know what I'm talking about?

757
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,010
Alexander, you know?

758
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:39,770
Do you remember this?

759
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,210
You got it from your stocking.

760
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,490
Whenever you talk, it goes into our headphones.

761
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,690
Did I?

762
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,410
I thought this was a skeleton.

763
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,510
But it's not.

764
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,030
You're welcome.

765
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,230
You've noticed I've been...

766
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,290
I can't believe it.

767
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,710
Have you noticed this skeleton all over the house?

768
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,130
You're the craziest brother ever.

769
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:00,670
What?

770
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,570
Have you noticed that there are skeletons all over this house?

771
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:05,390
No.

772
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,010
This is skeleton house, a fossil house.

773
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:08,490
Wow.

774
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,110
Hey.

775
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,910
I always thought this face was a skeleton.

776
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,930
It is.

777
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,030
That's a skull candy.

778
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,730
Oh no, it's not.

779
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,770
It's Edgar Allan Poe.

780
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,610
That's the great poet.

781
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,270
Edgar Allan Poe.

782
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,770
That's where they came up with the name.

783
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,290
Poe.

784
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:24,650
That's where they came up with the name.

785
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:24,650


786
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,870
They named poets.

787
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,290
What does the fox say?

788
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,410
They said, hey man, did you write a poem?

789
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,830
You really Poe'd it.

790
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,350
Hey, I'm going to write a poem.

791
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,250
I'll Poe it.

792
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,010
And that's how poems came to be.

793
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,750
Did you know that?

794
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,910
God almighty.

795
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:53,930
You know, it is challenging to do shows with six-year-old evil geniuses and eight-year-old

796
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,910
saintly geniuses.

797
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,930
What characters they are.

798
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,710
Okay.

799
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,790
It's the hour of snack now.

800
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,890
Ta-da.

801
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,910
With music.

802
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,450
Then I'll take that back to you.

803
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,490
So, we are going to be joined by the doofy Dee-Daw.

804
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,430
That's me.

805
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,470
And the crazy Alexander.

806
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,610
Yeah, he's definitely crazy.

807
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,350
But there's only one thing we have to worry about.

808
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,910
The time in King's Castle.

809
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


810
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


811
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


812
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


813
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


814
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


815
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


816
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


817
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


818
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


819
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


820
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


821
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


822
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


823
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


824
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


825
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,910


826
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,610
The time in King's Castle.

827
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:24,750
Okay.

828
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,190
We're doing the hour of snack now again.

829
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,950
I have two guests.

830
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:30,970
Elias and Alexander.

831
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:31,590
Hold on.

832
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,090
Stop the movie.

833
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,670
Stop the movie.

834
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,150
We need a press.

835
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,230
We didn't restart.

836
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:36,790
Okay.

837
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,410
We have to restart.

838
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,030
So.

839
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,330
Okay.

840
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,370
Take 190.

841
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,410
Action.

842
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:49,450
Since now you don't know what just happened, we are going to be joined by the doofy Dee-Daw.

843
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:50,750
That's me.

844
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,810
And the Alexander.

845
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:53,910
So, we are going to do the hour of snack.

846
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:53,910


847
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:59,970
We're going to be making a movie that's going to be Monster Hunter.

848
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,870
Data talk.

849
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,010
Monster Hunter.

850
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,150
We're making a movie?

851
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:05,430
Data talk.

852
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,270
Who's going to play the monster?

853
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,990
I will.

854
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,590
No.

855
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,450
I will.

856
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,110
I'm playing the monster.

857
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,150
My plan worked.

858
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,890
My evil plan worked.

859
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,430
I will.

860
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,850
My evil plan worked to get them fighting against each other.

861
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,070
I'm going to be the monster.

862
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,090
Let's start.

863
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:25,770
Oh, yay.

864
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,050
What's Bob going to do?

865
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,830
He's going to be the floor.

866
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,850
The floor.

867
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,650
Okay, Bob will be the floor in this Monster Hunter movie.

868
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,110
He often shows up in strange roles.

869
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,690
Yeah, he's a...

870
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:42,670
Things like floors and shower curtains and washing machines.

871
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,350
Maybe he'll get killed by...

872
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,530
I saw Bob on TV last night and he was playing a chair.

873
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:49,830
Maybe he'll...

874
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:50,930
Maybe.

875
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,930
Could we start the movie now?

876
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,470
Maybe.

877
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,750
Maybe.

878
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,190
Hi, friends.

879
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:59,330
Welcome to Hour of Slime number 10,590,000.

880
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,470
Starring Elias and Alex.

881
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,390
No, that's too high.

882
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,090
That's too high.

883
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,370
It needs to be the...

884
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:10,330
They're here to talk about everything except Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subterranean.

885
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,330
Because I know everything about that and they know everything else.

886
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,610
Bob is dead in the bathtub.

887
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:16,730
What?

888
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,190
I heard that.

889
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,750
I know you heard it.

890
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,190
You said Bob is dead in the bathtub.

891
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,930
Did you say Bob is dead?

892
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,130
No, I said Bob is dead in the bathtub.

893
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,830
Yes, friend, I can bathe in Bob.

894
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,970
Now Bob is dead in the car.

895
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,550
What?

896
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,330
Who's driving it?

897
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,470
My most vivid recollection of Bob was on the ground outside.

898
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,290
I said, excuse me, Bob.

899
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,130
He said, I'm gonna let you die.

900
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,530
I've always thought that Bob was a lonely outcast with that smile.

901
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,390
I love Bob's death.

902
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,710
Why do you have to sit away about it at home?

903
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,050
I love Bob.

904
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,590
I understand.

905
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,330
Although he doesn't have to resort to using ropes.

906
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,570
All he has to do is look at them and they do what he wants.

907
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,310
He's the only one that they'll obey like that.

908
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,870
But there's kind of a fad going on.

909
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,650
I think it started, somebody in Oregon started it,

910
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,930
but it, oh, it's spread all across the country.

911
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:02,870
Goat yoga.

912
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,210
And this is not a joke.

913
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,930
People who need relaxation

914
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,810
go to a place,

915
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:12,770
where there are goats,

916
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,470
and they let the goats walk on them.

917
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,410
Actually, it's baby goats that walk on you.

918
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,190
Because the big ones will probably urinate on you.

919
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,870
The little ones might too,

920
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,550
but it's not nearly as stinky.

921
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:31,810
And my brother was doing this two or three years ago.

922
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,770
He'd invite people to let these,

923
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,390
he'd get down on his hands and knees,

924
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,830
and the little baby goats would spring onto his back

925
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,530
and walk around.

926
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,730
And he'd kind of slide down

927
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,630
on his belly and let them walk back and forth on his back.

928
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,630
And it feels real good.

929
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,330
I've done it.

930
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:53,230
It does feel great to have baby goats tread upon your back.

931
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,530
There's no question about that.

932
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,930
I read today some people calling it the latest

933
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,990
in new age, charlatan idiocy.

934
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:08,410
But in fact, it does feel really good.

935
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,710
I guess you could dress up the yokes.

936
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,470
You could have part of a 아ंка.

937
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,950
There are those little flatts around it.

938
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,530
Those little dots.

939
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,290
And that's exactly the way people want to dress up.

940
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,050
They all look pretty.

941
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,410
They all go in circles.

942
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:24,410


943
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,030
It was also the SALT collection,

944
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,730
which is a full ö だzhijím

945
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:27,130


946
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:27,130


947
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,230
Of course, they're all covered in Wales nessa

948
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:31,690
so

949
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:32,930
they tend to do some

950
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:32,930


951
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:32,930


952
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,190
magic

953
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,670
neat

954
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,670


955
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,670


956
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,710
at

957
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:41,710


958
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:41,710


959
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,430
from The Governed.

960
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,490
Could we make that Monster Hunter movie now?

961
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,130
Hey, did you hear my new prayer?

962
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,430
No.

963
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,850
Okay, this is before dinner.

964
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,210
When you're ready to eat dinner, you say,

965
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,190
Dog is great, dog is good,

966
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,570
but dog cannot have our food.

967
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,610
Amen and amen.

968
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,690
Amen and amen.

969
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,930
Could we make that monster?

970
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,110
Yeah, I think we could.

971
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,470
Guys, guys, okay.

972
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,390
You're the strongest monster.

973
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,750
You're a lady that doesn't do anything.

974
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,210
I'm going to choose what monster I'm going to be.

975
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,510
I'm a lady who doesn't do anything.

976
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:28,850
Stop, stop.

977
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,410
I have an idea.

978
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:29,970
I have an idea.

979
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,490
You're the strongest monster ever.

980
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:37,590
No, I'm going to choose what monster I want to be.

981
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,430
Okay, which one are you?

982
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,210
Welcome to the Trump White House.

983
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,490
Let me go check real quick.

984
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,010
We're live here at the Trump White House.

985
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,270
This is the president,

986
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,930
Batman, and his little assistant, Donnie.

987
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:50,390
I'm going to be,

988
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,270
so D.R. is the black cat.

989
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,950
I am the Monster Hunter.

990
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,110
Xander is going to figure out which monster he is.

991
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,170
You need to stand on this side.

992
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,470
My problem is, these boys are bad.

993
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:08,830
They're not good boys.

994
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,030
They're bad boys.

995
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,430
I'm being with you.

996
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,830
They're very bad.

997
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,050
Elias is bad.

998
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,770
Not me.

999
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,690
I'm trying to be with you.

1000
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:21,710
That's why I've been saying that Elias is going to grow up to be a James Bond supervillain.

1001
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,490
Yeah, that's right.

1002
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,690
Not with superpowers, just with super evil.

1003
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,690
Yeah, I'm going to have a son with Elias.

1004
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,450
No superpowers.

1005
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:36,190
These guys have learned the subgenius way of talking all at once on the radio.

1006
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:36,650
Can you stop screaming?

1007
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,170
Yeah, that's the official subgenius technique.

1008
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,470
Stop screaming.

1009
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,030
Stop screaming.

1010
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,870
Can we make that movie now?

1011
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,830
I said that three times already.

1012
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,230
I've started the movie three times.

1013
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,210
No, I'm pretty sure you said it 15 times.

1014
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:49,890
Okay, man.

1015
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,110
There's a monster out there in Moga Woods.

1016
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,210
We've got to go out there and kill him.

1017
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,530
Well, somebody has to go out there and kill him.

1018
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,750
I'd love to go fight that monster.

1019
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,250
Hold on.

1020
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,830
Hold on.

1021
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:59,850
You're the black cat.

1022
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,850
Who will volunteer to kill the monster?

1023
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:03,750
I will.

1024
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,710
I am the Monster Hunter.

1025
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:06,930
And who are you?

1026
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,210
What is your name, young Monster Hunter?

1027
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:11,690
Monster Hunter.

1028
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,210
Monster Hunter.

1029
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,090
That's not a very clear name.

1030
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,010
It seems quite generic.

1031
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,350
It's rather generic, yes.

1032
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,450
Can it be more specific?

1033
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,030
I'm still a monster.

1034
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:22,630
I'm still working this show.

1035
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,390
This is the worst script I've ever seen.

1036
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,870
Who wrote this?

1037
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,910
I have no idea.

1038
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:29,950
Who wrote this script?

1039
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,350
Wait, that wasn't even a script.

1040
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:31,730
Okay, let's start.

1041
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:32,970
Once upon a time.

1042
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:33,550
Three little.

1043
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,290
You're supposed to say I wrote it.

1044
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,490
Okay, once upon a time.

1045
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,050
Okay, here's the music in the background.

1046
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,690
We are here to hunt monsters, men.

1047
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,210
Which monster shall we hunt?

1048
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,230
Bob.

1049
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:48,930
Let's fight him.

1050
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:49,990
Bob?

1051
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,310
Yes, we'll kill him.

1052
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,130
The worst monster of all, Bob.

1053
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,130
They say he's undefeatable.

1054
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:57,670
Okay, I just killed him.

1055
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,650
I just killed him.

1056
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,850
He just looks like a bunny, though.

1057
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,930
I just killed him.

1058
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,910
Jump fearless.

1059
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,530
That was easy.

1060
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,670
I killed him.

1061
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,170
No, he's not.

1062
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:07,950
Hurley.

1063
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,070
Hurley, let's go.

1064
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,750
I just killed him.

1065
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:11,290
Who's straight?

1066
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:12,270
I'm straight.

1067
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,170
Who's straight?

1068
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:13,170


1069
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:14,470
Okay.

1070
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,870
Okay.

1071
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,170
I give up.

1072
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,390
I give up.

1073
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:18,090
I give up.

1074
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:18,770
I give up.

1075
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,050
Add sound effects here.

1076
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:20,530
Bing.

1077
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:20,690
Bing.

1078
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,250
The monster.

1079
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,570
The monster's here.

1080
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:26,070
Come on.

1081
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:26,810
Let's get it.

1082
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:27,590
He's too powerful.

1083
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,270
He cannot defeat Bob.

1084
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,190
Bob will destroy us.

1085
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,950
He will kill us all with his slack power.

1086
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,490
But I just got the monster hunter sword.

1087
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:36,530
Run.

1088
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,050
We need a slack powered sword to fight Bob.

1089
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:39,270
Run.

1090
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,310
I just got it.

1091
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,210
I'm gonna run.

1092
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:42,630
Okay, let's get him.

1093
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,310
Okay, that's a good idea.

1094
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:43,730
Let's run.

1095
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:44,530
Run away.

1096
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:45,290
Run.

1097
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,050
Wait, wait, wait.

1098
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,050
You know we have...

1099
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:48,270
No, wait.

1100
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,770
We'll never beat the monster this way.

1101
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,290
Wait.

1102
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,590
Okay, let's go back and get him.

1103
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,950
Okay, Yamba and Cha-Cha.

1104
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,750
Hurry.

1105
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:55,530
Get him.

1106
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,130
Okay, we'll go away.

1107
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,070
Yamba and Cha-Cha, they will help fight Bob.

1108
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:58,550
Hurry.

1109
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:59,130
They're here.

1110
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,050
They will help us destroy Bob.

1111
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,150
I got my sword.

1112
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:03,490
Oh, wait.

1113
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,250
It's not working.

1114
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,470
I got my sword.

1115
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,330
Bob is selling a new mask.

1116
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:07,850
Bam.

1117
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,030
Shing.

1118
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:09,790
Bam.

1119
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:10,290
Bam.

1120
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:10,710
Oh, no.

1121
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,170
Bob got him on his side.

1122
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:12,610
Bam.

1123
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:13,050
Bam.

1124
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:13,650
Bam.

1125
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,670
Hey, look at that great sword Bob has.

1126
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:17,490
I'm going to go...

1127
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:17,550
Splash.

1128
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:17,630
Splash.

1129
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,290
Hey, quit killing Bob for a minute.

1130
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,730
I want to go buy a sword from him.

1131
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:21,130
Okay.

1132
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,110
Run, run, run.

1133
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,270
He sold me this great sword.

1134
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,770
Oh.

1135
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,190
Oh.

1136
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:26,670
Oh.

1137
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:26,770
Oh.

1138
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,310
Oh.

1139
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:28,270
Oh.

1140
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:28,990
Oh.

1141
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:29,090


1142
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:29,150
Oh.

1143
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:29,210
Oh.

1144
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:29,310
Oh.

1145
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:29,390
Oh.

1146
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:29,630


1147
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:29,690


1148
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:29,690


1149
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:29,790
Oh.

1150
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:29,890


1151
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:29,890


1152
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:29,890


1153
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:29,890


1154
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,050
Oh.

1155
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:30,050


1156
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:30,690
Oh.

1157
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:30,910
Oh.

1158
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,430
Oh.

1159
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:31,490
Oh.

1160
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:31,490


1161
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:31,490


1162
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:31,490


1163
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:31,550
Oh.

1164
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:32,670
Oh.

1165
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:33,870
Oh.

1166
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,030
Oh.

1167
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:44,570
Oh.

1168
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:45,530


1169
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:45,890
Oh.

1170
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:47,450


1171
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,510


1172
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,630
Oh.

1173
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:48,490
Oh.

1174
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1175
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1176
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1177
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1178
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1179
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1180
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1181
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1182
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1183
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1184
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1185
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1186
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1187
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1188
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,490


1189
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,150
I'm going to put in the trap.

1190
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:52,990
That's it.

1191
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:53,790
Put in the trap.

1192
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,270
Okay.

1193
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,970
When he falls in, I'll put a bomb on it.

1194
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:57,330
Okay.

1195
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:57,830
Hurry.

1196
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,490
Okay.

1197
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:58,890
warp in.

1198
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,470
Come on.

1199
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,670
Quick.

1200
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:01,810
Broom.

1201
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:02,170
Okay.

1202
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,370
Now, I'm going to throw a paintball.

1203
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:03,790
Come on.

1204
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:04,170
bullet to Bob?

1205
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,130
He's still coming!

1206
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,850
Bob is still coming!

1207
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:10,230
Kill him!

1208
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:10,950
Slash!

1209
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:12,150
Slash!

1210
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:12,930
Slash!

1211
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,790
Slash!

1212
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:14,250
Bang!

1213
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,150
Slash!

1214
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:20,050
I think he just fell asleep while we were trying to kill him.

1215
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,090
Stop it, Andrew!

1216
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:22,710
He wasn't fighting back.

1217
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:23,710
Arch!

1218
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,170
It hasn't hurt him.

1219
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,670
Slash!

1220
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,610
Nothing will stop him.

1221
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:27,070
Slash!

1222
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,410
Bullets cannot stop him.

1223
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:28,990
Slash!

1224
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,150
I'm going to slash him into pieces.

1225
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,250
Gah!

1226
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:35,250
Slash!

1227
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:35,670
He's smiling.

1228
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,050
I think he likes it.

1229
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,670
He's getting turned on.

1230
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,010
This is gross!

1231
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,270
What were we...

1232
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,350
That's the monster right there, too!

1233
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:45,130
He's Bob.

1234
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:45,830
It's Bob.

1235
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,190
That's how he likes being killed.

1236
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,650
One more bomb.

1237
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,830
That makes...

1238
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:53,490
The skull bomb!

1239
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:54,890
The skull face bomb!

1240
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,310
Slash!

1241
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,030
It makes him laugh.

1242
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,410
No, it doesn't make him laugh.

1243
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,050
Oh.

1244
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,770
Since it makes him laugh...

1245
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:08,650
It would make him dead because he likes being hit so much.

1246
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,810
Three, two, one, go!

1247
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,230
It worked!

1248
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,090
Yay!

1249
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:16,130
He's dead!

1250
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,490
Now we just have to go have armor and...

1251
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,290
His armor and his weapon.

1252
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:23,670
Yay!

1253
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:24,290
Yay!

1254
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,470
Let's go back home.

1255
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,130
That man is Bob.

1256
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:36,730
Bob!

1257
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,570
Bob!

1258
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,210
Bob!

1259
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:48,890
Bob!

1260
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,190


1261
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,530
Bob!

1262
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:50,590
Bob!

1263
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,090
Bob!

1264
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,650
Bob!

1265
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,910
Fernanda Nande-Lemore.

1266
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:11,170
Oh, did I mention the other bootlegging that was done in Glen Rose

1267
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,930
was dinosaur track bootlegging.

1268
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:21,190
The town, of course, is famous for the really well-preserved,

1269
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:25,910
various different series of dinosaur tracks all along the Paluxy River

1270
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,570
and also the tributaries.

1271
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:32,850
We have our own lesser, somewhat smaller dinosaur tracks

1272
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:36,870
on our own property.

1273
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,730
And they're real, and there's no question.

1274
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:46,030
If you look at these things, you go, yeah, a big animal definitely did this.

1275
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:49,610
This is not just by chance.

1276
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:55,890
But back in the 20s, they were somewhat more exotic,

1277
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:01,470
and the very same fellow who had brought the dinosaur tracks

1278
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:02,390
to the attention,

1279
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,830
the first person in town who knew they were dinosaur tracks

1280
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,230
and not devil tracks,

1281
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:13,370
was a high school principal who then alerted paleontologists

1282
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,330
at this New York Museum of Natural History, I think.

1283
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:20,250
So anyway, this teenager had discovered the tracks,

1284
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,110
and when he grew up, he made bootleg dinosaur tracks

1285
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,550
and sold them.

1286
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,490
They looked absolutely unrealistic, but...

1287
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,830
And I think Dr. B...

1288
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,650
Bob will sell you dinosaur tracks too,

1289
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,830
although I don't think he tries to insist that they're real.

1290
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:40,870
They're just decorative.

1291
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:46,310
Yep, this is an interesting and wonderful town.

1292
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,450
It's a sleepy town.

1293
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,670
I go into the post office every day, just about,

1294
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,990
and you can write to us.

1295
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:56,910
You can send us stuff.

1296
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:02,030
The eventual permanent Church of the Subgenius

1297
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,250
will be...

1298
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,570
Got your pencil ready?

1299
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:11,210
And it's this way all through the winter and spring and fall months.

1300
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:18,070
Subgenius, post office box 807.

1301
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:19,910
That's it.

1302
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,330
Box 807.

1303
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:25,850
Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1304
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,730
Also, subgenius.com.

1305
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,790
Also, during the...

1306
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:32,830
During the...

1307
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,510
Late spring and summer, early fall.

1308
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,990
The official subgenius...

1309
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:42,430
Still the official subgenius headquarters is in Cleveland Heights, Ohio,

1310
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:45,990
where it's 33 degrees when I'm saying this.

1311
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,930
It was 80 degrees here in Texas.

1312
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,770
Yes, yes, yes.

1313
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,330
So, thank you.

1314
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,210
And now this.

1315
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,030
Well, we're home again.

1316
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:00,970
Let's eat.

1317
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:00,970


1318
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,750
Yum, yum, yum, yummy.

1319
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,970
That more lemon on belly sure is yummy.

1320
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:15,050
Tough, though.

1321
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:15,770
Chewy.

1322
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,630
Okay, who's going to throw up now?

1323
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:23,750
I just ate the guts.

1324
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,390
I will.

1325
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,410
That was a good meal.

1326
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,290
I just ate the guts.

1327
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,850
That was a good meal.

1328
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,910
Mine was terrible.

1329
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,890
Here, some of this.

1330
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,390
Oh, okay, I'll try that.

1331
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,410
It's even worse.

1332
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:47,670
How dare you.

1333
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,250
I don't care that it's worse or better.

1334
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,590
I just want to eat.

1335
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:55,670
Because I'm hungry.

1336
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,230
You want it to be worse, sir.

1337
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,610
Here's some...

1338
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:00,950
Cha-cha and cappuccino.

1339
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:00,950


1340
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:00,950


1341
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,290
Chachara and chai rum bus.

1342
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,170
Cha-cha and chai rum bus.

1343
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,150
Here's some royal cheese.

1344
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,510
Cha-cha and ca-yum-ba.

1345
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:10,430
Here's some...

1346
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:11,250
Here's some candy.

1347
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:11,790
Circle.

1348
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,510
Cha-cha and...

1349
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:12,870
Square.

1350
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,090
Here's some candy.

1351
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,130
It's the Monster Hunter Idiot Show.

1352
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:20,010
Here on Hour of Slack.

1353
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:21,770
Hey, some candy.

1354
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:22,710
Hey.

1355
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:27,470
Why are you making me eat skull candy, Dr. Alexander?

1356
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,970
Hey, skull candy.

1357
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,030
Because it's so good.

1358
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,370
Skull candy makes you throw up just so you know.

1359
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,610
No, it's so good.

1360
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,670
This show broke my hearing aids.

1361
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:37,570
Wait, is that true?

1362
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,450
It made my hearing aids run...

1363
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:40,190
explode.

1364
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,110
Because it sounds so bad.

1365
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,050
Yeah, I'm always serious.

1366
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,410
Would I kid you?

1367
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,210
Would your grandpa kid you?

1368
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,670
While doing a subgenius radio show?

1369
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:57,070
Would your grandpa tell you some crazy story?

1370
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:57,950
Yep.

1371
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,610
Now, it's the end of the story.

1372
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:08,670
Bye.

1373
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:14,250
Hey, isn't there a movie called The Bad Grandpa that we haven't seen yet?

1374
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:15,470
Bad Santa?

1375
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,370
No, there's a movie called Bad Grandpa.

1376
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,710
Wait, the music turned off.

1377
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,750
Because I want to learn from that movie.

1378
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,250
I want to learn how to be a really bad grandpa.

1379
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:28,230
No.

1380
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,450
I think they like the idea.

1381
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:40,510
Oh, but I can't forget to credit the music, which is Mayan Ruins from their album.

1382
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,690
Sounds like college radio.

1383
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:49,150
Sacred and Profane, a lovely album by Mayan Ruins.

1384
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,870
What is he doing?

1385
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,030
What are you doing?

1386
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:09,350
Alex, the future evil genius, Ilyas, is toying with our radio station equipment.

1387
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:10,530
No!

1388
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,170
You may not do it.

1389
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,970
You may not know.

1390
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,750
Hey, you meddler.

1391
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:17,690
You know what that thing is?

1392
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,650
Ilyas, you know what that thing is?

1393
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,150
That's a layover to catch meddlers, buddy.

1394
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:24,570
What's that?

1395
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,370
It's a layover to catch meddlers.

1396
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,270
You're a meddler.

1397
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,470
That's a layover.

1398
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:29,390
It's going to catch you.

1399
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:30,010
You think that's funny?

1400
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:30,010


1401
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:30,010


1402
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:30,010


1403
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:30,010


1404
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:30,010


1405
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:30,010


1406
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,110
It's a layover to catch meddlers.

1407
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,390
And you've just been caught, buddy.

1408
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:42,370
Show them there's another one in the shelf over there.

1409
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:49,370
We actually do have labeled layovers to catch meddlers in this house.

1410
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,510
You know where they came from?

1411
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:52,330
Pappy.

1412
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,050
Because Pappy was a trapper.

1413
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:58,450
He's a trap maker and he made traps to catch meddlers like you.

1414
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:04,890
This right here is a genuine subgenius brand layover to catch meddlers.

1415
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,450
Good.

1416
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:06,890
Right here in my hand.

1417
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,350
Right here.

1418
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,030
Well, look at what it says.

1419
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:10,990
It's a big tube.

1420
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:11,790
What are meddlers?

1421
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,470
It says on the side, layover to catch meddlers.

1422
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:21,070
And not to be used at speeds exceeding 70 miles an hour.

1423
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,230
Wait, I'm a meddler?

1424
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:22,810
Yep.

1425
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:23,190
Wait, what?

1426
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:24,030
Duh.

1427
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,090
Guaranteed for the life of the meddler.

1428
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,430
Oh, it's a little bit.

1429
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:28,730
It's a little whip.

1430
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,230
It's a little whip to whip the meddlers with.

1431
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,590
A meddler whipper.

1432
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,310
It is.

1433
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,250
But I don't want to be whipped.

1434
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,470
But I'm a meddler.

1435
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,250
My father left traps all over this house.

1436
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,310
I'm not a meddler.

1437
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:47,990
Booby traps.

1438
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:50,010
And there are a lot of boobies around here.

1439
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:50,930
Boobs, I mean.

1440
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:51,990
Here's some candy.

1441
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:53,970
Like the birds.

1442
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:57,870
Here's instructions for the layover to catch meddlers.

1443
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:58,210
Ooh.

1444
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,210
Which really is there.

1445
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:00,090
Wow.

1446
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:06,830
Allow layover to sit unattended in open areas in households, such as table or bookshelf.

1447
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,030
Check occasionally for meddlers.

1448
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:12,890
When meddlers are found congregating around layover,

1449
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:18,910
flagellate them with soft end of layover while holding hard end in hand.

1450
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:19,530
Cool.

1451
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,870
Let's find the meddlers.

1452
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,530
You're the meddlers.

1453
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:23,890
No.

1454
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,810
That's why I was flagellating you with the soft whip end.

1455
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,370
That's right.

1456
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,470
You're being flagellated.

1457
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:30,570
With those flagella.

1458
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:32,770
All right.

1459
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:39,450
Well, friends, this has been Hour of Slack number 18,001.

1460
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:40,510
Okay.

1461
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,610
Starring Alexander and Elise.

1462
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,190
But I don't want to do it again.

1463
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:48,010
With, and no one ever wants to do it again.

1464
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,030
I promise.

1465
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:50,430
I promise.

1466
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:51,230
I promise.

1467
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,010
I promise.

1468
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:54,450
I promise.

1469
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:56,870
I promise.

1470
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:09,730
And that's the way it is here at Fossil House, Dockstock Mountain, Stang Ranch, Stangsville, Texas.

1471
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:11,370
Praise Bob.

1472
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:12,810
Praise Bob.

1473
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,170
Humans.

1474
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:26,230
And I also should mention the money.

1475
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:26,550
The money.

1476
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:27,090
The money.

1477
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,070
On the internet.

1478
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:35,650
of the show, I can mention the money. And it's $35 to become a minister in the Church of the

1479
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:42,690
Subgenius and a member of the cult and get in on... Just take my word for it. It's worth it.

1480
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:51,730
Well, it might not be for you, the listener, but it definitely will be for you, the listener.

1481
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:58,090
I know you know how to take advantage of this sweet, sweet, sweet offer,

1482
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:05,550
which includes the option of meeting other actual life subgeniuses. Isn't that challenging?

1483
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:15,510
And yes, it can be. The best... Well, I can't say the best. Actually, the hardest place to meet

1484
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:20,430
subgeniuses is at our X-Day celebration this summer.

1485
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,710
You may not have heard of it, but it's a celebration of the X-Day.

1486
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:21,710


1487
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:26,210
heard this anywhere else but the world is coming to an end on July 5th at 7 a.m.

1488
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:34,590
assuming this really is 1998 and not 2017 like they're always saying. And we've

1489
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:43,570
been wrong again. In fact we've been wrong 21 times. We've had 21 X Day drills.

1490
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:53,190
Anyway this is X Day 20 coming up. Yeah that's right XX. Two X's. XX Day again

1491
01:00:53,190 --> 01:01:03,030
and that's the week before July 5th starting very late June in southern Ohio

1492
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:08,930
at Wisteria Campground. It's a lot of fun and I've almost finished an

1493
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:13,530
edited video. I haven't done a video of X Day in a long time.

1494
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:13,550
I haven't done a video of X Day in a long time. I haven't done a video of X Day in a long time.

1495
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:26,170
But I got new equipment. Praise Zaphod. And so yeah editing video again and it's really fun and it reminded me of how much fun X Day is.

1496
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:31,790
It's probably not much fun if you just sit there and watch but nobody does that.

1497
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:40,970
I think the concerts we had didn't have an audience because all of the audience was on the stage.

1498
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,270
Luckily the stage is really big.

1499
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:47,290
And if you don't believe me you can see all of this stuff.

1500
01:01:48,590 --> 01:02:00,950
YouTube channel RevStang and I'm also putting stuff together for the Ministry of Slack TV show on Roku Network.

1501
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:11,830
The specific channel on Roku is OSI 74. That stands for Outer Space International 74.

1502
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:16,710
And there's a lot of other stuff on there besides subgenius.

1503
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:23,510
It is a river of bulldada. A torrent. A deluge of bulldada.

1504
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:30,470
There's a Noah's Ark of cultural bulldada artists floating around on top of it.

1505
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:36,910
Presenting it to you and streaming it over the internet onto your television if you have one of those Roku sticks.

1506
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:41,810
And they're pretty cheap and there's lots of cool stuff on there besides that.

1507
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:44,170
But yeah, there's a subgenius channel. You can...

1508
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:50,990
You never know. It's gonna be something different every week and it's curated by Dr. Philo Drummond.

1509
01:02:51,150 --> 01:03:00,610
The most powerful other subgenius corporation committee member besides myself.

1510
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:03,150
And of course, JR Bob Dobbs.

1511
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:08,470
But Bob doesn't concern himself with our petty affairs much.

1512
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:11,330
He does, however, occasionally...

1513
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:14,850
Smite us if we don't bring in enough money.

1514
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:18,990
And you know, friends, it's true. I really did have a heart attack one week ago.

1515
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:22,750
I was home in 24 hours but...

1516
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,030
I guess Bob was just making a warning.

1517
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:30,270
That if the subgeniuses can't...

1518
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:33,190
You know, some of the Gimme Bobs out there.

1519
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,610
I'm talking to you on Facebook especially.

1520
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:39,550
The ones who don't know how to spell Bob or subgenius.

1521
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:40,610
And yet they...

1522
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:44,890
They'll get a little $1 Bob pin and then say,

1523
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,790
Well, I'm a subgenius now. I can do anything.

1524
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,590
No, sir. No, sir, ma'am.

1525
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,030
That's not the way it works.

1526
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:55,570
If you haven't sent that 35 bucks, you're still pink to Bob.

1527
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:00,670
I don't know if Paul Mavridis ever actually paid 35 bucks.

1528
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,910
He may die. He may suffer with the pinks on next day.

1529
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,410
I did. I paid my...

1530
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:06,750
It was 30 bucks when I paid.

1531
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:10,210
Just before the false 1998. I got a little nervous.

1532
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:14,690
I sent in my check to myself, but I didn't have to endorse it.

1533
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:19,010
Reverend Nikki Deathchick stamped it with a rubber stamp of my signature.

1534
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,930
That's how slick we were then.

1535
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:24,770
And we're even slicker now. Slicker and slacker.

1536
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:28,050
And you can be too, by golly.

1537
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:33,250
I don't get on here and brag about how great my luck is just to brag.

1538
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:34,390
It's because...

1539
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:40,050
Look, if you don't get slack from the Church of the Subgenius, then it's all just a joke.

1540
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,890
Just a lie. Just a satire. A takeoff on cults.

1541
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:47,050
Somebody has to prove that you really get slack.

1542
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:47,790
Why not me?

1543
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:51,450
I busted ass slacklessly for 30 years.

1544
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:56,050
And now I'm going to spend the next 30 years getting payback.

1545
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,850
Payback slack. The best kind.

1546
01:04:59,030 --> 01:04:59,590
Ah, yes.

1547
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:06,410
And so with that, once again, we're not begging money.

1548
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:10,590
We're selling a really cool package of material that will keep you going.

1549
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:12,090
Keep you busy for a long time.

1550
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:13,450
And might just...

1551
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:19,170
Well, we actually do have people say we changed their lives for the better.

1552
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:29,290
Occasionally, I am told that the hour of slack, quote, got me through high school.

1553
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:36,970
What's sad is that sometimes the person who's telling me that the hour of slack got them through high school is 50 years old.

1554
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:38,870
That's how long we've been on.

1555
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,050
This is, what?

1556
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:43,470
32nd year.

1557
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:51,610
Hour of slack number 1,609, I believe, is what this episode is.

1558
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,930
So there you go.

1559
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:54,250
But we're not going to quit.

1560
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,770
Death can't stop us.

1561
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:56,870
I kicked death's ass.

1562
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,370
Yes, I did.

1563
01:05:58,550 --> 01:05:58,930
There was...

1564
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,150
It's funny.

1565
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:03,310
I've been trying to film buzzards.

1566
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:04,070
Long story.

1567
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:06,450
And so I've been noticing them.

1568
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,250
And two days before my heart attack,

1569
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,370
we noticed that instead of the...

1570
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:14,970
five or seven buzzards normally hovering and soaring around this place,

1571
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,470
there were 17.

1572
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:17,810
We counted them.

1573
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:18,510
And I have a picture.

1574
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:20,430
Hovering over the house.

1575
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:22,490
Two days later, I had a heart attack.

1576
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:26,050
When I came home, I went out looking for buzzards to film,

1577
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,290
and they'd all gone away.

1578
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:32,310
Like, hey, we thought we was going to have a good meal off that tough old bastard.

1579
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:33,850
But he didn't die.

1580
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:37,450
So we're going to have to head off, boys, for deader pastures.

1581
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:39,630
But they did actually...

1582
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:40,910
return today.

1583
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,410
And I did get the shot I was looking for.

1584
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:45,210
So you see, everything's just perfect.

1585
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,730
Here on Stang Ranch.

1586
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,870
Outside of our...

1587
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:52,810
machine gun...

1588
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:54,450
defended...

1589
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:56,950
barbed wire covered fence...

1590
01:06:57,490 --> 01:06:58,290
of our compound.

1591
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,310
Things may not be that good.

1592
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:03,250
Although, frankly, when I drive into town,

1593
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:06,050
it still looks like the same old America it always has.

1594
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:08,750
But...

1595
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:12,890
that may be because nobody's talking about...

1596
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:13,650
it.

1597
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:16,610
And I managed not to this whole show.

1598
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:18,030
Praise Bob!

1599
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:20,330
Shhh!

1600
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:20,930
Humans!
