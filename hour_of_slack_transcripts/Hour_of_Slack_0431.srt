1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,320
Raaaaaah!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,100
Things kept going from bad to worse, but we all put our shoulders to the wheel, and it wasn't long before I was flat on my back again.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,120
Meltdown.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,840
Hear equal parts of music, subliminal guideposts, and dirty talk.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,160
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAT.

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,020
Subgenius hour of SWAT.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,080
Bob?

8
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,980
The horror of SWAT.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,840
Of your job, and the joy of spending what you earned on that job on this job, this radio station, this, this anti-job, this hour of, yes, uh,

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,760
Bob?

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,800
That's right, friend, there's only two races in this world, us and them.

12
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,500
Whose side are you on, eh?

13
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,500
All you gotta tell me now is why, why, why, why, welcome to the workin' week.

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,340
Oh, I know I don't fail you.

15
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,980
I hope that you're not afraid.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
I hope that I don't kill you.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,100
Welcome to the workin' week.

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,240
You gotta do it till you do it, till you get again to it.

19
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,860
Uh, yes, and I know that there may be some of you out there who actually love your jobs.

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,680
And to all three of you, I have this to say.

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,320
Bob blesses you, and expects you to tithe even more than 45% of your income.

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,980
Uh, for the rest of us, we have some readings from both the new and old, uh, radio stations.

23
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,080
Testaments, uh, to this lovely background music here by the Nurk twins.

24
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,820
Uh, yes, both in, uh, Book of the Subgenius and the upcoming Revelation X.

25
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,600
Uh, for Bob, uh, has spoken on these things.

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:22,540
And of course, in between the sermons, you can call this station, my friend, and pledge until your very guts bleed.

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,960
And you'll want to, because this time, we have a, a new pledge premium that you won't want made.

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,480
Yes, no sir ma'am.

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:39,520
It's the brand new Subgenius Catalog, or Actalog as my script says here.

31
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,640
That's right, the Subgenius Catalog.

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:53,360
Uh, you pledge money to this station, and we'll send you a 12-page suitable for framing gigantic catalog of subgenius paraphernalia and ritual knives and skull goblets and so on.

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,780
Uh, by which you can spend even more of your money on Bob.

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,200
Oh, but this is no ordinary catalog, dear friends.

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,180
No, I, I'm taking a look at it.

36
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,220
I'll dig out my magnifying glasses for this.

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,460
That, because it explains to you, uh, e-everything.

38
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,240
Answers to everything, including many you'll wish you had never learned.

39
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:28,640
Uh, this superb marital aid encompasses the life of Bob, his prophecy, the entire past and future history of the Earth,

40
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,940
and all the instructions.

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:37,520
You'll ever need for survival, slack, psychic wealth and prosperity in these the end times.

42
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,920
Because this is a weapon!

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,260
And it also contains the infinite control with knob.

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,520
Well, actually, that's a description of book of the Subgenius, which is listed in this catalog.

45
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:58,320
It's also a good description of this show, which is likewise an intensifier of perception, stretching your imagination to the limit until it pops.

46
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,260
And, uh, you will then learn that no matter how sure of things you thought you were,

47
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:14,840
you were dead wrong and groveling in an illusion manufactured by the authorities who secretly lord over your very mind.

48
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,840
And after that, uh, you can continue to live in blithering normalcy.

49
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,920
But you'll know what you're being fattened for.

50
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,200
Uh, which, of course, is to pledge money to this show.

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,760
Uh, the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

52
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,800
It's got sharp image resolution with no fake trademark, uh, p-p-p-pull-down claw.

53
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,840
Rolling Stone called it a sick masterpiece.

54
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,160
This is no fake, friends!

55
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,620
We're putting you in charge of your life!

56
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,940
With this baby, you'll be ready the next time your face is on fire.

57
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,300
Quick con-down-clamp-spiracy release.

58
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,060
Easy, undelicate tissues, no danger of runaway infections.

59
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,440
Automatically sloughs off waste.

60
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,720
You'll feel good about yourself, my friend.

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,860
Because this catalog, which is available for your pledge, only, uh, well, not every pledge will get you this catalog.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,600
You can't pledge a nickel, uh, to Pope S. Cecilia here.

63
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,920
She's waiting by the phones.

64
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,360
She's got a sly look on her face, cause she knows that you are gonna be the lucky one to call.

65
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,840
Uh, and you will, uh, pledge, uh, thirty, uh, over $25.

66
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,260
And you will receive, for that $25, uh, called in.

67
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,160
To this station.

68
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,720
Uh, you will receive not only the schedule, the bumper sticker, and the calendar of this station,

69
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,620
which will tell you when all the other weird shows are on.

70
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,900
You know, it's kinda hard to tell without that calendar.

71
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,380
But you will also receive that amazing subgenius catalog.

72
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,020
This holy catalog has been Xerox reprinted and distributed by thousands of zealous fans

73
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,120
for use in the church's relentless campaign to freak out the pink wimps and mediocritons of our planet.

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,020
Uh...

75
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:02,420
Uh, this catalog and the pamphlets described inside are excellent for, uh, uh, airport proselytizing,

76
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,400
leaving in friends' houses, bars, restrooms, uh, granny's purse, etc.

77
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,940
These are the gifts that keep on giving, friends, from the cult that keeps on taking.

78
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,140
Uh, lifelike and durable, and you can achieve cosmic onelessness safely at home, at work, or at school.

79
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,000
And for $35 pledge to this show, you get, uh, uh, a $25 gift card.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000


81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,880
A, uh, a K-N-O-N t-shirt, a bumper sticker, and the schedule, and the subgenius catalog.

82
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,180
But you'll have to come to the station to pick up the t-shirt.

83
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,000
$45, uh, same as the $35, but, uh, we'll mail you all, uh, the, the t-shirt and all the other premiums.

84
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,260
Yes, my friends, it's amazing but true.

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,800
You can use credit cards, you can call up and make a bank draft,

86
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,400
you can do anything in order to get more of the slack, w-which...

87
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,980
It's the only way to get your money.

88
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,560
Put your hands on this catalog, friends.

89
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, aside from the obvious.

90
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,840
Um, the all-pulp chassis of this thing is flexible yet resilient.

91
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,940
No more difficult de-spunking.

92
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,940
In fact, encrusted spum will come off as fast as it got on with a simple dish rag.

93
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,460
After years of digestion, you'll feel like you have a bomb shelter in your gut.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
You'll be able to take anything to Pink's Dish out, and I mean just about anything.

95
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,420
You'll be able to eat anything, too.

96
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,660
Forget that health food and save money.

97
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,980
Uh, this catalog carries, uh, uh, information about our new Bob Boxer shorts.

98
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,980
That's right, there are such things.

99
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,720
Fine quality boxers sporting large Dobbs heads and glow-in-the-dark anti-Bobs.

100
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,480
Bob Coffee Mugs.

101
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,100
Uh, you'll be able to sell these things for thousands of dollars when the tribulation times come.

102
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,100
But you won't.

103
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:53,640
You'll trade them for boxcars of food or tanks of church air because, friends, money ain't gonna be worth a whole lot in those days.

104
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:53,640


105
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
I wanna...

106
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,620
I wanna read to you here of what Bob had to say...

107
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,860
What Bob had to say about money in Book of the Subgenius.

108
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,920
Uh, this is a good time, by the way, for you to call in your pledge.

109
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,040
I've got three ministers sitting here.

110
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,260
Sitting here. Yes, sitting here. Three...three ministers.

111
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,120
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

112
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,180
Yes.

113
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:25,860
You three.

114
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,760
Gentlemen. Us.

115
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,060
You're on. You're talking.

116
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,760
Who, me?

117
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah.

118
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:29,880
Nah.

119
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,100
Come on, call, call Reverend Trickster. Call Pope S. Cecilia or call...

120
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,560
Oh gee, please, call Trickster. He's waiting to abuse you.

121
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,160
Yeah, call him. Well, if you bet he probably is. He probably is, dear friends.

122
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,940
Cheap at the price.

123
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,240
Well, I'm going, um, you can call the station and in the meantime, I'm, uh, going to read this.

124
00:08:52,260 --> 00:09:01,940
This little piece. Because, you know, friends, of all the answers or rather excuses available to us,

125
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:09,400
money is without question the most primal and effective, overshowering love, power, even sex.

126
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:17,160
As Bob himself so succinctly put it, if it is money, it is good.

127
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,140
Money is the most powerful chemical.

128
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,500
It is the most powerful chemical in the universe, dissolving everything that is not of itself.

129
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:37,900
The conspiracy has always known this and has bred many good slaves by making its subjects simultaneously hate and desire money.

130
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,400
They program people to feel embarrassed to talk about it.

131
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,940
But we're not. We're not at all because love is the answer. Love of money.

132
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,240
You must love that which the conspiracy would have us love.

133
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,240


134
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,240


135
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,440
And that which the conspiracy would have us feel guilty about.

136
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,900
For money is not evil, nay, nay, but a primordial benevolent force.

137
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,760
It is the ultimate artwork.

138
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,120
Man's first true use of symbols, predating language.

139
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,080
Why, blood was used as money at one time.

140
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,060
That got trickster's attention.

141
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,620
It is indeed one of the purest manifestations of the holy yuccatismic force.

142
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,640
We should revel in money. We should grovel in it.

143
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,920
Money is the green breath of the estate of man.

144
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,400
If the cash flows out, it flows back in.

145
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,520
It can bring slack.

146
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,160
But to attain slack through money, you must not desire it.

147
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,200
To try to attain it, it will only entangle you further in desire.

148
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,940
One way to lose your attachment to worldly things is by indulging in them.

149
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,100
By smothering yourself in them.

150
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,320
This can bring enlightenment.

151
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,320
But it can also bring the dangers of Jonesism.

152
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,900
For you can never keep up with them.

153
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,840
Instead, the seeker may concentrate on a method, a tantra.

154
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,500
A technique that will lure slack to him.

155
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,220
Learn always to feel the flowing of the cash.

156
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,240
The life force.

157
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,260
The moolah.

158
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,740
Go to a store and remove all the money from your wallet or purse.

159
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,360
Hand it to the salesperson.

160
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,460
All of it.

161
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,320
And say, give me this much worth.

162
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,120
Gesture ambivalently at their entire stock.

163
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:45,980
Then turn and meditate while your items are gathered randomly by the puzzled clerk.

164
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,840
As you hand the salesperson your money, or phone in your pledge to this radio ministry,

165
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,260
pay close attention to the look of the money.

166
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,660
The stench of the auras that have accumulated on it.

167
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,520
The feel of the greenbacks as they slip from your hands.

168
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:12,340
Feel the life force of the salesperson, or in this case, Reverend Ivan Stang, through the currency.

169
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,180
Then, in that gap of time,

170
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,080
as the money leaves you,

171
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,900
as you pass through that moment of going from the material world in which you have nothing,

172
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,720
in that moment, sense the slack.

173
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,300
Do not look for it or you will miss the moment.

174
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,580
In that brief period between having something and having nothing,

175
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,980
there was slack.

176
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,200
When you had something, you were responsible for it.

177
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,700
You had to do something with it, spend it, or save it, or invest it.

178
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,000
When you had nothing, you needed something.

179
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,220
In both states you had desires.

180
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,180
But in that interval between having and needing,

181
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,640
there, in that moment, was the slack.

182
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,020
Go into that moment.

183
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,200
Gaze, my friend.

184
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,900
Gaze.

185
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,540
And, uh, uh, we, uh, uh, uh, switch.

186
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,700
Start calling this show, friends, and me at 82374.

187
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,240
Because you must understand that the money itself is worth nothing.

188
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,540
It is only a tool.

189
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,260
Uh, yet, uh, because the conspiracy controls its printing,

190
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,120
they extract great life energy from those who worship it.

191
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,540
Until we rid ourselves of the artificially, uh, induced, uh, obsession

192
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,960
with the colored pieces of paper themselves,

193
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,900
we are still slaves to their conditioning.

194
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,260
If you worry about its lack,

195
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,520
you are theirs.

196
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,660
For they make far more off of your hours of labor than you do.

197
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,980
If you were paid what you were worth, they'd go broke.

198
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,000
They are not really obsessed with money, but with time.

199
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,100
Your time.

200
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,800
They're all time junkies who vampirize your minutes and days

201
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,000
until you are nearly drained of slack.

202
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,940
To break this vicious cycle of exploitation,

203
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,200
you must purge yourself of all respect

204
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,240
for paper money and call this show and pledge it all to us.

205
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,600
Debase the false idols of the Federal Reserve

206
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,660
by sending it to this station.

207
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Make a game of its destruction

208
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,960
and feel righteous pleasure as you draw on it,

209
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,040
write on it, shred it, or promise it all to us

210
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,320
by calling 8237490.

211
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,380
Make it useful for something real.

212
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,920
Uh, friends, now we elders of the church,

213
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,180
do not use money in the traditional ways.

214
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,680
No, we launch it.

215
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,220
We scrape the smudge of soul essence

216
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,420
of previous owners off of it.

217
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,560
We burn it ritualistically in public.

218
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,660
And we pray over the dollars as they wither in the flames.

219
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,120
And the smoke carries the prayers up to the saucer men

220
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,960
who shall save us all.

221
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,980
But only if you call this station right now

222
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,740
and pledge that money in here, friends.

223
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,900
We hand the dollar back to you.

224
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,140
We hand the bills back and forth among each other,

225
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,700
letting the psychic stench accrue upon it

226
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,280
that it may give Bob more power.

227
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,100
Spend it like there's no tomorrow, friends,

228
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,940
because there is no tomorrow.

229
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,020
Spend it experimentally.

230
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,960
Spend it aesthetically.

231
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,300
Spend it anesthetically.

232
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
But spend it! Spend it right now!

233
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,640
Call this station, 8237490.

234
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,720
Indeed, everyone should send all of their money to us right now.

235
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,400
Or everyone they know.

236
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,520
As many strangers as possible. Right now!

237
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,980
Why, the system would cave in

238
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,040
if all of the money were tied up in the mail for that long.

239
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,900
Of course, there is a simpler way.

240
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,440
You could just send what you don't need to the church.

241
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,220
Bob will spend very little of it.

242
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,460
It mostly goes to the station.

243
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,440
Bob has infinite wealth anyway.

244
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,380
He does not spend it but stores it,

245
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,580
which keeps it out of the hands of the conspiracy,

246
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,060
keeps it from being abused on monstrous death research projects,

247
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,520
and really, the more money Bob can prevent from circulating, friends,

248
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,920
the longer the econocataclysm will be staved off.

249
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,480
So, if you're having trouble with your cash flow, friends,

250
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,620
it's because your cash is not flowing to Bob.

251
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,360
You can correct that.

252
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,500
You can correct that by calling this station...

253
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,640
823-7490.

254
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,720
What about his slack?

255
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,780
I seem to see the word slack mentioned a lot.

256
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,020
Well, that's... we've lost our original slack.

257
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,300
And Bob is here to help us regain it.

258
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,600
Some people have a greater proportion of it than others.

259
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,340
But slack is essentially what you need to be able to do whatever the hell you want.

260
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,800
Has this ever happened to you?

261
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,240
Why, I should have been there, Ted. It was great.

262
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,460
There was free booze, great music, one of the best parties I ever went to.

263
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,040
Where were you that night?

264
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,180
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

265
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,100
I guess I should have gone, huh?

266
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,700
Didn't you feel stupid?

267
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,560
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

268
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,920
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

269
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,140
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

270
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,060
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time,

271
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,000
slow time,

272
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,580
and make time run backwards.

273
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,560
Back to learn...

274
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,700
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

275
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,960
How, you may ask?

276
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,320
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

277
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,820
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

278
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,580
Blango.

279
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,800
My dog was dead.

280
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,740
Was I sad till I met Bob.

281
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,440
Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car,

282
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,980
do a slip job on the brakes, and wouldn't you know it,

283
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,440
that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

284
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,200
Ain't that right, fella?

285
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,780
Yes, just imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow

286
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,740
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

287
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,900
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

288
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,180
Just right. Bob's School of Time Control, the universe.

289
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,600
Bob's School of Time Control, a division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

290
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,000
And suddenly I've found how wonderful a sound can be.

291
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,020
Release your hold on this tenuous practical joke they call reality.

292
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,240
Let your body be sucked out of your ears, for we're going to take you deep, deep inside yourself

293
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,720
to the place of silence in the noise.

294
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,340
We're going deeper, deeper into your consciousness, down past the membranes of the fabric of your very mind.

295
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,140
We bore down into the cranium, drilling through the irrelevant memories of job and normality,

296
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,980
piercing the squamous epizootic.

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,440
The epizootus rolling around in the hollowed-out inside of the skull,

298
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:16,460
scraping along the edges of the birth canal and stretching the imagination gland until it pops.

299
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,680
Now, let all your thoughts drain out through the brain pan, tumble down through the sinuses,

300
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,660
slide down the esophagus, and finally let them plunge to the base of the soul itself,

301
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,480
located in the lowest organ of your body, the foot gland.

302
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,180
And finally, an idea.

303
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,940
An ultimate plan is born at the very bottom of your mind.

304
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,500
And it is Bob.

305
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,580
I don't care what you call him. I don't care if you're a Hindu, a Muslim, a Jew, a Christian.

306
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,640
He's up there. He's in that spaceship.

307
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,880
He led Moses to the problem, halfway to the promised land.

308
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,960
He never gets them all away.

309
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,940
But Bob's going to make it. Bob's going to take you to the promised land.

310
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,800
Bob's going to have you knuckle-walking to Jerusalem, my friend.

311
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,920
The whole world's gone crazy.

312
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
Bob's gone crazy.

313
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,000
Bob's gone crazy.

314
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,460
Bob's gone crazy.

315
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:17,660
Bob's gone crazy.

316
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,600
Bob's gone crazy.

317
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:18,980
Bob's gone crazy.

318
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,320
Bob's gone crazy.

319
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,320


320
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,400
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

321
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,400
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

322
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,700
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

323
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,640
Dare I ask it? Yes.

324
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,500
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

325
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,320
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the Earth each and every day?

326
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,460
The answer? Yes, definitely.

327
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,180
Take that and shove it up the tube, mark certainty,

328
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,500
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

329
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,900
Here's one of the basic tenets of religion.

330
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:06,860
It says here, Jesus is our Bob, Bob is our hope, Jesus is Bob Hope.

331
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,300
That's one of the tenets of the religion.

332
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,820
What I want to know about is slack.

333
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,360
Sometimes I wonder if we're living in the same land.

334
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,280
Glad you want to be my friend when I feel like your children are running out of hands.

335
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,800
Welcome to our working week.

336
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,060
Welcome to our working week.

337
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,060
Welcome to our working week.

338
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,160
Friend, the devil is tearing the family apart.

339
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,620
But what the devil uses to do it with is nine to five jobs.

340
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,760
Conspiracy, corporate, pink situations where mommy and daddy get up in the morning

341
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,860
and go to work and they kiss the kids goodbye.

342
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,580
It's the first time they see them during the day, kiss them goodbye,

343
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,460
kind of a simultaneous goodbye and hello.

344
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,840
Then they get home about seven o'clock, ticked off to use the polite term,

345
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,880
after a long drive back out to the city of New York,

346
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,140
they get home and kiss their kids hello and goodnight and they go to bed.

347
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,720
And the other churches dare to say the breakdown of the family

348
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,600
is because the kids see a little tittering stupid sexy gags on television

349
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,740
or because of the new permissiveness where men are allowed to do things with other men.

350
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,880
That's a bunch of holy hooey, I say, my friend.

351
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,080
I say, why not legalize pornography and ban work?

352
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,360
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids.

353
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,860
Most of these kids these days grow up, they don't have parents.

354
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,360
They got some kind of robot scarecrows.

355
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,100
Well, friend, let there be slack.

356
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,260
Oh, and there will be slack.

357
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,140
There will be slack, dear friends.

358
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,060
Thanks to Jerry Oakley of Mesquite, Texas.

359
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,860
Praise Reverend Jerry Oakley.

360
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,100
You're ordained now.

361
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:55,860
He called in an American Express pledge of $50.

362
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,260
Man, he has paid us not to work.

363
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,020
And, you know, work, according to this flyer here from Radio Werewolf,

364
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,580
work, my friends, is a plague worse than AIDS.

365
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,060
And I know that makes you upset, but look at these, just listen to these five points.

366
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,840
Number one, only two million Americans are HIV positive,

367
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,280
while 130 million Americans have jobs.

368
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,400
And most of these are full-blown 40-hour-a-week jobs.

369
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,980
Number two, safe sex is possible.

370
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,500
Safe sex is possible, but safe work is impossible.

371
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,100
Because at some point, one out of ten Americans will be physically injured

372
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,200
while doing their job, and many will die.

373
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Point number three, the government spends millions of dollars each year

374
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,140
trying to find a cure for AIDS,

375
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,720
but it spends nothing on trying to find an alternative to work.

376
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,200
In fact, it uses the tax code and subsidies

377
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,580
to encourage more of it.

378
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,180
Point four, high schools and colleges pass out free condoms,

379
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,700
but no one passes out free unemployment checks.

380
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,780
And point number five, having AIDS qualifies you

381
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,940
for a privileged moral conviction or victim status,

382
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,340
through which you may even transcend the banalities of your society.

383
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:31,900
But having a job makes you nothing but a loser and a clod.

384
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,620
Act up, dear friends, by slacking off.

385
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,900
We say, we demand, uh, yeah.

386
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,940
The American Dream

387
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,700
At a bed at 6-13

388
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,520
In a rush out in Camp Dean

389
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,880
Gotta catch the bus and train

390
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,300
I'm in a rush, I'm feeling insane

391
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,800
I can't take this crazy pace

392
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,320
I've become a little kiss

393
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,480
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

394
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,840
Go to work, it's such a drag

395
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,280
Face the boss, he's such a blag

396
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,660
In a suit and in a tie

397
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,020
I look so lame, I wanna die

398
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,640
I can't take this crazy pace

399
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,120
I've become a little kiss

400
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,320
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

401
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,560
I can't take this crazy pace

402
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,920
I've become a little kiss

403
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,320
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

404
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,320
I punch the clock at 9 or 5

405
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,720
I know I'm late but still alive

406
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,220
Everyone just stays in bed

407
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,720
Unless the life of the spirit's hate

408
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,280
I can't take this crazy pace

409
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,660
I've become a little kiss

410
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,960
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

411
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,060
5 o'clock rolls around

412
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,560
I feel so glad I kissed the ground

413
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,100
I'm in a rush, I'm feeling insane

414
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,100


415
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,100


416
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,100


417
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,020
Even though hours in the day

418
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,620
Has got to be a bed so wide

419
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,000
I can't take this crazy pace

420
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,440
I've become a little kiss

421
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,700
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

422
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,940
I can't take this crazy pace

423
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,440
I've become a little kiss

424
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,740
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

425
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,380
I've become a little kiss

426
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,380


427
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,380


428
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,380


429
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,880
That's right dear friends

430
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:12,660
You know, uh, the problem is not so much with the paper bills, the money, or the life energy that it represents

431
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:19,500
The problem is that to get it at all, most of us have to submit to these so-called jobs

432
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,080
Now, Bob approves of this

433
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Of the great Peter principle theory

434
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,440
Which explains why so many companies seem to have all the wrong people doing the wrong jobs

435
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,380
That is, a worker moving upwards in his career will end up stalled right at his level of incompetence

436
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,720
And stay there until he retires

437
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,220
And from there he makes the terrible decisions

438
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,980
Which filter back down to his or her underlings

439
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,940
In the form of insanely wrong working conditions

440
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,100
Yes friends

441
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,980
The peckers

442
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,860
Are still inflicting their pipe dreams upon the peckies

443
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:04,200
And big companies for which most people work use a million tricks to subjugate your will

444
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,700
Often against their own best interests

445
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,220
Because first they show you all the job freedom you'll ever have

446
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,000
So that you forget that there's a leash on you

447
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,600
They promote you a little bit

448
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,940
Let you build up to speed

449
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,100
Running after that conspiracy slack that you know exists

450
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,320
Uh, upstairs

451
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,940
And they reel out the slack of raises and days off

452
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,200
Until you're sprinting as fast as you possibly can

453
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,460
And then wham!

454
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,020
They yank that leash back with the equivalent of a heavy torque motor

455
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:45,780
It snaps your neck and drags you backwards so fast that you'll never ever again forget that you have that leash

456
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,300
If you're gonna stay with the company friends

457
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,980
You better hope they use that leash trick

458
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,840
Early

459
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:59,540
Oh yes, yes, we're all, uh, dogs begging for a treat here

460
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Flexibility and adaptability are words which the conspiracy has hijacked and beaten into meaning good slavery

461
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:15,380
Those who are truly flexible and adaptable actually have long since freed themselves from the corporate daisy chain

462
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,420
Or ripped it off from within

463
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,960
And you can join us in that great show!

464
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,060
It's a great task, my friends

465
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:30,060
If you will just call this selfsame, uh, helpless radio station with your helpful big, big, big bucks

466
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,160
Ah, yes

467
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,460
Another type of false compensation

468
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,020
Or over-assertiveness is exemplified in the one who always comes late to every gathering

469
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,340
In order for everyone to notice him when he arrives

470
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,540
And who leaves early so that people will notice when he leaves

471
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,960
Or who is constantly name-dropping

472
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,820
After he said that, then he said, arise!

473
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,220
Take up your bed and go your way to your house

474
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,640
Take up your bed and walk

475
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,300
Then he stretched out on the floor

476
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,020
Don't you lose it, remember to take time out for fun

477
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,920
Time out for fun

478
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:20,560
Uh, it's time to take that time out and call your subgenius radio station

479
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,020
The only one in town, friends

480
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,360
There's only one

481
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,940
I'm gonna have to go to the pledge tapes pretty quick here

482
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,480
If we don't get just a few more calls

483
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,320
We're doing real good

484
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,620
We're doing real good

485
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,300
You're not, you won't be starting something

486
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,220
You'll be joining something

487
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,600
Ha ha ha ha ha

488
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,800
Eh, cause, you know, I've worked hard on this show

489
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,640
I hate to admit it

490
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,380
But we wanted to do something for those of you who have to go to work in the morning

491
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,120
We wanted to take the money you're going to earn tomorrow

492
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,300
But, but we want, we've tried

493
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,800
We're gonna make it work

494
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,540
We're gonna make it work

495
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,840
We're gonna make it work

496
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,580
We're gonna make it work

497
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,000
We're gonna make it work

498
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,000


499
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,640
Friends want you to call that money

500
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,000
And I know that you'll feel better when you go to work tomorrow

501
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,460
You know the conspiracy has developed ways to twist your survival fear

502
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,600
To meet their needs

503
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,560
Not the needs of this station

504
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,160
This one lone voice of slack in the entire Southwest

505
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,740
Uh, some of the conspiracy's tools they call motivational training

506
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,060
At which employees voluntarily let themselves be adapted

507
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,240
You're not gonna do that now, are you friends?

508
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,500
You're not gonna be part of that

509
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,420
As it says here in Book of the Subgenius

510
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,620
Available through your subgenius catalog

511
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,860
Which is available through your pledges to this station

512
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:44,260
Exploitable traits shared by both humans and subgeni are

513
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,760
Among many others

514
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,720
Incredible capacities for procrastination

515
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,740
Moment by moment self-delusion

516
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,760
Rationalization of sheer laziness and greed

517
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,560
And an instinctive resistance to effort of any kind

518
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,340
In humans, the conspiracy uses these qualities to obscure all reasons for living

519
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,700
Making the pink more tolerant of mechanical boring labor and radio stations

520
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,760
And causing him or her to consider complaining not to be worth the trouble

521
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,720
On the other hand, the pink is more tolerant of the fact that it's not worth the trouble

522
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,140
And the subgenius brings these talents for shirking to their fullest fruition

523
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:30,920
For he or she or it knows that conspiracy business is based on those things

524
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,180
Having true faith in slack

525
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,600
We take these natural propensities for sloth

526
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:45,000
We make these propensities for sloth appear to idiot bosses to be symptoms of expertise

527
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,720
Thus we can repeatedly quit our jobs and get rehired back

528
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,540
At better pay

529
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:56,200
Just because the boss has learned to expect eccentricity from us

530
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,840
Friends, those are helpful hints in your subgenius lifestyle

531
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,920
Ah yes, because they...

532
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,040
Now wait a minute

533
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,280
Friends, you're getting me upset

534
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,300
I ain't seeing my ministers here on the phone

535
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,880
I had some real...

536
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,520
Ah well, I guess I know what we're just gonna have to go back to

537
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,720
We're just gonna have to let them know what we're doing here

538
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,700
And let them know what it's all about

539
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,460
Hallelujah!

540
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,700
The only true religion's guns

541
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,860
Okay

542
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,900
So then you could say Bill, for example, is suffering from slacklessness

543
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,820
Well I don't know

544
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,680
This station seems to have a much greater proportion of slack than others in the area

545
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,220
That's right, we are truly original and...

546
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,160
Full of slack

547
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,560
And most...

548
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,840
As I understand it, we are full of slack

549
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,460
Because we are different from everyone else

550
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,060
We are not dictated by the norms of society and of commercial radio

551
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,860
We try to do our own thing on XCI, especially on morning sickness

552
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,960
Bob would not choose to appear on any other radio station, I don't think

553
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,620
Oh, we're very honored, did you hear that?

554
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,160
Bob and the Church of the Subgenius would never be represented by a commercial representative

555
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,880
For example...

556
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,060
The Bible and Bob are crazy, the kind of crazy that comes from faith

557
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,680
So when Bob says you have to spend money to make money

558
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,060
He knows what he's talking about

559
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,480
And so do I

560
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,660
Money is not the wind

561
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,120
You can only feel it when it's moving

562
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,920
God bless you

563
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,100
Make no mistake, time does march on here now that we have a new stereo stereo

564
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,340
To eat the past tape themselves, they ought not to be feared, do you sir?

565
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,440
I agree with that

566
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,640
Friends like yourself, except perhaps they called in a pledge to pay for a certain solder joint

567
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,460
Ah yes dear friends, well you know if you don't pledge...

568
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,580
There's gonna be more and more and more reverence stands

569
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,560
Too many reverence stands

570
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,780
Can you imagine?

571
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,900
Come on, pledge man, pledge

572
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,240
We need that money, call in

573
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,440
Let's get some spirit going here

574
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,940
Look at those phones light up

575
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,600
Every time somebody lies on the ground

576
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,000
You need to do is shake it all

577
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,720
Shake it all

578
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,620
I looked in the newspaper for a job

579
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,440
I looked in the newspaper for a job

580
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,260
I looked in the newspaper for a job

581
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,060
I looked in the newspaper for a job

582
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:44,400
You some all you niggas

583
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
You don't any chances

584
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,440
Go all

585
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,020
Baker, this is called the claw, and it's got the power of dogs in it, and the power of

586
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,860
Bob, and I challenge you to show your ugly face here at this radio station and come forward.

587
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,860
Go ahead, come forward with all your millions. I'm ready to have a match without rules, no

588
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:08,640
rules at all. One will survive, one only. One minister will leave the match still breathing

589
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,300
if one of you, one of you goody, goody preachers has the guts to show up.

590
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:22,280
Uh, yes, I'm sitting here drinking some Texas Select beer, friends. Beer! You hear that,

591
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,920
Jimmy Swagger? You don't drink beer, oh no, or smoke on froth, because you don't know the power

592
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,780
of these herbs. I challenge any minister do-gooder out there to show up, all of you, with all your

593
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,940
TV shows and all your bought-off politicians, your paid-off judges. Do any trick you want,

594
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,020
but I got the claw, I got the power of Bob, and the power of Texas Select, and you, my

595
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,440
friends, you're the best.

596
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,900
Every man listener has the power to call 823-7490.

597
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:08,400
Or have someone close to you bring you the phone and make that call.

598
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,880
The end times get closer and closer every minute. Imagine some guy or some gal driving

599
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,440
around town.

600
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:21,500
They're tired of listening to the same old music on their conspiracy radio show, so they

601
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:27,000
try switching channels, and they come upon this. They hear these voices talking, and

602
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,220
they think, now what is this, a talk show? A church show? A comedy? I mean, oh my God,

603
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:37,740
are these people serious? It's too developed to be a joke. Should I kill them, or should

604
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,820
I pay them? Which will it be, friend? Which will it be?

605
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,300
You.

606
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,440
You.

607
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,320
You must draw your own conclusions.

608
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,160
You've got to believe me!

609
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,120
Save us!

610
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,680
You've got to believe me!

611
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,620
Save us.

612
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:04,620


613
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:04,700
Save us.

614
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,360
You've got to believe me!

615
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,380
Save us.

616
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:12,040
You've got to get out of here, quick. I know you haven't had much practice, but you've

617
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,680
got to start thinking.

618
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,440
You will win.

619
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,900
I'm not rude to think.

620
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,840
I'd rather not do...

621
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,420
anything.

622
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,580
The Thargians don't want you to do anything.

623
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,340
Even eating or breathing.

624
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,140
Breathing?

625
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,960
But I've always breathed.

626
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,880
I can't stop now.

627
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,820
Then get started thinking.

628
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,440
Think, boy, think!

629
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,700
What do I think about?

630
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,500
Think of birds that swim

631
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,820
and fish that fly.

632
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,600
Ah, let's see.

633
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,540
Birds that swim...

634
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,920
and fish that fly.

635
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,620
Words that begin with J.

636
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,260
It's working, it's working!

637
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,180
Keep thinking!

638
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,660
Dinosaur insteps, potato ice cream.

639
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,480
Uh, potato insteps and

640
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,820
dinosaur ice cream.

641
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,880
Faster, boy, faster!

642
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,060
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

643
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,760
Deoxyribonucleic acid?

644
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,120
Albert Einstein!

645
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,660
E equals MC squared.

646
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,680
Albert Einstein!

647
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,140
E equals MC squared!

648
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,000
William Shakespeare!

649
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,340
Anthony Tronoff! Isaac Newton!

650
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,600
Faster, boy, faster!

651
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,840
Roger Bacon! John Stewart Middle!

652
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,160
February!

653
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,180
February!

654
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,800
F-E-B-R-U-A-R-Y!

655
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,140
Fifteen times eighty-six equals twelve-one-ninety!

656
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,660
Fifteen times eighty-six equals twelve-one-ninety!

657
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,800
Then carry the three...

658
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,960
K-O-N is eight-two-three-seven-four-nine-zero!

659
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,580
Eight-two-three-seven-four-nine-zero!

660
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Eight-two-three-seven-four-nine-zero!

661
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,520
Eight-two-three-seven-four-nine-zero!

662
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:47,520

Donate $300,000.

Give to us something to live for.

673
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,200
Anything.

674
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,380
Anything.

675
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,820
We need hope now, love.

676
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,960
We need hope now, love.

677
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,480
I'll open the son of a bitch!

678
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,460
I'll open the son of a bitch!

679
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,340
One moment, please.

680
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,540
I bring you a message.

681
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,240
Exactly six miles north of Skag Mountain

682
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,480
Exactly six miles north of Skag Mountain

683
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,460
in the Valley of Pain,

684
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,240
there lives an evil devil monster.

685
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:33,500


686
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,140
His name is Bingo Gas Station

687
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,660
Motel Cheeseburger

688
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,380
with a side of aircraft noise

689
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,760
and you'll be Gary, Indiana.

690
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,520
And he loves to hurt people.

691
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,680
And he loves to hurt people.

692
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,960
The last time I saw Bingo Gas Station

693
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,100
Motel Cheeseburger

694
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,500
with a side of aircraft noise

695
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,820
and you'll be Gary, Indiana

696
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,420
he told me what he wants to do.

697
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,500
He wants to come down here

698
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,240
and kill each and every one of you.

699
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:02,440


700
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,480
But I said to him,

701
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,640
Bingo, wait a minute.

702
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,600
And the reason I said that

703
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
is because I believe in you people.

704
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,600
I believe you can do the job.

705
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,560
I believe you can help each other.

706
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,880
I believe you can make this world

707
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,660
a better place to live in.

708
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,020
That's it.

709
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,780
That's all, friends.

710
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,080
That's, you know,

711
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,600
it may seem

712
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,940
confusing, perhaps,

713
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,420
to some of you that

714
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,060
particularly tonight.

715
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,220
On the one hand,

716
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,800
we're exhorting you to quit your job

717
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,280
and never work for their filthy lucre

718
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,380
and at the same time

719
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,760
demanding ever so much

720
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:49,980
like

721
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,600
five to fifty bucks or so

722
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,200
from you.

723
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,800
Of course, there's somewhere out there

724
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,220
there's probably somebody who could easily

725
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,880
drop two or three thousand on this show.

726
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,800
They're thinking to themselves,

727
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,560
that's just what they want me to do.

728
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,160
I ain't gonna do that.

729
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,320
But friends, you know,

730
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,920
what it ultimately comes down to,

731
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,340
what Bob has been trying to say all along

732
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,700
is,

733
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,000
let the robots do the work

734
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,560
and we'll get paid.

735
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,300
There is a practical basis

736
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,740
to all this. You know, that philosophy

737
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,060
will come true. You might not

738
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,300
think it to hear all the

739
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,060
doom saying on this show, but

740
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,600
we're really quite optimistic.

741
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,280
Speaking for myself,

742
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,300
I personally, Reverend Ivan Stang,

743
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,880
believe that humanity plus

744
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,460
the unsaved subgeni

745
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,420
will achieve utopia

746
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,420
within, why,

747
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,040
no more than ten thousand years.

748
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,920
Actually, we, the card-carrying

749
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,400
paid-up subgenius ministers

750
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,800
will achieve glutopia

751
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,840
within only four years

752
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,600
on X-Day.

753
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,100
But even for those left behind,

754
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,880
I don't see why it should take more than

755
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,260
ten thousand years for people to

756
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,940
figure out that they really could

757
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,900
let the robots do all the work.

758
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,420
And then, themselves get paid

759
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,640
and spend all their time vacationing.

760
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,040
Now, don't get me wrong, friends,

761
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,480
things are gonna get worse. A hell of a lot

762
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,840
worse before they get better.

763
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,260
Uh, at least they'll

764
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,200
get worse for everybody

765
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,080
except those already inside

766
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,140
the dome.

767
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,520
And the planet will probably undergo

768
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,260
a nine thousand year

769
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,420
dark ages, worse than

770
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,820
the thirteenth century, but

771
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,160
then after that, you know, they'll probably

772
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,420
wise up, repent, quit their jobs, and

773
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,980
slack off. Even the humans.

774
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,540
I know, they'll call me

775
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,680
a teary-eyed dreamer, a hopeless

776
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,380
romantic idealist, but

777
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,580
and it's true, we'll be

778
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,340
lucky if any life still

779
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,620
survives in even a hundred years, but I just

780
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,580
have that shining hope,

781
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,100
dear friends, that someday

782
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,460
in some better world,

783
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,200
slack will prevail

784
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,760
and we'll all be

785
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,460
fabulously rich, yes,

786
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,360
but without working.

787
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,460
But on the other

788
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,020
hand,

789
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,280
on the other hand,

790
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,380
you aren't calling in,

791
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,220
you don't hear the songs ring, the phones

792
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,360
ringing in the background, do ya?

793
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,600
Hear anything, friends?

794
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,640
I ain't lyin'.

795
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,380
But,

796
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,960
in the meantime,

797
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,240
did you know that two

798
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,260
point, twenty-three point five

799
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,280
million new jobs were created

800
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,220
in the eighties, and Clinton

801
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,500
wants to create even more!

802
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,660
In the nineties!

803
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,080
That's right, twenty-three point five

804
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,420
million more Americans went to work in the

805
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,440
nineteen eighties, eighteen million more

806
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,160
than ever before in our nation's history,

807
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,700
but Clinton doesn't think that's enough!

808
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,940
Well, we do!

809
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,420
We recognize that while

810
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,460
having employment seems to provide

811
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,580
certain advantages, the rush

812
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,020
of receiving a paycheck,

813
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,500
the security of mental

814
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,180
and dental benefits,

815
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,620
a sense of euphoric

816
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,540
fulfillment for a job well done,

817
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,200
the happy-go-lucky

818
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,120
camaraderie of co-workers,

819
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,740
dependency

820
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,020
on work, like

821
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,300
any other feel-good answers,

822
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,220
crack, pot, or the bottle,

823
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,980
leads to problems the

824
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,160
work addict rarely realizes

825
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,200
until it is too late. We understand these

826
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,000
problems, and we're here to help.

827
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,180
But we can't help unless you call

828
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,100
in these last ten minutes remaining.

829
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,520
Call the station.

830
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,300
Because we are

831
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,540
among, besides being the church of the

832
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,580
subgenius, we are

833
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,520
part of another group

834
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,680
called Employees Anonymous,

835
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,740
a fellowship of men and women

836
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,240
who share their experience,

837
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,020
strength, and hope with each other

838
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,180
that they may solve their common problem

839
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,940
and help others to recover

840
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,560
from employment.

841
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,540
The only requirement for membership

842
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,240
is a desire to stop working

843
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,860
and a pledge to this station.

844
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,980
There are no dues or fees otherwise

845
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,900
for Employees Anonymous membership.

846
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,460
We're self-supporting through our

847
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,420
own contributions.

848
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,160
Employees Anonymous is not allied

849
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,240
with any sect, denomination,

850
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,600
politics, organization, or institution

851
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,060
except, of course, Radio

Weirwolf, P.O. Box 75416,

853
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,760
Washington, D.C., 20013,

854
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,740
K.N.O.N., here in Dallas, Texas,

855
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,020
at, uh,

856
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,340
Post Office Box

857
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:25,520
710909,

858
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,260
Dallas, Texas,

859
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,540
75371, or the Church of the

860
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,340
Subgenius, P.O. Box 14306,

861
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,860
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

862
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,300
Although we're not allied

863
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,620
with any such institutions,

864
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,740
we do not wish to engage

865
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,620
in any controversy.

866
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,440
We neither endorse nor oppose any causes

867
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,620
except for slack.

868
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,600
Our primary purpose is to stay out of work

869
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,520
and help other employees

870
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,440
do likewise.

871
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,640
Life is short, friends, and sadly,

872
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,620
even quitting your job right now

873
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,620
will not bring back all the precious time

874
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,120
you've lost to your employment dependency.

875
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,060
But you can learn to cope,

876
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,620
and we will be waiting

877
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,120
to help you, and to take your calls,

878
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,360
your pledges, to keep this station

879
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,520
on the air.

880
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,080
Ah, yes, and, uh, uh, Will,

881
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,140
Dobbs, how much do you think we've

882
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,340
perhaps, uh, accumulated at this point

883
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,420
in the hollowness of this room?

884
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,520
Just under $200.

885
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,180
Oh, wow!

886
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,860
Just under $200.

887
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,620
Well, let's see, uh,

888
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,080
Trickster brought a record of, uh,

889
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,860
Guy Lombardo's 50 Greatest Hits.

890
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,660
Suffer!

891
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,440
I've got the Should We Make Them Suffer

892
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:32,780
record!

893
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,680
Make them suffer!

894
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,860
No, they probably like that.

895
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,120
That's, that may, yeah, it's

896
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,040
it brings back memories of cartoon.

897
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,500
Friends, look, now, are you gonna make

898
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,400
Give him the Lombardo.

899
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,300
No, I don't wanna do that. The comfy chair!

900
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,720
The comfy chair.

901
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,660
The soft cushions. You know what the mistake

902
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,140
was? Working too hard.

903
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,620
Working too hard to try to get them

904
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,480
to understand to quit working

905
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,020
and just send us the money. It just,

906
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,420
it, it, God, God, God Almighty.

907
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,780
Criminy. Where's my, uh,

908
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,120
Someone close to you brings you the phone.

909
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,360
Yeah. Make that call. Make that call, friend.

910
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,020
Come on.

911
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,680
And donate fifty dollars.

912
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,460
And this way we're fair and square.

913
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,300
I understand that you loved Bob.

914
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,920
And that maybe you and Bob

915
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:42,940
are

916
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,040
somehow, um,

917
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,500
help each other in a good

918
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,800
way. I don't know.

919
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,960
You will not attack people.

920
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,800
You will not turn them into frogs.

921
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,480
If you stay in the United

922
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,820
States, you will be destroyed.

923
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,540
One way or another. It's a waste

924
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,300
of your time to remain in the United

925
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,780
States. Forget about it.

926
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,940
That is my advice

927
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,520
to you. Take it or leave

928
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,040
it. And stop

929
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:13,840
harassing me.

930
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,680
I want to kill her. Obviously you don't want to. I want to kill you,

931
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,680
Connie. You're responsible for the pain of these

932
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,900
four. I'm so tired. Get your hands off me.

933
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,500
So how do we know? How can we tell whether

934
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,620
our friends are ready to walk the path of

935
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,560
Dobbs? Surely just not by the

936
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,700
t-shirts they wear or the pipes in their mouths.

937
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,340
Hello? Hello, Connie?

938
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,420
Hi. Hi. Listen, I'm tuned to

939
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,440
your station. I just don't know what the hell's going on.

940
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,300
Well, us too. So you help us out.

941
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,360
I am the Pope of New York, flown out here

942
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,360
especially to preach the gospel of Bob and

943
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,320
the Church of the Subgenius to you,

944
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,120
young lady. Do you have enough slack in your life?

945
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,140
Do I have a what?

946
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Do you have enough slack in your life?

947
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,220
Enough what? Slack.

948
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:50,500
Slack.

949
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,380
Yes, this spazzed, mature, macho

950
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,440
irony. I am sure that on a car radio this

951
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,140
probably sounds like vegetable soup.

952
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,620
Just put in here that

953
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,140
half of the dolphin's sexual drive

954
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,600
is released through their blowhole.

955
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,640
And the other half is released through the

956
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,500
Church of the Subgenius. Thank you for that

957
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,220
testimonial and good work.

958
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,100
Clean your own blowhole, would you please?

959
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,580
Yes. We have a special brush here

960
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,860
available at the Church.

961
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,580
The brush and soap department

962
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,460
of the Church here.

963
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,640
Yes, I can lay hands on you

964
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,620
and drive the demons of

965
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,080
Yucatan.

966
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,500
I can grant you slack with the very touch

967
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,180
of the tentacles of the Pope.

968
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,660
That's right. Andy's using one of those brushes

969
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,900
on Channel 5 right now.

970
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,760
And if you don't believe I can heal

971
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,520
with my mere hands, just ask

972
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,760
Andy about the hands of the Pope.

973
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:41,960
Oh, yes.

974
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,480
...all around me.

975
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,460
And yet, God asks that we

976
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,460
worship him by holy

977
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:49,920
living.

978
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,740
Today? Can he really mean that?

979
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,340
And that way lies madness.

980
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,520
Madness and poverty.

981
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,560
The poverty, for instance, that would have

982
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,260
afflicted this station and put us off the air.

983
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,060
Not just us, but everybody

984
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,440
else on this station.

985
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,380
Don't torture

986
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,780
us this time, friends.

987
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,620
Quit laughing at us.

988
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,720
Don't torture us by waiting until the last

989
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,800
five minutes to call in your pledge.

990
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,580
And don't

991
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,000
just pledge money. Pledge everything.

992
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,180
You can pledge credit cards. That's right. We'll take

993
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,400
Visa or Master Charge

994
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,120
here. Listen.

995
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,500
Feel the spirit of giving, friends.

996
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,600
There is no more money.

997
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,320
We've got to get some money.

998
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,540
That dirty

999
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,440
Turkish Archibald Blackman!

1000
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,360
I'm not gonna... We ain't gonna be taking

1001
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,740
no guff this time. This time,

1002
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,500
this time, you are going

1003
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,640
to pay up. You are going to call

1004
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,420
823-7490.

1005
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,080
Because that sweet name of...

1006
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,520
and the sweet name of

1007
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,280
Bob, my friend. What...

1008
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,680
What else can you do?

1009
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,480
What else you gonna do with that money?

1010
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,680
Well, I can probably think of all kinds

1011
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,960
of things you can do with that money.

1012
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,380
It is true that I do like meat. Some of my

1013
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,320
best friends are meat.

1014
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,480
But that doesn't mean

1015
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,840
I'd put them in a cauldron stew.

1016
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,080
We would hope not. Let's see.

1017
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,520
Just carry the wetness with you wherever

1018
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:11,980
you go.

1019
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,000
Just bring a bucket. That's true.

1020
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,060
I mean, and we'd just wring ourselves out.

1021
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,960
Or a nice, tawdry little novelette.

1022
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,160
Yes. Or just don't

1023
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,260
change your Depends.

1024
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,020
Okay.

1025
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,820
I've heard enough about Depends.

1026
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,440
I've heard enough about Depends.

1027
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:30,440


1028
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,720
What I want to do is really cool ourselves

1029
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,920
off right here with a cocktail.

1030
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:35,980
Ah!

1031
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,460
Cocktail.

1032
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,080
She thinks you can cure the world by

1033
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,320
kindness and rules.

1034
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,160
But it's too small.

1035
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,980
The Lord's Prayer on a pinhead.

1036
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,180
Some make rules,

1037
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,820
some obey, but the rules are for the fools

1038
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,180
is what I say.

1039
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,920
I used to hang around in airports

1040
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,920
and I used to sell books

1041
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,820
and I'd stand on a street corner

1042
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,920
with flowers and I would do

1043
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,020
anything that my religion asked

1044
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,940
me to do. But now I've got more

1045
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,020
sense! Now I've got Bob Dobbs!

1046
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,960
Dobbs is saving me.

1047
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,820
He showed me Slack. Slack.

1048
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,980
Being able to edit your own memory

1049
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,740
and cut your attention span

1050
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,080
down to just three little

1051
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,860
minutes. You can program

1052
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,620
your life just like that TV

1053
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,280
guide. Slack!

1054
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,900
I want you to witness

1055
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,820
now its psychosomatic healing

1056
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,920
influence. If you're listening to

1057
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,820
me now, if you hear my voice

1058
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,860
on the radio, I want you to feel

1059
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,860
the inner power of your own Slack

1060
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,820
center. I want you to stand

1061
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,640
up from where you're sitting now

1062
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,580
and come over to the radio

1063
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,920
where you hear my voice reaching out

1064
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,920
to you. I want to heal

1065
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,960
your lifeless Slack center, brothers

1066
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,140
and sisters, and make your brain

1067
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,100
whole again.

1068
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,000
If you hear me now, brothers and sisters,

1069
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,940
I want you to come close to the radio

1070
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,820
I want you to lean over

1071
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,980
and put your head on the

1072
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,000
radio. That's right, brothers

1073
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,020
and sisters. I want you to put

1074
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,960
your head on the radio and

1075
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,920
feel the healing power from my

1076
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,020
voice. I want to reach out

1077
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,940
to your Slack center. I want

1078
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,820
you to feel every brain cell

1079
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,300
in your Slack center awaken

1080
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,000
and rise up reborn in the

1081
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,980
glorious light of the subgenius

1082
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,320
personality reorder.

1083
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,040
Well, I used to be a sinner

1084
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,840
cause I truly did

1085
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,840
believe that the Virgin

1086
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,740
married Jesus and

1087
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,380
me worth the gas thieves.

1088
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,080
And I used to give my doly

1089
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,500
to evangelistic

1090
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,660
snobs. But then the light had

1091
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,800
shone upon me and I found

1092
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,860
J.R. Bob Dobbs. And now my

1093
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,760
wallet belongs

1094
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,920
to Bob.

1095
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,340
Yes, my wallet

1096
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,900
belongs to Bob.

1097
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,700
Well, my

1098
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,860
heart is for my honey and

1099
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,700
my brain is for my job.

1100
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,100
But my wallet

1101
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,880
belongs to Bob.

1102
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,680
Well, Bobby goes a

1103
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,700
frappin' every chance that he

1104
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,960
can get. He can outperform

1105
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,540
the biggest without

1106
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,240
even breaking sweat.

1107
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,860
So I gave him all my money.

1108
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,800
Reverend Stang said it was

1109
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,560
right. And for only

1110
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,800
$20 he did save

1111
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,580
my soul.

1112
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,540
So my wallet belongs

1113
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,960
to Bob.

1114
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,100
Yes, my wallet

1115
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,300
belongs to Bob.

1116
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,000
No more can the

1117
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,740
curacy my lowly

1118
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,080
wages rob. Cause my wallet

1119
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,440
belongs

1120
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,280
to Bob.

1121
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,700
Oh, friends

1122
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,000
and thanks to Sister Melodious

1123
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,940
Chops for that song. My wallet

1124
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,360
belongs to Bob.

1125
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,820
And thanks to Dr. Neuroberger

1126
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,760
who you heard just before that

1127
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,280
from the old subgenius

1128
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,480
Media Barrage number 12 tape

1129
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,320
which we've played quite a bit of.

1130
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,420
And little bits and pieces of our old

1131
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,180
pledge tape.

1132
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,700
You've heard many

1133
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,600
of subgenius preacher's voice popping

1134
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,680
in and out tonight. And we'd

1135
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,680
love it if you could hear more next

1136
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,600
week. If we're not

1137
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,860

00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,800

pledge

1141
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,800

00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,560

Time out for fun.

1194
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,840
Oh, we are out of there.

1195
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,940
Oh, that is my favorite song for sure.

1196
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:38,020
Oh, we're out of that Belfast battle zone.

1197
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:43,540
Slave driver drove his tank into his reserved parking spot

1198
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:48,400
and stepped out looking like Margaret Thatcher.

1199
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,700
The war was on.

1200
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:59,120
Ah, the keys on the typewriter had sharp points that kept sticking into our fingers.

1201
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:04,380
The dictating equipment started asking us questions.

1202
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:11,960
And our beepers sent electric shocks just through our body like a cattle prod.

1203
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,520
Out in the wind.

1204
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,320
Our air house, the trucks kept banging into the docks.

1205
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,480
Not even thinking about stopping.

1206
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,460
Oh, our frail bodies were strapped to the chairs.

1207
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,080
And our chairs were chained to the desks.

1208
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:33,000
Our pleas for justice were ignored.

1209
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,000
And the end seemed near.

1210
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,000
But we busted our Margaret Thatcher.

1211
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,940
Slave driver's little bitty balls.

1212
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,540
We've charged our little brick fortress.

1213
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:58,140
The streets are ours because it's Friday.

1214
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:00,960
Friday.

1215
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,020
Friday.

Friday.

1217
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,480
But you see, it doesn't matter.

1218
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,840
It doesn't matter how sinful you are.

1219
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,160
It don't matter how much you've had to kiss ass

1220
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,780
On some ignorant lout who happens to make more money than you.

1221
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,140
