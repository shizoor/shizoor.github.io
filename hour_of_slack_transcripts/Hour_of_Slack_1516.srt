1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
What's the name of this place?

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,180
The Salt Genius!

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,920
Watch!

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,180
Now!

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,300
I have absolutely heard of that place.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,800
Sounds like a school for Neanderthals.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,900
No, it's actually considered the Harvard of kindergartens.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,620
We found a sweet haven of sunshine at last

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,140
The exes are biting above

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,060
They'll scoop us with tentacles luridly cast

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,780
And smoothly they'll sell us some love

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,260
The tempest is our relief evermore

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,900
What slackness, what rupture is not

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,980
The danger will pass

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
We're rescued at last

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,000
The Indies are here by and by

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,640
He sees us endangered and sends out his men

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,400
To pilot our ping-baiting soul

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,920
The Inclans have teased us again and again

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,880
But this one's the true Rufus Toll

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,780
The tempest is our relief evermore

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,920
The tempest is our relief evermore

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,920
What slackness, what rupture is not

24
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,500
The danger will pass

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,260
We're rescued at last

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,840
The Indies are here by and by

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,020
We're rescued at last

28
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,140
Scrant's jail control made through lightning death

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,380
On Bob all my money all speddened

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,560
All praise him each hour of my last fleeting breath

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,520
Repentance slack off to the end

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,860
The tempest is our relief evermore

33
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,040
The tempest is our relief evermore

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,240
We're rescued at last

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,240


36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,400
What slackness, what rupture is not

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,880
The danger will pass

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,160
We're rescued at last

39
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,420
The Indies are here by and by

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,360
The tempest is off

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,300
We're safe evermore

42
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,440
What slackness, what rupture is not

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,900
The danger will pass

44
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,220
The tempest is our relief evermore

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,560
We're rescued at last

46
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,220
The Indies are here by and by

47
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,400
We start with nothing

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
Nothing, nothing

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
Nothing, nothing

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,540
Nothing, nothing

51
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,220
Nothing, nothing

52
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,620
Nothing, nothing

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,320
Nothing, nothing

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,040
Nothing, nothing, nothing

55
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,360
With a rainy day in mind

56
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,460
The sun will rise in the morning

57
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,960
Sure as every night it sets

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,180
Maybe there'll be no warning

59
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,700
From the men from Planet X

60
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,740
Who knows who might be next?

61
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,580
Who knows you might be next?

62
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,580
Who knows anyone's guess?

63
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,760
Who knows?

64
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,920
Hated all of it

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,480
Who knows?

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,260
It might soon be you

67
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,320
Who knows?

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,140
It could be me too

69
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,200
Who knows?

70
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,020
When your time is time

71
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,180
Who knows?

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
If heaven is here

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,440
It's been one hell of a ride

74
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,460
We start with nothing

75
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,660
And leave everything behind

76
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,300
No point in waiting

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,760
In saving

78
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,820
With a rainy day in mind

79
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,900
The sun will rise in the morning

80
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,400
Sure as every night it sets

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,580
Maybe there'll be no warning

82
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,240
From the men from Planet X

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,180
Who knows who might be next?

84
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,020
Who knows you might be next?

85
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,520
Who knows?

86
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,940
You might be next?

87
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,360
Who knows?

88
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,360
Hated all of it

89
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Who knows?

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,720
It might soon be you

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,840
Who knows?

92
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,580
It could be me too

93
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,640
Who knows?

94
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,400
When your time is time

95
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,580
Who knows?

96
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,920
If heaven is here

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,060
It's been one hell of a ride

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,260
Leave everything behind

99
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,760
Behind

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
Behind

101
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,080
Behind

102
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,160


103
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,440
Who knows?

104
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,080
Who knows?

105
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,220
Hey, you want to see a magical type trick?

106
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,360
You want to see it here?

107
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,020
Watch it.

108
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,160
I'm going to do it.

109
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,060
Behold!

110
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,120
Just show me a trick.

111
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,960
You want to do a step?

112
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,020
Yeah, not everybody can do that, huh?

113
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,620
Show trick.

114
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,660
Impressed, eh?

115
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,500
Sure, okay, I'm impressed.

116
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,940
Can you teach me magic, man?

117
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,980
Can you show me how you did that trick?

118
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,140
Oh, well, you know.

119
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,640
The magician doesn't like to reveal how he does his tricks.

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,440
I mean, that takes all the glamour away.

121
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,200
It's rather simple when you find out what it is.

122
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,600
To see the magic makes the magic go away.

123
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,500
Well, to see the behind the scenes, yes.

124
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,700
Then certainly whatever you get for being an insider,

125
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,020
you lose in your guileless appreciation of some magician's.

126
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,700
Uh-huh.

127
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,140
Yeah.

128
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
You know, you can fire some cliches and...

129
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,660
Something's not right.

130
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
Something is just not right.

131
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,440
The magic land of Alakazam.

132
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,800
It's because you're missing the A's.

133
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
Oh, Betty, Betty.

134
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,380
These things.

135
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,920
These things?

136
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,160
Have you got some more of them B's things?

137
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,420
These tings, man.

138
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,600
Oh, it gives you a tingle, yeah.

139
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,120
Tings, yeah, tings.

140
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,280
But this is different.

141
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,400
All these tings.

142
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,620
This is something different.

143
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,320
These B tings.

144
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,340
These tings.

145
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,220
It hurts.

146
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,180
Honey badgers don't care.

147
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,480
Honey badgers have a tough little skin.

148
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:08,720
Well, imagine the tremendous danger a Kryptonian honey badger would represent.

149
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,860
They're masters of mayhem, too.

150
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,180
I don't think they had those on Krypton.

151
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,320
They had all sorts of weird, bizarre creatures, but no honey badgers.

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,500
But, of course, they'd all be horrendously strong here.

153
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:23,840
Uh-huh.

154
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,000
Uh-huh.

155
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,380
Uh-huh.

156
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,380
Including the miniaturized ones in the bottle city of Kandor, though they were only about

157
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,860
as big as a...

158
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,000
Miniature honey badgers.

159
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,980
...a flea's foot.

160
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,880
They would still be strong enough, in theory, to move the Earth.

161
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,820
What do you think they did about animal control in the bottle city of Kandor?

162
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,840
They must have had some way of controlling, keeping those creatures in the Kryptonian zoo

163
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,940
in the bottle.

164
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,780
Well, not just that.

165
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,440
What about rats and mice and things like that?

166
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,720
Oh, they're in a good, thick glass bottle.

167
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,580
No rats and mice.

168
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,840
No, but I'm talking about the tiny little mini rats and mice that came...

169
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,700
The vermin that came along with the city.

170
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,700
But, again, I don't know if Krypton had creatures like rats and mice.

171
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,420
Are you saying that it was...

172
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,860
That Krypton couldn't support a full ecological biodiversity that would have included even

173
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,680
vermin and scavengers?

174
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,920
Well, the thing is, I remember what was in the Krypton Zoo, and all those creatures were

175
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,200
so weird that they didn't seem to be broken down into the divisions that we have on Earth.

176
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,380
Right.

177
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,500
Right.

178
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:23,820
Right.

179
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:23,820


180
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:23,820


181
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:23,820


182
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:23,820


183
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:23,820


184
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:23,820


185
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:23,820


186
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:23,820


187
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,540
All the exotic creatures.

188
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm really just talking about the common creatures.

189
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:26,920
Sure.

190
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,040
They're not going to put rabbits in the zoo.

191
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,560
They're going to put some exotic creatures.

192
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,520
Or even possums.

193
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,140
You know, the possums are hanging around the sewer in Krypton.

194
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:34,780
They're not...

195
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,600
Or in, you know, whatever the...

196
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,620
What was the main city that they lived in?

197
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,960
I can't remember the city's name.

198
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,560
Well, Kandor itself was a city, but...

199
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,980
Well, the city on Krypton...

200
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,500
Hey, you've got a mosquito on your head.

201
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,400
There you go.

202
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,880
You got it.

203
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
How dare they?

204
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,640
How did that happen?

205
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,080
It's probably a disease-ridden one.

206
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,900
Yes, he's probably...

207
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,460
Is it experimental?

208
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,580
He injected me with...

209
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,120
He probably broke out of an experiment.

210
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,900
I haven't been feeling too well lately anyway, so I'm assuming...

211
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,540
And now you don't...

212
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,800
Was he biting me?

213
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,640
I don't think he'd actually sunk his proboscis into your face yet.

214
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,740
That little bastard, if I catch him again, I...

215
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,520
Oh, is this on?

216
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,280
Yeah, that's on, but...

217
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:16,520
Well, I suppose since this is KPV, I should speak of my reverence for all living things.

218
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,660
You're listening to KFV.

219
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,120
Yes, I was involved on part of the same...

220
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,940
You, the listener.

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,180
...lake pilgrimage through life.

222
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,560
And so...

223
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,100
Some of you on KPFB, do you think people actually listen to KPFB in Berkeley?

224
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,780
Oh, I know they do, my dear friend.

225
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,760
Because they have KPFA.

226
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,700
Why would they choose B if they have A?

227
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,040
Because that is the nature of people, to wish to differentiate their choices.

228
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,740
I think one of them is for when you're behind a tree and the reception's better, you know?

229
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,380
And then, of course, if you're in Fresno, you have to be at 88.1 on KFC.

230
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,560
You know how all this works.

231
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,000
I guess you sound very knowledgeable about...

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,740
Oh, yeah, I know that you have to have four letters and at least two numbers.

233
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,920
Although I never hear about, like, you know, 100 FM.

234
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,120
It's always 101 or 101.

235
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,600
That's your special buzzword, I mean, your password that you use to unlock the mystery.

236
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,200
Mm-hmm.

237
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,200
They never say 90 FM or, you know...

238
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,700
It's never a round number.

239
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,060
It's always, you know, goes to some point.

240
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,260
Some fractional point on the dial.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,240
Yeah, you should know why.

242
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,000
There's a very good reason.

243
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,300
The same reason gas is always 399.

244
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,540
Because the government has to put some points on the end.

245
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,400
That's why.

246
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,900
No, it's a sales trick.

247
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,900
Come on.

248
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,140
89.3?

249
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,380
You mean it's not just because that's where they cut the frequency range?

250
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,380
Nope.

251
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,320
And the megahertz are measured that way?

252
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,700
No.

253
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,580
The megahertz is to sell the numbers.

254
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,940
But what about the gigahertz and the terahertz?

255
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,260
It all hurts.

256
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,680
The bigahertz.

257
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,940
It all hurts.

258
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,720
There's no differentiation.

259
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,600
Unless you're Honey Badger.

260
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,240
Nothing hurts.

261
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,360
No, if you've got a good, tough, pachydermatous skin like a little Honey Badger,

262
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,640
and the unpleasant disposition of a Honey Badger to go with it...

263
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm kidding.

264
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,160
They have got...

265
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,400
They're fierce little guys.

266
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,280
I don't know if their disposition is that unpleasant.

267
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,260
They're just not that cuddly, and so that's resented by humans who...

268
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,740
Humans hate ugly animals, don't they, Dr. Howell?

269
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,040
Well, they like little fuzzy animals.

270
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,000
They like the fuzzy ones to be fellow travelers and to get in line and not act out of, you know...

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,820
But they won't invest in the preservation of the mosquito.

272
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,080
Why they do.

273
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,820
Because, once again, as I was saying before,

274
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,760
agriculture makes it possible for the mosquitoes to live,

275
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,920
and malaria comes after agriculture.

276
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,040
Rice has to be grown in standing water.

277
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
They can't think beyond their own...

278
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,960
The perfect place for these insects.

279
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,800
...to develop.

280
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,300
Are you familiar with the appearance of a mosquito larva?

281
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,360
As a child, I always observed these things with wonder.

282
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,400
For one thing, it's larger than the adult mosquito, right?

283
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,040
And it's all jointed with all these...

284
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,280
I mean, it's a hideous, horrible thing.

285
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,160
It's a hideous, horrible thing.

286
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,580
It is.

287
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,300
Well...

288
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,580
So are maggots, though.

289
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,860
Maggots, maggots, maggots.

290
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,960
But maggots have...

291
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,640
Those sort of intermediate stages of a lot of animals.

292
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,640
Maggots have great use in treating...

293
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,340
They have open wounds.

294
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,320
If you just pour maggots into the wound,

295
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,760
they eat all the necrotic flesh and leave the healthy flesh alone,

296
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,700
so you are...

297
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,720
That's generally what I do when I have a big necrotic wound that needs...

298
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,640
Just dump maggots in it.

299
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:34,980
...needs cleaning.

300
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,220
I dump maggots in it.

301
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,700
Right.

302
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,380
That's the thing.

303
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,780
I've always done that to every necrotic wound I've ever had.

304
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,780
Really?

305
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,580
Even, like, a sucking chest wound?

306
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,060
Well, I've got to hand it to you.

307
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,320
And here it is.

308
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:50,840
No.

309
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,420
Okay, thanks.

310
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,500
All sticky.

311
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,520
Now, what do I do with it?

312
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,020
You can put it in the disposable chute over there.

313
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,420
Okay.

314
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,640
I won't need it anymore.

315
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,980
It's kind of been used.

316
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,540
It's got some dirt on it over here.

317
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,960
Don't toss and turn all night with spiders in your hair.

318
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,480
On the pseudo-carpet.

319
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,580
I wish that thing that we did earlier was about five times bigger.

320
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,700
We did a big thing, huh?

321
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,260
Yeah.

322
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,700
Well, that was...

323
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,620
I did a big thing, but only about one-fifth as big as what it should have been.

324
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,880
Well, there must have been expenses involved, you know.

325
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,840
Dr. Hal, I've got to get something off my chest, and I think I can let you know about it because you're a know-it-all.

326
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,680
Well, it's something...

327
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,860
Don't you hate it when people say,

328
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,360
that object is five times smaller than what it was, than the other object?

329
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,000
And why should I be particularly...

330
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,180
Why don't you hate it when they...

331
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:59,120
When they're talking about something that is a fraction of the other thing, that they use the word times to describe it.

332
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,560
Oh.

333
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,800
It's fractional proportion rather than the proportion itself.

334
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,280
That drives me nuts.

335
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,500
That just aggravates a lot.

336
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,160
That body in space is five...

337
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,000
There's only...

338
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,200
Instead of one-fifth as large, they say it's five times as small.

339
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,160
It's like a ridiculous series of words that mean nothing to me.

340
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,040
When I hear a scientist or some supposed person with a reputation say that,

341
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,120
it makes me want to reach through the radio and choke them to death.

342
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,180
Now, Philo, please, remember your blood pressure.

343
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,880
I'm sorry, but this is just...

344
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,120
Some people have pet peeves.

345
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,720
This is my pet peeve.

346
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:47,200
When someone refers to a body that's a smaller proportion than the other one,

347
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,180
they refer to it as some number of times smaller.

348
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,400
Oh.

349
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,540
You can't make something number of times smaller.

350
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,600
A times is a multiple.

351
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,640
Unless you're multiplying negatives, I guess you could.

352
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,760
Well, but that would be pointless.

353
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,180
It would be pointless.

354
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,660
Yes, multiplying negatives has no future.

355
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,100
So, I've got that off my chest and I feel remarkably better.

356
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,180
Well, I am afraid that there are even a large number of subgeniuses who use that expression.

357
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,840
Well, there's...

358
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,740
There's something around chewing the fat at X day.

359
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,600
Yeah, they say that and they say I'm like...

360
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,800
Speaking of pointless, here I am.

361
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,120
Pointless?

362
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,320
Pointless, you say?

363
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm eminently an expert in the pointlessness.

364
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,820
The finer points of pointlessness.

365
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,480
Well, sometimes...

366
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,500
Well, don't you agree with my assessment of the previous statement and agree with me 100%?

367
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,200
Isn't a rounded version just as accessible as a pointed version?

368
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,760
Just minimum, at least.

369
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,000
107%.

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,400
Yes.

371
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm glad.

372
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:52,880
I'm really...

373
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,320
Subliminally, minimally.

374
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,700
Not only do you agree with me, you agree with me more than I even agree with myself.

375
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,980
Yes, that's tricky, isn't it?

376
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,500
It is tricky and it's awesome.

377
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,340
I appreciate that.

378
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,720
I want that ahead of you.

379
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,940
I appreciate that because...

380
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,120
Harmony in nature.

381
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,760
Someday I'm going to appreciate me as much as you do.

382
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,400
Is expressed through privileges.

383
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,600
Now, I have a question though.

384
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,960
But chaos and destruction are expressed through points and angles.

385
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,140
I'm just nabobbing about a thank you to the listener.

386
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,700
How do you know you have a listener?

387
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,100
And how do you know if they're actually listening?

388
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,460
They are theological.

389
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,300
We do make a leap of faith at the point where we...

390
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,600
The second...

391
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:35,200
We know sometimes that we have a person that has engaged their computer with a stream on the internet.

392
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,220
We know that.

393
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,880
There's software that tells us that...

394
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,080
It shouldn't be on their computer.

395
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:39,780
I don't know why you're encouraging that.

396
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,560
The computer and its browser has engaged with the stream of the show.

397
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,720
Oh, the dog was...

398
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,400
The dog was your neighbor.

399
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,660
Anybody that's just out there in the ether and they're listening to their radio...

400
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,100
No, I think I understand.

401
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,160
No, I think I understand.

402
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,160


403
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,340
I have no idea what that is.

404
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,920
You said the dog was urinating on it.

405
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,940
The dog was urinating on it.

406
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,500
The browser was doing...

407
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,820
The dog was urinating on it.

408
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,520
How's still thinking about McNamara's electronic fence?

409
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,240
I'm not browsing your browser, okay?

410
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,480
The browser, we know...

411
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,360
So, we do get an indication of that.

412
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:05,860
Bad dog.

413
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,060
Bad dog.

414
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,840
We like to extrapolate that and say that...

415
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,140
Are you vindicated or cylindricated?

416
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,300
Which exactly is it?

417
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,460
It's bifurcated.

418
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,220
No, we appreciate it.

419
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,440


420
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:13,840
Uh-oh.

421
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,240
I'm not Twitterpated.

422
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,220
He's a...

423
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,020
Adelpated, more like it.

424
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,100
He's a banana split personality, apparently.

425
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,340
He's got a paint, a shiny paint.

426
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,640
He's got bananas, I tell you.

427
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,260
Is there another mosquito on me?

428
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,920
And now it's on Puzzling Evidence.

429
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,140
No, it's flying around.

430
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,520
This is utterly unacceptable.

431
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,420
I think you guys, in all fairness,

432
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,420
developed some sort of Turing-type test

433
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,060
to determine whether a listener is actually a listener.

434
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,860
If it's a real human listener or a robot listener.

435
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,780
Whether they're actually listening.

436
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,560
The listeners have to take care of themselves.

437
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,760
We have all sorts of problems.

438
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,660
We need a feedback system

439
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,200
where we can broadcast a certain number of repeated messages

440
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,820
and the listener would have to repeat them back to us.

441
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,860
And we need a mosquito-free environment

442
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,120
in order to do our show.

443
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,640
That would be a good start.

444
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,300
We're starting on Mars, I guess.

445
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,580
Too many mosquitoes in the control room.

446
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:05,880
There's a mosquito in here

447
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,040
and we're actually under attack.

448
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,440
I'm telling the listeners,

449
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,120
all of you people out there in the ether zone,

450
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,840
we're under attack by giant mosquitoes.

451
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:14,880
Get away.

452
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,600
Get them away.

453
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,600
These are Anopheles.

454
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,140
Get them off.

455
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,440
Get them off.

456
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,080
Weather one haywire.

457
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,760
These mosquitoes are deadly.

458
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,520
I'm pretty sure Mars is going to be our salvation.

459
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,040
I'll just give them a good smack.

460
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,620
Sure.

461
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,600
Sure, why not?

462
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,980
That's my blood in there.

463
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,540
That's good blood.

464
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,460
I bet you there's no dang tooting mosquitoes on Mars.

465
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,960
Maybe something a lot worse,

466
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,080
but at least we won't know what we're doing.

467
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,020
No, he's absolutely right.

468
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,900
There are no mosquitoes on Mars that toot gangs.

469
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,400
Well, you're thinking of that movie

470
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,280
where they did have mosquitoes on Mars.

471
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,720
There could be a darn toot mosquito on Mars.

472
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,560
There could be darn toot

473
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,080
and there could be two mosquitoes on Mars.

474
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,320
There could be college-educated mosquitoes,

475
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,820
but probably none that,

476
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,100
pretty much we're sure,

477
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,360
none toot gangs.

478
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,240
Well, we don't know.

479
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,500
But you don't know which college.

480
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,160
He's doing Pedro.

481
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,440
The only thing worse than a mosquito

482
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,100
is a Harvard-educated one.

483
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,620
Yeah.

484
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,100
That would be a bad thing.

485
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,080
Landing on your cerebellum.

486
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,500
A mosquito with a budget.

487
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,980
Sarah Palin or something.

488
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,680
Yeah.

489
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,700
Hey, props to the protesters at Harvard right now.

490
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,620
They're trying to get them to divest

491
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,440
from fossil foolishness.

492
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,020
And they can take up extracting sunbeams from cucumbers.

493
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,500
I think they should run on magic unicorn juice.

494
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,540
They got like trillions of dollars in investments or something.

495
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,140
They're the biggest,

496
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,460
most heavily invested university in the world

497
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,360
and most of it's in fossil fuels,

498
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,420
probably half of it.

499
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,300
I don't know.

500
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,820
Yeah, that's where the old money came from.

501
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,520
I don't know why you would be investing in fossils,

502
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,320
fuels when you've got unicorn juice.

503
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,240
What fuels we morsels be?

504
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,820
All you need is one unicorn

505
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,860
and you can power a whole country for a year.

506
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,280
One unicorn.

507
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,500
That's not a good use of it, though.

508
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,480
Well, we don't use all of the horn at once.

509
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,500
We try to just whittle off pieces of it at a time

510
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,800
so as it grows back,

511
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,660
we can continue to keep the unicorn trapped

512
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,880
in their small cage

513
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,680
and just milk, more or less,

514
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,180
milk the horn over time.

515
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,880
You say it's sustainably harvested.

516
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,320
Who am I to question you?

517
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:17,860
Yeah.

518
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,680
Yeah, I don't know.

519
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,260
Oh, who are you?

520
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,540
Take a break here for a minute

521
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,320
so we can question something else, man.

522
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,660
You're an active caller.

523
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,920
A caller that...

524
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,000
A caller ID.

525
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,060
My name is ID.

526
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,660
A caller ID.

527
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,840
And being a caller,

528
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,580
I'll tell you that we'll be right back.

529
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,760
From PR News in Washington,

530
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,500
I'm taking Yazidi women as sex slaves.

531
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,380
The Centers for Disease is ramping up its efforts

532
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,060
to protect the U.S. from West Africa.

533
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,560
The World Health Organization warns

534
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,080
that West Africa could start every week by December.

535
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,520
WHO's assistance says West Africa is already killed,

536
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,220
more than 4,400 people in recent months.

537
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,340
The numbers we need to get behind are 70% of 60

538
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,660
and 76% of October.

539
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,740
Dow is 27, 16, 46, 61, 20, 42, 34.

540
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,940
I am doing well and want to thank PR News.

541
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,360
The prosecution says this is PR News.

542
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,620
Control, control.

543
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,560
Control, control.

544
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,120
Control, control.

545
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,860
Mind controlled by Bob by Slack T

546
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,260
is playing in the background.

547
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,660
We heard some PR news from Fernanda Nantes,

548
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,160
the ladyly mer.

549
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,060
And we heard about 15 minutes

550
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,420
of the puzzling evidence show from KPFA Berkeley.

551
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,140
That particular episode,

552
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,640
Philo titled,

553
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,520
The Massive Frop Show.

554
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,800
We'll probably be playing more of that next week

555
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,380
because they continue to have trouble

556
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,800
with those mosquitoes and callers

557
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,620
if they aren't the same.

558
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,100
Before that, that song,

559
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,600
You Might Be Next,

560
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,800
that was by Max Slack from a few years ago.

561
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,020
And the very first song we heard was,

562
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,960
the bluegrass song was

563
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,060
The Mutant Mountain Boys,

564
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,120
recorded live at X Day Drill

565
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,060
of the conspiracy named year 2014.

566
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,820
In a little while,

567
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,280
we'll be talking with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

568
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,980
But before that, we'll listen,

569
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,580
well, I'm going to,

570
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,240
make you listen to the

571
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,120
Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate Rap Song.

572
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,620
But in the meantime,

573
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,400
back to Slack T.

574
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,060
Slepti.

575
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,880
Sleep.

576
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,340


577
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,340


578
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,340
Sleep.

579
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,920
Sleep.

580
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,000
Sleep.

581
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,500
Sleep.

582
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,120
Sleep.

583
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,320
Thank you.

584
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,860
Thank you.

585
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,860
Thank you.

586
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
Thank you.

587
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,380
Thank you.

588
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,980
Thank you.

589
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,160
Thank you.

590
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,020
Thank you.

591
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,100
Thank you.

592
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,220
Thank you.

593
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,740
Thank you.

594
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,380
Thank you.

595
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,640
Thank you.

596
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,040
Thank you.

597
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,280
Thank you.

598
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,660
My voice would have sounded better singing the backup on the Monster Hunter song.

599
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,000
I can hear you, but it sounded like you were on the other side of the room.

600
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,340
Aw, well.

601
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,460
I didn't really realize that that mic there isn't working.

602
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,920
I didn't realize that either.

603
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,060
The other mics are, but...

604
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,080
Yes, this one is apparently working.

605
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,900
Plankets are important.

606
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,680
Give me something.

607
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,160
Rubber blankets?

608
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,920
Yeah, I'll take a rubber blanket.

609
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
I'll take a number of them.

610
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,460
As many as you've got.

611
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,200
And even prosthetic, oh, like wooden prosthetic devices from the Crimean War.

612
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,000
Stuff like that, you know, where the originals, I mean, not the aborigines, but the generals.

613
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:37,900
Well, you know, Princess Wee was quoting a famous aphorism from the Book of the Subgenius

614
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,440
that was originally uttered by the late Dr. X.

615
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,980
It went like this.

616
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,860
I can't decipher anything.

617
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,560
Put me where you want me.

618
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,520
Give me rubber blankets.

619
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,720
I called it the drunkard's lament.

620
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,200
Because that was something he actually said.

621
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:56,880
Yes.

622
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,840
I was like, you know, come on, Dr. X, you gotta go.

623
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,440
I mean, it's time for bed.

624
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,520
People are already marking you up with markers because you're passed out at this party.

625
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,940
And he goes, I can't decipher anything.

626
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,800
Put me where you want me.

627
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,220
Give me rubber blankets.

628
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,740
Well, he was already familiar with rubber blankets.

629
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,900
And, you know, he went to New Jersey.

630
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,760
He went to the hometown institute for quite a few years.

631
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,560
He was also drummed out of the courts.

632
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,320
Oh, those are all rumors.

633
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,180
Yeah, but it was a regular rate.

634
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,180
So, you know, it didn't jar him too hard.

635
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,240
The fact that he wanted to join the Merleville's later and become a civilian autocrat after that

636
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,740
makes me wonder if he's from planet Earth.

637
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,160
Well, I got to get off this planet's kick.

638
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,160
I have a deep desire to jump ship tonight.

639
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,380
Get to some place where everything's...

640
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,080
There's glue and ego and...

641
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,260
Speaking of jumping ship or spaceship Earth,

642
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,980
actually, I have several things I could read from about that.

643
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:07,340
Remember last week we got this book of this dissertation by Reverend Lee Seifer

644
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,980
that was about the rhetorical ripples, Church of the Subgenius,

645
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,820
Kenneth Burke and comic symbolic tinkering?

646
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,900
I read...

647
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,420
Here's some more fancy talk.

648
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,240
Here's some more fancy talk and it involves the end of the world too.

649
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:30,820
Burke concludes that the result of this quantified rational order, that is civilization,

650
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,480
has been a crop of, quote,

651
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,280
new material and moral resources that after nearly half a millennium

652
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,580
seem to have been exploited to the point where they in turn are nearing their Malthusian limits, unquote.

653
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,780
Now...

654
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,220
Now, subgenius teaching in Revelation X acknowledges our impact on the environment

655
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:56,940
and urges us to imagine being exploited by satirically...

656
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,640
I gotta look up that word.

657
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:09,340
Satirically casting humanity as little more than toxin generators for exploitive intergalactic alien industry.

658
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:15,260
And then it's a quote from Revelation X that I probably read.

659
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,760
Oh, that guy was probably...

660
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,820
Probably artichoke back in 1978 when the project...

661
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,260
Over the aeons, aliens...

662
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,960
No, oh, this should be in my voice.

663
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,160
Over the aeons, aliens have been sending planets across the universe...

664
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,940
Let me start that again.

665
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,440
Take two.

666
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,080
Yeah, yeah.

667
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,920
Get in character.

668
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:39,420
Over the aeons, aliens have been seeding planets across the universe with humans.

669
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,320
There is tremendous intergalactic demand for planets having atmospheres ripe,

670
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,960
with deadly hydrocarbons, pollution, and heavy metal contaminants.

671
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:59,520
It was long ago and far away discovered that if one takes a nice virgin carbon-oxygen planet

672
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,880
of the right specifications, puts a few thousand humans on it,

673
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,400
and leaves it alone for a couple of hundred thousand years,

674
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,620
upon return, it will be a wonderfully contaminated hell planet,

675
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,560
a veritable cornucopia of synthetic poison.

676
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,480
The aliens then transfer the few surviving humans, the most ruthless ones,

677
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:27,660
to a fresh planet to begin the process anew.

678
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,400
Oh, yes.

679
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:36,340
Well, so the bad-doers, the evil-doers are kind of semi, like, immortal or something?

680
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,620
And also, I forgot what a Malthusian argument was.

681
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:46,440
Well, human intelligence and technological progress is such that we have an international space station

682
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,820
continually orbiting the Earth, and we have a spacecraft exploring beyond our solar system,

683
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:58,020
yet we continue to struggle with basic solvable problems, like environmental degradation.

684
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,000
Human intelligence has yet to keep our hubris in check

685
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,360
and prevent us from unnecessarily contaminating our only source of life.

686
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,620
Oh, well, we knew that, as Philo had the answer earlier in the show.

687
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,360
Unicorn juice.

688
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,300
Unicorn juice will run...

689
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,260
...run everything forever, peacefully, and without polluting.

690
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,040
That's right.

691
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,060
...safe for kids.

692
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,320
It's a beautiful substance, a milky kind of blue-green.

693
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,580
It's wonderful stuff.

694
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,180
Yes.

695
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,600
Unicorn juice.

696
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,200
Oh, yes.

697
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,100
Oh.

698
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:33,620
Oh.

699
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,400
Oh.

700
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:41,680
I find the juice machines to be quite reprehensible, though, and I was gonna call PETA or somebody.

701
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,140
Don't.

702
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,120
Don't call PETA.

703
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,180
Don't call PETA.

704
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,380
No.

705
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,620
PETA is a very unhospitable kind of tyrannical and subterfuge in its tube.

706
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,440
Can you imagine stuffing a whole baby unicorn into its tube?

707
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,560
No, no, no, no.

708
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:05,220
The unicorn juice is an extract that is made from the urine of the unicorn.

709
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:05,860
What?

710
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,280
Yes.

711
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:06,840
What?

712
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,760
Unicorn juice is an extract of the urine of the juice.

713
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,580
Of the...

714
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,000
I thought you milked the horn.

715
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,560
No.

716
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,140
No, no.

717
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,800
I thought you put one in your squisher and then, you know, just drain off the material

718
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,960
stuff and add the juice.

719
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,220
It's a distillation.

720
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,700
Anybody have a napkin or a glass of water?

721
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,360
A distillation.

722
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,080
I've got coffee in the other room.

723
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:35,220
Well, couldn't they conceivably, with nanotechnology, take that unicorn uterus and place it into

724
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,600
another much further and further away than the one that they already were talking to?

725
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,700
Because those guys get confused, especially when they're in those, like, sample groups,

726
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,700
you know, like at the mall.

727
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,160
Did you enjoy product so and so?

728
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,780
It's very wonderful.

729
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,760
Here, put, you know...

730
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,220
Is it like that?

731
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,600
Yes.

732
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,620
Try my tincture of unicorn horn juice.

733
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,080
Well, it would be like, did you find the unicorn...

734
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,340
Tincture of unicorn juice.

735
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
Lovable, smarmy, sweet.

736
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,320
You know, you check these different boxes.

737
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,120
And then you jump up and you start smashing the pen against the pad.

738
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,660
And you run out and you scream epithets.

739
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:15,680
And you say, I'm going to get a new one.

740
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:15,680


741
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:15,680


742
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:15,680


743
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:15,680


744
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:15,680


745
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:15,680


746
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:15,680


747
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,320
And you scream epithets as you leave.

748
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,520
Well, that's all beside the point because we're not going to get any unicorn juice.

749
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,780
All we're going to get is more Bab.

750
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,800
There's always more Bab out there.

751
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,240
Bab.

752
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,780
I have a little poem about Bab.

753
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,560
Poem?

754
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,120
Yeah, it was...

755
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,440
Are you mocking the northeastern Ohio accent, specifically the Buffalo...

756
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,480
No.

757
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,260
Buffalo...

758
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,840
I'm mocking all civilization.

759
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,760
This lady...

760
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,220
Bab.

761
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,040
Bab.

762
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:53,060
This person, name of Ann Glenn, if that really is its name.

763
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,800
Boy, it could be Ann Glenn for all we know.

764
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Now they're speaking of another headless wonder.

765
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,680
The book of the subgenius and decided to write a poem based on the book.

766
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,240
Now, so this is partly her...

767
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,860
This is her additions to the Bob chapter in Book of the Subgenius, okay?

768
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,800
And this is real cute.

769
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,160
I think y'all will like this.

770
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,600
Bob.

771
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:15,880
Okay.

772
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,200
Okay.

773
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,460
Bob is the money a sucker spends.

774
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,740
He can be your toilet paper when you wipe your rear end.

775
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,000
Bob is war.

776
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,460
Bob is peace.

777
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,340
Bob is the president.

778
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,200
He's the Indian chief.

779
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,620
The key to the gateway is Bob's pipe.

780
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,180
He's the fool of the universe, a tomato that's overripe.

781
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,480
He's the laxative of the world.

782
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
He's victory without a battle.

783
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,260
Bob is the money.

784
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,940
Bob is a baby's rattle.

785
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,100
He is the great work that sleeps.

786
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,260
He's silence in the noise.

787
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,680
Bob is Santa Claus who brings good kids their toys.

788
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,980
Bob is the phoenix rising.

789
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,640
He's the black goat of the woods.

790
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,420
He's heaven's perfect policeman, a policeman in heaven's hoods.

791
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,140
He's the sucker born every minute.

792
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,920
He's the bank in which money is locked.

793
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,620
Bob is your neighborhood.

794
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,840
Bob lives on everyone's block.

795
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,340
He's companionship when no one is there.

796
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,420
He won't laugh when he sees you in your underwear.

797
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,240
Bob is the friend who will never let you down.

798
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,440
Bob is the circus.

799
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,740
Bob is a clown.

800
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,920
Bob is your dad.

801
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,040
Bob is your brother.

802
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,420
In a weird way, Bob is even your mother.

803
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,440
Bob is a rock.

804
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,480
Bob is a tree.

805
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,740
Bob is you.

806
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,520
And Bob is me.

807
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,760
Says Anne Glenn, quoting the Book of the Subgenius.

808
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,740
Book of the Subgenius.

809
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,920
Bob's your uncle.

810
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,760
Bob is your...

811
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

812
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,780
She left that one out.

813
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,720
But that was, see, that wasn't, we didn't know about Bob's, Bob's uncle.

814
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,480
Bob's your uncle.

815
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,920
When we did the Book of the Subgenius.

816
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,980
Ah, I see.

817
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,880
That was because of the putrescence at the time.

818
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:21,740
You said you had a mole with a split hair on the end of it or something like that.

819
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,540
And that the, the Garbanians, or not the Armenians, but the real Garbanians had been making threatening

820
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:34,340
phone calls in your direction to try to get you to stop what you're doing in the Ministry

821
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:34,820
of Bob.

822
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,960
Yeah, well, they...

823
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,580
That's some serious stuff right there, especially if you're from Illinois.

824
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:40,700
Yeah.

825
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,100
Putrescence.

826
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:55,560
A putrescence, meaning it was not just putrescent, that it was an oozing thing itself of putrescence.

827
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:55,840
Yeah.

828
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,320
Dave, I had a quote from the news I wanted to run by you and run over you with it.

829
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,580
Okay, I'll slam.

830
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,080
Well, it was, I'm kind of paraphrasing a little bit.

831
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,680
But Paul Ryan, who's good at...

832
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:10,680


833
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,040
He's going to be running for president.

834
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,800
He was saying that basically that poor cities like Baltimore are stuck that way because

835
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,100
welfare pays too well.

836
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:29,260
In other words, the poor are so rich that they have no incentive to become...

837
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,320
Well, the whole thing, I'm just lost when I...

838
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,200
So am I.

839
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,320
It's too lucrative to be on welfare for them to get off welfare.

840
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,660
Now, I've heard...

841
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,140
I've heard that.

842
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,340
And so I always go, well, why don't you get on welfare?

843
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,340
And they go, well, because I don't want to live in a box.

844
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,240
But all I know is every time I see them buying fancy foods using food stamps and I can't

845
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,340
afford them fancy foods.

846
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,220
Well, it's like, why don't you get on welfare?

847
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,540
I don't want to live in a box.

848
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,300
But they're too rich.

849
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,040
It's like, well, look, they decided to spend their food on, I mean, spend their money on

850
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,760
sushi instead of a roof for their box.

851
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,200
Yeah.

852
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,980
And so, you know, it's one or the other.

853
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,480
I don't know.

854
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,800
All of life is a choice.

855
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,120
All I know is the poor are rich and the poor rich get blamed for it.

856
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,540
Those poor rich people.

857
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,680
I know.

858
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,680
It's really sad the way they treat rich people in this country.

859
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,460
The 1% are really, really caring, loving...

860
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,400
The 1%, you mean the subgeniuses?

861
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,400
No, not the subgeni.

862
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:38,680
Yeah.

863
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,200
Because subgeniuses are also only 1% of America.

864
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,200
And you know, America is 5% of the whole world's population.

865
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,520
And you know what makes us the greatest?

866
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,320
We've got one quarter of the entire world's jail population.

867
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,080
And that's what I like about it.

868
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,440
You and the Texans.

869
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,100
Have crazy people like, you know, come around and rattle their cages all the time, make

870
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,260
them do stuff, beat them up.

871
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:14,060
Of course, some of them are genuinely bad people, should be treated genuinely badly,

872
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:14,520
perhaps.

873
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,380
I don't know.

874
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,480
I'm not a sport when it comes to ethics and violations of morality.

875
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:26,080
But I do think one thing, if you accept Bob as...

876
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,960
What should we accept him as?

877
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:28,660
Bab?

878
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:29,900
Bab.

879
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,540
If you accept Bob as Bab...

880
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,740
Is that the way it goes?

881
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,080
Yeah, Bab.

882
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,220
You accept Bob into your mind.

883
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,860
Into your heart.

884
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,000
Into your heart and mind and soul.

885
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,460
Into your very being.

886
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,120
Down to your toes, where your feet can...

887
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,220
Any place you can find, like maybe in your hair, in the dendrites...

888
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,680
Oh, did I already talk about the dendrites in your head?

889
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,040
The spinal fluids.

890
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:53,520
Everywhere.

891
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,840
He's in our spinal fluid.

892
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,220
And that's all I got to say.

893
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,380
I'll bet you're lying about that, aren't you, Dave?

894
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,440
No, but I've been drinking a lot of spinal fluid lately, and I knew it would taste like.

895
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,940
If you know what I mean.

896
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,840
Well, I knew it wasn't all about spinal fluid.

897
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,600
It wasn't all you had to say, is what I'm saying.

898
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,160
Well, I know, but all those words didn't amount to a hell of anything.

899
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,980
That's what makes me want to cry.

900
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:17,980
But I don't know.

901
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,140
You were talking about subgenius soul, and that is in your foot.

902
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,300
So, what's the complication?

903
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,260
I don't get it.

904
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,300
No, there's no complication with that part whatsoever.

905
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,480
The soles of the feet is a wonderful place to hang the soul, so to speak.

906
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:37,820
But I think people who've actually hanged up some of their religious lives, they're

907
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:46,120
religious leaders in the future, in the past, to pay heed to where the soul is truly found.

908
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,620
I'll just make it short, you know, truly found.

909
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,460
That's just the bees keep at it every day.

910
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,300
I can dig that.

911
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,780
Princess, we went to one of them smoke-ins last Saturday.

912
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,720
Uh-huh.

913
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,020
She went to the...

914
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:05,980
I went to the normal rally.

915
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:06,880
She went over to the normal.

916
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,740
Yes, she went.

917
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,020
We went normal.

918
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,840
Princess, we went normal.

919
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:10,660
Yes.

920
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,140
You know, Mr. Sister, when he started reading my report on you going to the normal march,

921
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,520
he went, oh, no, it's gay and lesbian transgender stuff.

922
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,240
You're kidding.

923
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:22,740
No.

924
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:28,040
And then I explained at the end of it, by the way, normal means National Organization

925
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,900
for Reform of Marijuana Laws.

926
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,220
Good.

927
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,460
He can't even remember the acronyms.

928
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,800
When you take your finger and shove it in your ear canal...

929
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,780
Now, that hard, that's what happens to you.

930
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,020
And I hope nothing...

931
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,500
Well, no, he said, oh, it's marijuana.

932
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,440
Well, that's okay.

933
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,300
But see, let me clarify.

934
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,840
Well, it is okay, at least.

935
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,460
Princess, we don't care about marijuana.

936
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,980
We're froppers.

937
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,520
So we really...

938
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,600
Why would we mess with street drugs like that?

939
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:04,060
But, Princess, we did understand that the people at that festival would be part of the

940
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,020
audience that would be interested in the Starweed...

941
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,880
I mean, Starwood Festival.

942
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:18,680
The Starwood Festival, which happens to happen right after the world ends every year at the

943
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,200
same place where we gather for the end of the world at Wisteria Campground.

944
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,420
And in their case, it's the second week of July.

945
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:30,940
And it'll be held aboard my escape saucer, Dobbs Willing.

946
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:36,900
But if we got our dates wrong again, it'll be at the same campground as X Day, only they're

947
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,940
more hippies there.

948
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:38,600
Yeesh.

949
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:46,020
And that's why we weren't handing out X Day postcards at the free weed rally.

950
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,220
Not free weed.

951
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,600
Free the weed.

952
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,760
Yeah, free the weed.

953
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,600
But I understand.

954
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:58,460
I mean, there were people just smoking right out there on the street, weren't there?

955
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:58,540
Well, yes.

956
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,240
Did you see it?

957
00:48:59,380 --> 00:48:59,480
That does happen.

958
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,440
I did see it.

959
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,280
Yes, I did.

960
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,480
That's where you're bailing, Mr. Hillman.

961
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,880
And you once again...

962
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


963
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


964
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:13,800
I tried to win the contest, the oregano rolling contest, and only this time.

965
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,740
Last year, she got second place.

966
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,020
But this year, she only got third place.

967
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,740
Oh, because the winner was so pretty.

968
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,700
That's what it was.

969
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,480
Well, she came in second.

970
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,080
Her sticks that she rolled were terrible.

971
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:26,700
They were really loose.

972
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,940
They were unusable.

973
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:28,820
Unusable.

974
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,720
But she was...

975
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,360
She was cute and young.

976
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,500
Right, and so, well, there you go.

977
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,280
So, I came in third instead of second.

978
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,520
Doggone it.

979
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,780
So rather than the speed of the rolling technique,

980
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:45,400
they were judging for the extreme beauty and the physical body marks and stuff like that?

981
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,560
No, not in theory, but in practice, that's what happens.

982
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,600
It would have to be both.

983
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,960
You have to be fast, and they have to be a usable, workable cigarette when you're done.

984
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,800
So you could produce neither because you have no experience with that.

985
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,740
You smoke frap out of one of those real long Tibetan monk pipes.

986
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,900
We pack it up our exit wounds.

987
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,640
The wounds that Bob gave us.

988
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,940
The blueness of the wound will not cleanse away the evil.

989
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,500
Don't you see?

990
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,560
No, smoking is bad for you.

991
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,100
We don't smoke.

992
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,800
Now, in Dallas, I read they had a march.

993
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,060
It ended up being peaceful by some miracle,

994
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,800
because listen to who all showed up for the Dallas protest.

995
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,760
Four different groups.

996
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,700
We're all ears.

997
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,340
One was Mothers Against.

998
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,700
That's police brutality.

999
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,640
Or MAPBABA.

1000
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,740
MAPBABA.

1001
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,460
Yeah, Mothers Against Police, you know, because there's a lot of that going around.

1002
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:53,280
Well, the Immigration Reform Group, this is mostly Mexican-Americans, I think,

1003
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:00,700
and their friends showed up, too, to protest for immigration reform the kind they like.

1004
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,600
Now, I saw pictures of this rally,

1005
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,400
and most of those people were on one side.

1006
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,060
And they were all kind of skinny.

1007
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,300
Now, also, there was the Back the Blue, a pro-police group,

1008
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,540
you know, who have some sympathy for the tough life of a tough cop.

1009
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,380
But also, because this is Texas,

1010
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,500
the Open Carry activists showed up.

1011
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,440
So you had a bunch of guys in combat outfits

1012
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,080
with huge rifles and ammo packs slung across their backs,

1013
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,380
parading back and forth across the street

1014
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,500
from the street.

1015
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,760
And the anti-police brutality.

1016
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,500
Now, of course, they were part of that Operation Jive Mind or Jade Helm or whatever.

1017
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,520
Jade Helm.

1018
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,620
They were ready, as soon as the police showed up,

1019
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:54,540
to herd everybody at gunpoint into the Walmart detention centers

1020
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:59,680
and then run them through tunnels underground to the slave camps on the moon.

1021
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,300
These guys were going to stop the cops

1022
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,880
and anybody else who was an evildoer

1023
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,500
because they're good doers carrying big, big guns.

1024
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,980
Like they say, everyone should.

1025
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,480
If kids in schools were packing,

1026
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,900
you wouldn't have these school massacres.

1027
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,060
I don't quite understand the logic.

1028
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,740
It seems to me like you'd have one every recess.

1029
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:29,460
But maybe kids are much more disciplined than I ever remembered.

1030
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,920
Maybe. I don't know.

1031
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:31,920
Yeah, maybe.

1032
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,200
Reverend Fid Chooley had an answer for this.

1033
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:35,860
I read about it.

1034
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,040
About two minutes before we left, by the way.

1035
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,300
Reverend Fid Chooley said,

1036
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,440
less terrorism, more care-or-ism.

1037
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,540
And he said, I'm going to hashtag that stuff

1038
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,080
and put it on the internet and save the world

1039
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,880
and make some money and maybe everybody will like me finally.

1040
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,940
Less terrorism, more care-or-ism.

1041
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,160
That should be a bumper sticker with a peace sign on one side

1042
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,780
and a heart.

1043
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,680
And a cute little Scotty dog in the middle.

1044
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,560
What a drizzle bit.

1045
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,220
You're allowed to say that, too, on the air.

1046
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:13,820
Drizzle bit?

1047
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:14,920
Yeah.

1048
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,200
Actually, Reverend Fid Chooley had a whole rant

1049
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,780
that I saw just before I left it.

1050
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,640
I printed it out and I'm not going to read it

1051
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,800
because we don't have time.

1052
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,740
Well, we know the reason what we need,

1053
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,020
what we need, what we need is for the aliens

1054
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,860
to come and get us the hell out of here.

1055
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,860
We don't need terror.

1056
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,340
It's not even a real word.

1057
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,720
It's a perfunctory item that's put into the language to make...

1058
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,080
Well, you are...

1059
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,640
Oh, perfunctory.

1060
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,580
Listen, he's using big words now.

1061
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,480
Perfunctory.

1062
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,140
Now?

1063
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,600
He always uses big words.

1064
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,900
What are you talking about, Reverend Stang?

1065
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,620
But it's perfunctory.

1066
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,440
That's even...

1067
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,420
That is kind of perfunctory, I guess, I suppose.

1068
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,360
This is our Dave.

1069
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,340
Oh, hey, here's a bad thing in that book, Dave.

1070
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,340
Here's a bad thing in that giant book

1071
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,080
about the Church of the Subgenius,

1072
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,440
which, by the way,

1073
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,320
you can find online.

1074
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,120
Yes?

1075
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,720
Well, sort of.

1076
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,960
It starts talking about this radio show,

1077
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,820
The Hour of Slack.

1078
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,020
And it says,

1079
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,160
named after Reverend Bucknaked's

1080
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,200
1984 Naked Church newsletter,

1081
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,460
The Hour of Slack is the most prolific

1082
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,600
of subgenius productions.

1083
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,880
That's actually not true.

1084
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,860
With over 1,500 live broadcasts

1085
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,380
beginning in October 1985

1086
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,900
on KNON Dallas.

1087
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,240
And continuing today,

1088
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,680
I've got to wipe the book off,

1089
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,940
on Cleveland on WCSB.

1090
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,320
Yay!

1091
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,440
Cleveland State Student Run.

1092
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,140
Ooh, don't spit on this book.

1093
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,120
It's inkjet.

1094
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,020
Oh, no.

1095
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,640
Yeah.

1096
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,540
Oh, no.

1097
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,080
It's running on the word run.

1098
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,720
Cleveland State Student Run radio station.

1099
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,520
That word ran.

1100
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,760
Reverend Ivan Stang is usually

1101
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,800
the central host of the show,

1102
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
along with Dr. Howell or Princess We,

1103
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,520
Stang's wife.

1104
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,420
Notice anything missing?

1105
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,860
Notice anything missing there,

1106
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,980
Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

1107
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,240
Yeah, of course.

1108
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:15,880
So, yeah.

1109
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,540
We did.

1110
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,960
Actually, the guy who wrote this book

1111
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,100
asked me at one point, he says,

1112
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,440
now, Philo Drummond,

1113
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,060
is he the guy that's on the show

1114
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,980
with you all the time?

1115
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,140
And at that point, I thought,

1116
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,980
this guy doesn't really listen to the show,

1117
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:29,880
or he didn't then.

1118
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,060
He probably is right now,

1119
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,280
aren't you, Reverend Lee Seifer?

1120
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:32,980
Anyway,

1121
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:34,980
I wrote,

1122
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,840
realized, no,

1123
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,760
how could you think?

1124
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,660
Of course, Philo was on the show tonight,

1125
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,400
and Dr. Howell was on the show.

1126
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:41,900
Yes.

1127
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,940
And sometimes Dr. Howell is on the show

1128
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,700
in this room.

1129
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,080
Yes.

1130
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,060
Around X days.

1131
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:46,260
Sure.

1132
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,520
For about 10 shows in a row.

1133
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:47,940
Sure.

1134
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:48,720
But,

1135
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,280
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1136
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,540
let it now be stated

1137
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,820
that since the year of 1991 or so,

1138
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,760
when I first stumbled into this radio station,

1139
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,460
led by Princess We,

1140
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:04,920
and suggested,

1141
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,040
suggested by the late Jeff Rosenbaum,

1142
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,400
and I met the late,

1143
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,540
God, everybody's dead,

1144
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,360
the late Reverend Professor Chaz Smith,

1145
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,440
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1146
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,940
was on his first hour of Slack.

1147
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,240
And that was 1991.

1148
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,140
How many years?

1149
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,300
25 years.

1150
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,800
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is the only person

1151
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,160
who is even allowed to call the station

1152
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,500
during the show minutes

1153
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,880
of 9 to 10.

1154
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:33,740
That is correct.

1155
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,200
That is correct.

1156
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:34,520
That is correct.

1157
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,100
No one,

1158
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,040
even if people even pick up their phone

1159
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,560
and try to call the show,

1160
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,600
their phone will explode

1161
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,440
and blow them to smithereens.

1162
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,360
Don't even try it, kids.

1163
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,040
So, just so,

1164
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,200
that's the first thing I'm getting straight.

1165
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,560
He also seemed to think that Philo

1166
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,800
had created the Puzzling Evidence Show.

1167
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,320
Whereas actually the Puzzling Evidence Show

1168
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,140
was created in 1982,

1169
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,380
before the hour of Slack,

1170
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,160
by who?

1171
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:03,980
Who?

1172
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,280
Puzzling Evidence.

1173
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,000
Philo became a guest on Puzzling Evidence.

1174
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,040
A co-host now, I suppose you could say,

1175
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,440
after 25 years.

1176
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,320
And Dr. Howell is another of those guests.

1177
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,540
But the very first people

1178
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,740
on what we would call the Puzzling Evidence Show

1179
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,980
were neither of those worthies

1180
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,280
but Puzzling himself,

1181
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,800
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

1182
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,760
the great artist Palmer Vredes,

1183
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,140
and maybe Gary Gabroga.

1184
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,920
Gary Gabroga.

1185
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,100
Who later became a major co-host

1186
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,580
until he moved to Santa Cruz.

1187
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,420
And Bob Nelson,

1188
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,380
whose show it originally was,

1189
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,400
which Puzzling Evidence

1190
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,220
gradually eased into his own possession.

1191
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,460
And yes, Princess Wee,

1192
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,220
I know we are approaching the end times

1193
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,120
of this end show.

1194
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,840
The time everyone's been waiting for.

1195
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,180
Well, I say that because I know that.

1196
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,180


1197
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,180


1198
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,180


1199
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,180


1200
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,180


1201
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,180


1202
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:04,920
I said that last week,

1203
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,180
and then I heard Puzzling Evidence said it.

1204
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,420
Puzzling Evidence said it months earlier,

1205
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,280
but I haven't seen it at the same time.

1206
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,220
The moment everybody's been waiting for.

1207
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,860
The end of this show.

1208
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,480
This show, The Hour of Slack.

1209
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,720
If you need more information,

1210
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:33,420
please see subgenius.com on the internet.

1211
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,760
And you can write to

1212
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,460
PO Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1213
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,120
Praise Bob.

1214
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,440
Praise Bob.

1215
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,460
I'm hoping now I can give out your phone number

1216
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,780
and your own phone numbers.

1217
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,580
And now we'll copy the Fire Sign Theater again

1218
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,860
for those of you on drugs.

1219
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,440
Yes.

1220
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,300
Well, I guess Chris,

1221
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,720
Chris, Cool Hand Chris's music ended

1222
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:11,040
just as the show itself came to an end.

1223
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,740
It was the perfection of timing.

1224
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,520
That weird rumbling sound,

1225
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,520
but I couldn't hear anything.

1226
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,140
That weird rumbling sound ended.

1227
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,920
Let's just put it that way.

1228
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,900
And the weird rumbling sound was not a borborygmi.

1229
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,160
But speaking of borborygmis,

1230
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,340
it's showtime.

1231
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,400
Borborygmi?

1232
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,080
Borborygmi?

1233
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,920
It's showtime.

1234
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:33,340
It's showtime.

1235
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,540
Following show host has just entered the room.

1236
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,600
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

1237
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,240
And you're listening to radio station

1238
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,300
in the city of...

1239
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,440
And...

1240
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,760
What they're going to get into

1241
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,940
when they start genetically modifying people from Cleveland

1242
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:00,140
already full aware that it's DNA level C spelled backwards.

1243
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,460
I know that's an old joke.

1244
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,820
But just imagine,

1245
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,100
it's just that's in the...

1246
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,420
You know, they're going to try to do that

1247
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,320
within 18 years.

1248
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,380
I don't know why they get such a ridiculous spirit.

1249
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,220
And this is because it's under 20,

1250
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,580
but it's not over 25.

1251
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,280
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

1252
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,300
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

1253
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,180
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

1254
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:20,720
Insane show.

1255
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,360
And now we're signing off

1256
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,100
for bigger and better things.

1257
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,320
Oh, come on.

1258
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,600
Don't try and butter me up.

1259
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,420
Bigger and better things.

1260
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:30,880
Come on.

1261
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:31,860
Oh, you're moving on.

1262
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,140
You're moving on for better things.

1263
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,880
taller and louder things are on the way.

1264
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:40,020
Much taller and slightly louder and much...

1265
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,300
Your night's about to get better.

1266
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,140
Mine's about to go in the toilet.

1267
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,560
Far more intelligent.

1268
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,260
Less deaf.

1269
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,040
I'm still a subgenius.

1270
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:51,940
Barely.

1271
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,940
Okay, there goes Dave.

1272
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,500
Barely qualified.

1273
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,600
Dave, start talking while I fade you out.

1274
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,360
I admit I missed the last two X days.

1275
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,960
I just wanted to make sure that everybody was aware.

1276
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,540
I'm here to get you.

1277
01:01:33,300 --> 01:02:03,000
I'm here to get you.

1278
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:28,440
I'm here to get you.
