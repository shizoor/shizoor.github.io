1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,580
Colloids are liquids with particles suspended in them.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,480
Yes, sir. Yes, I understand. Goodbye.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,420
He says he's pretty sure this isn't sabotage.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,520
But he thinks there's something far more terrible than that in back of it.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,500
The Self-Genius Power of Swagging!

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,020
But why did they come here?

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, they're not friendly, we're sure of that.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,560
No matter what the cost, it must be destroyed.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,200
Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word...

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:51,940
Trump.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,260
Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F...

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,880
Trump.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,000
...is the only word that is referred to...

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,040
...as the F word.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,620
It's the one magical word.

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,540
Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,580
Trump.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,940
As most words in the English language is derived from German, the word...

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,720
...which means to strike.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,380
In English...

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,720
Trump.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,160
...falls into many grammatical categories.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,840
As a transitive verb, for instance.

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,000
John...

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,620
Trumped.

26
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,180
...surely.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,340
As an intransitive verb, surely...

28
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:27,720
Trump.

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,040
...is.

30
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,420
Its meaning's not always sexual.

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,680
It can be used as an adjective, such as...

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,180
John's doing all the...

33
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,740
Trumping.

34
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,060
...work.

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,260
As part of an adverb, surely talks to...

36
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,840
Trumping.

37
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,340
...much.

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,980
As an adverb enhancing an adjective, surely is...

39
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,580
Trumping.

40
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,240
...beautiful.

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,420
As a noun, I don't give a...

42
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:49,720
Trump.

43
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,280
As part of a word, abso...

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,940
Trumping.

45
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,460
...lutely.

46
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,180
Or, intrumping.

47
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,780
...credible.

48
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,980
And, as almost every word in a sentence...

49
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,040
Trump.

50
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,680
...the...

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,320
Trumping.

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,920
...Trump...

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,220
...ers.

54
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,700
As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of...

55
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:06,980
Trump.

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,860
...as in these examples describing situations such as...

57
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,020
Fraud.

58
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,640
I got...

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,180
Trumped.

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,380
...that they use Carlot.

61
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,820
Dismay.

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,020
Aw...

63
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:16,840
Trump.

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,220
...it.

65
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,360
Trouble.

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,060
I guess I'm really...

67
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,620
Trumped.

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:20,880
...now.

69
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,260
Aggression.

70
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,340
Don't...

71
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:23,620
Trump.

72
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,580
...with me, buddy.

73
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,100
Difficulty.

74
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,060
I don't understand this...

75
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,640
Trumping.

76
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,340
...question.

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,580
Inquiry.

78
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,440
Who the...

79
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,680
Trump.

80
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,480
...was that?

81
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,560
Dissatisfaction.

82
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,060
I don't like what the...

83
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,360
Trump.

84
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,420
...is going on here.

85
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,200
Incompetence.

86
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,080
He's a...

87
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,420
Trump.

88
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:40,880
...off.

89
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,600
Dismissal.

90
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,620
Why don't you go outside and play hide and go...

91
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:45,940
Trump.

92
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,620
...yourself?

93
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sure you can think of many more examples.

94
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,500
With all of these multipurpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the word?

95
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,980
We say...

96
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:09,200
Use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech. It will identify the quality of your character immediately. Say it loudly and proudly.

97
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,720
Trump.

98
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,220
You.

99
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,880
...you.

100
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,320
...you.

101
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,400


102
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,520
...you.

103
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:18,660


104
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:18,680


105
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:18,680


106
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:18,680


107
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,100
...you.

108
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,140
...you.

109
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,140


110
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,140


111
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,440
...you.

112
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,700
Who here can tell Bob what critical thinking means?

113
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,500
A time comes when silence is betrayal.

114
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,280
Bob, we're going to the Shite.

115
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,280
Bob! That's great.

116
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,380
That's great.

117
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:49,580
The purpose of this presentation is to show that the conspiratorial view of history, particularly of recent history, is the correct view.

118
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,580
And that it properly can be identified as the capitalist conspiracy.

119
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,860
Look around you.

120
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,380
Wa...

121
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,360
Look around you.

122
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,620
Wake up, humans.

123
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,360
If we are passive, we are enabling the controllers.

124
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,520
And therefore, we must rise up, not in violence, but in peace, but with one voice, without fear.

125
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:18,940
And we will say, enough of the secrecy, enough of oil, enough of economic slavery, enough of the wars.

126
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:26,160
It is time for a new civilization, and we will see that it will be born in our lifetime in the coming months and years.

127
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:36,080
We'll also grant you unrestricted access to all our recreational facilities, including our non-denominational modern house of worship.

128
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
A new day has dawned.

129
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,240
A new day has dawned.

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,740
A new day has dawned.

131
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,200
A new day has dawned.

132
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,740
A new day has dawned.

133
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,360
There's no force on this planet that will keep me from speaking the truth.

134
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,180
...speaking the truth.

135
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,740
...speaking the truth.

136
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,300
...speaking the truth.

137
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:49,660
...speaking the truth.

138
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,300
They'll have to carry me out feet first in a coffin before I'll shut up about the truth here.

139
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,780
...shut up about the truth here.

140
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,500
Stop living in the future or living in the past, and always live in your now.

141
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,080
Bob.

142
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:12,660
But let's leave things of this world behind, and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

143
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,700
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

144
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Hey, you know those policemen on Motorcycle?

145
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,740
They won't let me preach on car hoods downtown because they think I'm a crazy man or a drunk man.

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,260
And there's no reason to arrest me, yet they would.

147
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:34,920
Because I'm free, free, free enough to rant to myself in public because I come against death, taxes, work, and premature immaculation.

148
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,320
For Bob, your mind, friend, your mind has to be certified okay by them.

149
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,160
Them!

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
Them, and oh, we hate them.

151
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,700
They and their tools of iniquity.

152
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,640
Not the tools of the preacher, not the tongue, nor the other parts, nay, but tools of false slack,

153
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,400
dangled forever in front of you like that raise right around the corner,

154
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,500
or like that rat swimming in poison cheese.

155
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,880
Let there be slack.

156
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,320
On two tops down.

157
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,240
Tops down.

158
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,380
Here I come.

159
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm going to tops down.

160
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,520
Tops down.

161
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,420
Here I come.

162
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:34,160
They got some crazy little tops heads staring up and gonna get me one.

163
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,740
It's the modern age.

164
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,740
It's the modern age.

165
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:47,740


166
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,320
Excuse me a second.

167
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,900
Hello.

168
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,980
The electronics department, please.

169
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,140
Hey, how you doing?

170
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,580
You're a sound effects man always fooling around with electronic devices.

171
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,020
Fooling around, boy.

172
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,360
Tell me, do you suppose robots would enjoy listening to music?

173
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:25,800
If I can repeat it, do you think I like your job or your job isn't enough?

174
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,860
I do from a salesman's point of view.

175
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,720
You don't.

176
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:27,720


177
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,260
I'm a salesman at the office.

178
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,260


179
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:41,480
And it'd sound like you just had a good night's sleep, час but true,

180
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,920
and now folks are missing the prime time, damn it, now that you've suddenly got this,

181
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,600
behind the scenes, you're audience to the front lines.

182
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,240
It's the modern age.

183
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,360
It's the modern age.

184
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,560
It's the modern age.

185
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,540
It's the modern age of us.

186
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,260
It's the modern age of 我的街道 Alaska

187
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,240
It's the modern age of ポトランタ

188
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,240


189
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,780
It's the modern age of ポトランタ

190
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,120
Hell of a time of living

191
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,300
Hell of a time of living

192
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,180
Hey let's go, hey let's go, go down now

193
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:37,640
Hey let's go, hey let's go, go down now

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,020
Hey let's go, hey let's go, go down now

195
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,900
Bob. Great.

196
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:27,060
The acclaim and applause of millions

197
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,900
heralds the triumphant return of

198
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,460
Bob!

199
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,980
Bob!

200
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,560
Bob!

201

Bob!

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,160
Bob!

205
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,440
Bob!

206
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,760
Bob!

207
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:41,760


208
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:41,760


209
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,340
Bob!

210
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,520
Bob!

211
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,520
Bob!

212
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,320
Bob!

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,560
Bob!

214
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,280
Bob!

215
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,320

Bob!

217
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:53,620


218
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:53,980
Bob!

219
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,200
Bob!

220
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,300
Bob!

221
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,720
Bob!

222
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,300
Invited.

223
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,300
To me it looked like a Leprechaun

224
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,680
to me.

225
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560


248
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560


249
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560


250
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560


251
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560


252
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560


253
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560


254
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560


255
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560


256
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,560

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,240

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:51,300

267
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,220


268
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,220


269
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,220


270
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,220


271
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,880
That's a myth.

272
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,060
I'd fire all of you if I could.

273
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,480
Bob.

274
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,380
All of you if I could.

275
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,420
He may call his living.

276
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,800
Yes, Bob.

277
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,980
Yes, Bob.

278
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,740
Your due date was today.

279
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,900
Yes, Bob.

280
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,060
Are you sitting comfortably?

281
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,820
Then we'll begin.

282
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,640
O-A-C.

283
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,460
O-A-C.

284
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,080
That young.

285
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,780
O-A-C.

286
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,780
O-A-C.

287
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,440
That young.

288
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,600
Tender as a cotton tan.

289
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,240
And we got a saver.

290
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,320
Oh, yeah.

291
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,640
Oh, you're the worst kind of autistic.

292
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,040
You can't even count.

293
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,760
Oh, yeah.

294
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,720
Oh, Dave?

295
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,880
Yes?

296
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, there you are.

297
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,080
Okay, I almost forgot to push the button.

298
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,320
Yeah, I wondered why somebody forgot to push the button.

299
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,920
I would have just said...

300
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,200
I really...

301
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,500
I didn't...

302
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,460
I pushed a button, but I didn't push your button, Dave.

303
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:06,820
Me too.

304
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,860
Here on the other end.

305
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,200
I forgot which one I did now, so it's not even worth mentioning.

306
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,320
If I could push your button...

307
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,880
This is one of the many buttons that I have sitting here.

308
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,060
I love to push your buttons, Dave.

309
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,000
You better not be pushing his buttons.

310
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,080
That's called lobotomizing someone in modern terminology.

311
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,200
I don't know about that.

312
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,900
Kiss my button.

313
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,200
I don't know about that.

314
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,500
I don't know about that.

315
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,260
I don't know about that.

316
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,200
That's a good bumper sticker.

317
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,800
Yeah, kiss my button.

318
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,600
Well, no, it'd make a much better pin or button.

319
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,520
Yes.

320
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,160
They call them pins.

321
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,640
Like elongated noses and ear balls and eye wax.

322
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,980
It would give it a little bit more branding flavor.

323
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,560
That is, if you want to consider it any kind of sauce.

324
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,140
Well, Dave, we would love to come and press all your little buttons

325
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,360
and rub your nose and your little brown belly.

326
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,320
But you're an ashtabula, so we can't.

327
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,160
Oh, how terrible.

328
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,660
How sad.

329
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,580
Can't go rub on Dave.

330
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,180
Well, they could rub on some sort of symbolic image of me.

331
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,780
Perhaps Neil Ficrap's apple mode or something like that

332
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,240
or wearing those huge Wagner-like horns, you know.

333
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,840
Well, Dave, isn't it good to do a live show for a change?

334
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,340
Isn't it good or is it good?

335
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,080
It is good.

336
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,200


337
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:42,360
I've been editing my little fool fingers off on all that X-Day stuff since X-Day.

338
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,500
You don't want to fool your fingers because they're an important part of your anatomy.

339
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,800
Yeah.

340
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,720
Because if they accuse you of lying, somehow you could never get out of that

341
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,240
unless you had to maybe, I don't know.

342
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,860
Yeah, it's not a smart practice to put your fingers on.

343
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,880
You need to be straight up with your fingers.

344
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,560
Yeah.

345
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,620
You need rehearsal, but don't practice too much, you know.

346
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,100
Right.

347
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,000
Can you do a radio, can you engineer a radio show without fingers?

348
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,160
That would be the question.

349
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,500
Oh, of course, with stumps.

350
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,680
I can actually work all the buttons in front of me with a stump and my nose.

351
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,540
It would be best to have at least two stumps.

352
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,680
Hmm.

353
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,180
What if you had a pencil mounted to your forehead and you could push things with that,

354
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,640
using your head?

355
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,460
You talking to me?

356
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:32,880
Say.

357
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,820
I think we ought to patent that, only I think it's already been done.

358
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,440
It's been done.

359
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:37,980
Yeah.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,760
I copied that from someone else.

361
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,460
Well, people who are quadriplegic have things like that.

362
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:50,320
Well, some have five times, six, seven times more pleages than every other person.

363
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:58,840
So why shouldn't they be included in the grand octopussful mess of what we have left of our brains?

364
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,320
Why not?

365
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,080
Why not?

366
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,780
Well.

367
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,060
It sounds like taxi driver music to me in the background.

368
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,780
That's what I have to.

369
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,500
It is.

370
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:16,660
I believe that it is Bernard Herrmann's score for taxi driver, but it's being done without

371
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,840
any orchestral instruments at all.

372
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,180
It's a woman named Petra Hayden.

373
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,740
She's the daughter of a famous jazz musician.

374
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,880
Charlie Hayden's gal.

375
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,220
Yeah.

376
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,740
And she does all of this music with her voice.

377
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,180
She does all the orchestral parts of movie themes and other things.

378
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,680
I think she did a brilliant.

379
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,920
I think she did a Who album like that.

380
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,580
Yes, she did.

381
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,760
Some of that is on here.

382
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,020
The Who sell out.

383
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,260
Yeah.

384
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,920
She did.

385
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,960
She did the Who sell out all the way through.

386
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,680
It's amazing.

387
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,100
She did Knocko Blocko Jocko and the rest of the boys.

388
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,260
She had quite a fan club when she was about 22 and then she got red eye syndrome.

389
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,180
And the worse it got, the more she thought she was Bernard Herrmann herself, which was

390
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,980
not true, of course, as we all know.

391
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,740
And that led to a series.

392
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,360
You know.

393
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,160
A lot of recovery time.

394
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:10,020
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep implants and anything else that could get her off the

395
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,220
wisdom gizm chart, you know?

396
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,280
Yes, I know.

397
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,740
And I also know this.

398
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,520
I haven't done the credits yet.

399
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,160
But don't worry, Dave, they won't take long.

400
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,500
Oh, I'll shut up.

401
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,580
Well, we just did.

402
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,980
We're listening to Petra Hayden in the background.

403
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,260
But the collages tonight, there was a bunch of collage stuff.

404
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,340
I got a new package from Reverend Chris.

405
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,520
Christian Blatter.

406
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,340
And that really is his name.

407
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,500
He also goes by the name Chris Hand Luke, except when I'm messed up and calling him Cool Hand

408
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,220
Chris, which is not correct.

409
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,060
Anyway, he sent us a bunch of new stuff and he did the collages, except for a couple of

410
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,800
things that Lee Murr did, of course.

411
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:59,860
And the music we heard about the modern age about 15 minutes ago, that was Rural War Room.

412
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,320
Our favorite.

413
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,320


414
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,940
Our buddies, St. Byron Werner and Donovan, the Donovan and Theramina.

415
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,300
They were at the devotional.

416
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:20,440
And yeah, there may be more of the modern age by Rural War Room coming up at the bitter

417
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:20,960
end.

418
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,720
It's a barrage for the senses indeed.

419
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,640
And we heard Reverend Bleepo Abernathy twice, but I'm not going to say where.

420
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,360
Well, he was a woman the whole time, so it's hard to tell.

421
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,320
I don't know.

422
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:40,120
I mean, it's not an audio perspective, I guess, but it sure makes it difficult for

423
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,640
me anyway.

424
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,420
I'm having a hard time focusing anyway.

425
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,580
Focus if we can't take a joke.

426
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,440
Yes.

427
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,400
Trumpets as well.

428
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,180
Yeah, trumpets, man.

429
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,020
I've already played that little bit, but you got the idea.

430
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,340
Everything's all trumped up around here.

431
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,320
Well, and I also conceded there were many people who trumpeted up the funk.

432
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,440
And who were trumpets and people who had stern pots.

433
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,620
I think he needs to go play a game of hide and go trump yourself.

434
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,640
Hide and go trump yourself.

435
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,040
Indeed.

436
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,520
How could he do it?

437
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,420
You know, that's the double entendre of that disheveled argument.

438
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,860
Oh, he's doing it all the time.

439
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,040
If baboons could make stew, what great stew they would do.

440
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,700
Do you think anybody lets Trump trump them?

441
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,300
I don't know.

442
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,300


443
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,360
Without being paid real well?

444
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,920
I don't know.

445
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,620
What do you think, Will?

446
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,400
Do you think it's possible?

447
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
No, I actually don't.

448
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,500
I thought you didn't.

449
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,880
No, I think he's a lonely, lonely man.

450
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,220
No, that's not necessarily true.

451
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,440
He probably just doesn't need anybody else, you see.

452
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,640
He can sit and just look in the mirror and comb over, over and over and over.

453
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
And that's all he needs for stimulation?

454
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,280
No.

455
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,680
He obviously needs a hell of a lot more than that for stimulation.

456
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,000
And he's getting it.

457
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,400
And I'm sure that the big smackdown is being built up even as we speak.

458
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,300
Mackie?

459
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,820
Yeah.

460
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,160
There's got to be drama, you know.

461
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,720
When the climax comes, it's going to be entertaining.

462
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,300
For so many months.

463
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,040
We hope.

464
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,740
Yeah.

465
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,940
But we'll see.

466
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,380
Who knows?

467
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,260
In the meantime, the WCSB Halloween masquerade box.

468
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,260


469
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,260


470
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,260


471
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,720
The next big pass ball is next Saturday for us here in Cleveland.

472
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,080
Woo hoo.

473
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,540
And that's been going on for what, five or six years now?

474
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,140
At least.

475
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,560
I think this is the seventh one, I believe.

476
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,140
Yeah, yeah.

477
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,720
I guess so.

478
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,600
That's why I don't remember them.

479
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,040
I had so much fun.

480
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,020
It's lucky seven.

481
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,160
There wasn't one 11 years ago.

482
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,060
Are you sure there wasn't one 11 years ago?

483
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,640
There was one that you, me, and Princess We weren't invited to.

484
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,600
And Brother Love.

485
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,240
By the way, Brother Love is in British Columbia now.

486
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,240


487
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,240


488
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,240


489
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,240


490
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,240


491
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,240


492
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,240


493
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,240


494
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,240


495
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,060
the studio tonight.

496
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,720
He just didn't go home this time.

497
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,840
But yeah,

498
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,940
for people in Cleveland,

499
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,260
if you didn't know,

500
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,160
there'll be, what, four or five

501
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,720
bands.

502
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,100
Oh, right, there they are.

503
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,260
Simply Saucer. Well, that's

504
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,160
a good subgeniously type

505
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,180
of thing. It's not the saucers we were

506
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,140
expecting, but better than nothing.

507
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,700
Thomas Jefferson

508
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,480
Slave Apartments.

509
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,600
Slave Apartments.

510
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,080
Destructor and the

511
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,620
Shale Saitans.

512
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,300
And the theme

513
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,140
of the Masquerade Ball, not that anybody

514
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,160
has to pay any attention to this, is space.

515
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,340
I had to pay attention to it

516
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,720
because it's my job to

517
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,700
do the video projections,

518
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,780
don't you see?

519
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,680
You don't see.

520
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,140
You see, in reverse language,

521
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,980
you just said, you don't see.

522
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,120
Meaning you were unobtrusive, except

523
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
for the parts where you're showing, you know,

524
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,320
Grizzly,

525
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,340
except for the parts where you're showing, you know,

526
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:00,820
the great acceptances of human

527
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,200
anatomy.

528
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,500
Well, we've got Grizzly atoms in space,

529
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,300
we've got everything in outer space.

530
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,540
Four hours of space

531
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,740
compilations on two

532
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,780
screens, or maybe brick

533
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,880
walls, we'll see,

534
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,620
as usual. You only notice

535
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,020
these if you look up,

536
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,620
and the only reason anybody would look up at

537
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,640
that party is if they're laying down

538
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,060
flat on their back.

539
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,640
Or perhaps, once again,

540
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
they've had their third nostril removed,

541
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:28,800
or,

542
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
or been lobotomized,

543
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
or had other, you know, had their foreheads

544
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,200
tampered with.

545
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,200
So, we'll be there,

546
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,660
although, how would anybody know?

547
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,140
Because everybody's got a mask on.

548
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,360
Yeah, but you'll know

549
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,700
somebody's there. You'll be able to fill in the blanks

550
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,600
by yourself.

551
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,400
Well,

552
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,480
Princess We will be the one that looks like

553
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
a beautiful space princess, and I'll be

554
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,840
the guy with the blue

555
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,560
Greek fisherman's hat.

556
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,600
Which almost never comes off.

557
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,600
A couple of years ago,

558
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,040
I had a Mitt Romney mask

559
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,020
that was really pretty good, and if you stuck

560
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,100
a pipe in the mouth, you looked darn near

561
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,580
like Bob Dobbs. Sure did.

562
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,060
Yeah, I remember that. It was

563
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,140
frightening. You don't remember

564
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,480
it. It's really horrible. You weren't there.

565
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,220
But I remember it, and it was still horrible.

566
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,820
Can I at least make those

567
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,260
two points? He has a vicarious

568
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,060
memory. Others

569
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,240
can see that stuff

570
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,520
in that if you go to,

571
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,100
subconsciousofgenius.com

572
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,400
and click the events button, and you're looking

573
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
at this events page, which is all about

574
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
X-Day and Starwood, but if you scroll down

575
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,540
a long way,

576
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,240
you'll start coming to the Halloween

577
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,860
and WCSB events.

578
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,440
And you can, if a person

579
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,420
really wanted to, they could look

580
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,400
at every little kid that's ever

581
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,340
trick-or-treated at our home,

582
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,480
the Slacker Mansion. Quite true.

583
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,700
Over in Cleveland Bluffs.

584
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,580
Literally thousands of photos of cute little bunnies

585
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,700
and other perversions.

586
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Actually, you'd be surprised. They're very creative.

587
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,440
They really are. Especially the kids

588
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,360
whose parents aren't rich.

589
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,080
They have to make their own costumes.

590
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,500
And those are pretty interesting.

591
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,600
But obviously, you can't photograph

592
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,620
every kid. You have to ask

593
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,660
permission. And not

594
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,240
every parent wants their

595
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,520
child's picture on

596
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,640
the internet. I wonder

597
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:20,940
why?

598
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,500
The internet's not full of

599
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,280
perverts or anything now,

600
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,500
is it? Yes, it is.

601
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,620
But the internet

602
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,500
doesn't lie to me.

603
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,420
Oh, no. No, no. Whatever you want

604
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,380
to believe, the internet will tell you

605
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,340
that it's true. You can think the

606
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,400
dumbest thing in the whole world and go to

607
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,160
the internet and it'll go, yep, yep, there's

608
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,800
10,000 of us that agree with you.

609
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,500
It'll confirm your inadequacy

610
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,360
right there on the spot. Any kind of

611
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,340
idiocy you want to believe or disagree with,

612
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,960
it's right there.

613
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,400
Yeah, it's there to

614
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,080
validate your

615
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,220
craziest, most

616
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,360
self-righteous

617
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,340
notions. And, you know,

618
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,320
that's really what the best thing about the

619
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,440
internet is, that glorious feeling of

620
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,340
self-righteousness and

621
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,020
moral outrage when you

622
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,180
push thumbs down.

623
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,680
Yeah, it's like argumentative

624
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,280
bowel syndrome. That'll show

625
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,380
them. I'm a slacktivist. I sit here on the

626
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,060
web and get things done

627
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,620
by expressing my disapproval

628
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,220
with a thumbs

629
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,840
down. Or,

630
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,360
in some cases, if you don't have that option,

631
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,260
I'm going to withhold

632
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,480
my thumbs up. That will show

633
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,460
that other

634
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,400
loser, internet

635
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,080
loser, nothing better to do.

636
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,560
My glaring silence, I'll give that

637
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,340
to them, yes.

638
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,580
I'm about to use

639
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,320
the internet to send out a giant

640
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,200
form letter to everybody

641
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,720
who signed up for it.

642
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,820
And here's what it says.

643
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,300
Thank you and praise

644
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,040
Bob to the people who not only

645
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,780
ordered, but

646
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,360
donated.

647
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,980
Wait, I can't talk about that.

648
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,540
You are the ones motivating the production

649
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,620
of new radio shows, books

650
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,160
in progress, videos,

651
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,540
and the continued existence of

652
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,240
the Subgenius Foundation

653
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,220
Incorporated.

654
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,220
Your contributions are worth

655
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,180
way more than just money,

656
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,080
for they also boost slack

657
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,460
across the board

658
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,380
and across the planet.

659
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,180
They feed you pretty good, too.

660
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,140
And for that matter, come to think of it,

661
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,860
WCSB Radiothon

662
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,540
is coming up.

663
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:30,940
Start

664
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,680
breaking open your piggy banks,

665
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,700
kids, because the station

666
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,080
needs HEP.

667
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,480
It starts in two days?

668
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,400
Two weeks.

669
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,440
Oh, two weeks.

670
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,900
My heart bestows.

671
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,660
Remember next week, remember next week,

672
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,060
remember next week.

673
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,860
Because by the time everybody remembers

674
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,800
next week, they'll have forgotten it.

675
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,700
So you have to spring it on

676
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,720
right in between, like,

677
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,200
Nary Weasel would do.

678
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,680
Just to...

679
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,200
I know, next week,

680
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,860
Ohioans can vote

681
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,760
two different

682
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,020
confusing marijuana initiatives.

683
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,640
Not that any of our listeners

684
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,760
would care about that kind of thing, but...

685
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,540
There's the

686
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,640
one that supposedly

687
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,920
legalizes recreational

688
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,980
marijuana, but not really exactly.

689
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,280
And the other one that outlaws

690
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,060
monopolies, which

691
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,660
defeats the previous.

692
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,900
So it's like, if you vote

693
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,260
for three, you're

694
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,880
voting against two, even if

695
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,540
you don't know that.

696
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,780
All I know is I have to read a lot

697
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,720
more about them to find out which one

698
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,280
is which.

699
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,800
Now I'm mixed up.

700
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,320
I should just

701
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,740
stay out of this.

702
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,580
You said last night to me that you believed

703
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,380
that three was the true

704
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,920
positive one.

705
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,360
That's right. I've got my numbers reversed.

706
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,960
For legalization.

707
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,960
Do you really want

708
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,980
people to be walking

709
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,940
around on

710
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,040
marijuana? Wouldn't you rather

711
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,380
have them just be drunk?

712
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,420
Horribly drunk,

713
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,860
smelling, puking, driving

714
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,560
real fast, getting in fights?

715
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,240
Yeah, the getting in fights thing I really think is

716
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,060
a lot more

717
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,260
better than having people just hide,

718
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,480
just kind of smiling and

719
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,560
walking around.

720
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,400
Right.

721
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,260
You don't see a lot of punch fests at a Zooter party.

722
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,120
Well, we'll just have to let the votars figure that one out.

723
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,920
I don't.

724
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,460
Come on.

725
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,060
This is Ohio.

726
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,360
Might as well be Texas.

727
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:38,900
Well, it's not.

728
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:39,820
Okay.

729
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,460
It ain't Texas.

730
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,860
Well, they tried for 14 years, I think.

731
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,980
I'm not sure of the exact number, but they've tried for many, many years.

732
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,020
Ohio was one of the original ones that would get slapped down by the, it's going to make

733
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,380
everyone take heroin and LSD.

734
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,180
Really?

735
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,320
Oh, man.

736
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,840
Well, in that case, I'm going to vote for them.

737
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,020
I'm going to vote for it.

738
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,260
I can't wait to try that heroin and LSD.

739
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,760
Everybody says-

740
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,280
At the same time?

741
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,980
Oh, hell, that's the only way to do it, man.

742
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,520
You're a wuss if you don't do it all at the same time.

743
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,580
Everything, all at once, and the whiskey.

744
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,000
Our friends, we're just doing a comedy show.

745
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,160
We're not advocating any sort of unhealthy behavior.

746
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,040
We never would.

747
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,200
Absolutely.

748
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,060
We're in the slack here.

749
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,020
We wouldn't even think of that.

750
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,720
Slack, love, frop.

751
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,180
If we thought of that, if we dreamed of it, we'd wake up and apologize.

752
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,820
If we dreamed of it, we'd wake up and apologize.

753
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,880
We were going to legalize something.

754
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,180
We legalized Habifrop Zipulops.

755
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,280
We have the money earwigs in our earrings.

756
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,220
Right.

757
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,900
When is Ohio going to vote on Habifrop Zipulops, or frop for short?

758
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,640
Oh, never, never, never, never, never.

759
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,580
That reminds me.

760
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,880
We forgot to bring those ... Oh, well.

761
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,620
Is that a Radiothon giveaway?

762
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,420
Yeah.

763
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,820
That's a good Radiothon giveaway.

764
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,160
Yeah, a Radiothon giveaway.

765
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,140
Free frop.

766
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,860
He forgot his premiums.

767
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:51,880
Yeah.

768
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,300
It makes you forget your premiums.

769
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,120
This is our jockstrap collection I own.

770
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,880
That's the problem with the frop.

771
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,740
It makes you forget.

772
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,820
You forget your premiums.

773
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,320
In fact, this is the saddest thing.

774
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,760
When the drug user gets so high, he forgets all his other drugs.

775
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,200
You know, that's the saddest thing.

776
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,120
The drug user wakes up the next morning and goes, I forgot to take my heroin and my LSD.

777
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,780
I smoked too much frop, and I forgot my heroin.

778
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,060
Oh, darn.

779
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,900
I was going to overdose and everything.

780
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,100
Got my heroin.

781
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,240
Yeah, just like them people on TV.

782
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,340
Well, you can't hide from Bob, friends.

783
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,920
And we know that half the people listening to the Hour of Slack and using the subgenius

784
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,200
Facebook pages aren't actually dues-paying subgeniuses yet, but still pink in the eyes

785
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,320
of Bob and everybody else who counts.

786
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,720
It's a serious and crippling problem, but it can be solved very easily.

787
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,060
But I can't tell you how.

788
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,360
How about that?

789
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
Talk about a conspiracy.

790
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,220
Mm-hmm.

791
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,620
Mm-hmm.

792
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,300
Yes, sir.

793
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,060
I'm going to ask you a question.

794
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm going to ask you a question.

795
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,440


796
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,400
Well, you know, sadder things have been said.

797
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,600
You're saying it is a sad thing, but just think of the sinking of the lunatic and the

798
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,000
few of the other small vesicles that made their way past the department.

799
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,940
They thought the lunatic was unsinkable, too.

800
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,740
What?

801
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,340
Just like a fat woman or something.

802
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,980
I don't know if that's really true or not.

803
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,440
It's just handed down from the foot to the cartwheel.

804
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:22,840
Unsinkable?

805
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,020
I don't know.

806
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,640
I'd like to find out in a fun way, though.

807
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,680
Oh, ha ha.

808
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,760
Oh, actually, we should be happy and say something happy.

809
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,980
There's two new stations, broadcast stations, carrying the Hour of Slack.

810
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,160
No, get out of town.

811
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:52,860
Yes, so let's ... Well, actually, we've been on our beloved other WREK in Atlanta, for instance,

812
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
WORT in Madison for months.

813
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,000


814
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,000


815
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,000


816
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,000


817
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,940
Many, many, many years.

818
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,300
But the latest new ones are WOZO, WOZO in Knoxville, Tennessee.

819
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,640
Praise Bob, Hour of Slack.

820
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,320
Praise Bob.

821
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:14,360
And it's on with the Fugue Segway show, which is an interesting original show, and WLSL

822
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,820
in Dade City, Florida.

823
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,920
Oh, yeah.

824
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,220
Wow.

825
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,280
They are also playing the Hour of Slack now.

826
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,280
So, hello, Dade City, Florida, and Knoxville, Tennessee.

827
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,700
Yes.

828
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:30,660
We'll be driving through Knoxville in about a month or two, but not stopping.

829
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,740
Be looking for a ... Welcome to the origami, I mean, the fold, I mean, you know.

830
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,860
Yeah.

831
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,860
That made perfectly sense to me.

832
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,560
Yeah, brother, love, this is before your time, but the Hour of Slack, this used to just be

833
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,820
another station that we mailed the show to.

834
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,720
And they paid me for it.

835
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,360
I used to get five bucks a show.

836
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,260
Of course, that's my ...

837
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,760
It's not how much it cost to mail a cassette.

838
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,480
Yeah.

839
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,540
But my phone is ringing.

840
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,860
I'm not going to ... It's Priestess Pisces, and she should know better.

841
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Oh, my goodness.

842
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,860
She's been trying to get ahold of me all week.

843
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,540
I mean, I've been trying to get ahold of her.

844
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:11,980
That rascally gal.

845
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,280
We've been going back and forth.

846
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,040
Oh, Lordy.

847
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,980
She was a big star of last week's show.

848
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:17,900
She's quite a rapscallion.

849
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,440
What the hell's a rapscallion, anyway?

850
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,260
It's a type of vegetable, believe it or not, that is formed by a plant.

851
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,260


852
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,260


853
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,260


854
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,260


855
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,260


856
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,140
It's formed like a hand shooting the finger.

857
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,260
A rapscallion?

858
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,220
Yes.

859
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,220
In Monster Hunter.

860
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,640
I know that ...

861
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,920
It's a vegetable.

862
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,640
That was a word that was ...

863
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,920
Well, aren't we all ...

864
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,540
It bloomed large in my grandmother's lexicon.

865
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,960
Was rapscallion?

866
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,800
Rapscallion, yes.

867
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,880
Just add two cups of moist rapscallion and a turn of butter.

868
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,140
Pound the cakes down until they're solid and smooth, and wrap around in gravy and bits

869
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,580
quits.

870
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,240
Oh, my goodness.

871
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,240


872
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,240


873
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,240


874
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,240


875
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,240


876
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,240


877
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,240


878
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,160
That's saliva all over the ...

879
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,400
It's not an onion that rocks the microphone?

880
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,460
Yeah.

881
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,500
Yeah, man.

882
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,080
There's also two new subgenius music albums.

883
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:17,580
Bob's Song 7, called Bob's Prolapsed Something Something, and Bob's Songs 8, also known as

884
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,540
Orally Transmitted Diseases.

885
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,660
That's oral.

886
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,960
You can actually hear ...

887
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,220
That's oral.

888
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,700
... everything on those for free if you want to.

889
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,900
And all you have to do really is look at subgenius.com, and it will make itself pretty

890
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,380
obvious when you see the little word download and music albums and all that.

891
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,000
It's a delightful world unto itself.

892
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,080
There's a Lonesome Cowboy Dave song on there that you probably don't remember because you

893
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,540
only sang it once on Chaz's show.

894
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
You just made it up off the top of your head.

895
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,120
Why?

896
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,020
I just put it on there.

897
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,020


898
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,340
I love Bob, and Bob loves me.

899
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,700
And me, me, me, me, me, I'm on a funny little tree.

900
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,620
Something like that.

901
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,360
I can't do that.

902
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,500
That's why he's so lonesome.

903
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:18,060
What he bring in ... Well, to me, like the work mongers, the rest of these people that

904
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,340
want to build nuclear fuels across the United States even while everybody's still arguing

905
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,660
about the ...

906
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:22,660


907
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:22,660


908
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:22,660


909
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:22,660


910
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,900
the most recent accidents.

911
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,640
Wouldn't you say that's kind of a conflict

912
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,880
of interest between like

913
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,860
maybe Strumpet Dumpet,

914
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,500
what's his name, and the

915
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,740
Marquess of Queensberry?

916
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,380
No, I'm sorry.

917
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,060
Well, it doesn't matter.

918
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,920
No matter what you ask him, he's got a plan.

919
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,340
He won't tell you what it is,

920
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,020
but he's got a plan, and he knows all the right people.

921
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,420
Yep.

922
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,320
And he doesn't know

923
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,380
anything about the government.

924
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,800
That's the important thing.

925
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,780
He knows what's for you.

926
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,840
That's a matter to brag about now.

927
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,920
I will make the best leader

928
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,460
because I have never led.

929
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,700
I know nothing

930
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,820
about what I'm taking on,

931
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,900
and that's why I

932
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,360
always lie, and I'm always right.

933
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,780
So vote for me, Bob Dabs.

934
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,440
And if you don't, you're all

935
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,360
trumped, all of you.

936
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,940
Bunch of trump wads.

937
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,680
Dingle dags.

938
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,760
Trump wads.

939
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,440
Yeah.

940
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,940
I'd slap them all if I had a big enough hand

941
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,100
or foot or I could even think

942
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,000
that far, you know?

943
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,520
When you just like, you just go

944
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,680
across thousands of them.

945
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,020
Just like a little

946
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,640
lightning bug ready to spiel.

947
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,680
Okay.

948
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,160
Yeah.

949
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,400
Well, you know what I mean.

950
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:41,700
No.

951
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,620
No, but when I play the recording back online.

952
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,280
Maybe perhaps a lady's glove

953
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,020
from late 1950s.

954
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,140
Are you advocating

955
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,260
slappery?

956
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,680
Slapping Trump?

957
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,320
You want to trump slapping, don't you?

958
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,200
Trump slapping, yeah.

959
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,080
Make him your little trump.

960
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,340
Son of a trump.

961
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,480
Trump him up.

962
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,120
And he is a trumpet.

963
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,720
He can trump his own trump.

964
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,760
Hey, what else rhymes

965
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,580
with trump dump?

966
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,540
Pump, hump,

967
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,440
jump.

968
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,400
Pump, trump, dump, trump.

969
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,420
I'm going to trump you up.

970
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,700
I'm going to trump you up.

971
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,900
We've been quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger

972
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,820
lately because we saw that third,

973
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,440
fifth, the fifth Terminator movie.

974
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,200
Arnold came back from retirement

975
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,280
to act in that.

976
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,500
And then went back and looked at

977
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,580
all of the Terminator movies.

978
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,820
Princess, we had not seen the original one.

979
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,340
She saw the most recent one,

980
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,940
which makes for a confusing,

981
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,520
confusing beginning.

982
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,000
But the important thing is...

983
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,900
Was the fourth one really terrible?

984
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,720
Huh?

985
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,720
Was the fourth one really terrible?

986
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,320
I hear...

987
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,640
Well, let's see.

988
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,000
That was the one with Batman in it, right?

989
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,560
Right.

990
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,640
Christian Bale

991
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,100
was in the fourth one.

992
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:08,860
Right.

993
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,360
Yeah.

994
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,040
Yeah.

995
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,680
No, it wasn't that terrible,

996
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,840
but it wasn't...

997
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,620
I don't know.

998
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,420
I don't remember it well enough,

999
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,360
but the point about the new one is...

1000
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,200
Okay, Arnold Schwarzenegger's

1001
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,680
in his...

1002
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,780
He's in his 70s now.

1003
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,740
He's pushing 70,

1004
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,800
if he's not over 70.

1005
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,540
And he plays...

1006
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,580
They show the young Arnold bot

1007
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,380
and a 50-year-old Arnold bot,

1008
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,280
both of which had to be done in CGI.

1009
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,380
The only one they couldn't do,

1010
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,700
they didn't need to do in CGI,

1011
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,540
was the 70-year-old Arnold bot.

1012
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,800
But the cool line from that one,

1013
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,440
the take-home line is...

1014
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,680
Old.

1015
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,460
Not obsolete.

1016
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,560
Right.

1017
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,440
Yes.

1018
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,640
Three times during the course of the movie,

1019
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,000
he gets to say,

1020
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,780
Old.

1021
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,020
As opposed to obsolete.

1022
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,940
Not obsolete.

1023
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,520
At one point, his hand messes up

1024
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,220
and it's going...

1025
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,300
Like, you can hear the little servo motors

1026
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:06,940
getting caught,

1027
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,060
and he bangs it on the table

1028
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,800
and looks at the hero and goes,

1029
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,460
Old.

1030
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,040
And then the hero goes,

1031
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,080
But not obsolete.

1032
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,260
And then they go and kill the bad guys.

1033
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,100
But of course, you know,

1034
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,240
you can't leave a Terminator robot around

1035
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,440
in our time.

1036
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,720
Because, Scott,

1037
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,360
that just leads somebody

1038
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,600
to invent Skynet all over again.

1039
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,240
But why do they have to,

1040
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,780
when they go out on these campaigns

1041
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,780
across the country

1042
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,140
to build awareness

1043
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,060
of the most current movie stuff,

1044
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,800
why do they always have to wear

1045
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,160
those, like, green diaper things

1046
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,960
and stuff like that?

1047
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,880
Why can't they just wear

1048
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,540
a common, ordinary Japanese business suit

1049
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,840
or a pair of Toreador pants, perhaps?

1050
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,980
Well, let's say you'll know

1051
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,360
which ones are Terminators

1052
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,580
and which ones are politicians.

1053
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,880
Oh, yeah, of course.

1054
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,900
Otherwise, it's kind of hard

1055
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,780
to tell the difference.

1056
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,120
They're all old.

1057
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,940
They're all Trumpy.

1058
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,760
Yeah, everything's old.

1059
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,080
They all got back buttons, too,

1060
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,220
so stay out of the way.

1061
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,180
Stay a certain distance.

1062
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,240
Oh, yes.

1063
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,800
What's this world coming to?

1064
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,780
I'm so glad I'll be dead

1065
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,020
40 years from now

1066
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,020
at the very, you know,

1067
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,460
there's no way I could last another,

1068
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,740
I'd be 102 in 40 years.

1069
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,320
I don't want to see

1070
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,420
what's going on then

1071
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,860
because I have a sneaking sense

1072
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:20,860


1073
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:20,860


1074
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:20,860


1075
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,140
of suspicion

1076
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,300
that in the words of Frank Zappa,

1077
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,920
it won't all blow up and disappear.

1078
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,920
It'll just look ugly

1079
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,320
for a thousand years.

1080
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,920
Yes.

1081
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,480
But we won't have to worry

1082
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
about that, will we, Dave?

1083
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,140
Because we'll be dead, dead, dead,

1084
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,820
and gone, almost certainly,

1085
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,940
unless some idiot

1086
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,180
invents the singularity

1087
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,240
and turns us into Terminators.

1088
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,980
Trumps, Terminators, same difference.

1089
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,280
Trumpinators?

1090
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,660
Trumpinators.

1091
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,120
Yeah, the Trumpinator.

1092
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,860
Trump rhymes with Trump as well.

1093
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,800
Right, Trump.

1094
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,240
Are you a Trump chump, my friend?

1095
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,060
Of course, you know what they're going.

1096
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,140
Well, you probably think

1097
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,420
that Hillary is going to save

1098
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,080
all your problems

1099
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,160
and she's going to give you

1100
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,800
everything for free

1101
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,040
because that's all Democrats want.

1102
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,400
It's just everything for free

1103
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,300
because no Democrat

1104
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,580
has ever had a job.

1105
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,580
I want you to know that.

1106
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,000
I've never known a Democrat

1107
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,700
to have a job.

1108
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,260
I tell everybody what I think

1109
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:16,860
and I've never heard

1110
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,780
a single one of them

1111
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,680
tell me they was going to vote

1112
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,420
for Hillary Clinton.

1113
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,780
I read on the internet today

1114
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,840
that Obama was the most

1115
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,140
monstrous individual

1116
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,800
who has ever lived

1117
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,780
on the planet Earth.

1118
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,440
I'm not kidding.

1119
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:32,940
Wow.

1120
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,320
A very, very butthurt

1121
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,100
Yahoo commenter

1122
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,220
had that to say.

1123
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,940
Okay, Obama was so much worse

1124
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,780
than Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot

1125
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,760
put together.

1126
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,740
Oh, my goodness.

1127
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,700
Well, look what he's done.

1128
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,780
He's destroyed America.

1129
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,740
We're just sitting here,

1130
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,840
being able to say this

1131
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,100
and nobody's killed us yet.

1132
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,900
That proves that America

1133
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,740
is destroyed.

1134
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,440
If Reverend Ivan Stein

1135
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,600
can get on there

1136
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,200
and make fun of Trump,

1137
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,640
then what kind of a country is this?

1138
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,120
Obama must die!

1139
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,000
Hillary's going to be impeached

1140
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,100
the first day she's in office.

1141
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,100
She's going to be impeached

1142
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,700
and put in jail

1143
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,260
because you know what they do

1144
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:15,800
for treason?

1145
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,180
Hang.

1146
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:16,780
Hanging.

1147
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,100
First day she's in office,

1148
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,860
she's going to be impeached.

1149
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,080
She's going to be impeached and hung.

1150
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,380
It's another thing that I have read

1151
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,860
numerous times over and over again.

1152
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,260
The spelling is almost always the same

1153
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,460
every time they say that.

1154
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,240
I wonder if...

1155
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,440
Oh, well.

1156
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,320
They just paint it.

1157
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,120
I'm sure it's spontaneous.

1158
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm sure there's nobody

1159
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,820
coordinating these things.

1160
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,720
That would be crazy.

1161
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,420
Only rich people could afford that.

1162
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,160
Only very, very rich brothers

1163
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,700
could ever afford to pay people

1164
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,020
to sit and post nonsense

1165
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,860
on the internet.

1166
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,920
And create an echo chamber.

1167
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,000
Oh, yeah.

1168
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,300
It's going to sell 52 million.

1169
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,900
That's nothing.

1170
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:15,980
What's that?

1171
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,460
Yeah, that's pocket change.

1172
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,660
That's me about a year and a half.

1173
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:18,960
Right.

1174
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,840
Or the late 40s.

1175
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,020
Or 50s.

1176
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:21,760
That was a lot, right?

1177
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,600
I guess that would probably be

1178
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,680
about 10 times what it sounds like now.

1179
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,160
So, yeah, it'd be about 500 million

1180
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,460
instead of 50 million.

1181
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,680
That's a fair shake.

1182
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,100
That's a good piece of change.

1183
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,360
So, the Kochs Pappies

1184
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,560
made money off Stalin?

1185
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,380
Yeah.

1186
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,380
Well, how could he make money

1187
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,200
off communists?

1188
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,180
Communists don't even know

1189
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,940
what money is.

1190
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,780
They don't know what God is.

1191
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,860
They don't know what money is.

1192
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,760
All they know is slavery

1193
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,840
and they think it's slack.

1194
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,380
They think it's slack.

1195
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:49,840
And diaphanies.

1196
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:49,840


1197
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:49,840


1198
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,020
I hope so.

1199
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,160
They're really good on Twitter.

1200
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,780
That's what they're...

1201
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,580
Burmese Sambers.

1202
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,320
He's a communist, socialist, Nazi.

1203
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:57,880
Same thing.

1204
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,520
All the same thing.

1205
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:58,840
Muslim.

1206
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,380
They're all the same.

1207
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,140
That's the same exact definition.

1208
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,680
You said Muslim.

1209
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,820
You didn't say Muslime.

1210
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,100
You always say Muslime.

1211
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,460
No, actually,

1212
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,320
I prefer to say Muslamics.

1213
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,260
Right.

1214
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,100
Muslamics.

1215
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,900
Which is actually not one

1216
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,980
that you hear people say all the time.

1217
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,580
My son made that up

1218
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,400
to make fun of people

1219
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,740
who are complaining.

1220
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,040
All the time

1221
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,860
about something

1222
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,480
they never actually see.

1223
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:25,780
Hmm.

1224
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,480
But they hear about it

1225
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,180
from each other.

1226
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,120
And that's the important thing.

1227
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,320
I am the master

1228
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,780
of many a fine singing.

1229
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,660
I'm sorry.

1230
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,520
That's my group.

1231
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,040
Joe Joplin.

1232
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,440
I'm sorry.

1233
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,080
Dave, I can hear

1234
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,300
the voices in your head.

1235
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,340
Yeah, we just heard it.

1236
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,100
You're not the only one

1237
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,080
hearing them this time.

1238
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,500
Goodness.

1239
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,720
That was chilling.

1240
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,760
I can barely hear it.

1241
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:49,960
Yeah.

1242
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,520
I've been spending a lot.

1243
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,880
I kept it under fruit wire

1244
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,700
for a long time.

1245
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,320
Like they used,

1246
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,040
you know,

1247
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,000
the Norwegian days

1248
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,860
when they used to build

1249
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,760
those big husky vitamin C's.

1250
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,220
And sometimes

1251
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,480
the whole swamp

1252
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,380
would be full of them.

1253
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,720
Just like burbling up

1254
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,020
like in Dante's Inferno,

1255
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:05,400
you know?

1256
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,520
That's the part I didn't like

1257
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,240
because it's too loose a fabric.

1258
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,280
You just kind of lose your mind.

1259
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,980
No, lose your mind?

1260
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,580
No, Dave.

1261
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,360
Oh, I can't imagine

1262
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,700
something like that happening

1263
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,840
around here.

1264
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,220
Well, it's free.

1265
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,840
On the internet.

1266
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,340
On this show.

1267
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,900
Building enormous ascorbic acids?

1268
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,060
Yes.

1269
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,600
Especially if you're planning

1270
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,100
to actually exit

1271
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,420
on X day

1272
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,440
and so far

1273
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,820
as yet to materialize.

1274
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:32,700
Hmm.

1275
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,480
Wait a minute.

1276
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,680
You're talking vitamin C,

1277
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,340
did you say?

1278
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,200
That's coffee, right?

1279
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,220
Yeah.

1280
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,560
It's copy grass,

1281
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,040
coffee,

1282
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,960
carnivorous wax.

1283
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,820
Yeah, it's an important

1284
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,000
vitamin your body needs,

1285
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,300
coffee.

1286
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,720
Actually, I think the C

1287
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,700
stands for caffeine.

1288
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:47,920
Ah.

1289
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,640
Okay.

1290
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,840
Like vitamin S, salt,

1291
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,320
vitamin G, grease.

1292
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:52,720
Grease.

1293
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,000
Those are the important vitamins.

1294
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,000
It makes me hungry

1295
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,060
just thinking about it.

1296
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,160
Well, that's the problem

1297
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,180
with many people

1298
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,260
who worship the devil

1299
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,720
is they assume

1300
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,520
their problems

1301
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,780
with their agronomy

1302
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,580
and growing things,

1303
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,900
the little vegetables

1304
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,140
that they create.

1305
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,800
Like you, Dave.

1306
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,280
Oh, yeah.

1307
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,900
Like I'm one of their little vegetables.

1308
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,460
I'm Satan's carrot or something.

1309
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,240
Yeah, you're Monsanto's

1310
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,100
Franken-Dave.

1311
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,460
Monsanto grows Franken-Daves

1312
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,000
and they get out

1313
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,100
into the environment

1314
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,140
and they kill off

1315
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,380
all the natural daves.

1316
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,360
Wow.

1317
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:37,960
Uh-oh.

1318
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,240
Because they are powerful.

1319
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,680
That sounds dangerous.

1320
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,960
The bees are sick and tired of it

1321
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,920
because there's no real daves

1322
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,680
to suckle on.

1323
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,580
Franken-Dave is

1324
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,440
ugly.

1325
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,860
Our kids aren't going to know

1326
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,680
what real daves

1327
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,780
are like anymore.

1328
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,460
You can still find them

1329
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,560
in Amish country.

1330
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,060
Okay.

1331
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,980
But that's about it.

1332
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,580
Yeah, the Franken-Daves

1333
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,780
are big and strong.

1334
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,900
They're ugly

1335
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,980
and they're covered with scars

1336
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:04,900
and they have electrodes

1337
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,720
in their necks

1338
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,020
but they're strong

1339
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:07,820
and they'll live forever.

1340
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,920
I like the naturally occurring daves.

1341
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,160
Myself.

1342
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,080
Yeah, but they rot real fast

1343
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,020
before you even get them

1344
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,480
to the store.

1345
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,520
They're all bruised up.

1346
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,500
Just look at this one.

1347
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,300
He's covered with bruises.

1348
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,500
He actually is, too.

1349
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,760
Unfortunately, friends,

1350
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,140
if you believed in prayer,

1351
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,820
I'd ask you to pray

1352
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,700
for Dave's shoulder

1353
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,820
but we won't do that

1354
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,000
because we don't know

1355
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,800
who might be listening.

1356
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:32,620
Yeah.

1357
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,180
The devil might be listening.

1358
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,360
On the other hand...

1359
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
As a matter of fact,

1360
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,160
if you wouldn't mind

1361
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,020
signing your name

1362
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:38,660
and giving us

1363
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,340
every bit of financial

1364
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,460
and information

1365
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,720
that you might have,

1366
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,180
we would at least like

1367
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,380
to know who you are

1368
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,460
and where you're from.

1369
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,080
Where you live

1370
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,740
and what your credit card number is.

1371
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,520
You mean all our hippy-dippy listeners

1372
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,420
can't send their healing energies

1373
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,760
toward Dave's shoulder?

1374
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,600
They can.

1375
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,000
They must.

1376
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,700
But the problem is

1377
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,260
that there's other...

1378
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:00,380
You know,

1379
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,680
somebody else might go,

1380
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,460
well, I know how to get Dave now.

1381
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,080
I'm going to send

1382
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,440
injury vibes.

1383
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,180
I'll send a doubt

1384
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,040
and hurt energy towards Dave

1385
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,260
because I don't like

1386
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,040
that Lone Camp boy.

1387
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,280
Dave, he confuses me

1388
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,300
and makes me feel stupid.

1389
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,080
The injury reiki?

1390
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,260
Yeah.

1391
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,260
It confuses.

1392
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,280
Yeah, it makes me confused.

1393
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,400
I don't like that stuff.

1394
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,060
It makes me...

1395
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,160
Yeah.

1396
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,080
It makes me feel angry.

1397
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,620
And alienated

1398
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,120
and brushed

1399
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,700
and dark

1400
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,440
and full of anger.

1401
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:26,820
Yeah.

1402
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,240
And alienated

1403
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:28,840
and brushed.

1404
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:29,800
Yeah.

1405
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,500
Anger.

1406
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:30,840
Yeah.

1407
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,900
Oh, it feels so good.

1408
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,700
Especially when you

1409
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,220
type out that

1410
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:36,840
cutting,

1411
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,000
cutting put down

1412
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,960
and push send.

1413
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,620
Oh, you're such a

1414
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,940
brave, anonymous man

1415
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,720
when you do that.

1416
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,740
Not you, Dave.

1417
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,260
I'm not anonymous.

1418
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,000
Poor old Dave

1419
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,860
hardly even has

1420
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,160
any kind of computer.

1421
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,760
I'm hoping that he'll

1422
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,880
get his started up

1423
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,020
so that

1424
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,340
so he can put his

1425
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,220
put his hand out

1426
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,260
like everybody else.

1427
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,400
What are those?

1428
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,220
They got the crowd

1429
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,720
crowdfunding or that?

1430
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,280
What's that?

1431
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,580
Go fund me.

1432
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,100
Yeah.

1433
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:03,920
Yeah, right.

1434
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,380
The new

1435
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:04,900
the new

1436
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,780
Go Trump yourself.

1437
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,600
Go Trump yourself.

1438
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,500
The new

1439
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,840
funding program.

1440
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,440
I've actually seen

1441
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,020
people start

1442
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:15,880
Go Fund Me

1443
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,580
that so that they

1444
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,340
could drink, you know,

1445
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,040
send me money.

1446
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:19,340
Yes.

1447
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:19,700
Drink.

1448
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,000
I can't afford to drink

1449
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
as much as I want.

1450
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,340
Didn't Janice Joplin

1451
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,380
make a song about that?

1452
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:24,700
Did she?

1453
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,320
Yes.

1454
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,080
Oh, Lord, won't you

1455
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,140
buy me a night on the town?

1456
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,180
Yes.

1457
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,220
Perfect.

1458
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,200
I'm counting on you, Lord.

1459
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,100
Please don't let me down.

1460
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:31,840
She did.

1461
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,740
Prove that you love me

1462
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,600
and buy the next round.

1463
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,140
Yeah.

1464
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,120
And Priestess Pisces

1465
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,340
did a takeoff on it

1466
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,440
last week at the very

1467
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,420
end of this show.

1468
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:39,820
Marvelous takeoff.

1469
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,000
Well, they're certainly

1470
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,960
not celibates.

1471
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,560
We know that.

1472
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,180
And we've witnessed

1473
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:44,940
some of the strange

1474
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:45,800
acrobatics.

1475
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,040
Mom and Dad used to

1476
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:47,720
report on the

1477
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,680
History Channel,

1478
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,420
as it were.

1479
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,600
You've witnessed

1480
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,480
Mom and Dad acrobatics?

1481
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:54,840
Oh, of course.

1482
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,640
At least when I was

1483
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,260
into my late 50s

1484
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,560
or 60s or 70s.

1485
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,020
Wow!

1486
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,800
Probably my late

1487
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,780
100s or something

1488
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,280
like that.

1489
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,200
They'd fly by

1490
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,060
just as rapidly

1491
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,120
as a raven

1492
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,960
in the Mad Men's

1493
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,700
scrawl.

1494
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,320
Wow.

1495
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,440
Dave's parents

1496
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,540
were circus people,

1497
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:10,960
you know.

1498
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,020
I did not know that.

1499
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:12,280
Yeah.

1500
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,260
They weren't actually

1501
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,560
the main acrobats.

1502
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,220
They did do acrobatics.

1503
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,580
They were involved

1504
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,560
in another...

1505
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:20,580
They dressed like clowns

1506
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,480
and did milder acrobatics.

1507
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,080
There was the one

1508
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,140
accident one time.

1509
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,400
He said that they

1510
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,360
cut a rope

1511
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,240
or that the...

1512
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,200
something was wrong

1513
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,220
with the main line

1514
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,400
and so that's why...

1515
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:30,460
Cut the cheese.

1516
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,640
Cut the something.

1517
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,340
Princess Andrew's

1518
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:33,580
Lena

1519
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,500
actually

1520
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,120
fell on top

1521
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,620
of somebody

1522
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,300
and broke

1523
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,120
the person's

1524
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,560
foot.

1525
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,220
But that was

1526
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,140
mostly happening

1527
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,120
in the sideshow,

1528
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,700
wasn't it?

1529
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,420
Not the main...

1530
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,720
tent.

1531
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,340
No.

1532
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,300
Well, there were

1533
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,220
a couple big tent shows

1534
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,340
but no,

1535
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:50,880
they were mostly

1536
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,580
in the sideshow.

1537
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,460
That's okay, Dave.

1538
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,720
Most of our friends

1539
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,420
in the circus

1540
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,380
are the sideshow

1541
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,060
people too.

1542
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,720
They're all bearded.

1543
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,060
They're all...

1544
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:00,960
No, just the ladies.

1545
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,160
Andrew the Impaled

1546
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,320
and David Apocalypse,

1547
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,180
they're sideshow

1548
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:04,840
performers

1549
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,580
and they're not...

1550
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,740
They're not...

1551
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,720
They're both

1552
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,500
clean-shaven

1553
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:09,840
fellas.

1554
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:10,720
Absolutely.

1555
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,280
One thing you could say

1556
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:12,440
is...

1557
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:12,860
They're covered

1558
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,400
with blood

1559
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,240
and scars

1560
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,080
and tattoos.

1561
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,620
You know?

1562
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,620
You can really

1563
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,480
Those aren't tattoos,

1564
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,380
Princess Wee.

1565
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:18,880
Uh-oh.

1566
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,720
Those are tumors.

1567
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,720
Uh-oh.

1568
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,120
They're very

1569
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,240
artistic tumors.

1570
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:22,800
I see.

1571
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,420
Very artistic.

1572
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,480
Designer tumors.

1573
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,360
Yeah, the one

1574
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,160
happens to look

1575
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,120
kind of like a skull.

1576
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:27,760
That's why you

1577
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,460
thought it was a tattoo.

1578
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,460
Ah, okay.

1579
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,100
Yeah.

1580
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,040
They grew those

1581
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,480
themselves.

1582
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,060
Wow.

1583
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:32,940
They just injected

1584
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,520
some Trump

1585
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,340
under their skin.

1586
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,180
Well, it's almost

1587
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,060
harvest time.

1588
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,820
That's what we should

1589
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,960
be thinking of, comrades.

1590
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,100
These tumors

1591
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,140
are about to be picked

1592
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:40,680
at the height

1593
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,380
of their flavor

1594
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,200
and delicacy

1595
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,020
and taken

1596
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:43,980
to the nearest market

1597
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,360
to make the party,

1598
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,020
Thomas ours,

1599
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:46,720
and of course

1600
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,540
the corporate heads

1601
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,200
smaller than usual.

1602
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,500
So let's all

1603
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,680
get together right now

1604
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,420
as quickly as we

1605
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,120
possibly can.

1606
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:53,740
Join together

1607
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,480
in one vast movement

1608
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,320
of silk and iron.

1609
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,080
A movement of

1610
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,860
depth and clarity.

1611
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,300
And we can just

1612
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,760
all just forget

1613
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,540
about all the rest

1614
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:04,960
too, please.

1615
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,940
Thanks for the

1616
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:06,420
hummingbirds.

1617
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:06,900
You know.

1618
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,180
Smaller heads,

1619
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:09,940
did you say?

1620
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,200
Much, much

1621
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,060
smaller heads,

1622
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:12,560
my friend.

1623
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,580
The kind that only

1624
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,220
the head of a pin

1625
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,280
would compare to.

1626
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:16,720
Ah.

1627
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,140
Pin head.

1628
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:18,960
So yeah,

1629
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,900
the side right there,

1630
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,200
we're back in the sideshow

1631
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:21,700
in that remark.

1632
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,120
Yeah.

1633
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,500
Yeah, that's why

1634
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,200
I started singing

1635
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,100
Gibba Gabba,

1636
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,020
We Accept You,

1637
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:26,580
One of Us,

1638
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,340
much in the same

1639
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,520
vernacular as

1640
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,740
The Church of the Subgenius.

1641
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,280
We accept you

1642
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,080
despite the fact

1643
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,560
that you are

1644
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,620
semi-functional.

1645
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,600
You know,

1646
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,080
I was in

1647
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,400
Todd Browning's Freaks

1648
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,200
when I was a teenager.

1649
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,380
I was in that.

1650
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,660
I was the chicken man.

1651
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,940
He had great big glasses,

1652
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,900
kind of a bald head

1653
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,200
and a little bit of hair.

1654
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:45,500
I was a little skittish

1655
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,380
No, no, you didn't.

1656
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,260
No, that was me

1657
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,840
in high school.

1658
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,180
You were a chicken man

1659
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:51,660
in high school?

1660
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,180
Yep.

1661
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,380
1933, I think.

1662
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:54,900
Yeah.

1663
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,480
Did you win

1664
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,720
the Robuster Award?

1665
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,300
No, but I got paid.

1666
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:00,880
I think it was

1667
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,760
20 bucks a day

1668
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,520
back then

1669
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,840
for, you know,

1670
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,600
sideshow people

1671
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,400
in the movies.

1672
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:05,960
Oh, that was

1673
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,700
big money then.

1674
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1675
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,300
That was a real

1676
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,080
good day's pay.

1677
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,540
Chicken,

1678
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,440
fried chicken

1679
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,340
and pizza

1680
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,020
or badly made

1681
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:15,200
chicken?

1682
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,040
Chinese food or?

1683
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,700
Yeah, mostly

1684
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,800
badly made

1685
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,540
Chinese food.

1686
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:20,580
Oh, that's

1687
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:20,780
inexpensive.

1688
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,220
Oh, that's

1689
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:23,880
my favorite.

1690
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,460
That's everyone's

1691
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,060
favorite today.

1692
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,680
That's all I've ever

1693
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,480
let me have

1694
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,440
in this job.

1695
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,740
Four walls, man.

1696
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,880
That's the way it is.

1697
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,240
Yeah.

1698
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,500
We must accept

1699
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,680
our own mutual

1700
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,440
enslavement.

1701
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,160
We've all helped

1702
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,500
put each other

1703
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,840
in these tiny

1704
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,760
little cubicles

1705
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,120
and now we won't

1706
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,140
let each other out,

1707
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:43,800
I believe,

1708
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,340
perhaps.

1709
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,100
Perhaps.

1710
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,420
And we just have

1711
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,120
to sit around

1712
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,560
in this room

1713
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,540
waiting another

1714
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,460
week while all

1715
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,300
the other victims

1716
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,220
have to do their

1717
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,680
shows.

1718
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,740
Wait our turn

1719
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,820
and then sit down

1720
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,960
in the hot seat

1721
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,840
and do our show.

1722
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,840
There's no escape.

1723
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:02,600
They don't let

1724
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,540
Brother Love leave.

1725
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:04,960
Dr. Sinister's

1726
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,360
over there

1727
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,100
in the other room.

1728
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,580
Keith's asleep

1729
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,580
underneath the

1730
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,540
console in there.

1731
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,140
Right.

1732
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,460
The whole station,

1733
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,300
everybody's,

1734
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,460
they keep us here.

1735
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,080
It's like a

1736
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:15,560
submarine.

1737
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,500
Yep.

1738
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,940
Won't let you go.

1739
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,700
You can tell

1740
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,500
by the way these

1741
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,080
shows sound

1742
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,380
that we're victims.

1743
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,440
We're prisoners.

1744
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,580
We're kept here.

1745
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,720
But luckily,

1746
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:27,500
we'll only be here

1747
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:27,720
for,

1748
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,860
we only have to

1749
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,440
keep talking

1750
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,600
for another four,

1751
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,020
no,

1752
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:31,900
three and a half minutes.

1753
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,180
Well,

1754
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:34,560
he's just,

1755
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,080
you know.

1756
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,080
I love that last,

1757
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,100
the last five seconds

1758
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:38,800
of the show

1759
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,240
because I know

1760
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:40,880
that I'll be able

1761
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,160
to shut up finally

1762
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:42,820
and the listeners,

1763
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,800
I know they feel

1764
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,480
the same way.

1765
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:45,540
They're crying

1766
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,520
for the same thing.

1767
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:46,860
They're going,

1768
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,940
oh man,

1769
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,920
I'm going to be so glad

1770
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,040
when this show's over

1771
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,480
and Stank can shut up

1772
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,920
and I can,

1773
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,200
well,

1774
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:55,760
but then,

1775
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,860
then what do they get?

1776
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,240
Dr. Sinister

1777
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,100
or whatever other

1778
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,600
person is coming in

1779
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,100
for our beloved

1780
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,300
other sister stations.

1781
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,420
You know.

1782
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,020
Yes.

1783
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,440
It's not Dr. Sinister

1784
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:07,960
everywhere.

1785
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,240
Not on every station.

1786
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:09,520
Yeah.

1787
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,420
But someday,

1788
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,260
it will be Dr. Sinister

1789
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,340
on every station

1790
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:13,900
all day.

1791
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,100
Hey,

1792
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,340
it's the only hope

1793
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,180
against Trump.

1794
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,020
I don't think Dr. Sinister

1795
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,540
is in on in Knoxville.

1796
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,380
No.

1797
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:24,900
No, no, no.

1798
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,200
Now what do you mean

1799
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,820
by he's not in on Knoxville?

1800
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,420
Well, I was saying

1801
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,920
we're on the air

1802
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,720
in Knoxville

1803
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,680
once a week now

1804
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,900
by the miracle of

1805
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,660
Oh yeah, of course.

1806
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,060
That's right.

1807
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,420
Me mailing CDs

1808
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,000
to Knoxville actually

1809
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,800
is how that works.

1810
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,420
I was wearing

1811
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,160
the sunglasses

1812
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,200
and the pig nose.

1813
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:39,880
I'm sorry.

1814
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,440
Yeah.

1815
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,580
I used to mail cassettes

1816
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,900
to WCSB

1817
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,020
from Dallas.

1818
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,700
But the female cassettes

1819
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,260
were the ones

1820
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:48,760
that you were

1821
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,780
most particularly

1822
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:51,720
interested

1823
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,800
at least in your career

1824
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,480
there before

1825
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,700
all of the problems

1826
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,580
with the law

1827
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,700
and a couple

1828
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,380
of underage

1829
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,100
elderly women.

1830
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,260
Now, Dave,

1831
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,200
I'm going to have

1832
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,240
to fade you out

1833
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,740
if you keep this up.

1834
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,060
We've made an agreement.

1835
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:07,760
No more

1836
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,020
dirty laundry

1837
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,220
old history now.

1838
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,380
But it's such good talk.

1839
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,140
You know,

1840
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,620
it's good talk radio, man.

1841
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,780
To hear the things

1842
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,960
that you had to go through

1843
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,700
to make things worse

1844
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,300
in your life.

1845
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:20,720
Didn't you?

1846
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,440
Didn't you?

1847
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,500
You do represent a model

1848
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,760
that we can all look up to

1849
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,040
and go,

1850
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,480
what the hell

1851
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,260
are we looking at?

1852
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:25,940
It's a contradiction

1853
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,660
in terms.

1854
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,860
Good talk radio.

1855
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,520
That's like

1856
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,920
good daytime TV.

1857
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:30,840
Yeah, right.

1858
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,760
Or good mime.

1859
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,160
No, that's a little

1860
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,260
No, you wouldn't see again.

1861
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,000
You're bringing up

1862
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,080
my sad past.

1863
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,060
I'm sorry.

1864
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,480
I love mimes.

1865
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,180
You know that.

1866
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,240
Good tofu.

1867
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,340
You love everything.

1868
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,740
Well, yes.

1869
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,840
I had dressed up

1870
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,780
like a Snoopy

1871
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,720
as a Christmas dog

1872
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,260
one time.

1873
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,880
Okay, I've got to

1874
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,240
we've got to get out of here now.

1875
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,200
What kind of

1876
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,160
goofy thing

1877
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,120
can I put on

1878
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,300
to get it?

1879
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:56,880
Beethoven.

1880
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,460
A little bit of the old

1881
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,560
you know

1882
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,080
Ludwig van

1883
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,000
and that there.

1884
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,580
No.

1885
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,980
No, I'm just going to

1886
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,200
put on a nice little

1887
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,320
mysterious instrumental

1888
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,600
by Reverend A.T.

1889
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:11,760
Old history.

1890
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,960
By Reverend A.T.?

1891
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,560
Yeah, Reverend A.T.

1892
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,620
sent some music.

1893
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:17,780
Cool beans.

1894
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,580
Hey, you know what we didn't

1895
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,160
we never did?

1896
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,120
We never read through

1897
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,980
Charlie Worsham's thing.

1898
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,640
Charlie in New York

1899
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,060
or someplace far away.

1900
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,900
He was actually a contributor

1901
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,180
to subgenius shows

1902
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,860
back in the 80s.

1903
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,000
And he sent a letter here

1904
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,640
with a note that said

1905
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,400
open them on the air

1906
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,600
and tell us what you have.

1907
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,380
And it's wacky packaging.

1908
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,160
I think you should keep that

1909
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
for the next show.

1910
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,420
Hostage filled cupcakes.

1911
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,500
Screech tragic embalming type.

1912
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,160
Dampers.

1913
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,120
Sure to rust your hampers.

1914
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,500
Irish ring leaves rings

1915
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,840
around your tub, Agora.

1916
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,440
And armor hot dogs.

1917
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,640
Armor metal encased hot dogs.

1918
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,980
Some of those are

1919
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,420
dead on the same

1920
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,520
as old brain rot.

1921
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:07,640
For instance,

1922
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:08,740
the hostage cupcakes.

1923
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,160
Well, hostage, yeah.

1924
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,200
Hostage filled

1925
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,520
with mud cupcakes.

1926
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,700
The food kidnappers

1927
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,780
give their victims.

1928
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,540
Oh, that's weird.

1929
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,000
Well, we expanded it

1930
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,220
and in a different direction.

1931
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,760
Screech tragic embalming type.

1932
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,200
Well, happy Halloween, everyone.

1933
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,960
If the metal encased hot dog

1934
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,580
was empty,

1935
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,000
it would be a Halloweener.

1936
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,460
Oh, stop it, you.

1937
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,880
Okay, well, we'll see

1938
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,560
something somewhere someday.

1939
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,020
Perhaps.

1940
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:41,520
There.

1941
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,380
Okay, there's Reverend Castro.

1942
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:43,580
He might000.

1943
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:43,720
He's music.

1944
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,600
I'm out of here.

1945
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,340
Bye, Dave.

1946
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,300
Bye, Dave.

1947
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,040
Bye, everyone.

1948
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1949
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,160
Oh, yeah.

1950
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:54,860
Oh.

1951
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:07,200
Oh, yeah.

1952
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:09,840
Oh.

1953
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:10,100
Oh.

1954
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:10,940
Oh.

1955
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1956
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1957
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1958
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1959
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1960
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1961
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1962
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1963
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1964
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000


1965
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,280
Thank you.

1966
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,580
Thank you.

1967
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,360
Thank you.

1968
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:50,760
Thank you.

1969
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,920
Thank you.
