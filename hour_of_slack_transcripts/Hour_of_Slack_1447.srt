1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Our friends, this is Hour of Slack number 1,447, a rerun of Hour of Slack number 753 from the year of 2000.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:28,000
We know now that in the early years of the 20th century, this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's, and yet as mortal as his own.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:45,940
We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.

4
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,520
Mob?

5
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,420
Mob?

6
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,660
And now, the subgenius!

7
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,980
Hour of Slack!

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,760
Slack!

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,020
Slack!

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:27,200
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of...

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:40,800
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show, the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

12
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:50,660
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

13
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:57,980
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases, but truth is, not everyone gets the...

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,340
...picture.

15
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,820
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpremissible truths are happy truths.

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,960
Here's your host, the Reverend Pippi Stinks.

17
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:18,480
Well, to usher in this brand new month with a brand new disclaimer, here's the Reverend Pippi Stinks.

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,380
Today is the last day of the end of your life.

19
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,100
Pippi...

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,980
Look at it that way... Tomorrow...

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,960
and, you know, there won't even be a tomorrow.

22
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,640
So what you gonna do about it?

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,640
Might as well just lay back and enjoy it.

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,620
It's like bad weather.

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,960
Get back down.

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,500
Slide into it.

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,620
If you hit it hard,

28
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,780
it's hard as a rock.

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,380
But if you touch it gently,

30
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,160
it talks.

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,980
Caress it like a dog.

32
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,460
It accepts you.

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,120
Oh, thank you so very much.

34
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,660
It is like a fluid.

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,500
You are truly, truly.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,200
Through which you can float.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,500
My one-eyed guru.

38
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,560
And if you run into it,

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,500
I have worshiped other one-eyed gurus.

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,660
But as you snuggle up.

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,900
Through aeons by,

42
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,100
I have wasted my spiritual juices.

43
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,340
It's like a warm, fuzzy,

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,820
bathtub full of

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,620
hot material.

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:27,800
But now,

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,180
when I see you rising in the eastern horizon,

48
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,320
fuzzy and red,

49
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,120
and made and built for my sexual pleasures,

50
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,560
I can only offer up my squanderances

51
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,740
in what meager supplies of vestal surges are.

52
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,320
Dave's talking to his dog again.

53
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh puppy.

54
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,160
Salutations.

55
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,820
Today I feel a sense of urgency as I speak to you for Devo Incorporated.

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:56,780
Salutations. Today I feel a sense of urgency as I speak to you for Devo Incorporated.

57
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:56,780


58
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,000
There is a direct connection between Devo's work in the music field

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,460
There is a direct connection between Devo's work in the music field

60
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,720
and a big wiggly world around us.

61
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:03,760


62
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,300
You may not be aware of this, but we are in the middle of World War III.

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,640
It is not nuclear bombs that we must fear.

64
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,700
The weapon is the human mind or lack of it on this planet.

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,900
That will determine our fate.

66
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,720
Capital punishment for airline passengers who attempt to save money.

67
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,800
Spud men in gas lines who forgot that guns don't work.

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,560
And tourists attempting to catch some rays at Three Mile Island

69
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,940
add up to a major attack of corkscrews in the brain.

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,920
We must fight back.

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,100
We must know what we want.

72
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,140
We must want what we need.

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,160
And what we need is duty now for the future.

74
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,180
They make me say things.

75
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,780
We're all here tonight to praise Bob.

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,300
He's kind of...

77
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,420
He's shown us that Devo works in parallel ways

78
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,960
with other pockets of humans on this planet.

79
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,860
Where we thought we were alone,

80
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,620
we know there are now other human forms

81
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,580
that believe in conscious mutation.

82
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,220
As he knows, Bob is merely an enema for a constipated society.

83
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,400
These people here are here to help a constipated society blow it out their ass.

84
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,160
Have you ever met Bob?

85
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,640
Well, like I said, Bob would appear in my bedroom

86
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,940
and chase me around, making me do jumping jacks.

87
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,460
Peek-a-boo!

88
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,200
I know what you do.

89
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
Cause I do it too.

90
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,420
Intelligence.

91
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,300
Intelligence.

92
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,500
No.

93
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,360
No.

94
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,660
No.

95
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:58,660


96
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:58,660


97
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:58,660


98
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:58,660


99
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,840
Am I as smart as I think?

100
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
Probably not.

101
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,080
That's good.

102
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,300
Daily disease cannot feel pain.

103
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,160
No.

104
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,480
No.

105
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:12,620


106
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,000
No.

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,400


108
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:13,720


109
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:13,760


110
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,320


111
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,320


112
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,320


113
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,560
No.

114
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


115
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


116
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


117
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,680
No.

118
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,300
No.

119
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,900
There will always be time for DeVoe.

120
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,600
Where we were raised, we were taught this is the way that music should be played.

121
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,780
Thank you.

122
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,840
From little snails, I say it's all just for themselves.

123
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,780
Are we not men?

124
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,500
We are DeVoe.

125
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,440
Are we not men?

126
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,880
We are DeVoe.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,160
Working heads held, we are not whole.

128
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,420
Working heads all, can't go home.

129
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,460
Are we not men?

130
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,340
We are DeVoe.

131
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,020
Are we not men?

132
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,500
We are DeVoe.

133
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,380
Are we not men?

134
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,140
We are DeVoe.

135
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,060
Are we not men?

136
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,700
We are DeVoe.

137
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,300
In business, teachers and critics all dance the blues.

138
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,080
Are we not men?

139
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,000
We are DeVoe.

140
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,780
Are we not men?

141
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,340
DeVoe.

142
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,260
Are we not men?

143
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,240
We are DeVoe.

144
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
Are we not men?

145
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,580
DeVoe.

146
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:39,280
hear us shout in the thighs that assigned by irony,

147
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,060
You order by the collection,

148
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,120
Light supporters,

149
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,520
So arise that zeros are persons,

150
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,140
I've got a rhyme that starts with a riddle

151
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,680
Ohio

152
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,300
What's round in the ends and high in the middle?

153
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:58,920
Ohio

154
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,380
God made man, but he used to want you to do it

155
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,180
Makes it a plan, but wants to ruin it

156
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,460
Can one thing, one thing, do what I want you to do?

157
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,680
God made man, but I want you to supply the deal

158
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,560
Norma, Norma, let go of the sofa. It's time to go now.

159
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, Carol, I am having second thoughts.

160
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,120
Now we've discussed this, Norma, so just let go of the curtains.

161
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,340
When you think of inviting a friend to church or synagogue,

162
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,040
you probably imagine meeting some resistance.

163
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,600
Norma, let go of the emergency brake.

164
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,420
No, no, really, Carol, I think I changed my mind.

165
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,620
Please, the steering wheel, huh?

166
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,500
The more you think about it, the more you think about it.

167
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,720
The more you worry about it, the more you imagine how difficult it will be.

168
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,620
Please, Norma, let go of the door.

169
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,540
Oh, I just can't go through with it.

170
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,820
But it's probably just your imagination, and your friend will actually thank you in the end.

171
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,360
Carol, the service was wonderful. I feel so good, I almost hate to leave.

172
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,380
Well, maybe we'll come back next week.

173
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,620
Come on, Norma, let go of the pew.

174
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,820
If religion enriches your life, share the wealth.

175
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
This week, invite a friend.

176
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,880
A service of the Advertising Council and Religion in American Life.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,440
Bob?

178
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,140
Hey, you might be sitting there looking around at yourself going,

179
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,860
well, now, so this is the Church of the Subgenius.

180
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,300
Well, there's all kinds of people here.

181
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,500
I was...

182
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,640
And I'm trying to understand these people.

183
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,980
I'd like to understand a little bit more about this Church of the Subgenius.

184
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,520
Well, friends, these ones around here that seem to be sort of fanatic,

185
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,600
like they really believe this stuff.

186
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,140
Friends, those are the ones who have given their brains to Bob!

187
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,420
And I'm not going to try to get everybody here to give their brains to Bob for good, like I did.

188
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,060
But you just tried giving your brain to Bob temporarily.

189
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,000
And you may find you like it.

190
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,140
You may find that you didn't need that brain all that much.

191
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,580
Why do you think we call it Church of the Subgenius?

192
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,340
Jesus Christ!

193
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:15,860


194
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:28,520
As I crossed the desert, pulling myself along by my stumps,

195
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,660
and it's very hard to pull oneself with using stumps,

196
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:40,100
I would just wrap my handless limb around the cactuses to pull myself forward.

197
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,020
But I knew that it would be worth it.

198
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:53,100
For I had heard the call, and I had smelt the smoke of the pipe of the piper.

199
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,400
He was... I knew...

200
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,880
And what a horrible liar he was.

201
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,040
He was the one to follow.

202
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,860
To follow!

203
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,140
No matter that I had blinded myself blundering after him in his path.

204
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,380
Like a bumbling, sickening Christ.

205
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,980
No wonder that I had chopped my own hands off in devotion.

206
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,220
And was crawling, pulling myself along the desert.

207
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,080
A shiny visage in the dark.

208
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,400
Nothing to drink but Helium Monster Blood.

209
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,220
Nothing to drink but Helium Monster Blood.

210
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,880
But my love for Bob.

211
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,820
My guru, my savior, my sweet, sweet...

212
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,860
Bob.

213
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,200
Surely this, the quest for Bob alone, was slack.

214
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,800
I thought as I wrapped my arms around yet another prickly pair of cactus

215
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,900
to drag myself forward as the ants and the rattlesnakes crawled over me.

216
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,380
My only friend.

217
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,840
I crossed my promise to四-o-оры and Champions.

218
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:40,840


219
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:40,840

Oh, yes, dear friends, Blockhead by the Doguloids.

266
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,180
I wonder if they're any relation to my old friend, the Mongreloids.

267
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,120
And before that, friends, lots of subgenius preaching

268
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,760
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra on WCSB in Cleveland

269
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,080
and at the Blind Lemon in Cleveland.

270
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,080
Before that,

271
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,880
the Jocko Homo version was by the band called C.D. Truth.

272
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,720
C.D. Truth, who we just saw live at the Devotional Day of Atonement, friends,

273
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,220
an international Devo spud harvest held here in Cleveland

274
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,100
by Michael Comer, Toth Wilder, and Ace, and Devo,

275
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,160
and we heard Mark Mothersbaugh,

276
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,620
your fellow reverend Mark Mothersbaugh,

277
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,220
on TV.

278
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,800
Bob and General Boy, progenitor of the Devos,

279
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,280
who was live at the Devo Day of Atonement.

280
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,820
Also, we heard, friends, puzzling evidence,

281
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,860
the original puzzling evidence,

282
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,080
and our original live, dead, live announcer,

283
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,180
Bleepo Abernathy.

284
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,600
Friends, the Devo convention was great.

285
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,620
There were wonderful bands,

286
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,060
many fellow subgenius.

287
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,640
Alan Meyer's shoes,

288
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,740
the whip from Whippet, friends,

289
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:21,380
but the DevoCon is not the same as the con,

290
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,700
as in conspiracy.

291
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,120
Well, what is the conspiracy?

292
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,340
It's 20th century traditions.

293
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,060
It's the old traditions.

294
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,200
It's all the things that got us where we are now.

295
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,620
It's the old traditions. It's all the things that got us where we are now.

296
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,620
It's Christ without a penis.

297
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,280
He's part of the conspiracy.

298
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,180
It's presidents that don't look like they're capable of getting erections anymore.

299
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,100
That's the conspiracy.

300
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,180
Hey, Benz, you've just been had.

301
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,220

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,620
We are not home

306
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,160
We're pinheads all home

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,360
Jot the hormone

Are we not men?

309
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,120
We are devils

310
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,520
Are we not men?

311
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,080
God created man

312

God created man

313
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,540
But he needed the monkey to do it

314
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,960
Monkey man

315
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,260
In business suits

316
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,220

We are devils

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,680
Are we not men?

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,220
We are devils

322
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,320
Well, are we not men?

323
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,940
We are devils

324
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,200
Yes, are we not men?

325
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,560
Extremely interesting and extremely worthwhile artistic performances.

What is this?

357
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,800
With infinite complacence,

358
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,880
people went to and fro over the earth

359
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,900
about their little affairs.

360
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,960
Serene in the assurance of their dominion

361
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,860
over this small, spinning

362
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,620
fragment of solar driftwood,

363
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,940
which by chance or design,

364
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,760
man has inherited

365
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
out of the dark mystery of time and space.

366
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,000
Yet across an immense, ethereal

367
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,240
gulf, minds

368
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,400
that are to our minds

369
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,960
as ours are to the beasts in the

370
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,280
jungle, intellects

371
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,340
vast,

372
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,520
cool and unsympathetic

373
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,860
regarded this earth

374
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,940
with envious eyes

375
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,820
and slowly and surely drew their plans

376
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,500
against us.

377
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,180
It was a thing I had to do.

378
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,880
It was a message from below.

379
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,540
It was a message situation.

380
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,220
It was desire for approval.

381
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,020
It was desire for approval.

382
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


383
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


384
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


385
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


386
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


387
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


388
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


389
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


390
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


391
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,020


392
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,160
I'm not a wanker or a banker.

393
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,700
I'm not afraid to take a risk.

394
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,560
It's the thing females ask for when they can taste opposite.

395
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,320
Before I die.

396
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,280
Before I die.

397
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,100
Before I die.

398
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,420
I'll get another piece of pie.

399
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,580
I'll get another piece of pie.

400
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,140
I have to die.

401
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,040
Ha!

402
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,460
It was a thing I had to do.

403
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,920
It was a message from below.

404
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,500
It was a messy situation.

405
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,360
It was a triumph of the will.

406
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,180
And the people just started to say.

407
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,720
When I die, before I die.

408
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,620
Before I die.

409
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,600
Before I die.

410
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,020
I'll get another piece of pie

411
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,100
Get another piece of pie

412
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,980
Get another piece of pie

413
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,660
If I have to lie

414
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,340
And when the well cries out for water

415
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,200
It is a need that must be filled

416
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,820
It goes beyond the laws of nature

417
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,320
It takes a triumph of the will

418
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,720
It takes a triumph of the will

419
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,540
It takes a triumph of the will

420
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,780
And now, CD Truth!

421
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:13,240
It takes a triumph of the will

422
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,540
Freedom of choice

423
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,080
Freedom of choice

424
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,840
An ancient poem

425
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
There was a poem

426
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,960
About a dog

427
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,700
Who found two bones

428
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,020
He kicked the one

429
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,720
He licked the other

430
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,300
He went in circles

431
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,720
He drowned dead

432
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,800
Freedom of choice

433
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,800
Is what you've got

434
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,900
Freedom of choice

435
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,860
Freedom of choice

436
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:52,860


437
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,820
Then you got it

438
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,460
But you don't want it

439
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,400
Seems to be the rule of thumb

440
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,080
Don't be tricked

441
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,440
By what you see

442
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,120
You've got two ways to go

443
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,320
Just say it again

444
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,220
And we'll let it hum anew

445
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,160
Freedom of choice

446
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,100
Freedom of choice

447
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Freedom of choice

448
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,680
Freedom of choice

449
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:13,960
Freedom of choice

450
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,720
Freedom of choice

451
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:15,800
Freedom of choice

452
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,480
We'll be right back.

453
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,440
We'll be right back.

454
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,420
We'll be right back.

455
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,560
We'll be right back.

456
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,120
We'll be right back.

457
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,460
We'll be right back.

458
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:46,960
We'll be right back.

459
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,020
We'll be right back.

460
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:16,400
We'll be right back.

461
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
We'll be right back.

462
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,180
We'll be right back.

463
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:46,140
We'll be right back.

464
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,820
We'll be right back.

465
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:20,800
We'll be right back.

466
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,180
We'll be right back.

467
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,980
We'll be right back.

468
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,240
We'll be right back.

469
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,080
We'll be right back.

470
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:09,260
We'll be right back.

471
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,900
We'll be right back.

472
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,600
We'll be right back.

473
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:22,600


474
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,360
plague.

475
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,360


476
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,440
plague.

477
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:41,980
plague.

478
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,620
plague.

479
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,000
take in one tiny pill.

480
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,180
Every afternoon at around

481
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,360
6 o'clock, Mom and Dad get awfully

482
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,460
sleepy, but with one shot of

483
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,360
God's Opaque, you'll be back

484
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,140
in Boozness again.

485
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,400
I can't believe it.

486
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:53,620
I can't believe it.

487
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,720
She's just a girl. She's just a girl.

488
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,580
The girl you want.

489
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,140
She's just a girl. She's just a girl.

490
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,180
The girl you want.

491
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,980
The girl you want.

492
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,760
You're in a corner

493
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,400
and we're waiting

494
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,020
for the day you turn.

495
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,760
You know you're headed for the pattern of burn.

496
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,600
When the words get stuck on the tip of your tongue.

497
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,080
She's the real thing

498
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,440
that you knew in our lives.

499
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,560
She's just a girl. She's just a girl.

500
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,700
The girl you want.

501
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,160
She's just a girl. She's just a girl.

502
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,760
She's just a girl. She's just a girl.

503
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,900
The girl you want.

504
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,360
She's out of your mind.

505
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:18,680
Come on, you.

506
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,380
Come on, You're радиot.

507
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,060
All right. Praise Connie.

508
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,660
I'm kidding.

509
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,220
Don't.

510
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,020
wan tooo yaaaa pag.

511
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,800
This is me.

512
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,400
What all you

513
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,540
thing you play

514
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,720
and it asleep, but I'm using

515
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,900
the Tesla even voice because it

516
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,140
stays on Batteries while I think

517
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,760
with your brains.

518
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,740
I've seen that so-called

519
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,160
vehicle.

520
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,380
the accelerator.

521
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:46,380


522
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:46,380


523
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:46,380


524
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,260
evidence before and maybe puzzling where it comes from, but as far as I'm concerned, it's just a lot

525
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,040
of the same hoopla that they've been feeding us all these years. Somebody ought to do something

526
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,980
about this business before it gets completely out of hand. Well, if that kind of thing doesn't

527
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:05,540
bother me, what I want to know is, when I talk to somebody, is he real when I'm talking to him?

528
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,940
Only when you're talking to him is he real. When he tries to answer, he becomes tape again.

529
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,200
Oh my God. Is this for real? No, no, no. This is just a tape. Relax. It is not the day before

530
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,160
or the week between. It's just the show. The show that, yes, was thrown into the bay three

531
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,620
weeks ago and struggled free of its chains and floated up, swam back to the studio here,

532
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,760
climbed up the antenna, and is now running all the way down those little air wires right into

533
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,980
your ears. You never know when you're here or not on this show because there's so many doctors.

534
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,680
Just a few dugs, sprinkle a few Gary's, drop a few bobs over here. Yes, I'm sorry, listener.

535
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,360
You've got a real problem now. They're alive all the time.

536
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:10,320
A puzzling evidence did it. Puzzling evidence did that. And this music in the background,

537
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,780
and all of my credits background music is from Mark Mothersbaugh's Christmas album,

538
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:24,860
Joyo Mutato. Girl You Want, that kick, kill, amazing version of Girl You Want was by

539
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:34,480
Robert Palmer and from Einstein's Secret Radio Show on, or Einstein's Secret Orchestra Radio

540
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:45,080
Show on WCSB. Lonesome, Cowboy Dave, Chaz Smith, yours truly, which is also heard strangely in the

541
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,180
insane music.

542
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,680
Mixed by TODCRA now.

543
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,220
Königschau knows whatcha time is gen 3

544
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:52,160
Always kept your distance when you built my friends near you

545
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,240
Love keeps on rolling over

546
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,540
Flying in between our four wheeled ships

547
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,120
The ship was supposed to take a leap to the plane

548
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,820
To be had and rehired in the thick of a feeling

549
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,760
Now it's strange

550
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,500
It's a strange first to be

551
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,140
It's a strange first to be

552
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,120
It's a strange first to be

553
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,700
I come running like a fat boy

554
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,120
In a suit like a fat boy

555
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,460
I don't come for nothing, yo

556
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,160
It's hopeless, I hope for the one thing I want

557
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,020
I got a strange

558
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,980
It's a strange first to be

559
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,800
I'm a little dazzled, but you don't have to

560
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,060
I'm a strange first to be

561
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,580
Taking my mind apart, I'm lost for a few seconds

562
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,400
It's a strange first to be

563
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,480
Never get stuck when you get to where you're at

564
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,640
It's a strange first to be

565
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,940
Time you can't stop, but you never turn the head forward

566
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,800
It's a strange first to be

567
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,060
Taking my mind apart, I'm lost for a few seconds

568
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,780
It's a strange first to be

569
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,220
Never get stuck when you get to where you're at

570
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,060
It's a strange first to be

571
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:54,460
You just can't stop, nobody can stop, no one can stop you

572
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,400
I won't stop, will run do what I want

573
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,740
You couldn't stop me once I told you

574
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:00,740


575
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,980
After I'm all dried up, dragon the dude

576
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,880
Fluged along on his way

577
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:05,880


578
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,840
No more inhabitants to two-one me

579
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,540
It's a strange first to be

580
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,760
and is coursing

581
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,620
like the love

582
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,960
of Bob.

583
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,520
The blood and the love

584
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,000
shall defeat their weak

585
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,740
god

586
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,660
with the power

587
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,640
of the blood

588
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,140
of Bob.

589
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,780
It devour the

590
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,360
weak and the unfit.

591
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,980
The dwarfish.

592
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,580
The stunted.

593
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,240
Oh, wait, no, that's us.

594
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,520
The handsome, the large,

595
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,080
the successful, yes, those we will bring

596
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,440
down and we will

597
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,920
raise up the dwarfish,

598
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,540
the stunted, the criminal,

599
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,500
the evil,

600
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,660
the bad,

601
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,020
the pug-nosed,

602
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,660
the pig people, yes.

603
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,020
Those shall become our

604
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,380
beautiful gods

605
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,320
and the

606
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,380
modern movie

607
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,380
stars and politicians,

608
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,100
they,

609
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,680
they shall become

610
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,400
our tongue-beaters

611
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,900
upon the face of society.

612
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,600
I'm trying, I only wanted to

613
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
check your underwear.

614
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,780
Because the revolution

615
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,920
is close at hand.

616
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,800
Mark my words, all the signs are there.

617
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,220
The conspiracy

618
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,800
is a running

619
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,060
whipped dog.

620
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,560
You can just tell

621
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,560
they think they're fooling us with their

622
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,380
silly elections and things.

623
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:36,720
Nobody,

624
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,260
and as soon

625
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,440
we will all

626
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,160
band together and

627
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,580
leap up and say

628
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,800
I'm mad as hell

629
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,260
and, uh,

630
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,480
I'm falling asleep.

631
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,320
Yes, yes,

632
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,880
that sounds like a better idea.

633
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,160
Let's forget this revolution

634
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,280
and have our own

635
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,360
spiritual revolution

636
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,520
in our navels.

637
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,400
A life

638
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,660
free from worry.

639
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,240
Free from cares.

640
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,500
In a condom condominium.

641
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,780
Hermetically sealed.

642
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,800
And kept from all trauma.

643
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:17,500
Mother Mary comes for me.

644
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,480
Whipping

645
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,560
words of wisdom.

646
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,720
Let it be.

647
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,640
Let it be.

648
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,140
Let it be.

649
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,660
I'm in a wheelchair.

650
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,820
I'm in a wheelchair.

651
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,000
He's in a wheelchair.

652
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,220
He's in a wheelchair.

653
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,180
He's in a wheelchair.

654
00:46:47,660 --> 00:47:01,520
But I want to know

655
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,360
and let it be with you.

656
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,500
I can breathe in the wild

657
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,440
I can't help but love this love

658
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,540
And I'm coming to the wind

659
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,760
I don't care

660
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,540
Coming to the wind

661
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,760
I don't care

662
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,580
Coming to the wind

663
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,580
I don't care

664
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,440
Coming to the wind

665
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,640
I don't care

666
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,020
Coming to the wind

667
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:10,760
I don't care

668
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,340
Coming to the wind

669
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,880
I don't care

670
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,560
Coming to the wind

671
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,780
I don't care

672
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,320
Coming to the wind

673
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,620
I don't care

674
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,860
Coming to the wind

675
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,200
celulose

676
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,420
Coming to the wind

677
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:06,420


678
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:06,420


679
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:06,420


680
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:06,420


681
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:06,420


682
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,100
I don't care, could it be a joke or a piece of cake?

683
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,500
I don't care, could it be a joke or a piece of cake?

684
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:24,900
We've got a plan in place, and we're flying high.

685
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:35,420
We've got a plan in place, and we're flying high.

686
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:45,560
But we've got a plan in place, and we're flying high.

687
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,560
We've got a plan in place, and we're flying high.

688
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,180
And we're flying high.

689
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,760
Now, could it be a joke or a piece of cake?

690
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:05,400
I don't care, could it be a joke or a piece of cake?

691
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,420
I don't care.

692
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:06,900
I don't care.

693
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,200
Could it be a joke or a piece of cake?

694
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,880
I don't care.

695
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,920
Could it be a joke or a piece of cake?

696
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,740
I don't care.

697
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:32,200
I don't care.

698
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,380
I don't care.

699
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:41,980
I don't care.

700
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,660
I don't care.

701
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,060
I don't care.

702
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,200
Just a joke, dude.

703
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,500
Just a joke.

704
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,700
Just a joke, dude.

705
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,720
He wasn't there, too.

706
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:58,900
I don't care.

707
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,540
I don't care.

708
00:50:59,540 --> 00:50:59,540


709
00:50:59,540 --> 00:50:59,540


710
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,400
I don't care either.

711
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,680
I don't care making jokes all day.

712
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:02,860
I don't care, neither.

713
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:02,860


714
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:02,860


715
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:02,860


716
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:02,860


717
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:02,860


718
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,000
Thanks, guys.

719
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,000


720
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,720
Thanks for doing a good job.

721
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,780
And thanks for doing a good job.

722
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,380
Thanks, guys.

723
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:06,380


724
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,660
Oh, wow, dude.

725
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,100
Hey, man.

726
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,600
You have your license?

727
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,080
Turn the radio down, sir.

728
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,180
What?

729
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,540
What?

730
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,400
I can't hear you.

731
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,500
Please step out of the car.

732
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,040
Step out of the car.

733
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,720
I can't hear you.

734
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,720
I can't hear you.

735
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,660
Wake up, my friend.

736
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,260
It's just a show.

737
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,860
Einstein's Secret Orchestra Radio and Jimmy.

738
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,620
Jimmy's in a wheelchair.

739
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,020
That Devo song by Crapper Keeper.

740
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,580
Michael Pilmer's band.

741
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,960
He used to do Silica Jelly.

742
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,660
And we also heard Strange Pursuits as performed by Gajito

743
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:52,600
with our oldest, youngest friend, Dr. Onan Canobite.

744
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,900
And now, the touch tones.

745
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,380
They tell us that we lost our tails.

746
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,860
It was enough from the first note.

747
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,100
I say it's tough.

748
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,340
Just wind and sail.

749
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,620
Are we not meant?

750
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,900
We are Devo.

751
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,040
Are we not meant?

752
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,140
We are Devo.

753
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,100
Okay, here's the story.

754
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,940
But aren't you going to molest me some more?

755
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,520
Dr. Piper Pop?

756
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,820
All right, climb right up here on my...

757
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,000
That's right, that's a good boy.

758
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,140
Climb right up here on my lap.

759
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:52,800
Now bend over.

760
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,480
I'm going to have to give you...

761
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:54,980
Oh, boy!

762
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,680
Can I have my spanking?

763
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,540
We're all Devo.

764
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,080
Come on, boys.

765
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,980
Come on all over here.

766
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,960
And the doctor's going to give you a good spanking

767
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,800
and teach you about Planet X.

768
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,520
We're just cannibal eggs.

769
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:04,880
Huh?

770
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,320
Huh?

771
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,660
And so,

772
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,280
the poor little children were abused and abandoned

773
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,240
by the evil doctor.

774
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,860
Left to their own devices,

775
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,920
there wasn't much left to eat

776
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,200
but rat meat and sundaes for the week.

777
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,840
Some of the little boys resorted to crying,

778
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,720
but they knew they had to be bigger than that.

779
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,860
They had to stand tough and swallow back their tears.

780
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,500
This is the end of the show.

781
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:34,500


782
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:34,500


783
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,200
This is the story of Cry Baby Duck.

784
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,440
They said he cried too much.

785
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,000
Then he cried some more.

786
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,340
Poor little duck.

787
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,060
What could he do now?

788
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,220
Then he began to cry.

789
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,740
And again, he began to cry.

790
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,920
Cry Baby Duck.

791
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,260
Cry Baby Duck.

792
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:04,500
Cry Baby Duck.

793
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:04,500


794
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:04,500


795
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:04,500


796
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:04,500


797
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:04,500


798
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:04,660
Cry Baby Duck.

799
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:04,980
More tears.

800
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,140
So, drip, drip came the tears.

801
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,700
Cry Baby Duck cried harder than ever.

802
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,080
He did not want to go away.

803
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,740
This was his home.

804
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,600
And he wanted to stay.

805
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,940
Cry Baby Duck drank and drank.

806
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,120
He was happy.

807
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,860
He was happy.

808
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,700
He was glad.

809
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,780
He was glad.

810
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,860
He was happy day after day.

811
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,080
So, Cry Baby Duck cried again.

812
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,060
I remember when I had that harmful, and they removed both of my hands,

813
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,300
they removed my feet, and they showed them back on.

814
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,260
So I don't really see...

815
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,280
Seven times a night.

816
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:50,200
Well, actually, they cut them off seven times, but only sew them back on six.

817
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,080
Six times?

818
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,860
And you have to learn, by the seventh time, you have to learn how to do it yourself.

819
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,780
That's how the aliens really work.

820
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,500
I don't know if actual learning is involved.

821
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,480
It's more of a rote task, isn't it?

822
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,340
Well, we'll be back next week.

823
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,620
Till then...

824
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,100
We'll be back next week.

825
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,880
Keep your hat on tight.

826
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,560
You're back to the wind, and your sack firmly seated in the saddle.

827
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,040
Keep the caps on your feces bottles at all times.

828
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,200
Make sure the sunstroke medicine is correctly prepared and hermetically quarmed.

829
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:30,860
And make sure that Mom and Dad have restructured the DNA groups for both you and yourself.

830
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,400
And don't forget to pray.

831
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,480
Pray for Dave here.

832
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,740
I need not your prayers.

833
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,700
I worship not your false god.

834
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,120
I worship the bright shining star.

835
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,900
I worship the evening star.

836
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,700
Please.

837
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,840
Adios, muchachos.

838
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,220
Please keep those cards and letters coming.

839
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:11,060
Please spread our song to all wherever you are or whatever area you live.

840
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:15,640
Stay in touch with us wherever you might be.

841
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,860
Thanks, Dave.

842
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,460

They seem to be in touch with everybody that I was.

850
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,640
And friends, the Church of the Subgenius can always be reached at, you've got that pencil ready?

851
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:50,460
After you remember to check the website at www.subgenius.com, I want you to write down Bob's address.

852
00:56:50,560 --> 00:57:02,480
Yes, Hour of Slacker or Subgenius at P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 4417.

853
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,240
118.

854
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,400
Ah, yes, praise Bob.

855
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:26,080
I can see now from the drool perv, the material pouring out of his ears, that Dr. Stang, the lovely Dr. Reverend Ivan Stang, must mention his shoes tonight are just spectacular.

856
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,300
Speaking of the last words from the formication amulet of Dr. Pinky,

857
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,480
and the other...

858
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,860
...tracks from the liturgy already spoken by,

859
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:42,140
Dr. Stang will be making his next appearance at the Cow Arena in downtown Sundersburg,

860
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,880
brought to you by the Kiwanis and the people of Original Duskent.

861
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:51,960
Also this week on the forum for formulators, it's the...

862
00:57:51,960 --> 00:58:00,660
Well, it's the Reverend Ivan Stang again, speaking this time at Willie's Tavern on the corner of Barkmere and Handerbury.

863
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,440
This...

864
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:09,040
This evening's broadcast was brought to you by the manufacturers of sex-sexual subsensual...

865
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,360
Did I get this right?

866
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,400
I can't read the way...

867
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,060
I can't read this damn stuff.

868
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,220
Are you a bit of an audio nut?

869
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,220
You like to record stuff and find it to be somewhat of a hobby?

870
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:31,740
Yeah!

871
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,580
Want to subject other unfortunate souls to your eccentricities?

872
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,120
Just leave a cassette recording of your stuff anywhere.

873
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,120
Be it concerts, bars, or other public places, you can expose yourself to the public in a private and anonymous way.

874
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,300
And leave a message on a tape to encourage the listener to do the same, if he or she wishes to.

875
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,020
You heard of the internet? Get in on the cassette net.

876
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:53,800
Thank you.

877
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,080
Gosh, I don't even know the guy.

878
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:57,860
Bye.

879
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,100
Bye.

880
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,000
Our boss.

881
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,740
Our boss.

882
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:08,700
Our boss.

883
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,700
Our boss.

884
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,900
Our boss.

885
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:11,780
Our boss.

886
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,120
Our boss.

887
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,600
Hey, what's the matter, kid?

888
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,740
No good?

889
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,100
Ah, it's a lot of baloney.

890
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,160
Not for me.

891
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,320
Yeah, that's what I figured.

892
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,760
Well, good night.

893
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,200
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

894
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,540
Good night.

895
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,160
I'm a man of few words

896
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,340
Is the band ready to play now?

897
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:43,980
Ready?

898
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:44,880
Play!

899
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:45,860
And now

900
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,540
As a bonus

901
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,260
Cut

902
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,000
Mongoloid

903
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,880
By

904
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,980
Occupant

905
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,980
Praise

906
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,820
Onan

907
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,100
Onan

908
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,720
Onan

909
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,240
Onan

910
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,420
Onan

911
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,900
Move

912
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,360
Onan

913
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:11,460
Onan

914
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:12,120
Onan

915
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:12,640
Onan

916
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,040
Onan

917
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:13,180
Onan

918
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:13,540
Onan

919
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,560
Onan

920
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:16,400
Onan

921
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:16,400


922
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:16,400


923
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,760
He was a Michael Lloyd, and it determined what he could see.

924
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,340
Michael Lloyd, Michael Lloyd, not here.

925
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,520
Michael Lloyd.

926
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,880
Michael Lloyd.

927
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:16,860
Michael Lloyd.

928
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,760
Michael Lloyd.

929
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,160
Let's go.

930
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,500
You say you've heard it all before

931
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,780
Songs about my nuts

932
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,980
A song about a whore

933
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,140
I know a place where MCs get crushed

934
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:30,880
We can smash

935
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,040
And that ain't much

936
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:32,660
I got late

937
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,240
And paid

938
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,400
Had it made in the drug trade

939
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,420
Fuck minimum wage

940
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:36,320
I just got a page

941
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:36,940
Need a nickel

942
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:37,500
A dime

943
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,060
A twenty

944
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:38,460
I know

945
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:39,140
I'm a slinger

946
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,120
Motherfucker's got money

947
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:40,860
On my asshole

948
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:49,960
Going under

949
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,400
And I'm drunk as a skunk

950
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,040
Going under

951
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,400
Don't fuck with me, punk

952
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:53,980
Going under

953
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,640
I'm high as hell

954
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,820
The evolution is real

955
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,740
Can't you tell?

956
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,560
Going under

957
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,960
And I'm getting fucked up

958
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,840
Going under

959
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,120
And I'm with my boy Chuck

960
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,100
Going under

961
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,360
We're smoking blunts

962
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,220
Going under

963
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,640
And we're pulling stunts

964
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:09,520
Nine a.m.

965
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:09,700


966
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:14,520
Going under

967
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,380
Going under

968
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,460
Going under

969
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,600
And you motherfucking dig it

970
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,140
Going under

971
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,680
Give me a forty, I'll swing it

972
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,400
Going under

973
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,440
And I'm getting lit

974
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,560
Going under

975
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,600
I don't give a shit

976
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,720
Going under

977
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,700
Why you wanna step?

978
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:26,860
Going under

979
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,060
Hey, I'm gonna put you in check

That's right, I cordially invite you

01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,600
Come on

1031
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,100
another couple of months. Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1032
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:58,560
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should go to

1033
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:06,400
subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages and help out

1034
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:12,380
financially as best you can. Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1035
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:18,620
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse. But some of you still have

1036
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:25,880
jobs. Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1037
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:34,140
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference. All we're saying is that glow jobs could go the way

1038
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:40,640
of Steve jobs if you don't pay dogs. We also take checks and money orders to

1039
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:42,360
subgenius.com.

1040
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:55,020
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1041
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,240
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1042
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:18,720
We'll see you next time.
