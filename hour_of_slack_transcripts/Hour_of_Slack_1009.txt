From PR News in Washington, I'm charged with assaulting suspected insurgents and 3,000 hits.
Thousands of Jamaicans are ending the week at a long-time high next week.
A baby that weighs 500 pounds, 3 ounces, has this report.
Wiggling, wiggling didn't fix things.
People just need to get used to this.
Less than 1% of babies weigh more than PR News in Washington.
There is some pain involved in this procedure.
Enjoy yourselves.
Everybody at school was talking about it.
A surprise discovery.
Marijuana.
Oh, my God.
A very special 7-Even.
You know, it's like a bad dream.
If you pray to God, I'll wake up and...
Why would anybody do such a thing?
Why?
Hey, how about that?
It's a little woozy.
I've never smoked one of those before.
Yeah, you're kidding me.
Maybe a few times.
It's always the hard stuff.
Yeah, that's why.
That's why they call it a recreational drug.
All right, huh?
That's what we're doing here.
Just having a little recreation.
I know what you need.
One hit.
Just like a man.
I'll see you next time.

Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.



Hello, my name is Gross Pearl, and I like to do a little bit of comedy once in a while about Brother Bob.
You've heard Bob speak, I got all the talent, but he got the looks.
Boy, I tell you, he's something else.
I'd like to tell you a joke about Brother Bob.
Bob is something else, I tell ya.
I get so embarrassed when I'm with Bob, it's terrible.
The other day Bob went down on the 200 pound bully.
Bob said, I gotta gain some weight.
Bob, we was at this gas station, and Bob got out.
Bob went across town the other day on the bus, and he's all-time.
Like I said, he's all-time.
He's just such an embarrassment to me.
So see, I'm telling you, he's just embarrassing me all the time.
Before I sign off, I'd like to sing a silly song to Brother Bob.
I love my Bob. I love my Bob. I love my Bob. Bob is all the world to me.
The time has come. Turn on to the live stream.
Tune in and drop off. Are you ready?
It's all part of a cosmic uncut.
Turn on, tune in, and drop out. Are you ready?
Man, you're talking about a war crime. I got one.
He said, how long would, on the average?
Well, do you have any diagrams?
I said, yes.
I said, I don't believe you.
I said, do you have the tension anus?
He said, yes.
I said, I don't believe you.
Do you have loop- 같i like muscles?
He said, yes.
Sure.
I said, I don't believe you.
I said, well. Do you have malt dystercit status?
He said, yes.
Right.
Right.
I said, I don't believe you.
I said, do you have d' who's male?
He said, yes.
True.
I said, I do
I said, do you have any психopedics can thrive?
He said, yes.
It just got cut off.
I said, right.
He said, I don't believe you.
I said, well, do you have any heart fluxes?
Sure.
He said, yes.
I said, you want to be normal for the rest of your life.
For the rest of your life.
Isn't that shocking?
That seems wrong.
You may know.
It's something that's difficult.
It was revealed.
I was homosexual, immoral, on drugs.
The worst kind of person.
Pingy-pangy, useless.
It's my own testimony of what I witnessed.
It's my own immorality, corruption.
I was on the rock man, down with an orchestra, in a very direct manner.
And what happened then?
Drugs followed that.
And all other spirits came enjoying such God.
The whole world enjoyed the rock music beat.
I first met George Bush in a tuna fish bath in Mendocino, California.
It was 1989.
He was taking the big cure.
He was a pill popper.
He was a pill popper like I was.
And I'll be for one thing and one thing only.
Scoopin' the lube, grippin' the shit, boop, doop.
I said, I've got no reason, my substance is a now baby.
The heart you see, but you're drivin' it, poor boy, crazy.
I said, I've got no reason, my substance is a now baby.
Because you kick him in the face, it's such a damn disgrace.
The way you run is like water.
I love it, I feel alive.
Stop abusing my substance abuser now, baby.
Hey!
Stop abusing my substance abuser now, baby.
Hey!
Because you kick him in the knee and then you say,
Oh please, I gotta do more of this murder, you whore.
You gotta...
Stop abusing my substance abuser now, baby.
This is one of those shows again.
And that was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band
live at 8X Day Drill a few months back.
Before that, friends, there's some marvelous puzzling stuff
that happened in the show.
This is the opening of the Norel Pref collection,
which we heard just before Dave's song there.
Oh, and also there was a bit from Bill T. Miller,
OBE, out of band experience, the king of slack, you know.
And there'll be more of his classic.
And I think we'll have a good time.



And did I mention Norel?
Well, now there's some Norel.
Metal finish.
Okay, take this box.
Here, take it.
Prior to 1888.
There's the box.
Okay, I've got it.
Now put some gadgets in there.
All right.
Let's...
Load up this bucket of gadgets into that box.
Yeah, okay.
I can do that.
Okay, now the callers will be calling in expecting their gadgets any second, so...
A leather humidor?
Gadget universe keeps us in touch with all the gadgets we need.
Gadgets.
That's what I've been looking for.
Every kind of gadget that you're thinking of now...
Yeah.
...appears magically in gadget universe.
This one I didn't think of.
Wow!
I didn't think of that.
I thought of it, though.
But I wanted to.
I thought of it.
I thought of it.
This...
So the combined thoughts of you, puzzling evidence...
The future's better.
And...
Yeah.
You know, the future...
Dr. Philodrop.
...is really better than the future of the past.
That future of the past sucks.
Produce...
A known...
A known fiber optic flag...
...invision of future from the future, rather than envisioning...
And a spray gun kit.
...and manifesting a future...
Wee!
...in the future.




Based upon the past, or even the stale present.
The future of the future provides more...
But is it the future, or is it just an alternate past?
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, what?
Is it yesterday's tomorrow, just today's...
Well, technically, yesterday...
...day after tomorrow?
...was the day before tomorrow yesterday.
And if tomorrow's yesterday is today's day after yesterday...
...then tomorrow's...


...is...
Caller.
...today's...
You can turn the page.
You can roll over and go back to sleep.
...day after yesterday's tomorrow.
...and put a stop to the madness.
You can, with your new utility trailer gadget.
...call in.
...towards my utility belt, because I have the ultimate ability to become the most awesome
person ever.
Bored on the planet Earth.
Even pure regimen.
...recognized.
...recognized.
...and then I...
...recognized.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, moving on to the last of the stack here.
Let's see.
Keep going.
What is the ultimate chord progression?
Tritones is what I would say.
They sound good all the way up the scale.
Even in that upper register that only bats can hear
as they squeak and flit about,
searching for succulent moths in the darkness.
Yes, we may claim that harmonies are dead,
but our fads are only that.
There are certain things which always please and always displease.
And if we no longer...
If we no longer recognize them,
the animal kingdom will not have such tropes in their repertoire.
So does this have anything to do with soothing the savage beast or anything?
Well, they might stop to listen if you're playing them a tune
before devouring you, sucking your blood,
or attaching themselves to your intestinal wall.
But the animal kingdom wishes intimate encounters with you at all times.
Country, I am Bob Country.
I am Bob Country.
I am Bob Country.
I am Bob Dairy Queen.
President Bush's Antichrist Barb.
Sin, sin, sin, sin.
Dobbs, dobs, dobs, dobs.
As dobs, dobs, dobs, dobs.
As part of what's pushing him over the edge here.
Child killing with tranquility.
Child killing with tranquility.
Like a chocolate sundae.
Bob, I used to own a Dairy Queen.
It has no nutritional value, but makes Republicans feel better.
I mean, talk about being judgmental.
M-m-m-m-mental.
That's judgmental.
Many of us recognize homosexuality and gradually prostitution.
And pornography, it's a lifestyle.
Other homosexuals, come on out.
Come on out.
This is going to be fun.
Bring the kids for this stuff.
Trouble maturing in cleaned tacks.
Tying up neighborhood rulers only gets boring.
Need to great mix-up.
Roundup the rim are the only immune escolties.

That's some lemur, ain't it?
And before that, ask Dr. Howell at 8X Day with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrum.
And by the way, the background music is Ego Plum from EbolaMusic.com.
And right now, we shall go to Bill T. Miller of OBE, Out of Band Experience, I guess.
Welcome, young people. He's leading our young people to drug addiction and promiscuity.
By virtue of the cosmos and all the powers in command.
By virtue of the form and all else that has that power.
Oh, no!
Wait, what? Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
You seem a little nervous.
You seem a little nervous, my friend.
You have the strength of my soul.
You're selling me from beyond.
You'd better be ready
to speak your piece.
You call me from beyond.
You disturb my rest of sleep.
With your childish games.
You don't know what you're playing with.
This is not a game.
Put a little voice in your soul.
This is your life.
You've become a good man.

Look, we are not just another...
Look, we are not just another...


We are the only real fans.
Listen to your music backwards in reverse.
It's the truth.
It works for you.
It's the truth.
Heavy metal.
Heavy metal.
Heavy metal.
I'm going to set you in the...
We're only valid, okay?
The bottom line is...
Quietly, please.
Heavy, get it?
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.









Keep going.
Kindly stop.
I didn't even get in a fight,
and I know this a great deal.
I'veguys are keen to think
when I go to sleep,




right now?

I know that the truth
is in the thinking of...
It's not the effect I've got.
No pain in the self
of being a nerdy loser.
I fucking sent you
baby.
No pain in the self

No pain in my life!
Dude,
You are a mess!
You are a mad bitch!


You ready for me?
Can it be ready to face the consequences?
It's never too late to redeem yourself
One last chance
That's all you have
It's up to you
You ready for me?
No escaping my eyes
You'll see them in every dream
You ready?
You ready?
No escaping the eyes
The sun will never shine with the eyes again
You ready for me from the outside?
You ready to face the truth my friend?
I'm here for you
You ready?
The giant locusts have reached the Chicago Southside and nearby suburbs.
Men of Earth, we of the planet Mars give you this warning.
People!
No!
But don't mess with us because we're all you got.
In fact, if we fold, we'll have no damn phones.
It's like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines.
You're tearing me apart!
Horror and moral terror are your friends.
You can crawl out from under no rocks.
You've got no tails.
I'm a cop and you will respect my authority.
Bloodless, lifeless.
No pulse in one of them.
I'm gonna be naughty.
I'm gonna be a naughty vampire god.
Well Jim, there's no reason why you shouldn't live another 20 to 30 years.
However, you will be bleeding constantly from both eyes.
Okay, here's an important question.
A lot of people want to know.
I'm glad that they're listening.






I'm glad that this particular audience member was able to encapsulate this so well.
The vertical mark above Dobbs' left brow cannot possibly be a shadow.
I've done my calculations.
What is it?
You see, the beginning of wisdom is staring at the Dobbs head itself.
It's almost too much really for the human mind to consider.
There is a certain frightening majesty in it.

In the implacable visage of Dobbs.
Here we have an analog Dobbs behind us.
You see the mark there on the left brow.
This is not to be construed as the mark of Cain.
Which was put on the brow of the first murderer.
And those who derived from his loins.
After the expulsion of the first couple from paradise.
In fact, what is registered in many images of Dobbs.

As a mark.
Actually translates as no real mark at all.
It is the opposite of a look-a-fleck.
And I don't know the word for it.
You could call it a dark-a-fleck or something.
It's where the dark is gathered.
It's gathered on the corner.
Because on either side of it there are separate light sources.
There is a light source coming from the front of the Dobbs head.
And a light source coming from each side of the Dobbs head.
These light sources whose evidence we can see from the appearance of the Dobbs head itself.
Are not of equal intensity.
The strongest one comes from above the Dobbsian skull.
But as you can see it's also coming from the left side.
As well as from the top.
Where is the shadow to go?
Only in this little line.
On the left side of the head.
That represents a place where light is not.
But it is not a mark.
And if one ever could see the profile of Dobbs.
Something which scholastics and devout people have thought about for many years.
You would not see that line.
Only in the full fledged, full frontal confrontation of the face.
Does that line appear.
But unless it is Dobbs.
That line.
Well there it is.
So it's not a mark.
Get that out of your mind.
It's not a mark.
It's a place where light is not.
You have to define Dobbs with darkness and light like everything else.
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
That's a question I used to think about quite a bit.
After we took the dots off.
There seemed to be a lot of marks there that just weren't there before.
Dobbs.
Dobbs.
Dobbs.

Dobbs.
Let's go crazy.
Dobbs.
Now, Tipper Gore.
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend.
I met her in a hotel lobby.
Masturbating with a magazine.
10 to 12 times a day.
Blood races to my private spot.
Let's me know there's a fire.
Can't stop passion when passion's hot.
Come inside my sugar walls.
Come sleep inside my sugar walls.
F word.
F word.
You'll feel our hell on your back.
Sex fiend.
Blood follows blood and we make sure.
Life ain't for you and we're the cure.
Sex fiend.
Damage incorporated.
Smell inside of this.
It gets me going.
F word.
Masturbating with a magazine.
10 to 12 times a day.
Sex fiend.
Sex fiend.
Dobbs.

Let's go crazy.

Now, Tipper Gore.
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend.
Let's go crazy.

Let's go crazy. Dobbs.
Blood races to my private spot.
Sex fiend. Dobbs.

And 8X Day
Ask Dr. Howell
with Philodrummon.
And Dr. Howell.
And Leemurr was in there.
And Leemurr devotee.
And Lambre Systems.
All did little bits and trips and clicks.
And now, puzzling
And now, puzzling
evidence.
Evidence.
Slackmar
is only an appendage
in the past
into which our apertures
are freely associated.
And you're quite good.
Dr. Howell is not in the house tonight.
So, no, no.
Yeah, the Dr. Howell machine is broken.
I had to take it off the shelf
and put it in the back.
You removed his double-edged sword.
I moved his subliminal
mind extension
that he normally is able to protrude
into our studio
when he's out of town.
Just to make sure he gets a little piece of himself
on the show.
In absentia, so to speak.
In absencia. Not absentia.
He wasn't abstaining.
He was actually just not there.
He was just there.
He was just there.
Oh, hi there.
Oh, what, all this stuff?
Oh, hi there. Oh, what, all this stuff?
Well, I used to just do this
on the weekends.
And then I started
doing it in the evening
during the week.
And then I'd say to myself,
Well, I can do it
before work.
I can do this.
And I'd wake up
with my tongue
tasting like a soccer field
on the equator of Venus
where sarcastic third quadrant aliens
had been using my skull
for the ball.
I'd have to take my four
boiled neurons to the job
in a quartz-sized Ziploc bag
and the boys
would throw it back and forth
during lunch, pretending they weren't
ever gonna give it back.
I left the juice on
all night one time.
And when I woke up,
I smelled burning hair.
And when I looked at my feet,
I thought they were
female sex organs.
It was really scary.
I mean,
I'm no neurosurgeon.
I can't put those
nerve trunks back in the right places
every time.
When the psychoplasm spills over the edge
of the containment field,
it's every man, woman, and thing
for his, her, or itself.
And the escape valves
only have room for one at a time.
So, it can get pretty ugly in there.
It can get pretty ugly out here as well.
It's been getting worse






for a long time.



expensive tools.
I tend to fry
three or four pairs of shoes
a week.
And since the process
makes my feet grow,
it's getting intense
because I can't
pull this stuff.
And the neighbors
have been complaining
out of the garbage, and cats don't mate under their bedroom windows anymore.
And of course, having your eyes mounted on flexible spots like a crab's has its advantages.
You can get through lines at the stores a lot faster, although I'm not sure of exactly
why that is.
The powers of levitation come in pretty handy, as long as you remember to dodge the high
tension power lines.
And a lot of people seem to think that I'm over the edge for hooking myself up like this,
but as they say, one man's bummer is another man's beautiful thing, and I think the exposed
electrodes are really good.
They're really quite pretty, so I think I'm just going to keep on doing it.
I think I'm going to keep on doing it.
I think I'm going to keep on doing it.
Where are you?
Where's everybody going?
Maybe we're all insane.
A couple of very unimportant items seem to have eluded me, like who I am.
What in the name of everything holy is going on?
What's going on here?
Wait a minute, what's going on?
What's going on here?
We, all of us, we are in hell.
Maybe we're all insane.
Wait a minute, what's going on?
Where are you?
What's going on here?
What's going on here?
What in the name of everything holy is going on?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?

Who are you?

Who are you?

From PR News in Washington, I'm scattered in the streets and set fire to more than two dozen cars.
Lance Armstrong killed two Israelis at the Gaza border and Israel killed Judge John Roberts,
who allegedly carried out a murder.
The White House exploded in the luxury resort area of South London.
A powerful earthquake is not related to PR News, Washington.
Yes, you're listening to the best pseudo-religion in the West.
This is the puzzling evidence show.
Look, there's an overman stuck in the weeds of time.
Oh, yeah, look at that.
Living la vida loca, as far as I can tell.
A little show character.
He's skibbling along now.
Sage and sage.
Sacred scribe.
Ivan Stang himself.
Now, that's an interesting...
That's a subgenius after X-Day.
That's me.
I think that is me.
Vomiting blood, as it has been said in the last days.
Yeah, we're applying the special x-rays to the show.
It's taken me years to perfect the technique to be able to vomit blood.
The dropsicle.
Have you ever been hit by a quarter in the forehead from the balcony?
If you get to keep it...
No, I haven't.
It hurts.
It really...
Four dollars for Dobbs.
You lose a couple of memories every time a quarter hits you.
And if a guy throws a 50-cent piece and hits you square between the eyes...
You'll go berserk.
You lose your sermons for that night.
You'll go berserk like Mighty Joe Young in similar circumstances.
That's right.
I don't blame him a bit.
The stark fist of removal.
Hi, this is Thursday's channel.
This is my new single.

Shit was gold, it all would be rich
You didn't have to hear me, bitch
Get fucked up every night

Get some grass, I get a little ass
Sex, drugs, rock and roll
Then I go home alone on LSD
He's on LSD
Karma, karma, come and go
Got the karma key
For karma fun
Use the key or lock the door
We'll make love forevermore on LSD
All this war, all this hate
It's all just a bloody big mistake
Where's this man that they call God?
Is he here or is he stoned on acid?
He's on acid
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born
While I'm here I'll have my own
I find what sex, drugs, rock and roll
Disco, sex, and soda

So here's

Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, the girl with the frock in her eyes.
Great Yucateers mock of yellow and green, towering over your head.
Look for the puzzling evidence now and it's gone.

I'll follow her down to the end.
I'll follow her down to the end.
You are rich by a mountain where mutated people eat habber frock pies.
Everyone sighs as you float past the Neagy and Jane-ers incredibly high.
Prairie squid flaxseed appears on the shore.
Waiting to take you home.

You're a little too old to go away.
Climb on the saucers that float through the clouds and you're gone.
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.
I'll picture yourself.
On a saucer of pleasure with pink boys for slaves of every size.
Suddenly someone is there on the planet.

You can get more from him at nationalcynical.com.
And now let us go through the outflow valve into Dr. Howell's answer machine.
All right, now this is something I think we can all identify with.
The audience member, I wanted to call you a caller, but I won't.
I'll call you an audience member, more precise.
That makes you the caller.
It says, I just had a pseudo-recto-retro-endectomy.
When can I go swimming?
You can go in as soon as you like, but I wouldn't press myself against the outflow valve.
Good.
Good advice there, Dr. Howell.
I've been known to stay away from those valves myself.
You read that Chuck Polanyuk story, I assume.
Right, right, with the valve and the aperture misfortune.
Yeah, so let's go on.
This is interesting.
Because it's madness.
It's got some good pictures in it, too.
I just like to look at the pictures.
Dr. Howell.
I wish I had this with me when I was out last week in the woods.
Good, good, good.
Fine.
Because then I could have read it.
Look at these scary pictures of people getting shock-treated and stuff.
It's a book.
It's about what sane people think about people in insane asylums and stuff.
Which is probably a good viewpoint.
And the motivation of the people that run them.
Because if you're insane, you're going to get shot.
And if you're insane, you're probably going to get shot.
don't care about reading a book about insane people in an insane society the
same man must appear insane so that's always been your theory I know but how
do you know that how do you know that if you are insane that that you would be
or what did you say Rockner in an insane society the same man must appear insane
so what does that mean about like short memory loss where you can't remember
when you restart reducing your sentences to just two words sentences are you
reducing it to like 1984 news speak almost syntax reduction yeah like the
paper reductionist in Rudd you can only use
sentences with two words in them now see I just violated the primary rule
right now you did I did can they laugh and laugh laugh and laugh that's an
incomplete sentence those who doesn't count I laugh from PR news in Washington
I'm looking for a good place to set off a radioactive bomb residents in southern
Texas and the Mexican Gulf Coast passed over the Yucatan Peninsula and back into

you
are arguing it is unconstitutional to strengthen into a category 3 storm 21
official groups have been killed in the two years since the invasion of the
Supreme Court I have oh okay here you go what is the airspeed velocity of an
overlaid and swallow I think there's something missing from that question
dr. how would you agree I'm not certain I I know what would be missing here the
degree to which the swallow was overlaid and would affect
the airspeed wasn't it that's true that there is more than one kind of of
swallow you can tell them of course by their swallow tales in the sky that
special tailcoat that they have what would it be laden with would it be full
of delicious selvages and bugs in its crop know it's carrying something
Carrying something in its little warm insides.
Helium balloons.
Well, see you're adding a piece of something that wasn't part of the question, a datum,
which you have brought to the equation.
Well, maybe it was, maybe so.
Helium balloon, maybe it was an anti-gravity device.
Possibly.
Still, I will say that the Swallow, however much it has picked up in flight, will still
endeavor to travel at its maximum speed.
It will not pace itself because it knows nothing of this.
It only knows that effort goes in and flight comes out.
Therefore, it will continue to make the effort.
But the human will destroy its mission before it even starts by fretfully considering this ratio.
It will fearfully consider its point of exhaustion before it happens and thus bring it into being.
And defeat itself.
Okay, excellent, excellent.
Riveting.
Shocking.
Since the neurons of the adult human brain do not reproduce, a space expedition represents irreparable brain damage
and would reduce the crew to idiots in even the eight years it would take to go to the nearest sun and return.
The
I'm abusing that substance abuser now, baby!
Please!
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby!
Oh, please!
Oh, please!
Oh, please!
Please!



Too bad.
They should have inflatable cups that you just want a little bit.
How about extreme prejudice?
We shouldn't let that guy get any votes.
His head's made of concrete.
For Christ's sake.
I did it with extreme prejudice.
Couldn't you just lighten up a little bit?
You know, everybody's kind of basically the same underneath.
Well, think about the two words that they're combining.
Extrem께!
and prejudice.
Both bad words.
Extreme prejudice.
Even bad is bad.
89.3. Extreme
prejudice.
Not really.
I can't believe anybody actually uses that word
as a marketing tool anymore.
Well, they used to use Ein Volk, Ein Reich,
Ein Führer.
Yeah, now it's Ein Volk, Ein Reich,
Ein News Channel.
Oh, I'm so old that I remember
when they used extreme
back in the 40s.
These things go in waves.
Before that, I think in the
around 1915,
everything was extreme.
It was extreme ointment
and extreme
truss.
Schwartz's extreme
truss. Extreme polio vaccine.
Yeah, but that was in the
40s. Only they were
fake. Bob sold
a thing called extreme polio
vaccine. Excellent.
But it was not proven
effective.
Me?
Disease.
I thought it was just disease.
I thought it was just that doctor. He had damaged
the lining of my esophagus. He prescribed
erosions in my esophagus.
Setting in serious stomach conditions
and headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
My esophagus needed
my esophagus.
Talk about pills.
Well, if only, I'm just saying, if they could make a designer
drug that made everything look like
it was made of chocolate, taste
like chocolate, feel like chocolate.
It'd be like going to Candyland.
The Aztecs had it all we needed
as a time machine to go back the year before
Cortez landed
and have some of this stuff.
You know what I'm saying?
Like I said, Montezuma, he drank like 40
40 like,
liters of this chocolate concoction every day.
And you know he wasn't drinking, you know,
Bosco or whatever you call it.
So that's why they call it Montezuma's revenge.
That was, he was the discovery of
Bosco.
Discover of Bosco.
That means a forest in Italian.
Foreta.
I believe.
Well, I'll tell you, I have,
as I've gotten older,
which seems to be
continuing, by the way, in case anyone
was wondering. We're all getting older.
Oh, you too.
I thought you looked like you had aged.
Just a little bit.
Imagine that.
Anyway, I find that the chocolate becomes
a more important drug than
almost any other one except for
its close relative coffee.
And some of its other relatives
in the cannabinoid area.
But really, the coffee, more than
anything else, because
the drugs I took seem to light up my brain.
You know, women like to say
that chocolate is a sort of a
drug for them.
It's an orgasm drug.
If you look at all the actual chemicals
that are found naturally occurring in chocolate,
there are some drug-like compounds
occurring in chocolate besides caffeine.
People talk about caffeine being the first one,
but theobromine is another one.
Anandamide,
which is a cannabinoid.
There are cannabinoids in chocolate.
Did you know that in the early days,
the brothers burned
the codices, which contained
over 1,200 recipes for everything?
They burned chocolate in different ways.
There was aphrodisiac chocolate.
There was hallucinogenic chocolate.
There was this squeaky, squished chocolate.
There was every kind
known to man.
And yet they thought it was the devil's work,
and so they polished it and burned it.
Except for the sisters did like their chocolate
at night, and so that's what's left with.
So what happened?
Yeah.
Finish the story, man.
Well, that's what happened.
They said, you know,
well, sisters like chocolate. It's a good tonic.
You know, people like that and a couple other uses.
You know, cake was nice.
But all the other stuff, this has got to be the devil.
Yet, at the same time, they recorded
hundreds of other things.
They were scared of real chocolate for some reason.
And these are lost
to mankind, supposedly.
We don't know if they were.
I mean, it's not like it's a purple lotus, man.
It's just chocolate.
Well, once upon a time,
it was very exotic
to Westerners or to Europeans.
It was like currency, wasn't it?
Chocolate was.
I mean, you know, this is something that
was not found
in Europe. So European society,
once it first encountered it, obviously thought it was
something exotic and strange.
It originally came from the New World.
I think it came from South America originally,
but nowadays, I think most of it's grown in
West Africa.
Right, but originally
it was something that the Spaniards
brought back.
Yeah.
Montezuma.
Everyone's favorite.
Montezuma.
I was a big fan of chocolate.
You know, like breakfast sausages
used to hang out in these little houses in London,
you know, and write poetry and drink chocolate.
Can you repeat that question for me, sir?
Oh, what kind of plant
did they actually...
It comes from a tree.
The cacao tree.
Its scientific name is Theobroma cacao.
And
the cacao fruit is
kind of like melon-shaped size sort of thing.
And it grows on
the trunk.
Nuts.
On the trunk.
And then like actual cacao beans are
pretty big.
Like they're, you know, they're nut-sized and
they are...
Their essential oil is very highly saturated
fat that we know as cocoa butter.
And you just grind those things up and that's
that's cocoa...
I mean, you have to roast...
They roast them first, I think.
Except for roasting them and grinding them, that's what cocoa powder is.

That's how all of us in the West feel about Bob.
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.
This is your old friend, Bozo the Clown.
Look on page one in your picture book.
