1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,440
These aren't men, some are right, and I think we better watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:28,060
Dear friends, it's KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

3
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:34,800
And, uh, I was thinking to myself, well, praise Bob.

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:50,720
I guess the kids have learned to think faster due to television commercials, MTV, and such like, a heavy, fast hour of slack.

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,280
It was a 20-foot slender and incredibly fast subgenius.

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,800
Oh.

7
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,560
That looks very inviting, Mr. Hobbs.

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,840
Well, why don't you take a bite?

9
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,500
A bite?

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,280
I got a little lick.

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,240
The gaping mouth was almost on me when...

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,680
Oh, take it deeper.

13
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,900
Oh, yeah, that's it.

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,960
Keep like that?

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,380
Rub your tongue underneath the head.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,940
Oh.

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,120
Oh.

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,680
Oh.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,840
Oh.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,320
I hope he swallows it.

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,460
He'll be back tonight in our dreams.

23
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,780
Enjoy this one.

24
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,800
Tell me about it.

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,780
Tell me what you like.

26
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,160
Oh, it is so good.

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,100
But I don't think he liked the way you taste it.

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,920
Sounds primitive, doesn't it?

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,200
Really?

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,620
We're all primitive deep down, Pete.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,400
What?

32
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,900
What?

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:55,940
What?

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,400
What?

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,900
What?

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:56,920
What?

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:56,920


38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:56,920


39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:56,920


40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:56,920


41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:56,920


42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:56,920


43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:56,920


44
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,420
What?

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,080
What?

46
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,440
What?

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,220
What's your rhyme?

48
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,720
I don't know why not master it.

49
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
Sounds primitive, doesn't it?

50
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,100
I know this will sound funny to a scientist.

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,180
I can't say.

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,140
Okay.

53
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,200
And now, this.

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,860
That thing's still running.

55
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,560
What do we got here?

56
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:20,800
Oh.

57
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:20,980
Oh.

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,820
Oh.

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,440
Oh.

60
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,340
Oh.

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,360
Oh.

62
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,500


63
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,560
Oh.

64
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:26,920


65
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:26,920

79
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Oh, wow.

80
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:46,200
I mean, like, you know, it's time for the...

81
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
I just had it.

82
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,500
Oh, wow.

83
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,200
The Gottlieb.

85
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,420
No.

86
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,260
Ginsberg.

87
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,480
Yeah, wow.

88
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,180
That's a Ginsberg moment.

89
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,320
Like, I keep trying to think back, you know,

90
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,580
and I can't really get it sometimes.

91
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,080
It's kind of confusing.

92
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,780
But I remember, occasionally...

93
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,720
And today we...

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,740
Are you on?

96
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,860
Yeah, I think I'm on.

97
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,800
Wow, man.

98
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,940
Like, what's happening?

99
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,980
May I sit down here?

100
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,760
Are you the DJ, sir?

101
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,300
Yeah, wow, man.

102
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,180
What do you want?

103
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,360
I feel as if I'm flashing back.

104
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,440
No, man, it's me that's flashing back.

105
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,120
What are you doing?

106
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,180
Who are you?

107
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,860
My name is Tyer Biter.

108
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,540
Someone asked me if I would come today

109
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,000
to help you on your radio program,

110
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,800
but they didn't say that...

111
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,380
Your eyes would be so strange.

112
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,600
Oh, wow, deja vu.

113
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm telling you, hey.

114
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,560
Tyer Biter.

115
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,480
Oh, wow, man.

116
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,340
I've heard that before.

117
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,400
Who is...

118
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,300
Vice President?

119
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,240
No, no, no.

120
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
Let me see.

121
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,040
Wow, man.

122
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,700
You want a Coke or...

123
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,500
No, I gave up Coke a long time ago.

124
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,380
I'm sorry.

125
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,540
This is 1989.

126
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,600
Wait, I know.

127
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,220
I remember.

128
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,740
Oh, wow.

129
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,520
Wow, you're the girl delighter.

130
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,020
Well, yes, I was in my youth.

131
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,540
I'm very happy that you remember this moment.

132
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,280
Yes, exactly.

133
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,800
I haven't heard your voice since 19 and...

134
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,800
Oh, wow, I don't know, 67?

135
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,000
Judging by your look, sir,

136
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,020
I don't think you've heard much of anything since 1967.

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,920
Well, I mean, hey, you know,

138
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,860
I mean, we've got priorities here, you know?

139
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,320
I mean, wow, it's just...

140
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,740
Well, what are you doing here?

141
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,900
Well, I'm in town to promote a film,

142
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,360
and someone said it would be good for me

143
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,780
to come on this radio station

144
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,380
and help you with your contest of some sort today.

145
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,720
I am fully ignorant and rather damp at the moment,

146
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,780
so why don't you go on with a Judge Crater moment?

147
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,480
Well, we should get along great, man,

148
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,320
because I've been ignorant for years, you know.

149
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,020
Yes.

150
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,560
But, yeah, yeah, I've got a song here.

151
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,760
I want to play it for everybody,

152
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,100
and then we can talk, you know, later on.

153
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,620
Wonderful.

154
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,240
Well, I'll just sit back and enjoy myself

155
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,960
and flash into your past.

on the Johnny Carson show, but I had to turn it down.

160

Why was that, Clem?

161
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,980
They wanted our people to supply the nitrous oxide

That could have been a good horn, but you just blew it.

187
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm beginning to move it. With 53 stitches in it, it's not about to fall off.

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,880
Will somebody fill me in? I offered.

189
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,780
Right in the face, and a bright flash circled him, and he seemed to stiffen.

190
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:45,780
And when he started to Fish up, it made him quite fetqiud.

191
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,820
Stand up!

192
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,280
Father, be civil!

196
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,300
Aead gives him the postcard in which the inexperienced questioner leaves the board,

197
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,320
and the rest, those two men go home.

198
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,320


199
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,120
any minute now.

200
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,740
Oh, actually,

201
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,940
they told us

202
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,540
10 o'clock.

203
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,240
Oh, he would love that.

204
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,120
There's been quite a bit

205
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,960
of kill Stang sentiment

206
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,060
in the air here lately.

207
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,060
Hey, Will,

208
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,980
is this going to be

209
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,360
another scripted revival

210
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,260
where they read off

211
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,020
a script that they've

212
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,220
written?

213
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,100
No.

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,740
No, not now.

215
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,940
Wait, what was that?

216
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,540
In the spring,

217
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,240
the FFB read some...

218
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,160
Maybe I wasn't here

219
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,020
or maybe I forgot.

220
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,440
You were here.

221
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,040
It was all scripted?

222
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,580
Yeah, we read some script

223
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,320
he had that he said

224
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,660
he'd done at every convention

225
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,380
for the last year.

226
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,200
I know, I've heard

227
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,500
the tapes on the other side.

228
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,740
I know, I know.

229
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,600
It's the exact same thing.

230
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,400
And then you read the book

231
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,680
and it's the exact same.

232
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,420
Oh, well.

233
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,400
The only good thing

234
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,020
is when Bob fell off the wall

235
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,120
and everyone screamed

236
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,240
and died.

237
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,560
But now, wait a minute.

238
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:52,840
Wait a minute.

239
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,000
The next one.

240
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,260
We're trying to suppress

241
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,380
the church's really

242
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,920
obscenely swollen name

243
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,480
in Arlington.

244
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,540
The one with Dr. Don.

245
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,200
Dr. Don?

246
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,860
Dr. Don,

247
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,100
the one who wrote that one.

248
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,780
It's in a house

249
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,840
filled with...

250
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,300
We're going to have

251
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,300


252
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,180
Let's all have

253
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,680
a revival.

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,080
The one who published

255
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,960
The Ideology of Madness.

256
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:12,920
I'm sorry,

257
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,420
what's that you're

258
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,860
talking about?

259
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,400
I don't even hate Sting.

260
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,220
He's mediocre.

261
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,560
He's worse than

262
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,220
a figure of paper.

263
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,900
Not worth hating.

264
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,580
Not worth even hating.

265
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,120
He's mediocre.

266
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,660
There's both of them.

267
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


268
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


269
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


270
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


271
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


272
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
It's the Fallen Bob's.

273
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,260
Oh my God,

274
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,640
my head broke open.

275
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,480
There's something

276
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,580
sticking out of it.

277
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,180
I never got any ones.

278
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,280
It wouldn't be a pipe,

279
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:33,700
would it?

280
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,240
It's a gland.

281
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,720
It's a big old new

282
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:36,920
hole.

283
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,620
Look at the tape.

284
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
Turn around.

285
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,860
Go back down

286
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,340
back the way you came.

287
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,380
Babylon is laid to waste.

288
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,080
Egypt's buried in Hashem.

289
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,720
The mighty men are all

290
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,900
beaten down.

291
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,760
Their kings are falling

292
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,080
in the waves.

293
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,740
Eat God.

294
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,600
Pride of man.

295
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,360
Broken in the dust again.

296
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,840
When the grand

297
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,380
Jarmagal all-star

298
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,940
belt was harrowly the rage

299
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,680
between our Weltington's

300
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,140
extraordinary and our petty

301
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,340
thick's the Marshalazy,

302
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,220
and Irish eyes of welcome

303
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,420
were smiling daggers down

304
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:22,820
their backs.

305
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,520
Yeah.

306
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,700
Daggers down our backs.

307
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,760
You thought I wasn't

308
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,740
listening, didn't you?

309
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,960
See, rest of listeners,

310
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,220
a little bit of that was just

311
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,400
to let those who were at the

312
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,760
Fantasy Fair subgenius revival

313
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,520
two weeks ago who were there

314
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,380
and thinking that the ears of

315
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,640
Reverend Stang and by virtue of

316
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,960
my placement in the church,

317
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,400
the ears of Bob, too,

318
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,140
weren't listening.

319
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,500
I'm not saying that they

320
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,500


321
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,100
weren't listening, but see,

322
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,280
we were listening, all right.

323
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,840
Yeah, always listening.

324
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,780
He records everything and puts

325
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,000
it in the movie.

326
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,580
Yes, that's, so that's, yeah,

327
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,640
that's what we do, friends.

328
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,240
That's the, just before the

329
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,980
revival starts, during the,

330
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,680
well, we've got 45 minutes of

331
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,460
show left, and which means

332
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,180
we'll be peaking about 20

333
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,060
minutes from now.

334
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,860
So, and we will be playing the

335
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,340
first half of the Fantasy Fair

336
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,720
revival, edited version, of

337
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,220
course.

338
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,660
Hopefully you'll be able to

339
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,840
tell where the edits are.

340
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,600
I like to edit that kind of

341
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,840
stuff in such a way as to bring

342
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,580
attention to the fact that

343
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,800
something was cut out and

344
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,400
usually with just enough left

345
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,880
in that you can tell what it

346
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,160
was.

347
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,600
Anyway, we've also got, well,

348
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,760
we've got a second generation

349
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,960
guest in our studio.

350
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,040


351
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,460
Praise Bob!

352
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:54,940
Praise Bob!

353
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,460
Reverend George Leroy

354
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,160
Tirebiter.

355
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,500
But, actually, first generation

356
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,140
here in the studio, the man who

357
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,160
brought George Tirebiter to St.

358
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Louis, where the tape was made.

359
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,660
Oh, it's a heavy responsibility.

360
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,160
We've got Chuck, the Doge of

361
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,060
South St. Louis.

362
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,060
Why didn't you just, you could

363
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,640
have picked all of Missouri.

364
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,980
No, I'm modest.

365
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,540
We're modest to a fault.

366
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm modest to a fault.

367
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,040


368
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,040


369
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,040


370
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,040


371
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
That is a fault.

372
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,940
That's a, not all of you.

373
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,180
Well, it's a divine fault.

374
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,820
Dr. Philo Drummond certainly

375
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,160
isn't.

376
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,980
See, what's happened here dear

377
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,400
friends.

378
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:32,880
What?

379
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,280
At the expense of the

380
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,640
taxpayers.

381
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,240
That's, no, K-N-O-N is not at

382
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,920
the expense of the taxpayers and

383
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,520
neither is K-D-H-X-F-M in St.

384
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:43,800
Louis.

385
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,260
Yes, it is.

386
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,280
Oh, it is?

387
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,980
Yes, of course.

388
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,820
We take government money.

389
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,940
We'll take anybody's money.

390
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,700
Well, I guess, I guess K-N-O-N

391
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,100
must surely take some government

392
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,520
money.

393
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,740
We're a public radio.

394
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:52,980
We're a public radio.

395
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:52,980


396
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:52,980


397
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,020
We're a public radio.

398
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,260
We'll take money any way we can

399
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,720
get it.

400
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,820
Crumpled singles, we don't care.

401
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,360
That's right.

402
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,440
Oh, yeah, it's an NPR affiliate,

403
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:02,800
right?

404
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,660
No, no, we're not.

405
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,560
We're sort of a kind of Pacifica

406
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,660
affiliate, sort of more or less

407
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,020
halfway.

408
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,000
Commies, man, I get it.

409
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,460
That's right.

410
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,700
Not like K-N-O-N.

411
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,240
Oh, no.

412
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,900
Anyway, and Doge Chuck here has,

413
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,640
has just sort of handed a, can you

414
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,400
believe this?

415
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,020
Give me a second.

416
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,020


417
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,020


418
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,020


419
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,020


420
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,020


421
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,020


422
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,020


423
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,280
I'm going to get this.

424
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,360
This guy standing here actually told

425
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,060
Dr. Philo Drummond and the rest of the

426
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,460
Swingin' Love Corpses, hey, why don't we

427
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
do a show together?

428
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,140
Yeah.

429
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,040
Yeah.

430
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,640
Yeah.

431
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,120
My father's got a barn.

432
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,700
I've got a mustache.

433
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,680
I'll be the old man.

434
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,540
Yeah, that's right.

435
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,700
We'll have to, we'll be getting tapes,

436
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,080
I guess, of that show.

437
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,840
And see now I can.

438
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,300
We aim to see that you do, yes.

439
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,860
And then I'll be sending tapes to you

440
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,000
and then they'll get played over.

441
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000


442
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000


443
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000


444
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000


445
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000


446
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,220
And then they'll get played over again

447
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,100
about a month later.

448
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,280
It's all part of the conspiracy,

449
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:55,820
friends.

450
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,260
Yes.

451
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,320
Bob, Bob is in us and with us and

452
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,300
under us and in our toothpaste.

453
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,540
And you can smell him all the time.

454
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,100
That's right.

455
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,060
But we're working on that.

456
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,340
We've got deodorizers all over the

457
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,240
friggin' station at KDHX.

458
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,620
Hey, you can't say frigging on the radio.

459
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
Isn't that a nautical term?

460
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,080
I thought that was okay.

461
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,220
Oh, okay.

462
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,900
Oh, you're talking about what first

463
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,880
mate Bob had to say about that.

464
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,360
Actually, I ought to, you know, I can.

465
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:22,980
Hype my boy.

466
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,680
I'm going to get a more jump from,

467
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,660
uh, let's see, yeah, side one.

468
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,880
The Reverend Ivan Stang is now

469
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,300
quickly queuing up a record.

470
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,100
Let's see.

471
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,080
He was in the rigging.

472
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,020
Uh, actually, yeah, now we've got two things.

473
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,440
I can have two going at once.

474
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,140
We've got, wow, this is like artistic

475
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,820
mixing on underground pirate radio stations.

476
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,980
Like, this is like psychedelic, man.

477
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,140
Yeah, where you have, you have Finnegan's

478
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,980
White going on one side and Fergie's

479
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,200
White going on the other.

480
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,620
Oh, it's like four out now.

481
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,780
Kansas was condensed.

482
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:05,320
I've anchored my soul in the haven of rest.

483
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,840
Oh, wow, it's like, like, like I'm having

484
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,740
a religious experience.

485
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,180
Ahoy there, shipmate.

486
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,540
Eight bells and all's well.

487
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,960
First mate Bob and the crew of the good ship, Grace.

488
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,520
The voices from the harbor called Haven of Rest.

489
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,580
I'm told that everybody likes a story.

490
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,980
Every life is a story.

491
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,560
And mine is no exception.

492
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,440
May I share it with you?

493
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,600
No.

494
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,620
The story of my conversion to Christ in 1934.

495
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,940
First mate Bob.

496
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,120
And I shall begin the narration.

497
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,180
See, what that's about is first you have to mate Bob,

498
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,560
and then you can have the conversion.

499
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,740
That's right.

500
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,300
It is a sexual religious experience.

501
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,500
Religio-sexual.

502
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,540
And that's what the Church of the Subgenius was supposed to be all about.

503
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,380
That's right.

504
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,900
Yeah, but then they put us in this little room with these microphones,

505
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,360
and ever since then we haven't been able to talk about what you really want to hear.

506
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,980
And in fact, I understand that some of the tapes I've sent you had objectionable language of some kind on them?

507
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,980
Well, I think, as I understand it, the conspiracy inserted that objectionable language

508
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,460
while the tapes went through the U.S. mail, because after all, that is a governmental agency,

509
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,480
and of course we all know who's behind it.

510
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:22,600
I understand that.

511
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,900
Well, you do, do you?

512
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,440
Well, I do.

513
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,220
Don't you?

514
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,780
I would never say I knew what was behind the government.

515
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,480
I wouldn't even want to really know.

516
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,020
I mean, a few stages of conspiracy end, sure,

517
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,320
but I don't want to see behind that vault in Rockefeller Center.

518
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,520
We joked about going behind that vault door, but we didn't.

519
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,820
Nobody but Bob has been back there.

520
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,380
I know.

521
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:52,640
Bob could.

522
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,880
Maybe Dr. Philodrumon, because of the operation, might be able to go through the screen.

523
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,300
You're right. It is scary.

524
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,260
I mean, George Bush only got to the first porthole, and look what happened to him.

525
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,820
Yeah, that's a good point.

526
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:17,160
Oh, gosh, I read in the paper today that a television official was talking to Quayle about,

527
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,400
oh, Czechoslovakia, yeah.

528
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,160
He was going, well, what do you think about what's going on in Czechoslovakia?

529
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,920
And Quayle said, what?

530
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,100
And the guy said, well, they just completely changed governments over there this week.

531
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,480
And Quayle just got a glazed look in his eye and said, oh.

532
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,020
Well, you see, the problem was that Quayle's handlers hadn't inserted the proper compact disc.

533
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,800
You see, let alone the fact that he really doesn't have a brain.

534
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,640
There is a very sophisticated laser compact disc player there.

535
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,380
But he's an elected official.

536
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,280
Well, not really elected, I guess.

537
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,540
Sort of.

538
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,200
I mean, it was part of a package deal.

539
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,160
Isn't that always the way it works?

540
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:57,800
Yeah.

541
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:06,060
Well, I wouldn't want to joke about the kind of votes that Bush would have to get in order to make Lyndon Johnson president.

542
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,800
Now would I?

543
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,260
We'll be playing Jack Ruby's Girls by the Potatoes a little later on if we get down to it.

544
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:12,620
All right.

545
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,800
But let's go back to what really happened in St. Louis that day.

546
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,360
None other than the president.

547
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,400
The old, the living codger, George Leroy Tirebiter.

548
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,700
Himself.

549
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,680
Do you want to say anything more about how that came about?

550
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,820
How he came there?

551
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,180
Well, it's actually, I see, I don't know how much you've got on the tape.

552
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,900
The reason he was in town was to promote the new colorized version of his film, Babes in Khaki.

553
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,360
Yeah.

554
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,740
Which many of you have heard excerpts from on an album of cultural archival stuff.

555
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,120
Yeah.

556
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,340
The Don't Crush That Dwarf Hand.

557
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,160
It's on a record label, God与 dir deerts.

558
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,920
That's the outdo briefing version.

559
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,080
Except, I have members of Texas future ..

560
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,160
.

561
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,060
n cust NSF, and South Bay.

562
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,140
Q hajaq 0663.

563
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,660
Ab Mtla eternalia olsun, where I am.

564
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:04,660


565
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:04,700
And to be straight and clear!

566
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:04,720
It was a special feature.

567
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:04,840
Caa!

568
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,420

573
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,320
Sorry?

574
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,980
I just can't stand people that willkell St. Louis.

Thank you.

580
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,560
Shout a warning to the nation

581
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,420
That the sword of God is raised

582
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,620
In Babylon, that's my history

Oh God, pride of man

585
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,160
Broken in the dust again

586
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,640
Yeah!

587
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,660
I first heard this song by Quicksilver Messenger Service

588
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,300
live at a show

589
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,560
a long, long time ago.

590
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,280
When I was at that concert, I think that was when I tried marijuana

591
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,880
for the first time, and that was the last thing I remember

592
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,380
until just now, sitting in this radio station.

593
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,380
Oh, wow.

594
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,240
And it shall cause your tower to fall

595
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,320
Make of you a pyre of flame

596
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,560
Oh, you who dwell on many waters

597
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,800
Rich in treasure, wise in fame

598
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,860
You bow unto your God of gold

599
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,460
Your pride of might shall be your shame

600
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,740
For only God can lead his people

601
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,300
To the glory of his glory

602
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,300


603
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,300


604
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,380
Back unto the earth again

605
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,620
Oh God, pride of man

606
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,760
Broken in the dust again

607
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,860
Thy holy mountain be restored

608
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:46,420
And by the sea of thy people

609
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,840

615
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640


616
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640


617
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640


618
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640


619
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640


624
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640


625
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640


626
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640


627
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,640

634
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,220


635
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,220

Lived on earth

646
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,020
Praise the Lord

647
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,300
This prophet

648
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,300


649
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,540
That's right.

650
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,460
Charles is here.

651
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,900
He's going to tell you about what's coming up here.

652
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,620
And I'd like to, because this is,

653
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,300
some of you folks may have recognized the voice

654
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,100
that helped introduce the Ginsburg moment.

655
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,020
Yes, it's none other than the Hollywood legend himself,

656
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,840
George Leroy, tire-biter.

657
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,940
George, welcome to St. Louis.

658
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,420
Thank you.

659
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,300
Thank you very much.

660
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,260
Privilege.

661
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,180
Great pleasure to be here on this rainy, rainy weekend.

662
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,880
It is that.

663
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,920
I want to let everybody know a little bit about George.

664
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,240
Of course, as you know, he was born in 1922 in Chicago, Illinois,

665
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,040
and just likes to think of himself as just an average North American.

666
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,040
I think it's great.

667
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,820
George, of course, a veteran of the radio and vaudeville,

668
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,940
where he made such a name for himself as the comic Croatian in Only a Plate,

669
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,860
and is well known for his radio scripts,

670
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,880
including, of course, the famous Anytown USA and Phone Trouble,

671
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,040
which I believe was later made into a film, was it not?

672
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,160
Oh, yes, Phone Trouble.

673
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,720
Yes, indeed.

674
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,900
That was a radio drama, one-woman radio,

675
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,260
and then ultimately we made it into a much larger film

676
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,780
with at least 20 or 30 people.

677
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,040
That was when Smell-O-Vision was employed in that.

678
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,560
Yeah, you were Scratch.

679
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,760
It was Scratch-O-Vision.

680
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,140
Scratch and Sniff.

681
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,820
Yes, Scratch and Sniff.

682
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,260
Yes, exactly.

683
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
First Scratch and Sniff movie.

684
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,580
I remember that because the ads for it would mention that.

685
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,460
The audience would often say,

686
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,100
Four, do four, you know,

687
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,360
and someone would scratch four in the back

688
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,000
and realize he'd been terribly hoaxed.

689
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,480
A number of people got employment out of that, though,

690
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,960
as scratchers in the theaters, did they not?

691
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,720
Well, not as many as sniffers,

692
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,000
but I believe we will discuss the subject of scratchers and sniffers

693
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
slightly later on.

694
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,480
That's right.

695
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,780
That's true.

696
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,700
Well, at any rate, of course, since 1968, George,

697
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,000
as everybody knows, you've made your home in Shenzhou, Japan,

698
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,560
which is the center of country eastern music,

699
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,560
produced a number of albums there,

700
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,120
and of course you're best known there

701
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,920
as the man behind the popular mystery series

702
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,420
Young Guy, Atomic Detective.

703
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,320
Young Guy, Young Guy.

704
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,740
Yes.

705
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,360
Isn't that also where Agar Agar comes from?

706
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,520
He's the star of Young Guy.

707
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,800
Oh, yeah, he's the John Agar's brother.

708
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,240
John Canassos-looking person.

709
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,740
Yes, exactly.

710
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,220
But maybe less known, of course,

711
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,560
is that you frequently appear on the show

712
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,440
as Dr. Toto, the clockwork fiend,

713
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,020
Young Guy's chief nemesis.

714
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,820
He's a nemesis, yes.

715
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,120
And, of course, in this country,

716
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,060
folks will recognize you from your numerous appearances

717
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,840
on Beat the Reaper and Stop That Tune

718
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,000
and, of course, Hawaiian Sellout.

719
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,900
Yes, indeed.

720
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,480
I want to hear about this new movie.

721
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:41,960
What is this?

722
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,760
What is the new movie?

723
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,380
Well, this is actually a new movie.

724
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,120
My publicity has been handed about, hasn't it?

725
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,640
Yes, it has.

726
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,400
Talking all about Babes in Khaki.

727
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,920
Babes in Khaki, a wonderful, wonderful motion picture

728
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,600
that has lain under dust in the archives

729
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,880
of the paranoid pictures.

730
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,680
You know, Paranoid went out of business,

731
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,440
sold its entire studios,

732
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,960
gave away all of its props,

733
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,440
kept a few films,

734
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,480
and we have been able, Ted Turner and I,

735
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,740
to get these films out of the paranoid vaults.

736
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,900
And I'm especially happy

737
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,280
that Ted has decided to colorize Babes in Khaki.

738
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,360
Well, now, I read that, and I just have a question.

739
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,540
When you colorize Khaki, don't you still get khaki?

740
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,600
Well, but you get a better grade of khaki.

741
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,480
I didn't know that I was going to come here to be made fun of.

742
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,700
Well, no, no, no.

743
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,620
I just wanted to clarify some things for our listeners here.

744
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,700
You know, they need to know all the facts.

745
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,760
Well, the original motion picture was made in sepia,

746
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,400
which was as close as we could get to khaki at the time.

747
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,240
Now we have a delicate balance of khaki tones,

748
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,900
which are provided entirely electronically,

749
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,780
a complete range of khakis,

750
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,840
from the wafts and the waves and the whacks, of course,

751
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,160
to the military men of the time.

752
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,660
Each, you understand, wore a different kind of khaki.

753
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,380
Pink, for example, a pink khaki.

754
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:17,660
Pink.

755
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,060
Pink khaki, yeah.

756
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,540
Yes, indeed.

757
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,760
And then there was the gray and salt and pepper khakis,

758
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,020
which were worn by the officers.

759
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,600
I see.

760
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,760
And the puce khaki.

761
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,980
I beg your pardon?

762
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,860
The puce khaki.

763
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,960
Puce khaki, yes.

764
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,580
I thought the Women's Army Corps wore wacky khaki.

765
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,580
Wasn't that what they would be?

766
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,020
I didn't know I was going to be made fun of.

767
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,600
I thought that was a historical fact.

768
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,480
You slacky.

769
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,000
Well.

770
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,700
It's a much more beautiful motion picture.

771
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,140
The battle scenes, the wonderful dance numbers,

772
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,420
the

773
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,720
This is a real period piece, though.

774
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,620
I mean, it's been in the vault since the war.

775
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:51,780
Since the war, right?

776
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,620
1942.

777
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,320
This was one of those great morale raisers

778
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,300
to get everyone in America behind the war effort to hate those

779
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,020
By bombs.

780
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,500
Bonds.

781
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,600
nasty nips and those, you know,

782
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,560
the people were all quite, you know, as it were, in bed with.

783
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,920
And it was a great star vehicle for Lily Lamont, was it not?

784
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,940
Yes, my wife at the time,

785
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,640
she was a somewhat older woman than I was.

786
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,100
I was a very young man when I made this film.

787
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,500
Twenty-two.

788
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,180
Twenty-two years.

789
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,020
Twenty-one, perhaps, around my birthday.

790
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,220
And Lily was a few years older.

791
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:34,120
Lily had been a great star of a certain kind of vaudeville.

792
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,960
Perhaps those of you who read her book, Taking It All Off,

793
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,260
will remember that she was one of the great burlesque stars of late 1920s.

794
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,360
That was hardbound, wasn't it?

795
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,940
Yes, never released in paper back.

796
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,460
Yes.

797
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,020
It was quite stiffly bound, as I recall.

798
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,840
It was indeed.

799
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,100
That's what I've heard.

800
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,400
That later became the basis for a famous Broadway musical, did it not?

801
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,040
As I recall, it lasted like one night, something like that.

802
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,180
Tremendous amount of money went.

803
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,920
Actually, I had nothing to do with the Broadway musical version of Babes in Khaki.

804
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,120
No.

805
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,440
The project was purchased from Paranoid Pictures.

806
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,320
Of course, I received not one red cent,

807
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,100
not even one all-American red, white, and blue cent for this.

808
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,600
And unfortunately, or fortunately, it didn't last.

809
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,860
I was very happy to see it flop-a-roo, I can tell you.

810
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,860
Well, I think perhaps we should move on to the Book of Lists, because...

811
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,120
No, no, not yet. Not exactly.

812
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:37,200
Because we have to play the carts.

813
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,580
Do you have to play the carts on the St. Louis show?

814
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,760
Well, of course, I'm sorry.

815
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,840
We, of course, don't have carts.

816
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,380
At St. Louis, we always believe in putting the horse before the cart.

817
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,060
You know that I didn't go to the cart.

818
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,540
Well, I thought I was going to go to the cart.

819
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,240
Well, we pull it out and shove it in again.

820
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,200
Collectors Records would like to thank K&ON by sponsoring this program.

821
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,960
For more information, Collectors Records can be reached at 327-33-1.

822
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,820
That's 327-33-1.

823
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,320
3313.

824
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,020
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

825
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,700
Yes. Yep.

826
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,980
Friends, you know...

827
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,920
Time for another healing of the tape machine.

828
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,880
This is a traditional thing, the battle with the 8-track carts.

829
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,740
I'll say, heal, heal!

830
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,940
And this is the new deck.

831
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
It's the visible.

832
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,140
You can't even get it out of there.

833
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,280
If you won't heal, sit up and beg.

834
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,700
It's not moving.

835
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,180
You gotta push stop.

836
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
And it won't let go!

837
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:54,860
There you go.

838
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,580
Oh, no.

839
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,080
See, it makes you...

840
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,400
Here in George Tirebiter, I don't know about you, but it makes me want to talk like him.

841
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,400
And I'm not going to do it.

842
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:04,860
No.

843
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,820
He's copyrighted anyway.

844
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,640
We can't do that.

845
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,180
Well, this is the underwriter cart.

846
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,920
And what it basically says, dear friends, is that you should...

847
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,000
If you know of a better way to do this, you can go to www.tirebiter.com.

848
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,880
And if you're a business or are a business that would like to underwrite a K-N-O-N show,

849
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,440
it's, uh...

850
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,040
Well, it's like cheap advertising, almost.

851
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:24,780
Almost.

852
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,980
You have to...

853
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,340
Because of the nature of the station, you have to kind of tweak it.

854
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,140
Yeah, yeah.

855
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,240
You kind of tweak it a bit one way or the other.

856
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,260
Oh, the Doge.

857
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,180
You've been taking lessons from the Healer of Appliances, haven't you?

858
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,780
Well, let's go ahead and we'll try it just for fun.

859
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,340
And nothing happens!

860
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,920
It's not easy to make nothing happen.

861
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,880
No, it's not.

862
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,940
Well, we got it out for a while there.

863
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,500
Well, uh...

864
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:02,240
Cassette machines can have a great deal of slack, and those are the kind that we use to make Doctors for Bob music.

865
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:02,920
Ah.

866
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,540
So...

867
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,480
Back.

868
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,700
Back we go.

869
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,360
Down again.

870
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,540
Gotcha.

871
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,260
I'm gonna spurt!

872
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,280
I'm gonna spurt!

873
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,260
I'm gonna spurt!

874
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,480
Don't you think it would be a good idea for you to turn the radio on?

875
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,900
Turn the machine on.

876
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,500
Well, it is a beautiful world out there, all right.

877
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,600
Take, for instance, the city of Chicago earlier this month.

878
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:45,060
It was filled to overflowing with Wookiees, Warlocks, and Japanese robots as thousands flocked to the annual World Science Fiction Convention

879
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,980
at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.

880
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,580
But at the cheaper hotel across the street, a group of people too weird for most science fiction fans to comprehend

881
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,960
were holding a little convention of their own.

882
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,040
These wackos call themselves the First Church of the Subgenius,

883
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,060
and they include, in their, to say the least, eccentric membership...

884
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:03,740
Bob!

885
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,020
Bob Bob!

886
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,440
Bob Bob Bob!

887
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,240
Bob Bob Bob!

888
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,700
Bob Bob Bob!

889
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,520
Bob Bob Bob!

890
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,700
What do they believe in? Everything.

891
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,180
Who do they believe in?

892
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,840
A mysterious character name?

893
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,300
Bob.

894
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,560
I'm sorry I haven't time for social obligations.

895
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,260
There is another word.

896
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,780
We are not, then, alone in our battle.

897
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,760
It might make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

898
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,880
The second question is, what's happening?

899
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,240
Is this a miracle? What kind of a miracle?

900
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,980
Is this a parable? What's the point?

901
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,340
Is this a letter? What's the big idea? What's he trying to communicate?

902
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,960
My God's dead!

903
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Sorry about yours!

904
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:45,980
Woo!

905
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,540
How'd you write that?

906
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,720
1989, Paul McBrady.

907
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:58,720
Well, well, well. What a wonderful congregation we find gathered here tonight.

908
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,120
Talk!

909
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,120


910
00:32:59,720 --> 00:32:59,960
Talk!

911
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,420
Talk!

912
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,300
Talk!

913
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:02,360
Talk!

914
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,360


915
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,360


916
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,360


917
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,380
Talk!

918
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,380


919
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,380


920
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,380


921
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,380


922
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,780
Talk!

923
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:02,980
Talk!

924
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,640
Talk!

925
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,160
Talk!

926
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,180
Talk!

927
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,620
Bigger, bigger talk!

928
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,700
We should 35 years, big money, big bills, big money.

929
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:10,700


930
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:10,700


931
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:10,700


932
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:10,700


933
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:10,700


934
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,240
Now, before we all moonlight out and all the hipstop parts behind the barrel that we

935
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,840
are cutting in our muds, it's on a universeshacters, the big future that's going on between us

936
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:14,840


937
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,960
Gathered in andefense lobby, up in that example.

938
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
In the full body of that scene, they say, O IRON MAN!

939
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,760
You've suspected what they are doing!

940
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,160
Freeze!

941
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,280
Freeze!

942
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,680
You got the right VR in there!

943
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:51,160
Before we get going, we do have this radio ministry every Sunday night, which has been getting a might bit of criticism of late these last few months,

944
00:33:51,940 --> 00:34:03,000
complaining that there weren't enough true believers from the Dallas clenches represented upon the airwaves, the great waves of Bob Dobbs.

945
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:15,940
And now's your chance! Oh, I'm sorry, take two! But it would be, uh, no, now's your chance!

946
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,740
To eat the gizzard of Bob!

947
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,040
You know, this'll be, don't worry, this'll be your chance.

948
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:29,100
To rant on the air of slack. It's real easy. Anybody can rant. You just go, one, two, three, RANT!

949
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,620
And then they're, ah, and then they're so good that way.

950
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,900
Yes, well, no, how did you do that?

951
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,840
Our egos are...

952
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,280
What? Pardon me? Say that again. Say it clearly and loud.

953
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:51,140
I said our egos are so pitifully small here in Texas that we've gotta show those Californians and those New Jerseyers

954
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,140


955
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,000
what kind of people we've got up here.

956
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,620
Oh, people!

957
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,520
You're just the man to do it. I can count.

958
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,900
Please let me on the air of slack!

959
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,720
Why do you, why do you, why do you, why do you...

960
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,380
Please, please, may somebody like the God-puzzling-evidence listen to us.

961
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:15,840
Well, okay, so I don't, I don't, obviously I don't have to EXPLAIN the Church of the Subgenius.

962
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,760
But what's it all about?

963
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,240
What do you like to know?

964
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,040
Oh, my friend, if you...

965
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,840
There are some things man was not meant to know.

966
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:38,180
And if, thank God, there are some things hidden from the mind of the pathetic, poor, tiny mind of man.

967
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:47,040
I, I need you to heal. I woke up yesterday morning and there was a psychic fishhook in the back of my brain being pulled on by Bob.

968
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,860
He said, Bob! And who is this Bob?

969
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:57,720
I didn't know who Bob was, but I found a map tattooed on my, on my very chest saying, saying, saying...

970
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,380
Tibet, Malaysia, Bobtown, Dobbsville.

971
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,860
What does it mean?

972
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,500
Psychophysians, visions, yetis without knowing what yetis are.

973
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,400
Well, I think you know just what to do about this, Joe.

974
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,680
Well, you take care of that.

975
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,340
Bob! Bob! Bob!

976
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,220
We get some damn good lampshades made out of those maps.

977
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,320
And how about that soap?

978
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,300
Oh, yeah, the soap.

979
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,600
The chocolate-covered, lontic, chili pieces. The whole deal.

980
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,300
Well, this isn't, uh...

981
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,740
This isn't a normal, uh, subgenius revival.

982
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,840
Uh-huh.

983
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,300
Of course, there... No, no.

984
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,960
Technically, there shouldn't...

985
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,540
I gotta admit it.

986
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,600
There should not be such a thing as a normal subgenius revival.

987
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:58,380
However, just to give you an idea of, of, uh, what has driven us to this place in this room tonight, here's...

988
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,700
I'll share with you...

989
00:36:59,700 --> 00:36:59,880
Oh!

990
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,620
Oh!

991
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,660
Oh!

992
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh!

993
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,100


994
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:02,820
Oh!

995
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:02,920


996
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:03,320
Oh!

997
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:03,420


998
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:03,560


999
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:03,580


1000
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:03,580


1001
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:03,720


1002
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:03,980
Oh!

1003
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:08,980
Oh!

1004
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,140
Oh!

1005
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


1006
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


1007
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


1008
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


1009
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


1010
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


1011
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


1012
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


1013
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,200


1014
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,260
Well, I love the accent here.

1015
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,600
Anyway.

1016
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,600
Okay.

1017
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,720
Uh, just to give you an idea of how, how far it's going.

1018
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,040
This is...

1019
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,420
I'm gonna share with you all, uh...

1020
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:19,540
Uh, uh...

1021
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:25,260
This is a typical inter-office memo within the Subgenius Foundation group.

1022
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:25,580
Bob wrote it?

1023
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,340
Okay.

1024
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:26,860
Huh?

1025
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,900
Did Bob write it?

1026
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,660
No, no.

1027
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,200
No.

1028
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,820
No, no.

1029
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,140
But just to give you an idea of just how far it's gone

1030
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,780
and why I'm doing things this way tonight,

1031
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,940
St. Palmer Vredes of the Lies Corporation in San Francisco

1032
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:55,020
wrote and sent this proposal for a subgenius motivational seminar, trademark.

1033
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,960
Well, he says, well, how's about another Mondo brain blowout,

1034
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,760
anus clenching, California style subgenius, trademark, show?

1035
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,740
But hey, he says, wait a second.

1036
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,920
Haven't the devivals, trademark, been done to death, you say?

1037
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,320
The audiences now are just the usual bunch of pink boys, trademark,

1038
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,960
and pink girls, trademark,

1039
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,460
mindlessly repeating our own jokes to us

1040
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,000
with every bit of our well-wishers.

1041
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,480
Worn-out acts memorized.

1042
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,400
Hell, they don't even spend enough money on our crappy dobs, trademark,

1043
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,160
doodads and souvenirs.

1044
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,060
Some of these aceholes even dance to the anti-music, trademark,

1045
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,200
as if it was some kind of entertainment.

1046
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,880
We've done this stuff so much, it's almost showbiz by now.

1047
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,280
It's time for a change.

1048
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,400
It's time to get tough with these scummy gimme bobs, trademark,

1049
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,600
and chintzy po-buckers, trademark.

1050
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,800
Okay, here's the proposed show.

1051
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,000
Any of the following ideas are just that, ideas.

1052
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,240
Don't worry if this sounds too crass and commercial.

1053
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,220
Ha, that'll be the day.

1054
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,420
Anything here can be changed, discarded, or mutated.

1055
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,600
I'm tossing this stuff out as a starting point.

1056
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,420
This type of subgenius, trademark, show

1057
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:20,260
emphasizes the sales and business aspects of the foundation, trademark.

1058
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,180
The revivals and devivals, trademark,

1059
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,980
centered on the mystic and religious side of dobs.

1060
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,960
If you will, the yuppie bob, not the new age bob.

1061
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,300
Combine the two and we get the no age bob.

1062
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,840
This is his idea.

1063
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,400
It's in a holiday inn or quality court or Ramada Inn,

1064
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,320
just like those other cult seminars.

1065
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,320
If people come to see us in a gallery, they mistake us for artists.

1066
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,740
If they see us in a nightclub, they think we're a rock band.

1067
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,160
If we're on a stage, they see it as a show.

1068
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,840
If we're in a theater, if we do it on the street, we just get arrested.

1069
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,780
And what's worse, lose money even if we do rack up valuable dobs points, trademark.

1070
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:10,760
Nobody can deny our reality in a holiday inn or a Marriott, as the case may be.

1071
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,460
Number one, it will be expensive to rent the space.

1072
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,360
Not to mention clearing some of the more extreme aspects,

1073
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,400
such as loud noises, cursing, screaming, blaspheming, live sex,

1074
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,720
gunfire,

1075
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,720
explosives, execution, and so forth,

1076
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,140
of the seminar, trademark, with hotel management.

1077
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,580
This may be a major stumbling block.

1078
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,380
Will we need insurance?

1079
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,540
In the other shows, we were covered by already existing theater or club policies.

1080
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,260
It will last several hours with a meal break.

1081
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Just like other seminars, we will wear the, quote, audience, unquote, down

1082
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,940
by controlling their time and forcing them to endure

1083
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,480
long stretches of sub, trademark, exposure,

1084
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,620
thus smashing their will to resist.

1085
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,280
They will become more pliant subjects for our evil purposes.

1086
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,660
Time span at least 40 or 50 hours, maybe more,

1087
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,100
makes anyone who attends really committed.

1088
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,180
This will not be, quote, taking in a show, unquote.

1089
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,400
Sure, it's hard to fill that much time up and retain their attention.

1090
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,220
The other guys do that.

1091
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,740
Their events last up to 24 hours.

1092
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,560
That's what effective brainwashing is all about.

1093
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,880
But we can use this time to make them always do as we say,

1094
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,080
pushing their limits until they either snap or begin to resist us

1095
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,660
the very thing we want.

1096
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,420
No, wait a minute.

1097
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,160
Meal break can be used to teach valuable survival lessons.

1098
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,680
Perhaps a box lunch can be passed out.

1099
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,200
This will force them to stay with us.

1100
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,540
Without the relief of leaving the room.

1101
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,720
Upon opening their box lunches, which have been referred to

1102
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,980
either as delicious or expensive or gourmet,

1103
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,360
in order to have raised their expectations,

1104
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,540
they will find a piece of burnt toast,

1105
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,580
some Cheetos or pork cracklins,

1106
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,720
a few candy corn,

1107
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,240
a vitamin pill, and a bottle or cup of the worst Dayglo soft drink we can find.

1108
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,180
In short, food that looks ugly and barely passes through the eye,

1109
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,640
but is edible and is something we obviously didn't spend a dime on.

1110
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,640
This is what you all could be getting if we'd have charged more.

1111
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,200
However, down with the seminar leaders and monitors at their own table,

1112
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,360
a hot banquet is laid out, wheeled in from the kitchen.

1113
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,680
Roast turkey, platters of pate, vegetables, whatever.

1114
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,860
A lot more food than the show personnel can eat.

1115
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,600
Enough, in fact, that the whole group could be fed from the table.

1116
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,420
The crew enjoy their meal with great relish.

1117
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,940
Any of the sub-trainees, trademark,

1118
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,380
have to do to claim a plate of real food is to come down and take it.

1119
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,680
Under no circumstances should anyone in the show reveal this fact to the trainees.

1120
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,420
They must do this for themselves.

1121
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,780
Otherwise, they'll just have to make do with their charcoal

1122
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,780
while they watch us pig out.

1123
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,460
This is the kind of relationship the United States has with the rest of the world.

1124
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,600
Well, I could, I might continue, I don't know.

1125
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,380
But we, I do know that one time at one of these conventions,

1126
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,600
at a science fiction convention like this,

1127
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,980
we, for some reason they put the table with the PA on one side of the room,

1128
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,860
but the chairs were all facing the other way.

1129
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,080
Well, Sternow, Kekever, and Dr. Snavely and I were doing the show.

1130
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,400
We came in and everyone was sitting facing the other way.

1131
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:51,400


1132
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:51,400


1133
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,400
Well, we didn't say anything.

1134
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:59,160
We just wanted to see who would have the cojones, or uvulas,

1135
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,620
to turn their chairs around and actually face us.

1136
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:10,840
About half stayed with their chairs turned the other way,

1137
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,840
with their necks like this, for an hour!

1138
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,040
For a whole hour!

1139
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,760
Now, can you, now can you understand

1140
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,400
why some people don't do this?

1141
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,800
Sometimes we don't even show up!

1142
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,800
I understand.

1143
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,400
The last, the last, quote,

1144
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,360
rave session, unquote, that,

1145
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,520
well, I had told Larry Langford I couldn't make it.

1146
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:42,120
He didn't want to change the pace up in the guide to the show,

1147
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,160
so people showed up anyway.

1148
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,480
Well, no subgenius preachers arrived,

1149
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,280
and yet, I understand it was a pretty good show,

1150
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,700
nevertheless.

1151
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,600
I mean, not even Willa Dobbs showed up to sell stuff, right?

1152
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:55,900
No.

1153
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,280
Right.

1154
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:56,780
So,

1155
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,280
I'm sure somebody showed something.

1156
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,780
Somebody showed something and did something.

1157
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,420
We know that.

1158
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,520
And apparently it was, uh, okay.

1159
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,300
So, I thought, well,

1160
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,480
darn it, everybody's giving us a hard time about how,

1161
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,440
oh, Reverend Stang, evil Reverend Stang,

1162
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,140
doesn't let me come on his radio show to rap.

1163
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,560
So, now's your chance!

1164
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:20,640
I know!

1165
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:27,580
You got a suas?

1166
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,660
chance.

1167
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,700
All right.

1168
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,900
So, I think you right now go the radio show.

1169
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,140
No.

1170
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:48,700
We have a new roller coaster.

1171
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:48,700


1172
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:48,700


1173
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,280
You know, well, is that something that we just took into the audience?

1174
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:50,600
Is there anyné drawing?

1175
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,600


1176
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,600


1177
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,600


1178
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,600


1179
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,600


1180
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,600


1181
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,600


1182
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,820
All right, let's see how many of you can leave with no legs and still call it an act.

1183
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,840
Well, you'll get an Academy Award, won't you?

1184
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,520
Woo!

1185
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,560
An act.

1186
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,300
Thank you.

1187
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,780
In the Comedy Church, they called it.

1188
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,740
Oh, yeah, right.

1189
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,520
In a fair number of...

1190
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:07,880
What?

1191
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,640
Five.

1192
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,000
Well...

1193
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,040
Yeah, thanks for the money.

1194
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,560
Well...

1195
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,060
To put the entire church in perspective,

1196
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,560
those of you out there who have...

1197
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,040
You've heard of the Scientologists, you've heard of the Moonies,

1198
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
you've heard of the Holy Rollers, the Snake Handlers.

1199
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,520
This is like all of those all rolled into one a thousand times worse,

1200
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,820
and yet, true, with so much...

1201
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,180
I mean, we can save that many more souls.

1202
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,240
What about the money?

1203
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,240
What about the money?

1204
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,560
Really, now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks?

1205
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,740
It's not the money, man.

1206
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,180
It's not the money.

1207
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,480
It's really not money.

1208
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,920
It's the souls.

1209
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,340
Yeah, it's not the whole, the entire soul, either.

1210
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,740
It's just a part of your soul that's rubbed off on you.

1211
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,300
You've got to go save it.

1212
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:49,780
You've got to.

1213
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,160
The bit of your soul which you...

1214
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,200
The symmetry of the church.

1215
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,280
This is a joke, but it is a very serious joke.

1216
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,300
To you.

1217
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,200
Now, we can...

1218
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,620
We can either let people walk by the microphone of the show here.

1219
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,320
This is the show.

1220
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:14,280
The show exists in this little black box from Radio Shack.

1221
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,140
It even has a little blinking light on it.

1222
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,640
Yeah, that's called a VU meter, son.

1223
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,620
It's like a show with a VU meter.

1224
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,680
And when that thing's lit up all the time, that means you're talking so loud that it won't be used at all.

1225
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,740
You can walk up and you can tell us...

1226
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,400
You can tell us about the people you hate.

1227
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,520
I don't mean just the people you sort of hate.

1228
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,020
I mean the people you hate.

1229
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,440
I hate you.

1230
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,800
I mean that you hate not necessarily just people.

1231
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,780
It could be corporations.

1232
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,580
It could be political groups, if you want to really be naive.

1233
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,840
It can be...

1234
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,420
It can be...

1235
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:53,420


1236
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,360
I mean, it could be TV shows.

1237
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:55,880
Bob Dobbs himself.

1238
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:01,420
It could indeed even be Bob.

1239
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,400
But it's got to be...

1240
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,000
I don't want to hear a bunch of fake hate.

1241
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,980
I want to hear the real...

1242
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,740
I mean the...

1243
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,980
My mom was giving me the car keys last Saturday.

1244
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,260
I hate you guys.

1245
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,600
I hate you.

1246
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,380
Or...

1247
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:19,560
Or...

1248
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:19,600
Or...

1249
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:19,920
Or...

1250
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,020
Or...

1251
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,020


1252
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,380
Or...

1253
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:28,380
You can also walk up to the show here and describe what is slack to you.

1254
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,460
What do you really like?

1255
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,540
What has...

1256
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,020
What about sexual problems?

1257
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,180
Ever since I discovered Bob, I've been shouting Bob's name during orgasm.

1258
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:37,860
Oh my God.

1259
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,020
And I've tried everything.

1260
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,980
I've tried lobotomy and castration.

1261
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,700
It doesn't seem to work.

1262
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,620
But ever since I found Bob, I've had this problem.

1263
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,680
And I was wondering if you could give me some good lies to convince me that that's not...

1264
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:49,860
That's not...

1265
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,380
That's not really a problem.

1266
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,840
Well, now, why is that a problem?

1267
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,780
Well, no, I never thought about that until you mentioned it.

1268
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,300
Remember what?

1269
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:56,740
Is that a problem?

1270
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,800
Remember what?

1271
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,460
I told you.

1272
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,080
The girl you were with was probably shouting Bob, too.

1273
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,480
Now, when I was watching you out...

1274
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:02,520
What's this?

1275
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,620
It's a bandwagon.

1276
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,040
How would they know?

1277
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,400
There's such a thing as...

1278
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,620
Well, with stereo, you get a thing called phasing.

1279
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,260
Let me ask you this.

1280
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,940
If the other person is saying Bob at the exact time and frequency that you are, then they'll cancel each other out.

1281
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,220
Look, it's very, very simply...

1282
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:18,640
Doesn't matter.

1283
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,420
Let me ask you a question.

1284
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,240
Do animals understand English?

1285
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,600
Which animal?

1286
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,760
Yeah, leave it.

1287
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,680
A paramecium still.

1288
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:27,980
A meep is yes.

1289
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:28,860
Okay.

1290
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,800
I mean, where do you draw the line?

1291
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,480
What's an animal?

1292
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,400
If cattle understand English, then I'm in deep s***.

1293
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,420
If not...

1294
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,280
I can promise you that cattle do not understand English.

1295
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:42,800
Of course not.

1296
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,600
I have stood in front of an entire herd of cows.

1297
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,140
This is true.

1298
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,980
I'm behind from it.

1299
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,240
I've stood in front...

1300
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,720
Yeah.

1301
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,680
And eaten a McDonald's hamburger.

1302
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,720
And they...

1303
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,880
I mean, they just went on eating their grass.

1304
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:07,640
I mean, by the same token, I've stood and sold subgenius pamphlets in front of pink boys on the street.

1305
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,780
Same thing.

1306
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,680
Same difference.

1307
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,760
And what do they do?

1308
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,560
Same thing.

1309
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,720
So I won't be hearing gossip about myself in early morning farmers programs.

1310
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:16,620
Huh?

1311
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,840
I won't be hearing gossip about myself in early morning farmers programs.

1312
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:20,900
I'll be hearing gossip about myself in early morning farmers programs.

1313
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:20,900


1314
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,660
You will on KM.

1315
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,180
Don't worry.

1316
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:23,600
Don't worry, boss.

1317
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,500
You will not testify.

1318
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,560
Even if it could talk, animals cannot testify.

1319
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,600
Well, we...

1320
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:34,080
The Church of the Subgenius is not responsible for the actions or inactions of any member

1321
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,180
or...

1322
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,120
Yeah.

1323
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,720
The Holy Dominion.

1324
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,700
Or writers or artists involved.

1325
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,500
Well, I just want to say that I met Bob in a dark alley.

1326
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,480
He raped me.

1327
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,360
He took my wallet.

1328
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,560
He left me for dead.

1329
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,540
I am eternally grateful to him.

1330
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,800
and I don't know why.

1331
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,140
Praise Bob Hewlett!

1332
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:52,640
Yeah!

1333
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,080
Frankly, I wouldn't be praising Bob

1334
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,020
if I were you.

1335
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,100
Wait a minute, was that Bob?

1336
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,220
Huh?

1337
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,160
I think it was Bob.

1338
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,200
It was me.

1339
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,480
Worship him now!

1340
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,240
It was him!

1341
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,780
It was Bob!

1342
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,180
He was the master!

1343
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,320
He cooked the eggs with the pickles!

1344
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,200
I had a child!

1345
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,320
So, you know...

1346
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,540
Is that one with the doctor?

1347
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,420
Whoa!

1348
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,180
Listeners, the show looks great so far.

1349
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,820
Wish you could actually be here.

1350
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,160
And you can also say,

1351
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,040
as this man has already done,

1352
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,680
stand up and give your testimonial

1353
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,240
as to what Bob

1354
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,740
has done for, or to, you.

1355
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,860
Bob may well have done nothing for you

1356
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,580
because that's what you needed.

1357
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,800
He's waiting for you to find out

1358
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,500
what it is you need.

1359
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,620
All you need is slack.

1360
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:13,920
Well, that's when the lady from the

1361
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,300
filth singing group came in and

1362
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,560
asked us if we could be quiet.

1363
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,400
Uh, which of course we couldn't.

1364
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,100
You know, I mean, we just flat out can't do that.

1365
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,600
This is a church of subgenius.

1366
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,060
It is in fact sacrilegious for us to be quiet, Reverend.

1367
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,500
Well, except in certain situations.

1368
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,900
I mean, we're not gonna get that...

1369
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,920
We're not that brutal of a cult.

1370
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,460
Now, it's fairly brutal.

1371
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,420
We like to think, but...

1372
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,740
We do our best, but...

1373
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,460
There's...

1374
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,360
There are worse things, believe it or not.

1375
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,440
There are people who outshine us in that regard.

1376
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:48,940
It's true.

1377
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,040
Yeah, some...

1378
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,920
This new political group here has tried to recruit us.

1379
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,760
Is this the one that Dan Quayle belongs to?

1380
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,820
I don't know.

1381
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,180
I'm thinking about joining them myself.

1382
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,640
It says here on this ad,

1383
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,460
Had enough of Western decline?

1384
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,500
Then turn to the American Imperial Party

1385
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,420
for men who are ready to own the world.

1386
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,700
Now, this is not a joke either.

1387
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,520
That's the interesting thing here.

1388
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,760
And here are ten reasons to vote for the American Imperial Party.

1389
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,740
Well, that's rotten.

1390
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,620
There are darn good reasons, too.

1391
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,040
Number one.

1392
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:32,200
Number one, executions will be rapid for vicious criminals who are already in prison.

1393
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,540
I'm all for that.

1394
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:38,200
And I'd like to be the one who defined who was a vicious criminal.

1395
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:45,420
Reason number two, death squads and vigilantes will execute vicious criminals who are not in prison.

1396
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,300
You know, save the cops some trouble.

1397
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:48,600
Absolutely.

1398
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,240
And reason number three...

1399
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:50,840
They need help.

1400
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,560
Reason number three, vengeance for honor will be permitted, even encouraged.

1401
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,360
Lawsuits will be more frequently settled by the firm of Smith and Wesson.

1402
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,360
I'd rather have twelve...

1403
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,160
No, I'd rather be carried out by six than judged by twelve.

1404
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,800
That's right.

1405
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,280
Reason number four, to vote for the American Imperial Party.

1406
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,080
And I don't know who the candidate is.

1407
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,920
Oh.

1408
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,120
But it...

1409
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:24,720
Taxpaying citizens will enjoy complete privacy from journalists, advertisers, and beggars.

1410
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,280
That's right.

1411
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,260
I notice it doesn't mention religious groups here, so I'm all for that one so far.

1412
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,720
And here's reason number five.

1413
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,760
People who are sick and dishonorable and or self-destructive...

1414
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,360
No, sick for dishonorable...

1415
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:37,900
Oh, sick for dishonorable...

1416
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,740
I'm sorry about that.

1417
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:43,880
Sick for dishonorable and or self-destructive reasons get neither sympathy nor medical care.

1418
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,680
So take that.

1419
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,600
Well, that means...

1420
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,660
That means dope addicts and so forth.

1421
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:48,960
Yeah.

1422
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,420
No medical care for...

1423
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,440
Well, they're self-medicating anyway.

1424
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,500
So it doesn't matter.

1425
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,520
Reason number six, foreign aid will be replaced by foreign tribute.

1426
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,200
The bribery of rug merchants will cease immediately.

1427
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,600
Don't like what this is.

1428
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,480
What is it?

1429
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,300
What's the term again?

1430
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,320
Reason number seven, American lives and property will not be subject to compromise.

1431
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:16,240
Any attack, even verbal, will be answered swiftly and brutally.

1432
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,820
That's, I mean, so much for burning flags, right?

1433
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,740
Public bounties will be placed on terrorists.

1434
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,000
And, of course, importantly...

1435
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,260
Why haven't they done that already?

1436
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,700
I don't know.

1437
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:32,440
It says here, reason number eight, the American military will be tested and bloodied.

1438
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:39,220
All segments of the military that do not fight or truly support fighting will be open to sacrifice.

1439
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:41,880
Um...

1440
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,060
There's human sacrifice, Baylor.

1441
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,080
Reason number nine...

1442
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:52,060
An Imperial Party president would be more than a candidate, but an actual commander.

1443
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:58,780
He would not hesitate to order invasions, remove dissidents, or conduct public executions.

1444
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,940
Now, see, all of this stuff is predicted in Book of the Subgenius way back in 1983.

1445
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,120
You look in the Book of Bob, it's right there.

1446
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:05,720
That's right.

1447
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,220
Praise Bob.

1448
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,320
And these things are coming, friends.

1449
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,620
These things are coming, and there's nothing you can...

1450
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,340
Not a thing you can do about it, except go ahead and...

1451
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,180
If I were you...

1452
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,100
I mean, you can't beat them, so join them.

1453
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,460
The American Imperial Party.

1454
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:24,280
Those nations which are near to us and insulting to us can finally be invaded.

1455
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,520
That means Canada, and Mexico, Puerto Rico, this will...

1456
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:28,940
Cuba!

1457
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:34,480
This will require secret military bases and many small usable weapons.

1458
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:39,140
Eventually, the goal of removing communism will be honored by blood.

1459
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:44,440
Communism is defined as anything which stands in the way of our pleasure.

1460
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,000
Well, Bob...

1461
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,840
That's as good a definition of communism as I ever heard in my life.

1462
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,500
My Bob, Reverend, I can't argue with...

1463
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:51,840
Wait a minute.

1464
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,280
No, it's not.

1465
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,280
That's the definition of the conspiracy.

1466
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,940
But the conspiracy is defined as anything which stands in the way of our slack.

1467
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,580
But it's the same thing.

1468
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,640
Well, yes and no.

1469
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,220
Sort of.

1470
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,160
Some get slack not from pleasure, nay, but from pain.

1471
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1472
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,000
Hey, say, do that again.

1473
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:11,340
Oh, yes.

1474
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,340
Madam.

1475
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,360
Ma'am?

1476
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,300
Oh, yes.

1477
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,340
Yes, but then Reverend, the pain is their pleasure.

1478
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,980
Well, we've got to get out of here for a collector's showcase.

1479
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,340
And just in time, too.

1480
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,240
Or, if you're listening in another city for...

1481
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,180
Which is a great show, I'm sure.

1482
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,760
Bob listens to it all the time.

1483
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,780
So, good night to you, dear friends.

1484
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:37,260
Good night to Chuck the Doge of South St. Louis.

1485
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:37,960
That's right.

1486
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,640
Who will be sending more garbled shows made from other shows...

1487
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,140
Which are made from...

1488
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:44,440
The Money Show.

1489
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:51,080
...which play on this show, which then gets rerouted again, and it's like a giant blender...

1490
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:51,600
Yeah.

1491
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:57,120
...that just spews right back into itself, and you get to, or have to, listen to the

1492
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,580
results.

1493
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,000
Yes.

1494
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,480
You hear me?

1495
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,140
Get away from it.

1496
00:57:59,140 --> 00:57:59,320
Just like these...

1497
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,480
Hey, you've got to pay me some money.

1498
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,400
Hey, give me some money.

1499
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,820
Is that a tick or a tick-head?

1500
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:09,500
This little chigger got on me when I was under the old Palo Verde tree, and it's kind of

1501
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,360
burrowed under my .

1502
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,280
If your chigger offends me, cut it out.

1503
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:14,280


1504
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,400
That's right.

1505
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,300
Use new chigger off, and the music will always keep coming.

1506
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,820
We are M.E.A.D.

1507
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,960
This is M.E.A.D.

1508
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,300
This is the coming together of people of all races, all sexes, all walks of life, coming

1509
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,160
together, joining hands, and sharing what they can with me.

1510
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,940
And that's kind of neat.

1511
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,200
Yeah, it kind of makes you wonder...

1512
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,060
Hands across the me.

1513
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,220
...where all the goodness is coming from.

1514
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,040
We are the me.

1515
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:41,800
We are the me.

1516
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,260
It is your responsibility to feed and to serve.

1517
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1518
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1519
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1520
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1521
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1522
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1523
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1524
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1525
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1526
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,260


1527
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,640
We are the musicians in this together.

1528
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,040
You are next.

1529
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,040
Good triumphs over evil every time.

1530
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:57,060
There's this force that flows between us all, and in Church of the Subgenius we just call

1531
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:57,400
it money.

1532
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,260
You can just make it flow towards me.

1533
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,160
Well, you know what really makes me mad?

1534
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:04,880
Thank you.

1535
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,400
Thank you guys.

1536
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,500
What makes you pee?

1537
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,900
What makes you pee?

1538
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,180
What makes me pee?

1539
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,160
Well, about, uh, two liters of Coke 45.

1540
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,240
No, no, no, no, no, not that.

1541
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:14,240


1542
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:14,240


1543
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:14,240


1544
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,780
Now let's go over that again.

1545
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,580
That's a good idea.

1546
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,600
No, no, okay, what?

1547
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,000
No, really.

1548
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,240
People come up to me and say that they have sugar bites.

1549
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,320
Oh, no.

1550
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,680
That bums me down.

1551
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,420
And mosquitoes collide with them.

1552
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,520
That's a good idea.

1553
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:27,580
Yeah.

1554
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,760
Don't they know that the word is chigoro?

1555
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,060
I don't know.

1556
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,560
No, no, it's chigo.

1557
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,360
They don't have any elegance.

1558
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,780
It's not chigoro, it's chigo, if we must be pedantic.

1559
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,420
Well?

1560
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,780
Well, chigo became corrupted into the word chigger.

1561
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,400
Oh, yes.

1562
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,980
Around the same time that the word revelia became pronounced revel-ee.

1563
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,560
It's an Americanization of the pronunciation.

1564
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,000
Now, what about the word origins of the word tawdry?

1565
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,180
Tawdry?

1566
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:58,660
Yes.

1567
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,160
Well, you know, this is Frank here, and I think you know Audrey.

1568
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,820
She's a wonderful trooper.

1569
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,200
Thank you very much.

1570
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,940
She's going to demonstrate in the finals of this wonderful contest

1571
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,320
how the tawdry talketh.

1572
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,400
And she's going to go on to a new question.

1573
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,460
A personal friend of mine for the past 15 years,

1574
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,640
a great humanitarian.

1575
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,320
Couldn't make it.

1576
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:18,780
What, what?

1577
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,100
Here you go.

1578
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,920
Someone who never wants to be known as just a Milton Berle for acid heads.

1579
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:24,640
Oh, no.

1580
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,500
Oh, never, never.

1581
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,780
The amazing Mr. Me, Me, Me,

1582
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:32,180
who sometimes is called the final solution to the entertainment problem.

1583
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,300
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

1584
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,300
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

1585
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,460
I mean, he might be Jane, but I'm even Janer.

1586
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,140
Oh, ho, ho.

1587
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:40,440
Oh, ho, ho.

1588
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,400
You're a Janer?

1589
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:41,400


1590
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:41,800
You're a Janer than most.

1591
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:42,900
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

1592
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,900
I'm making too much money off this kill me stuff to die now, baby.

1593
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,520
Who's the Janest in the world?

1594
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,680
Okay, well, shall we?
