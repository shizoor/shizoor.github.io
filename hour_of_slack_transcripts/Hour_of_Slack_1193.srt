1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,700
20 million men have had abnormal sex.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,660
Find out how.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,340
The Self Genius Power of Sweat.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,980
Specifically designed to target the muscles that control the bladder.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,540
Side effects include mouth constipation for a full 24 hours.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,040
I am just a dog.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,100
Thank you, Leemur.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,660
Friends, I had this whole show half assembled.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:35,180
And there was going to be a lot about our new videos and some sermon excerpts from Starwood.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,180
Of pagan bashing by yours truly.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,220
But that takes a lot of editing and explaining.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,920
And we're really busy and I'd rather do it next week.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:54,700
Luckily, this week, Radio Synesthesia on WCSB in Cleveland turned into Hour of Slack number 1193.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,000
Because Lonesome Cowboy Dave and I phoned.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,400
And then to join Dr. Sinister and his other guests.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,600
And we kind of never shut up.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,740
So I know when I'm licked and when my chicken is choked.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,840
So I give up.

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,920
This whole show, this entire Hour of Slack is one phone conversation.

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,540
Goodbye.

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,040
Hello, you're on the air.

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,980
I would like to relate to you, if possible, my story from a book called.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,140
Oh, the

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,120
metal nose, which was locked off and it doable.

25
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,840
It is rumor.

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:58,000
And why do you believe that he did he was killed by Kepler sort, like the original was chopped off and he had a metal replacement or he had a metal.

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,800
one naturally and that got chopped off or?

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,760
He had a normal nose

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,840
and then he was in a dual.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,180
It got chopped off

31
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,060
and so he was going around using his sighting tube

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,380
because he didn't really have

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,800
telescopes that good, you know.

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,200
They just had these sighting tubes

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,980
and he had a big metal nose on him.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,440
Oh, what happened to your accent?

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,120
Did you know that Kepler probably killed him?

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,200
Johannes Kepler?

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,240
Do you think that Kepler smelled his wife or something?

40
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,060
Smelled his wife?

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,980
Yeah.

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm sure he did.

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,200
I don't know if Kepler...

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,720
He should have kept his nose in his own place.

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,640
Don't be nosy.

46
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,860
That's the whole point of the story.

47
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,320
Yep, that's probably true.

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,720
It's like the economy.

49
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,320
If you stick your nose in something dirty,

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,340
it's going to smell bad.

51
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,760
He might so.

52
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,100
Hey, caller, what's your handle?

53
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,840
What's your name?

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,240
Oh, Les Boington Fruitful Erstweil.

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,800
Erstwells?

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,500
No, Orson Welles.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,420
Orson Welles, that's your name?

58
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,000
No, that's not my real moniker.

59
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,280
My real moniker is...

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,740
I'm a loathsome cow pie.

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,740
Aren't we all?

62
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,600
Oh, you're on the air.

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,100
Oh, Dr. Sinister.

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
Ah, welcome.

65
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,940
It's a sidekick, honest of mine.

66
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,740
A what?

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
Of your moniker.

68
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,400
I have to use psychic powers

69
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,700
to know what's going on lately

70
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,940
because my computer wasn't working

71
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,200
and streaming right

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
and I couldn't hear the radio

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,080
and the phone didn't work

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,520
and the TV special about Alzheimer's scared me.

75
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:47,960
Oh.

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,160
So I'm confused.

77
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,300
I need help.

78
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,020
I need you guys to tell me what to think.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,920
Well, one thing we can tell you for sure

80
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,120
is you're never going to be able to rebuild

81
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,880
that beautiful, normal, luscious, subgenius brain tissue.

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,840
It's just going to continue to atrophy and atrophy

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,780
until it's like a little piece of gravel

84
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,540
that irritates your eyesight and your hearing.

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,360
Well, what I'd like to think is that I've developed...

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,880
I've got good practice for that time.

87
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,140
Oh, you mean by the psychic regenerator

88
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,600
de-plus magnet thing?

89
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,380
Oh, no, no.

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,380
No, just...

91
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,900
I've been dealing with an Alzheimer's-like situation.

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,280
I've been in a state in the real world

93
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,800
because most of my concentration is tied up inside my brain.

94
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,720
Have you been drinking booze and smoking weed?

95
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,820
Huh, what?

96
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,380
Have you been drinking booze and smoking weed?

97
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,920
Is that why you've been losing your memory?

98
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,720
No, no.

99
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm old.

100
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,360
Oh, yeah.

101
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,200
I used my brain...

102
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,940
I abused my brain in other ways

103
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,620
that I can't even describe on the radio.

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,700
You would not understand.

105
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,700
A lot of people are familiar with...

106
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,720
Can you try and explain that to me, please?

107
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,900
A lot of people are familiar...

108
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,280
Are you familiar with something called anti-matter?

109
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,080
When matter and anti-matter get close to each other,

110
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,400
it results in this huge release of energy.

111
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,140
Well, there is knowledge,

112
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,780
and then there's also anti-knowledge.

113
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,140
Oh, is that right?

114
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,220
And it's possible to put anti-knowledge into your brain.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,460
You will see a huge amount of energy.

116
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:16,560
But that's been my whole problem with the race

117
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,920
of the ideogularity against the singularity.

118
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,620
So that would be the dark energy

119
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,260
that you would give to your brain, Dr. Sinister?

120
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,380
That would actually be...

121
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,180
It's more like things you can learn

122
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,280
that will make you unlearn other things.

123
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,820
Do they result, may I ask, in actually synesthesia?

124
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,320
Well, can you get some of that stuff, man?

125
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,940
I mean, do any of these result in a synesthesia?

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,600
Huh.

127
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
Of being able to smell the numbers

128
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,500
and feel the blue and so forth?

129
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,720
Well, that's only a minor symptom.

130
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,460
By the way, I would like to point out that...

131
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,720
One of the major quakes.

132
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,840
I would like to point out that one of the most notorious sources

133
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,800
of anti-knowledge is Fox News Channel.

134
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,500
Hmm.

135
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,420
That will fill up the spaces.

136
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,200
Between your brain cells with garbage, yes.

137
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,520
Yeah, there was already garbage in between those brain cells.

138
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,480
And you need to exfoliate them.

139
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,440
I'll talk to each other later.

140
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,060
Alrighty, see you later, I see.

141
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,400
Cell exfoliation of the brain.

142
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,280
Yeah, speaking of...

143
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,940
It's not an easy task, but it's one well worth undertaking

144
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,300
because you've got to clean the sucker out once in a while.

145
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,480
And speaking of cleaning the sucker out once in a while,

146
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,220
I've got to remind you all this is Gabe Zayson.

147
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,780
You'll be in Cleveland.

148
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,340
Portions of the following broadcast may be objectionable

149
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,900
to some listeners.

150
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,180
Therefore, WCSB advises listener discretion.

151
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,360
The views and opinions expressed on this program

152
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,500
are not those of WCSB or Cleveland State University

153
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,360
or anyone...

154
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,580
Anyone decent or sane.

155
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,080
Anyone worth mentioning.

156
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,160
But sometimes you have to take that old wire brush

157
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,520
and ream that station out.

158
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,680
And the brain.

159
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,640
Your brain and your radio station

160
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,080
are very similar machines after a fashion.

161
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,720
Yep.

162
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,440
The tools need to be cleaned.

163
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,060
Right, especially in the case of my brain

164
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,900
and WCSB.

165
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,180
You have to think of WCSB as a huge paintbrush

166
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,260
or maybe one of those jackboot listless animator type devices

167
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,180
that they used to be using or still do once in a while.

168
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,480
I used to have one.

169
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,560
And you have to give it a full rub down.

170
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,760
You have to wire brush it from the inside out

171
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,140
until it gleams like a shining new edifice of I don't know what.

172
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,340
Well, you know, when you do the kind of work that we do,

173
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,900
after a while, your brain starts to...

174
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,360
It starts to look like a campfire marshmallow

175
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,980
that caught on fire and then you blew it out.

176
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,600
It looks like a piece of fat and one vomited.

177
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,160
That's a result of that horrendous amount of energy released

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,960
with the interaction of the mind and anti-mind or whatever.

179
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,540
Well, it depends on your level of concentration also.

180
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,840
If you're the kind of person who can sit there staring at some idiotic thing on the internet

181
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,380
when your wife has just brought you a tray of cookies

182
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,900
and never noticed the cookies.

183
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,140
That's the kind of concentration that causes the sort of brain damage I'm talking about.

184
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,500
Well, that's the kind of brain damage that many of the denizens of those

185
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,880
that you reach out to in your church duties.

186
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,360
That's the level of estate, the random co-action that they've moved into

187
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,260
that you try to rescue them from.

188
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,520
We see in some of your propagandized material, some of your literature,

189
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,880
we see an idiot staring vacantly.

190
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,120
At a boob tube accompanied by a wife holding her cookies.

191
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,220
Really? I always thought of it as a chimp masturbating blindly in his cage.

192
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,500
But, you know, to each his own.

193
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,860
Wait a minute, I haven't seen that in a while.

194
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,860
Well, you haven't been to the zoo or ex-day.

195
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,420
Hello, you're on the air.

196
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,500
Hey, what's up, doctor?

197
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,360
How's the...

198
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,720
Welcome aboard.

199
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,760
By the way, my phone, besides the brain damage, I think I have phone damage.

200
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
If this phone suddenly shuts off, it's because we both ran out of time.

201
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:56,880


202
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:56,880


203
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:56,880


204
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,400
I ran out of batteries.

205
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,080
Hmm.

206
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,000
And I got a call back from another phone.

207
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,100
It's always good to have a non-cordless landline phone.

208
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,700
I wish I had a brain like that.

209
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,960
I wish I had a non-cordless brain that I could just, you know, phone in.

210
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,280
You mean you actually are using the cord on and as and with your brain?

211
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,080
You need the cord? You're no longer self-ambulatory?

212
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,860
Well, you know, dialysis patients, you know, they're not...

213
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,940
You know, patients have a life.

214
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,480
You can get around even if you have to plug your brain, keep your brain plugged in at

215
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,340
home most of the time.

216
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,660
Well, I would say you're degenerating rather quickly and you should definitely see a professional,

217
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,760
a shark or something.

218
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,980
I don't know, a rest...

219
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,380
Maybe a professional wrestler would work for you.

220
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,420
Well, I went to see a Wiccan visionary and she laid hands on me and said I was okay.

221
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,140
I think she was just trying to talk to you while she was taking your wallet.

222
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,160
I think she was just trying to talk to you while she was taking your wallet.

223
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,400
I'm sorry, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,080
I think she was copping a fuel while she was taking your wallet.

225
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,020
That's horrible to live like that.

226
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,820
I'm used to it.

227
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,580
To not know from one day to the next day if you're going to be able to copulate or fear

228
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,220
the police or maybe you just want to jump out of a window sometimes.

229
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,220
I'm used to it.

230
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,280
Reverend Stang, I have a suggestion for you.

231
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,740
Suggestion?

232
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,480
Yes, I either went with the novel and the movie, Donovan's Brain.

233
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,520
Yeah.

234
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,880
Of course.

235
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,040
Okay, that might be one good way to preserve your brain and prevent further damage.

236
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,520
You know, just take it out, let it have a little rest in a tank of some sort of solution

237
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,920
for a while, then maybe put it back in if and when you feel like it.

238
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,180
Well, you know, it's funny you should mention that because we've been experimenting

239
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,980
with that and I've got like seven aquariums in my basement with different brands of bobbies

240
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,360
in them.

241
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:51,680
Okay.

242
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:52,980
Okay.

243
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,380


244
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:02,340
So, it's a hellish existence, not being able to see or feel anything, just being this sort

245
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,500
of ball of awareness and pain.

246
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,020
Is one of those brains subspecies 23?

247
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,380
No, no, no.

248
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,540
I haven't.

249
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,200
Is that Ratnar?

250
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:11,840
Yeah.

251
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,820
Oh, hey, Ratnar.

252
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,220
I haven't talked to you in a while.

253
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,740
I know.

254
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,660
It's been...

255
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:23,840
No, no, we can't give out who's the identity of some of the brains because some of them

256
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,100
may be frequent callers.

257
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,380
Okay.

258
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,620
We're going to have to wait and see what happens with the show.

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,300
But the pain is a thing that really needs review is what sort of pain if they're indeed

260
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,860
not feeling in a liquid sense, what kind of transcendental pain which is never ending?

261
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,260
Well, there's...

262
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,380
You can measure.

263
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,560
There's pain centers in the brain and they're lit up.

264
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:47,880
I keep meaning to go down there and unplug them and let them die a kind death, but you

265
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,620
know how it is.

266
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,660
The brain itself...

267
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,720
You've got laundry to do, dishes.

268
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,260
The brain itself can interpret pain signals from other parts of the body, but it doesn't

269
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,340
any pain receptors of its own if you like poke somebody in the brain it wouldn't hurt no although

270
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:06,140
i have an interesting true story of uh relating to that doctor you can't feel your brain at it

271
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:15,300
at one point um my doctor was concerned about my brain and they had to do a cat scan type thing

272
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:25,340
what about a dog scan they injected iodine into my neck vein so that my and they could somehow

273
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,840
move it around so the iodine in different as they injected it over and over again would hit

274
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,680
different parts of my brain and then they could get a good picture of the blood vessels they were

275
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:44,060
looking for an aneurysm and i for that one and only time was able to have sensation on the inside

276
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,280
of my brain and just my whole body and i had to get the blood to start moving again and i had to

277
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,280


278
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:53,200
my brain it was felt like a combination of cold and heat at the same time in a place where i had

279
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:02,140
never ever felt anything oh and i have never felt anything since then i ended up with a nice

280
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:08,340
photograph so from three angles of my my brain and a piece of paper that said that it was normal

281
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,520
that's like a death sentence oh my god your brain my brain's normal i might as well just die

282
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,960
yeah how will you ever live down the embarrassment

283
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,720
well the it's what i'm trying to it's not the embarrassment so much as the awareness that we're

284
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,080
trying to avoid you know well doctors what do they know we're all trying yeah we're all trying

285
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,320
to avoid awareness i mean that's you know everybody comes home and has to be aware of

286
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,320


287
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,420
it like a couple like 48 beers or something like that and injects hypodermic full of heroin into

288
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:50,240

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,160
If I told you our policy, send us your money back and we'll send you another set of breasts.

312
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,700
I can't send the whole thing back because half of it exploded.

313
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,500
No, the money. Just send us all the money again.

314
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,080
I sent you the money, you sent me the product, and it was defective.

315
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,760
I just want my money back.

316
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,360
Send your money back to us again and we'll send you another set.

317
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,840
Look, this isn't the place to do that.

00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,520
I'm not customer service, okay?

319
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,100
She's on vacation. Call back next week.

320
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,460
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,860
Yes, this is Princess Lee.

322
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,660
I'm sorry, Dr. Shinshaw.

323
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,880
Reverend Service has been overworked as it is.

324
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,660
I'll never do that again.

325
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,100
She, by the way, is a happy user of those inflatable subgenius breasts.

326
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:06,280
Well, I've heard they're, you know, they're pretty popular and a lot of people have found happiness, whatever the hell that is, with them.

327
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:14,740
Well, now you may need our new improved subgenius forehead for that to experience, to appreciate the happiness that you already have.

328
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,640
Can you literally feel your own brain in dense matter or dark matter or dense space?

329
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,640
Through the third nostril.

330
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,180
Yeah.

331
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,640
No, it doesn't actually work that way.

332
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,980
It's just a strap-on forehead that makes you look smarter, so therefore you feel smarter.

333
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,340
Therefore, in new age trends...

334
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,760
In new age jargon, you are smarter.

335
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,280
In real speech, you're actually a sucker.

336
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:52,540
But in new age jargon, you have achieved quantum wellness if you're using our new artificial forehead.

337
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:00,540
Well, that sounds like Rocknard philosophy, which is Dobbsism, which is pure Dobbsism, which is there's a sucker born every minute.

338
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,120
Hey, we've all got Dobbsism.

339
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,320
Some worse than others.

340
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,700
Dobbsism.

341
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,120
I wonder how that's going to save the economy.

342
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,740
Not.

343
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:22,080
Actually, Bob predicted that in the year 2007, a subgenius pamphlet would buy you a boxcar full of canned peaches.

344
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,760
You have to wear like a huge Kreutzer belt full of coupons and stuff?

345
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,080
I should have gotten a lot of boxcars of canned peaches in 2007.

346
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,120
We'll all be living in our own basement.

347
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm afraid to look out the windows because the zombies will be coming.

348
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,860
Yep, give the stimulus time to fail.

349
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:51,040
Why does zombies and economic depression always go together?

350
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,660
Why do stimuli remind you of flaccid penises which need to be resurrected with, like, you know, outer space things?

351
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,240
Speak for yourself, dude.

352
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,400
Well, I need outer space sex.

353
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,500
I think it's a tenant of your creed.

354
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,440
You know, somebody...

355
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:17,480
Just today was making fun of me, or just making fun of outer space alien sex in general, on the basis that it was Masonic, actually.

356
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,780
Yeah, I'm not kidding.

357
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,880
Like the jars or the shoes?

358
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,360
We get some interesting, you know, mail.

359
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,080
I'm familiar with Mason shoes and Mason jars, but I don't know anything about what the hell ever you're talking about.

360
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,820
Mason sex.

361
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,220
Oh, Mason.

362
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,420
Yeah, it doesn't actually have much to do with aliens.

363
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,580
Pointed hats, though, I bet.

364
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,620
There have to be pointed hats or else it just doesn't...

365
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,460
I don't know.

366
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,880
What do you think?

367
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,100
All I know is I just found that cup of coffee I've been wandering all over the house looking for this entire conversation.

368
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,040
It was on the living room table.

369
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,700
Did, um...

370
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,600
Dr. Sinister, I'd like to ask you a question, not that it's relevant,

371
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
because there's nothing relevant going on.

372
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,080
Uh-huh.

373
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:16,100
Have you heard of Professor Michikaku's program on the radio called Science is Really Cool or something?

374
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:16,820
No.

375
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
I've, um...

376
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:18,880
No.

377
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:28,800
Now, I've heard from my fellow scientists that that particular scientist is full of a bunch of mumbo jumbo hoo-hah.

378
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,880
Well, he is a...

379
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,600
Chaz was real into that guy.

380
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,980
Yeah, he was a string man.

381
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,520
He was a string theory popularizer.

382
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,080
Yeah.

383
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,080
Yeah.

384
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,420
Of course, serious scientists serve him.

385
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,680
Well, I believe those guys just as much as I believe the rabbi and the priest.

386
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:45,980
They're all...

387
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,220
Probably not.

388
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,060
I haven't done the math.

389
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,560
I can't do the math.

390
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,640
I ain't equipped.

391
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,620
Well, think of...

392
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,680
So I'll take your word for it.

393
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,820
Think of Tycho Brahe's third...

394
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,140
There's 10 universes and there's a heaven and a hell.

395
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,420
Bob sold it.

396
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,520
I smoked it down at the hospital.

397
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,700
What about Purgatory?

398
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,080
Purgatory is a nice concept.

399
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
I think that's...

400
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,500
I think that's...

401
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:05,500


402
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:05,500


403
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:05,500


404
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,380
That's the shopping mall right around the corner from me.

405
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,220
Right.

406
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,840
It's the place where you go and consume and are consumed.

407
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,000
And that's what we're all doing right now.

408
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,500
We're all being eaten by ourselves.

409
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,700
Well...

410
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,980
At least, you know, kind of like...

411
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,540
Well, slowly.

412
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,180
...a place or something.

413
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,780
Some are a little further along than others.

414
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,580
Dave.

415
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,580
I'm chewed up pretty good.

416
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,080
At least I can still see things clear.

417
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,020
I can see we're headed for doom.

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,900
Can anybody else out there?

419
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,940
Well, I don't think doom is necessarily the right word.

420
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,620
I think...

421
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,840
I think things are going to be very, very different in a few years' time, but...

422
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,200
Exactly how, for better or for worse, it depends on whom you ask.

423
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,160
What if I have to go to a WPA camp and pick peaches and wear shorts and stuff and sing

424
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,500
like the Communist International?

425
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,180
Or is that...

426
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,960
No, I won't...

427
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,740
Well, that's what you...

428
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,880
I thought that was what you always wanted.

429
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,620
Well, that was when the other guys were in charge.

430
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,660
Oh, I see.

431
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,800
Now all of a sudden you're not the Wobbly anymore.

432
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,300
Now you're the arch-conservative NRA member.

433
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,760
Mm-hmm.

434
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,240
Mm-hmm.

435
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,860
I'm out training in the backyard every day.

436
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,940
I don't know what you're...

437
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,580
Mr. Contrary.

438
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,080
Professional oppositionist.

439
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,520
Right.

440
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,120
Oppositionalist.

441
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,680
You know, the...

442
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah, I got to hate whoever's in power.

443
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,760
Yeah, when it was Bush, Dave was a Wobbly Communist.

444
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,340
Now, ever since Obama's gotten in, Dave's all of a sudden a regular Rambo.

445
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,940
Rambo Limbaugh.

446
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,560
No, that's not a propagated falsehood.

447
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,280
I'm just making some sort of pointy head every now and then.

448
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,360
I know, but it sounds good.

449
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,840
And we all like to be the devil's advocate, because, you know, we like the devil.

450
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,620
At least that's the way I feel about it.

451
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm sure most of us sure would agree tonight.

452
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,520
He has his father's eyes.

453
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,740
I'm just saying.

454
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,300
No, I'm just kidding.

455
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,940
Well, we only like him.

456
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,060
We don't worship him.

457
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,180
It's not like we're in love with him, mostly.

458
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,540
Well, you're at a bar.

459
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:12,960
Who buys?

460
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,720
You know what I mean?

461
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,480
Nobody comes up shooting but old Lucifer.

462
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,320
He'll buy you a double.

463
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,040
In fact, he'll keep you going all night somehow.

464
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,600
Is that what happened?

465
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,620
How about the kidney dialysis unit?

466
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,460
What are you saying?

467
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Please get me out of here.

468
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,280
Who walks up and sits right on your face until you can't breathe?

469
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,600
You know who?

470
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:32,740
I don't know.

471
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:32,740


472
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:32,740


473
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:32,740


474
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:32,740


475
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:32,740


476
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,780
Of course you do.

477
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:33,860


478
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,900
Old night pass.

479
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,460
The old doctor's split foot from the insurance company.

480
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,800
Dr. Splitfoot.

481
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,500
Friend of the devil is a friend of mine.

482
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,460
My phone keeps beeping.

483
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,400
Do you guys hear that?

484
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:50,900
Yeah.

485
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,480
Yeah.

486
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,900
Oh, could you possibly have a penile warts?

487
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,380
Thank God.

488
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,460
So it is the phone.

489
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,400
Oh, what a relief.

490
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,320
So that would mean somebody was screwing with your head.

491
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,720
If you.

492
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,880
If you managed to somehow sprout penile warts on your brain.

493
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,320
Well, if you guys weren't also hearing the beeps, I would be pretty concerned.

494
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,500
We're not hearing them.

495
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,240
It's coming from inside the house.

496
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,620
I'm so glad I'm deaf and don't understand anything anymore.

497
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,340
No.

498
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,800
By the way, you know who really is a Masonic plot?

499
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,100
Terry Mason.

500
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,400
It says right in the title.

501
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,380
Oh.

502
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:44,900
Who is he?

503
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,180
Aren't you seeing him?

504
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,180


505
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,180


506
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,520
Oh, really?

507
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:48,680


508
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:48,680


509
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:48,680


510
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,500
You Petra would say so.

511
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:49,580


512
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,680
Okay.

513
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:50,700


514
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:50,700


515
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:50,700


516
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:50,700


517
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,660
So why don't we first bring in our first is seeking potential Snude-roĩ

518
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,620
nip, efforts to verify his existance.

519
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,100
He can recognize finances to help him deal with his problems.

520
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,100


521
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,380
Here we go.

522
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:05,160
helicopters again and then somebody with like a british 1984 voice says your number and tells you

523
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:12,440
to go by the window somebody was explaining i was reverend nicky was explaining to us earlier that

524
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:21,280
the british are are live in an orwellian society and we live in a huxleyan society

525
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,940
you know that's an important distinction i i hear so many references to 1984 all the time and yet

526
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,580
uh you know to me i thought brave new world was something that we're closer to in a lot of ways

527
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,080
well you know i think there's such a thing as a compromise i think we can strike a balance

528
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,720
actually i think brave new world is the answer how about fusion how about the dichotomy might

529
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:50,280
have been created by these illuminoid audio types long ago back in the 1920s when everybody had

530
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,760
large foreheads to begin with just think of that there was that brief time when humanity

531
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:05,380
was true humanity and before the devolution began when attila was a hun and lucifer 1950s about the

532
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:15,320
time i was born the uh you just everything started slip sliding backwards it started with all of our

533
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,040
dads having to stand there in the nevada desert in front of those nuclear bomb tests when they

534
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,920
were in the surface yeah those little malocclusions turned out to be huge how consequential they were

535
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,440
plutonium right the sides of their faces well imagine our surprise when we figured out that

536
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,620
that was the one thing that all the subgeniuses had in common at one point their parents had been

537
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:43,060
exposed to dangerous levels of radiation in most cases they were the guys in the old movies the old

538
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:51,680
army movies you see marching toward the atom bomb cloud yes hence um and normally you know there

539
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,920
were some who were uh like for instance princess wii's father had actually

540
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,440
had siren or something that worked but he had had to get his hands on the ndr and they

541
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,960
tried to get rid of the acne and they tried to cure that using strong doses of radiation on his face

542
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,120
get rid of the acne only to cause skin cancer you know years later

543
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:16,000
apparently in the early days of sexual enumeration when you were a small child it would make you walk

544
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,040
into an x-ray thing when you went to buy shoes and you would x-ray your feet and nobody it didn't make

545
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,140
any difference what your x-ray said about your feet you just got your feet x-rayed and then they

546
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:33,580
would fit you for shoes now why do they go around x-raying everybody's feet dave it's called a

547
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:41,400
fluoroscope a fluoroscope yeah yeah because it's on the floor and you stand on it they're not

548
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,160
pumping secretly fluoride into your purity of essence or your precious bodily fluids are they

549
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,940
no that's different that's what they did to make you feel they made me feel the inside of my brain

550
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:59,700
just to punish me made me feel like ripping something like a like a like a table a huge

551
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:07,100
oak table and running around and just crashing the school buses and i don't know i don't know

552
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,360
and this beeping on my phone is making me feel like i've got a sonar machine in front of me

553
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,160
you know it's like the enemy is approaching sir

554
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,840
could you

555
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,180
only two minutes one minute 30 seconds stand back

556
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,540
there were some sub geniuses in the atlantic uh bumping into each other last week weren't

557
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:47,140
there the french and british subs oh operated by geniuses who they they were both using sonar

558
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,340
but they were also both using anti-sonar what about the ruski slamming into one of our

559
00:27:52,340 --> 00:28:00,200
flatterlites everybody's crashing lately i guess there's enough space junk for 60 000 years isn't it

560
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,860
and now there's plutonium at the floor of the north atlantic again

561
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:11,380
well in rusting in slowly rusting barrels well if it doesn't bubble up from the sea

562
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,920
aristotle said it will certainly poop down on you from the skies because he believed in the fourpike

563
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,140
rob Black这个就想猜她一定要把你很严厉的

564
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,140

00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,140


566
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,140


567
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,140

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


591
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


592
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


593
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


594
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


595
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


596
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


597
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


598
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


599
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


600
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,320


601
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,980
tilt right now.

602
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,620
No, we call it an apron, Dave.

603
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,340
An apron.

604
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,020
Yeah.

605
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,340
Okay.

606
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,440
And a trowel and a T-square.

607
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,700
That's all you need to start a conspiracy.

608
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:59,420
An apron, a trowel, you know, one of those compass things, a little T-square and a few

609
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,600
engineering tools.

610
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,840
And a secret handshake.

611
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,680
Right.

612
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,400
I can't forget that.

613
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,000
You have to have a secret handshake.

614
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,720
And a fez.

615
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,920
Or else what would Copernicus say?

616
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,500
For instance.

617
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,260
Do you still have yours, Stang?

618
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,460
Do you still have your fez?

619
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,420
I have two.

620
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,740
I have several fezes.

621
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,100
No, I meant the one from Amsterdam.

622
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:15,720
Yeah.

623
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,720
I need to get a fez.

624
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,780
Yeah, that one doesn't really fit me very well, but I don't have to wear it just on

625
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,200
my head.

626
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,120
How about the mummified poodle?

627
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,920
Are you still wearing that around to the mall and then the bookstore over there?

628
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,080
That kind of fell apart.

629
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,880
Well, you know, it caused a lot of people a lot of headache and a lot of misery over

630
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,360
that poodle.

631
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,280
Well, it was dead.

632
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,440
It was freeze-dried.

633
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,360
That's the thing.

634
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,920
You know, people thought it was grizzly that I would have my pet.

635
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,060
Well, yeah.

636
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,820
It wasn't a poodle.

637
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,000
It was a chihuahua.

638
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,000
And it was freeze-dried.

639
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,020
And it was supposed to hold together for like two years, but it was more like two months.

640
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,140
I would not recommend doing that with your dog, Jake.

641
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,400
Grizzly third month there.

642
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,060
Jake would fall apart in a day or two.

643
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,840
Well, he'd have to be worn on my back.

644
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,760
Yeah, he's a big dog.

645
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,120
But the poodle fits easily on anyone's head.

646
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,980
All right, folks.

647
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,540
The time is now.

648
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,480
This would be a great time to remind you all the portions of the following broadcast may

649
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,140
be objectionable to some listeners.

650
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,660
WCSB advises listener discretion.

651
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,200
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not those of WCSB or Cleveland State University.

652
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,740
Or mine either.

653
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,340
Yeah.

654
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,360
Even if I say them, it's all just show.

655
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,260
That's right.

656
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,780
That's why I don't include any kind of disclaimers.

657
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,740
Oh, the views and opinions expressed are those of the podcast.

658
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,540
Participants are not.

659
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,640
No, they're not.

660
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,800
Not necessarily those of the participants either.

661
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,180
Not necessarily anyone's opinion.

662
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,720
And even if they were our opinion when we said them, they might not be for long.

663
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,740
Right.

664
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,280
We reserve the right to change our minds.

665
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,140
It is the sacred doctrine of erasability.

666
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,880
Sandy Beach.

667
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,280
Sacred doctrine of erasability.

668
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,900
I don't know how many times I've had to claim that one.

669
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,780
Erasability?

670
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,640
Yeah.

671
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,440
It was written into the first.

672
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,720
Okay.

673
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,560
A subgenius pamphlet.

674
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,720
The sacred doctrine of erasability.

675
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,700
Any subgenius can basically say, no, I did not say that.

676
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,020
I was not there.

677
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,460
It's freedom to lie, essentially.

678
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,200
Yeah.

679
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,460
And indemnifies ad hoc BS, which is all this is.

680
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:24,300
Right.

681
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:31,440
Is that a little girl calling my name?

682
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,460
Janet, is that you?

683
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,600
Or Dave?

684
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,220
No, it's no money, Mark.

685
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,880
Oh, it's a big hairy gay man with no eyebrows.

686
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,240
Hey, man, you don't knock until you've tried it.

687
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,840
No, it's more about the shaved eyebrows and the unusual taste.

688
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,800
See if any, yeah, I'd really like to open the lines up to some other callers here.

689
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,600
Okay, well, I can go now. I'll talk to you next time.

690
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,320
All right, thanks, Mark. I'll talk to you soon.

691
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,340
What a fellow.

692
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,580
So let's see if anyone else has taken the bait.

693
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,800
Well, I can talk to anyone if, you know, whatever. I'm sorry.

694
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:04,940
Sorry.

695
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,280
I have no value for the message.

696
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,160
I guess nobody's going to be able to call if you'd like to get a word in here.

697
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,720
Share your thoughts on, I don't know.

698
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,860
Is there a topic?

699
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,200
There, I don't know. Shall we pick a topic?

700
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:24,500
Do you think the lust for, you know, rumors about the economy is,

701
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,020
are things going to really get that bad or is what bad?

702
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,360
What is, what's going on?

703
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,600
Is that a thing?

704
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,680
The entire financial system.

705
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,300
As we know, it is really kind of coming unraveled.

706
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,820
A lot of banks are still appearing to be solvent right now, but they're not.

707
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,180
A lot of banks are actually insolvent right now, but the market hasn't realized it yet.

708
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,260
It'll be interesting to see what happens once that kind of thing starts picking up.

709
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,960
I can tell you that ordainments have gone down and I've been polishing my barrels.

710
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,260
I'm ready to get out there on the...

711
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,580
On the street corner.

712
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,440
You know, the world needs the subgenius gospel now more than ever, I'd say.

713
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,660
I think it would...

714
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,760
Well, that's not what I was going to be giving from the barrel.

715
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,140
Oh, no.

716
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:16,860
I think...

717
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:21,960
But, you know, somebody that buys a membership too, that'd be great.

718
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,980
Hello, you're on the air.

719
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,000
Brains.

720
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,620
Brains.

721
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,920
Someone with an appetite, I see.

722
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,420
It's going on in my teeth right now.

723
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,160
A healthy appetite.

724
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,280
Not much.

725
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,000
K3, how you been?

726
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,380
Good.

727
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,160
How are you guys?

728
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,560
We're all hanging in there.

729
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,100
So what's...

730
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,560
Licking cerebral cortex.

731
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,180
Protecting what's left of our brains.

732
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,040
I'm just seeing brains tonight.

733
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,940
Brain soup.

734
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,760
Brain pasta.

735
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,740
Brain pie.

736
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,880
No, MO does not only stand for method of operation, it stands for medulla oblongata.

737
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,020
Dude, they got the oblongata part right.

738
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,460
Has Bob Dobbs ever become a zombie?

739
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,180
Bob Dobbs is a zombie by now.

740
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,560
Is he?

741
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:04,780
Yeah.

742
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,060
Well, the church itself died and was resurrected as a zombie.

743
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,580
Well, it's more like a Frankenstein's monster.

744
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,420
It's not one dead body that just came back to life.

745
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,400
It's the parts of...

746
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,300
Kind of like the...

747
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:20,720
God's hundreds.

748
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,260
The Christian church is the body of Christ.

749
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,740
I don't have any dead religion.

750
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,320
Subgenius Church is the body of Bob.

751
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:26,980
Corpus Frankensteinus.

752
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,920
The body of Franken...

753
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,040
The overall body, the...

754
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,780
Yes, yes, Corpus Frankensteinus.

755
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,780
And Bob...

756
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,180
Bob went in the same sequence as Frankenstein.

757
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:43,040
There was Bob Dobbs, Bride of Bob, Son of Bob, Ghost of Bob, House of Bob.

758
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,260
Someone thought that the Son of Bob...

759
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,660
Abbott and Costello meet Bob was the last one.

760
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,960
And that was like...

761
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,760
That's when that spilled the end of the old school Universal Bob movies.

762
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,380
Well, Scooby-Doo was so itemized by Bob.

763
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,340
Bob has...

764
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,440
Well, that was when he came back.

765
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,480
That was during his comeback in the 80s.

766
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,380
Actually, after he came back to life a second time.

767
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:11,180
Bob's been extinguished like a flame so many times and yet keeps on returning.

768
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:11,700
It's...

769
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,580
He's...

770
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,320
He...

771
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,800
He...

772
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:21,000
He takes a licking and he keeps on something that rhymes with ticking.

773
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,080
Stinking.

774
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,220
Something like that.

775
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,760
He takes a licking and he keeps on stinking.

776
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,680
He gives a licking and he chokes his chicken.

777
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,780
Rather the world would have taken his lesson than the lesson of these...

778
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:34,780


779
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,400
types like...

780
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,620
Burnished Meatloaf.

781
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,760
And the other ones who are ranklessly ripping off everyone's savings and loans corporations.

782
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,340
Which don't exist anymore.

783
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,100
But I mean, you know what I'm saying.

784
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:47,740
Somehow.

785
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,760
Isn't it?

786
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,240
You know, it's...

787
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,700
I don't want to sound like a wobbly kid, but sometimes...

788
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,040
You know, that stuff is...

789
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,960
Is theft.

790
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,020
What stuff is theft?

791
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,800
Huh?

792
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,520
What stuff?

793
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,720
Yeah, but didn't Bob Dobbs sell...

794
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,380
Well, not property stuff, but...

795
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,420
Theft is theft.

796
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:04,680
Yeah.

797
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,020
Yeah, theft is theft, man.

798
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,120
Wasn't Bob selling like Viagra?

799
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,040
I thought he sold out.

800
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,100
No, you're thinking of Smiling Bob.

801
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,840
Or is that Ripoff Bob?

802
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,880
Yeah, that is Ripoff Bob.

803
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,400
That's another...

804
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,180
Yeah, another one of those...

805
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,920
Yeah, have you tried filing a suit about that?

806
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,580
I mean...

807
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,700
Yeah, I heard something about that.

808
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,200
On your show.

809
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,520
I thought you said the guy was in jail or something, or...

810
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,640
Yeah, yeah.

811
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,360
He got busted.

812
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,280
It's funny, though.

813
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,640
The company is still in business.

814
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,980
They had to clean up their act a little bit.

815
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,120
The owner is...

816
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,460
I don't know if he's actually behind bars yet, but he's on his way.

817
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,740
And they also threw his mom in prison or sentenced her to prison.

818
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,940
But since she was dying of cancer, she may not have had to go.

819
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,460
I haven't wickied that lately, so I'm not...

820
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,040
My revenge gland hasn't been that active lately.

821
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,700
So I don't care.

822
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,180
That's what happens when you rip off Bob.

823
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,580
Something horrible happens to your entire family forever.

824
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,640
They take it from everybody.

825
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,460
Everybody knows to risk Bob's wrath is to risk Bob's wrath.

826
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,000
Everybody knows somebody who has been screwed over by Bob.

827
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,040
And he's not a very merciful type of Allah, you know what I'm saying?

828
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,420
Well, but they asked for it.

829
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,560
They started it.

830
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,480
By trying to rip Bob off, right?

831
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,620
Well, no, but...

832
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,740
They imitate Bob.

833
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,060
Nobody's crazy enough to rip Bob off.

834
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,520
But there's certainly a lot of people who try to...

835
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,680
You know, come on like Bob and...

836
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,820
Use his shtick and so forth.

837
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,900
And, uh...

838
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,320
You know, they all end up on their heads.

839
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,060
What can I say?

840
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,120
Every one of them.

841
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,340
Did Bob Dobbs ever have a son?

842
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,960
You know, like son of Bob Dobbs?

843
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,500
Yeah.

844
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,580
Yeah, he has many sons.

845
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,500
We're all his children.

846
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,360
Sons of Bob.

847
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,800
He's the protector of an entire race of retarded manlings.

848
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,900
I don't know.

849
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,660
Perhaps you see him at the store.

850
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,340
The Barbie doll is based on Barbie Dobbs.

851
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,040
The Mardi Gras is?

852
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,780
The Mardi Gras is?

853
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,200
He has a special child named Bub.

854
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,820
And by special, I mean really special.

855
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,560
Yeah, he can't fly, if that's what you're thinking.

856
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,120
He can't do much of anything but smile and smoke.

857
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,380
You know those little jars in the basement?

858
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,700
He has no eyes or nose.

859
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,200
He just has a mouth and a spine.

860
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,240
He can't close his own zipper?

861
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,560
There's no zipper to close.

862
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,220
He's in a jar in Stang's basement along with those other little skulls.

863
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,760
He feeds them fish food every once in a while to pretend like he's doing something.

864
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,520
Well, they're still alive.

865
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,660
But brains don't eat fish food, Stang.

866
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,500
It means nothing to them.

867
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,800
It's just like you're dropping styrofoam dingleberries on their head.

868
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,940
No, no, it's not.

869
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,180
They're brine shrimp.

870
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,040
It's not cheap fish food.

871
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,900
It's really good.

872
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,200
You know, the kind of brine shrimp you get at the fancy pet stores.

873
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,420
I remember brine shrimp was the worst producer in rock and roll.

874
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,420
And you kept on bringing them to all those parties.

875
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,020
And you kept on puking in the punch.

876
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,040
And then...

877
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,180
No, man.

878
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,160
No, I'm not talking about him.

879
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,940
The former manager of the Rockers for Roche.

880
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,520
I'm talking about sea monkeys.

881
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,120
I'm talking about Artemia Salina.

882
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,420
The saltwater shrimp.

883
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,820
I thought that was the Argentine porn guy.

884
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,000
No, no, no.

885
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,940
Reverend Artemia Salina.

886
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,700
Sea monkeys, man.

887
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,500
What do you think sea monkeys are?

888
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:33,500


889
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,140
Oh, yeah, right.

890
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:45,280
The little happy business suited, you know, and rolling pin carrying families of microscopic creatures that you see advertisements for.

891
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,140
Yeah, but Artemia was the biggest ripoff ever.

892
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,180
I mean, it's funny when South Park made fun of it.

893
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,740
Sea man plus sea people equals society.

894
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,440
Biggest ripoff ever until the Church of the Subgenius came along.

895
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,920
I jest, I jest.

896
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,180
2G.

897
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,900
Oh, no, no.

898
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:10,980
Bob was proudly was voted fraud of the century in Time Magazine's online poll at the turn

899
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,600
of the century.

900
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,920
Yeah, but that was because we stuffed the ballot box.

901
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,000
No.

902
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,880
No, no, no.

903
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,300
Only proving, only proving how much he would deserve that award if that's how he won.

904
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,480
I set up a web program that put like 15,000 votes for Bob Dobbs in the system.

905
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:26,840
Right.

906
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:26,940
Yes.

907
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,660
That is important.

908
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,080
But they instantly recognized that those were happening and they discounted those.

909
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,160
Yeah.

910
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,020
So it was something that was a little bit too big of a deal for him.

911
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,540
It was the vote that was going to be the final vote.

912
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:39,840
It was Pope Phil Monte's manual final vote that tilted it away from his rival, Geraldo

913
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,240
Rivera.

914
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:47,340
And of course, let's not forget that we did stuff the ballot boxes with brains.

915
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,260
All of those individual brains in the basement made a lot of people pull the right lever

916
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:52,600
stain.

917
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:58,720
There's no denying that mind control helped a lot of people push that Dobbs button instead

918
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:58,940
of that other brain.

919
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,980
You're the one who stole my brain.

920
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:04,700
other baby you show me your ballot box and i'll stuff it with a lot more than just brains

921
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,380
and wasn't it reverend comrade stalin who said it's not whoever counts the ballot boxes

922
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,960
it's whoever blows the suckers up first

923
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:24,420
couldn't have said it better myself power comes from the stem of a pipe all right k3 um

939
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,180
welcome to the program sean penn and kate winslet

940
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:26,600
it's all connected man it sure is it's totally connected and you have to wait till i see all the

941
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:26,600


942
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:26,600


943
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,500
You can see the connections.

944
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,840
You and you alone.

945
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,360
That's what makes you special.

946
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,280
You know, Bernie, why haven't you given your dollars to Bob?

947
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,160
Since everybody's ganging up on Bernie,

948
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,800
I'd like to ask why he hasn't donated his pineal gland to the Aerospace Institute.

949
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,420
You were mentioning 1984 earlier.

950
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,000
I think the system we're in right now is soy and green.

951
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,560
Really?

952
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,280
So you think we're eating each other and not enjoying it?

953
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:56,960
Well, ask yourself.

954
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,580
You must have parents and grandparents.

955
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,700
Where in Barack Obama's stimulus plan is there room for hospitals and nursing homes for the elderly?

956
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,400
I think the teaching in barbecue culinary arts is going to take care of that problem.

957
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,000
I think there's going to be a lot of kids out there that are going to learn how to cook, Grandpa and Grandma.

958
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,840
In my culture, we used to just put them out on the ice when they'd get too old to follow.

959
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,800
But now we preserve them.

960
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,420
It's called temikin.

961
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,320
Yeah.

962
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,940
We use hickory smoke.

963
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,760
It's the old way.

964
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,720
What are you going to do with your grandma, Bernie?

965
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,660
She's already in the ground, unfortunately.

966
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,200
So you're saying not for long?

967
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,860
Because she's a communist and she's made of masonite.

968
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,880
Do you know that before the last Best Actor award that Sean Penn won,

969
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,780
that he endorsed Dennis Kucinich for the presidency on Fox News?

970
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,600
Then he won it that night.

971
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,880
I always enjoyed that story.

972
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,860
So do you think it's because he's Kucinich's supporter?

973
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,560
That's why he won?

974
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,220
Did Dennis Kucinich pull some strings to win this for Sean Penn?

975
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:06,300
If I could fill in the blanks there, what I was given is National Airwaves on the Lil' Ponty show

976
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,900
in between his endorsement and winning the Best Actor award to discuss my asking Kucinich,

977
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,380
who was then a two-time presidential candidate, to get that direct quote of Herman Goering out of the Senate record.

978
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,820
Well, that proves it.

979
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,460
Well, you're talking to a guy in the wrong house of Congress that you'd want to talk to a senator about that.

980
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,760
Well, I think we'll hear about that in a near future.

981
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,640
Thank you very much.

982
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,480
Bernie, you've been saying that for almost five years now.

983
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,720
I think we heard about it at the first press conference of Barack Obama.

984
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,200
I'm still waiting for the draft.

985
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,660
No, Bernie, he really didn't mention it.

986
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,820
You just thought he did.

987
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,520
Oh, I thought it was very obvious.

988
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,260
I'm sure you did.

989
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,920
Of course you did, Bernie.

990
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,980
And why did Obama say in the press conference that he got it?

991
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,120
You can see things that other people cannot see.

992
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:51,480
The first black man to ask the question at the press conference of our first so-called black president,

993
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,420
what was the question about?

994
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,520
Our first so-called black president?

995
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,260
What do you mean?

996
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,380
He's not black enough for you?

997
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,160
He's half Irish.

998
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,620
Well, so am I.

999
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,640
What have you got against the Irish, buddy?

1000
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,240
I'm sure he does.

1001
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,720
And Ireland has something against him for not admitting to it.

1002
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,200
Oh, God.

1003
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:07,880
Man.

1004
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,280
You know, if it wasn't for Bernie, we just wouldn't know what was going on in the world.

1005
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,300
Okay, let me end with this.

1006
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,940
What's the most important thing that happened this week that you didn't hear about?

1007
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,480
Well, I don't know because I didn't hear about it.

1008
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,700
Well, it was only broadcast for a short period of time.

1009
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,340
John Cohen Carey in the Middle East was there.

1010
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,240
He gave a message from Hamas, a note of some kind.

1011
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,100
Yep, yep.

1012
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,260
And you know why that's important?

1013
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,860
It was Valentine's Day.

1014
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,920
No, because everybody laughs.

1015
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,660
That's so funny because, you see, I'm a Dina Jad.

1016
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,100
I got, obviously, back to Hamas.

1017
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:46,000
So Hamas can say anything about the note to our first, again, Jewish president of the United States.

1018
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,060
So wait a second.

1019
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,180
Hey, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie.

1020
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,800
He said, Jack, I wish you had believed.

1021
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,560
Bernie, you're in.

1022
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,040
That was the text of the note.

1023
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,840
Bernie, there you go.

1024
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:59,440
You go again insulting the Irish by ignoring John Carey's Irish ancestry there.

1025
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,380
That's the whole point.

1026
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:00,820
He's not.

1027
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,960
But, again, Barack Obama, who's half Irish, said, obviously, he allowed that fraud to take place.

1028
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:07,640
Obviously.

1029
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,520
Thank you very much for the free speech.

1030
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,240
You know, Sean Penn, I saw that movie Milk, and I would have to recommend that.

1031
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,240
It's really good.

1032
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,540
I'm interested, but I'm lactose intolerant.

1033
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:22,980
I can't.

1034
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,960
Is that what they call homophobic?

1035
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,120
It's bad. It's heart-rending.

1036
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:36,140
But they did an amazing job of recreating the early Castro Street scene.

1037
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,000
I remember it well myself.

1038
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,980
I used to go up there to Twin Peaks every evening and look for boyfriends.

1039
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,540
Back to your more freewheeling days.

1040
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:51,140
No, in fact, I lived near Castro Street myself, and it was quite a nice neighborhood.

1041
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,360
But we had to beat up some old Oriental ladies.

1042
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,860
And they were the ones for stealing our change at the laundromat.

1043
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,620
They thought it was theirs, and they were wrong.

1044
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,960
And we actually got into a physical.

1045
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,000
Me and three or four biker friends of mine.

1046
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,300
You know, they've reversed the law since then.

1047
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,040
Now, it's only legal for old people to beat up young people.

1048
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,700
Thank God.

1049
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:20,980
I can go through the rest of my life knowing that I've always been able to beat somebody else up.

1050
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:21,780
Good evening.

1051
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,980
Without worrying about it.

1052
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,300
Hey, gentlemen, did you hear?

1053
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:24,680
What?

1054
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,720
Won the best short film tonight.

1055
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,860
I thought it was very interesting.

1056
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,400
Awake, Arise, I mean.

1057
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:29,920
Toyland.

1058
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,140
Toyland?

1059
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,140
Toyland.

1060
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:32,940
Best short film?

1061
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,320
Would that be...

1062
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,060
An anti-gay film.

1063
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,820
It was called Soy.

1064
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,500
Even Dwarves started out small.

1065
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
It was a what?

1066
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:40,840
Dwarves?

1067
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,720
Well, he was talking about short films.

1068
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,440
Well, the short film tonight, it was an anti-gay film.

1069
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,100
It was called Soy.

1070
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,700
I thought it was just really ironic.

1071
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,100
I don't know if anybody picked that up.

1072
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,000
It was an anti-gay film?

1073
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,620
Yeah, I don't know if you heard that.

1074
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,840
I thought it was kind of interesting.

1075
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,220
It was interesting that Milk might have won the best film,

1076
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,720
and Soy won the best short film.

1077
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:00,800
I thought it was kind of interesting.

1078
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,100
I thought it was short in running time.

1079
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,060
It was very short.

1080
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,620
Okay, I was confused.

1081
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,500
It was so short that the director wasn't even there.

1082
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,420
It was that short.

1083
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,460
I'm a little sensitive about my height.

1084
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,060
And then, guys, what do you think of maybe we need to create

1085
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,580
some kind of new Godzilla of our day,

1086
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,060
kind of like the Baba Ganoush,

1087
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,660
and he could take out the hummus.

1088
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,420
What do you think of something like that?

1089
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,640
You're talking about fusing cuisines and reptiles?

1090
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,820
Well, just all that could have different names.

1091
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,120
Yeah, most definitely.

1092
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,980
The grape-leaf monster.

1093
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,440
You can have, like, the Dolmades,

1094
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,640
the Dolmades reptiles,

1095
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,820
or a ceratops type thing

1096
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,300
that would, like, breathe fire

1097
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,160
if it had too much garlic in it and stuff.

1098
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,760
I mean, there was the early clover field monster.

1099
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,540
You know, the lava plants,

1100
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,100
you know, the man-eating lava plants

1101
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,840
and stuff like that.

1102
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,680
I think something like that would be just...

1103
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,860
It would take on a whole different...

1104
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,340
Pizza bread flying saucers, man.

1105
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,660
What could be more stupid?

1106
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,080
Logical, I mean.

1107
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,320
What could be more logical?

1108
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,300
We could kind of make the new...

1109
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,700
We need to make a new Plan 9 from outer space.

1110
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,560
So we really do.

1111
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,780
And just use...

1112
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,340
You know, you should be writing for sitcoms in Hollywood.

1113
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,880
You know, it's...

1114
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,360
I don't know.

1115
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,400
You know what, Reverend?

1116
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,640
I don't know about the sitcom scene, though, man.

1117
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,180
I don't know.

1118
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,200
I think there should just be one sitcom.

1119
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,360
And just bring, like, all the characters together.

1120
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,680
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1121
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,580
You don't partake in that already.

1122
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:33,940
Has that been done?

1123
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:37,240
How about we do something called The Last Sitcom?

1124
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:37,940
No, no, no.

1125
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,340
No partaking in sitcoms.

1126
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,760
It's called God, the Devil, and Bob.

1127
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,200
I like that.

1128
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,060
That is a certain smell to it.

1129
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,500
It was so bad.

1130
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,180
Oh, you already did it?

1131
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:50,760
Yeah.

1132
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,000
How come I don't ever see Bob on the God, the Devil, and Bob game?

1133
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,740
I'm really disappointed.

1134
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,040
Mm-hmm.

1135
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,860
Well, we're all disappointed.

1136
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,560
Has Bob ever been on the Golf Channel?

1137
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,740
The Golf Channel?

1138
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,520
Yeah.

1139
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,540
Oh, it's the Golf Channel.

1140
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:09,040
The whole Arnold Palmer, you know, conspiracy.

1141
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,540
Well, that was a long time ago.

1142
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,580
That's the last revival.

1143
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,640
I went to a revival in San Francisco.

1144
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,100
I know we were just talking about that.

1145
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,960
I went to one of the divivals there.

1146
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,480
Was that at the Old Stone?

1147
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,760
There was a divival at the Stone, at which...

1148
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,700
It was like in the 80s, early 80s?

1149
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,080
1985.

1150
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,660
That's when I was there at that.

1151
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,420
I'm sorry.

1152
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:34,760
The Stone on Gary, is it?

1153
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:35,840
Oh, that's right.

1154
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,520
We managed to evoke Bob as a...

1155
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,780
We brought him back from the dead with a special transmogrifier video thing,

1156
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,180
and there was like this fuzzy picture of Bob,

1157
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,960
or what might as well have been a shitty rubber Bob mask.

1158
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,080
Pardon my language there.

1159
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,180
Well, I remember, because I had brought in...

1160
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,580
I had brought in like about 10 cans of like Blatts with me,

1161
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,980
and I was in the bathroom, in the men's room.

1162
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,880
I was like giving them out to people,

1163
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,920
and then there was an employee there,

1164
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,240
but he kind of just kind of let me slide.

1165
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,160
He didn't, you know...

1166
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,980
He says, I'm not a Blatts drinker.

1167
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,040
I do work here.

1168
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,860
You know, it was kind of fun.

1169
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,840
And I remember all the watches.

1170
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,940
Was that like a...

1171
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,020
Was that a ritual that they did at all the vivals,

1172
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,480
where everybody put their wristwatches in the...

1173
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,180
Yeah, we used to smash the watches.

1174
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,180


1175
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,700
We used to smash the watches without letting them take the watch off,

1176
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,400
but eventually the club owners made us switch over to the version you saw,

1177
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,080
where we'd remove the watch and then smash it.

1178
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:36,920
That was beautiful.

1179
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,120
There were a lot of lawsuits in those days, weren't there?

1180
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,300
Well, not brought on by the people whose hands were smashed.

1181
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,440
No, they would always thank us.

1182
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,380
They'd try to prevent the lawsuits,

1183
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,540
but it was, you know, insurance.

1184
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,680
You know how lawyers are.

1185
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,040
I was actually wearing my grandfather's Rolex that night.

1186
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,560
It was a...

1187
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,180
You know, but I enjoy it.

1188
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,220
I enjoyed the sound that it made when it got smashed.

1189
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,120
It sounded extremely cheap.

1190
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,580
I loved it.

1191
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:05,640
Is that a testification to my first revival,

1192
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,580
when Stang started smashing a clock,

1193
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,800
and he could smell the patchouli in the air.

1194
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,440
There were naked women walking around,

1195
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,480
offering themselves freely to anybody they saw.

1196
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,020
There was some sort of punch, some Kool-Aid or something,

1197
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,100
that everybody was being entreated to drink,

1198
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,760
although there were already some casualties.

1199
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,840
Yeah, we can only do that at X-Day.

1200
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,500
Hey, those women were just the roadies, you know?

1201
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,120
I remember my first X-Day way back in 98,

1202
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,240
and I remember Stang smashing his watch,

1203
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,600
and it wasn't a cheap watch either.

1204
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,300
It was actually a pretty nice one that someone else had given him.

1205
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,060
That was not...

1206
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,800
That moment was quite spontaneous.

1207
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,300
I remember thinking to myself,

1208
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,720
I've got to prove that I really believe.

1209
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,260
And it was a 50-buck watch.

1210
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,000
The nice thing about it was...

1211
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,340
It used to be on the conductor's hand.

1212
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,700
...that when I smashed it on the pulpit,

1213
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,100
a big piece of it flew up into the air

1214
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:09,240
and fell right in front of one of the cameras that was pointing at us.

1215
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,140
So you've got this great little foreground watch smash object.

1216
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,920
It was the kind of thing that you would add in with Final Cut Pro nowadays,

1217
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,420
but it actually just happened.

1218
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,580
Hey, why don't we get Cleveland back on the map

1219
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,340
and have, like, the biggest watch smashing event

1220
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,640
in the history of the world in Bob's name?

1221
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,620
Well, to tell the truth, that watch smashing thing

1222
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:37,440
was invented by former subgenius Pastor Buck Naked,

1223
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,440
and I feel kind of bad about using his gag too much

1224
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,000
because he hates us now.

1225
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,420
A few years ago, actually, Bucky did that at the Beachland.

1226
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,960
Had to do the watch smashing.

1227
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,960
Other subgeniuses will occasionally do that,

1228
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:57,480
and Bucky almost made the same mistake I did one time,

1229
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:03,600
which was to put the watch on a cinder block at the edge of the stage

1230
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,280
and then smash the whole thing with a sledgehammer.

1231
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:12,360
The problem is there are human beings and subgeniuses standing right in front of it,

1232
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,380
and the giant pieces of cinder block can fall and break somebody's skull.

1233
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,220
Already broken skull.

1234
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:20,980
There's a little nipple in your eye.

1235
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,420
A question for Reverend Stang.

1236
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,280
How did you find yourself here in Cleveland from Texas?

1237
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,920
The most beautiful woman in the world lived in Cleveland.

1238
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,020
Charlie Rich?

1239
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,940
I came here.

1240
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,980
Also, it's closer to the launch pads out in Sherman.

1241
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:43,400
Right, I thought it was a fluke in the trans migration device or whatever it was.

1242
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:48,720
Hey, no, really, it was because of WCSB, the greatest station in the world.

1243
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,420
Right.

1244
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:57,360
And my good friends that were doing brain rot radio theater and ESO swamp radio.

1245
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,800
And the most beautiful girl in the world.

1246
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,020
When will the next revival be?

1247
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,100
There are several good reasons.

1248
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,740
Also, I wanted to know what snow looks like.

1249
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,460
When will the next revival be, Reverend?

1250
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,400
In my pants and as soon as this show ends, baby.

1251
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:19,400
The Reverend Ivan Stang will be delivering his next revival.

1252
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:19,400


1253
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,180
I'm going to have to get a few sermons in a pair of diapers.

1254
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:29,020
Actually, we just finished one at Atwood Lodge in Delroy, Ohio, during Winter Star.

1255
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,240
That went beautifully.

1256
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,480
And you'll be hearing it on the hour slack.

1257
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:38,920
We have one coming up in Portland later in the year.

1258
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,420
Of course, there's next day and Starwood and there was another one, but I can't remember.

1259
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,880
And for more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1260
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,920
I want you to do whatever you want.

1262
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:00,180
Or you can write to us for free information at, got that pencil ready?

1263
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:03,820
Post Office Box 181-417.

1264
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:12,720
That's Box 181-417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1265
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,580
Here in the US of A.

1266
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,200
And we welcome all the new stations that are now playing the show.

1267
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,860
Friends, praise God.

1268
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,900
And happy new month and year.

1269
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,300
Yes, yes, yes.
