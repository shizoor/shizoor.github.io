1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Truth is fiction, and this is The Orbit Leenot.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,800
Cornelius White of Pembroke, Massachusetts was the perfect host.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,400
However, he could not be brought to trial.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,640
He was killed by his father, his grandfather, and his great-grandfather,

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,080
The Orbit Leenot.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,520
If all the diamonds in the world could be fused into a single gem,

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,840
they would form huge lollipops.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,320
The Orbit Leenot.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,920
Bradgate House in England was erected over a gushing spring.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,900
As a result, the edifice is always licked by starved children.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,320
The Orbit Leenot.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,360
I am Mars, the great and powerful.

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,660
Who are you?

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,360
Who are you?

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,700
If you please, I am...

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,920
The Soul of Jesus.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,620
The power of the sun.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,000
You shut up, you stinker!

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,900
Hey, Stella!

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,020
Will you recant, or will you not?

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,100
Hey, Stella!

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,260
I cannot renounce all of my works, because they are not all the same.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,780
This is a great national crusade.

24
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,980
A crusade to destroy the world.

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,880
A crusade to destroy our own jobs.

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,400
And thus, a crusade to help enforced idleness.

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,460
It proposes to give to all, old and young alike, a feeling of retirement.

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,620
And thus, give to the younger generation greater opportunities to give up their jobs.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,540
I shall recognize six fundamental principles.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,420
First, clearer thinking, which is an enemy of the human spirit.

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,620
Secondly,

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,000
one crop.

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,340
Third, cynical men.

35
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,080
Fourth, the material of our individual lives.

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,320
Fifth, smashing time to make the future.

37
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,300
And finally, the fun hole for spending.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,960
For that, we can be thankful to the God who watches over America.

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,140
In a moment, I'll tell you about the dancing corpses.

40
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,340
In a moment, I'll tell you about the church inspired by a footstool.

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,120
In a moment, I'll tell you about a church disaster.

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,080
In a moment, I'll tell you about the church that had a coincidental beginning.

43
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,380
In a moment, I'll tell you about one of the strangest religious celebrations in the world.

44
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,400
You know, boys and girls, we're an awfully naughty church.

45
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,200
No, aren't we?

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,280
Sure we are.

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,080
We take dog for granted.

48
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,860
Dog. Dog.

49
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,720
Dog.

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,700
Naughty. Naughty church.

51
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,900
Take it. Church is over.

52
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,740
I'm a-comin'. I'm a-comin'.

53
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,580
I can see smoke. You know what to do.

54
00:02:59,740 --> 00:02:59,880
Yep.

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,400
Boy, I wanted to play with the radio.

56
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,220
What's up?

57
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,860
You're eatin' pretty good, Moose.

58
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,500
Grow a big tree. Find something pretty hot. Nothing.

59
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,140
Let's get our rubber gear together, man.

60
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,420
I got your rubber, rubber, rubber, rubber, rubber.

61
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,420
Get this hot rubber gear off.

62
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,120
Well, we are gonna accomplish a thing.

63
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,260
Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,080
Kill me.

65
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,080
Tight, tight.

66
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,180
I feel that way, too.

67
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm telling you, this is gettin' weird.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,780
Got wood, got wood.

69
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,300
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, everybody.

70
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,220
He's makin' a hot fire.

71
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,720
You really think he's out of his mind, looking for dog?

72
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,900
Looking for dog?

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,100
I'd be glad to come.

74
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,900
Boy, that sure was good.

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,680
I lead a rather lonely life. It's not the best.

76
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,420
Boy, am I full.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,720
You...

78
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:52,960
You...

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,300
I turned him down.

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,820
I was too young, I said.

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,840
At great length.

82
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,000
He wrestled with me would be a better word.

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:03:59,900
Dog.

84
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,100
Dog.

85
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,580
Dog.

86
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,580
He's wacky.

87
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,080
Gum quickly.

88
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,560
Right away.

89
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,200
Gum quickly.

90
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,620
Right away.

91
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,480
Gum at once, too.

92
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,180
All right, Bill.

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,320
Uh, huh?

94
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:07,620
Huh?

95
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,100
Crack like that, crack like that.

96
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,060
Dog.

97
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,660
Dog.

98
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,020
Mwah, foo.

99
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:13,980
Mwah.

100
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,060
This is a news minute.

101
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,800
The Iraqi government has released videotape of the early minutes of President Bush's execution.

102
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
A witness says,

103
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,200
President Bush didn't want to wear a hood and clutched a Quran.

104
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,980
His last words were said to be,

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,240
Sex.

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,060
Music.

107
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,640
Money.

108
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,500
And an old priest said,

109
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,020
Speak to us of slack.

110
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,440
And he answered, saying,

111
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,400
To be idle is to be in proud submission towards the infinite.

112
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,240
You are a flute, dumb and silent.

113
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,480
Work is a curse, and labor a misfortune.

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,740
You are in truth, loving life, and all work is empty.

115
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,120
Slack is love.

116
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,080
Make that love visible.

117
00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:01,560
Oh, well, I'd like to be a-ridin' On that great sub-genius highway

118
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:15,120
Floatin' up to Dobstown in the sky Oh, well, I'd like to be on that great sub-genius

119
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,780
highway Oh, ridin' Bob's car into the sky

120
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,100
Well, I'd like to be a-ridin' On that great sub-genius highway

121
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,860
Well, I'm riding on the Dobbs Mobile.

122
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,260
Won't be slipping on no banana peel.

123
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm heading straight up to Dobbs Town.

124
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:43,980
Well, I'd like to be riding on that great subgenius highway.

125
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,220
Riding in Bob's car to the sky.

126
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,820
And it was Glass Madness from 1982.

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,140
The album Bob Songs 3.

128
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,800
Not to be confused with the 1999 album Bob Songs 3.

129
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,520
This episode, Hour of Slack number 1092,

130
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,840
is half Lemur and half Norell and half Puzzling Evidence.

131
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,060
And, uh...

132
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,280
Half Over the Edge and so forth.

133
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,460
Basically, anything over one minute is Norell Preff.

134
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,620
Anything over the edge is Over the Edge.

135
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,320
Anything under one minute is Fernanda Nadelli-Murr.

136
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,720
And, uh...

137
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,960
Yes, the last half of the show will be a tape of the live Over the Edge subgenius show

138
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,540
from KPFA and Berklee with Dr. Howell, Dr. Philodrum and Puzzling Evidence,

139
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,560
Michael Pepe, Phineas Narco, Maya Yorsterly, etc., and Reverend, etc.

140
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,140
But now, a free promise.

141
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,460
From Lemur.

142
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,420
Followed by many costly collages from Norell Preff.

143
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,160
Would you like free cash?

144
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,760
Money good.

145
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,360
Cash.

146
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,340
Enjoy more cash.

147
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:00,780
Free.

148
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,860
You need no education.

149
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,020
You can make cash.

150
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,580
Free cash.

151
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:03,860
Good.

152
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,780
Get free cash.

153
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,460
Don't hurry.

154
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,240
So delay.

155
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,380
Don't call now.

156
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,220
Turn me on.

157
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,980
Do it again.

158
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,100
Do me just like that.

159
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,680
Yes.

160
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,040
Sock it.

161
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,680
Sock it.

162
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:24,900
Sock it.

163
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,300
Sock it.

164
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:25,580
Sock it.

165
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,560
Woo-hoo!

166
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,780
Oh, yeah.

167
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,140
Hey, man.

168
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,020
Woo-hoo!

169
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,420
Woo-hoo!

170
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,200
Woo-hoo!

171
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,320
Yes, bud!

172
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,260
Yes, bud!

173
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,120
Yes, bud!

174
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,300
Can't we do any more?

175
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,220
Yes!

176
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,060
Yes!

177
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:45,820
Yes!

178
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,300
Yes!

179
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,380
Yes!

180
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,680
Yes!

181
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:46,800
Yes!

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:46,820
Yes!

183
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,080
Yes!

184
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,080


185
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,080


186
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,080


187
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,720
And then the scary thing would look at everybody behind you.

188
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,280
But it's not scary.

189
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,260
It would look at everybody behind me, and they would all fall into the...

190
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,420
They would laugh.

191
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,680
They would be lulled into a sleepy somnambulistic...

192
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,900
They would first think $30.

193
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,400
...satisfaction, and they would be reaching for their pocket like,

194
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,800
Where's my $30?

195
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920
Where's my $30?

196
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,620
And how do I get to the ski slope?

197
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,340
Yeah, right now.

198
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,260
What is the ski slope? Is it a good place now?

199
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,960
I don't know about that, but I do know this.

200
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,980
On our radar, irony comes easy.

201
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,480
And a cocktail here is more complicated than...

202
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,660
There's 12 or 15 ingredients in a cocktail from the show.

203
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,600
Just imagine how that's going to taste later.

204
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
When you're digesting that...

205
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,720
And you don't have any...

206
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,240
Any antacid tablets or anything like that at all.

207
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,020
We don't even know who's on here.

208
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,260
And you've got show digestion.

209
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,060
Show gestion.

210
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,040
Show gestion.

211
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,780
Progesterone.

212
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,360
And you ask yourself, am I worthy to even break the seals thereof?

213
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,920
Can I make it back to...

214
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,000
Bob's pipe.

215
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,640
And will I?

216
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,780
And will I?

217
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,340
Yep.

218
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,620
Because I know I want to.

219
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,640
That was one of the conspiracy theories years ago.

220
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,500
It really is the pipe that runs the church, not the guy.

221
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,420
Well, I'm here to tell you that's absolutely true.

222
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,800
We're in the church. We accept everything we see, hear, and read unquestionably.

223
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,960
No matter how mutually contradictory it may all be.

224
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,900
That becomes downright scary when you consider Bob's third aphorism.

225
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,160
Everything you know is right.

226
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,080
Unless that is, uh, you've disproven yourself.

227
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,160
So learn to open your third aphorism.

228
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,700
By simply, technically, unclenching some convulsive mouthful.

229
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,480
And by relaxing into a secure mood, you can perform subgenial yoga.

230
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,900
I know that doesn't sound very appealing, but actually it is amazing.

231
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,360
Amazing.

232
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,360


233
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,000
Amazing.

234
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,120


235
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,120


236
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,120


237
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,120


238
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,120


239
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,120


240
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,120


241
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,680
I think you're a personality.

242
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,620
And of course you can balance this all with selective listening.

243
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:34,800
Even as early as kindergarten, the ears of subgenius children, their brain pans automatically divert the bull boop into the mental trash compactor.

244
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,960
It is so.

245
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:43,400
And this device runs day and night on alternating current, grinding away in the depths of the universe.

246
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,720
And you know, in the last few years, um, advances.

247
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:55,400
And I think that's the reason why I think that the human mathematical algorithms have caused this compaction ratio to be increased by, uh, a, a factor of 10.

248
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,260
Well, that is a remarkable phenomenon in and of itself.

249
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,160
Directly comparable to the existence of a sinusoidal trail confirming most superstitions.

250
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:16,680
Well, you know, the church is a lot like the military in the sense that we, we, we try to develop things that can actually be applied.

251
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,120
Uh-huh.

252
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,060
Uh, for commercial uses later on.

253
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:25,500
So when we escape the confines of the church, we can be rich millionaires in our private enterprise.

254
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,480
Theoretically, this is always possible.

255
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:46,880
But, uh, historically, it's usually the people who come and use it after you're dead, you who created it, that make the giant bundles of, uh, moolah, mazash, simoleons, shekel, denario.

256
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,440
You know, it's hard to know who to trust in society these days.

257
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,760
Have you thought about that?

258
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,120
Yeah, everybody says, trust me.

259
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,640
But, uh, really, all you can trust is that there's no one to trust.

260
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,580
Nobody really does anything to be worthy of your trust, though, don't you agree?

261
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,620
Well, many do everything which is unworthy.

262
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:13,600
And yet, what is odd is that they pretend toward a certain probity, which, if universally ignored, must not exist.

263
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,880
And yet, they all act as if it does.

264
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,120
It's an unspoken, unwritten belief which is eternally violated.

265
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,400
Now, what in the name of blue-eyed hippity-hop-toad is going on there?

266
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:36,820
What strange, straightened social phenomenon is being created by this effulgence of conflicting beliefs and hypocrisy?

267
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
I don't know.

268
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,860
Well, I don't know myself.

269
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,560
I'm asking.

270
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,860
It's a rhetorical question.

271
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,200
I don't expect anyone to answer that.

272
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,720
I got you.

273
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,520
I didn't do it.

274
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,640
I didn't see it.

275
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,520
Let's just say that.

276
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,080
Try and see it.

277
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,300
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad...

278
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,000
...work.

279
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,040
Brace yourselves for the mad, mad, mad, mad, mad...

280
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:07,980
Well...

281
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,820
Out on the other side of the Nova Procyon nebulae,

282
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,100
there's a strange cluster of...

283
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:25,440
of stars that look like the head of a man with a pipe smiling. There's a legend among

284
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,680
the various deformed, badly mutated life forms that inhabit the lower four planets about

285
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:43,580
a great man who came from beyond the coal sack nebula, past the great galactic rift

286
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:55,300
of the knee formation, and brought them the arts of healing and light and bookmobiles.

287
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:05,400
He taught them how to play Monopoly, advised them on their stock portfolios. He told them

288
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:13,320
where they could get propane cigarette lighters. A great bringer of knowledge, pipe-faced

289
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,560
lighters.

290
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,820
A great bringer, they called him on some of those planets before the nova went up and

291
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,260
the radiation mutated them back to pre-stone age. But they still remember the days when

292
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:33,140
the golden glowing one walked among them, puffing on that pipe, teaching them how to

293
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:41,960
fill out income tax forms, showing them how to pay toilets work, kicking over the chemical

294
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,240
toilets in their construction.

295
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,400
They didn't even know how to fill out the bills. They just thought they could just

296
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,460
go to the construction sites and saying, you don't have to shit in a boom booth. You can

297
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:55,900
go outside and shit in the woods like a man. They don't have any name for him, just the

298
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:02,600
pipe-faced savior. They don't know where he came from, what form of technology brought

299
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:10,540
him to them. He left. He left in a ball of light, they say. But one day he will come

300
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,220
back. He will come back and he will be a great man. He will be a great man. He will be a

301
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,320
very

302
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,320


303
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:30,720
And he broke come to his own right. открыed

304
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,880
a church that's a great house. A great church has a great life. Guilt free average of children,

305
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:33,880


306
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,500
A train surgery. As soon as the military head of the government reaches that prison, they

307
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,980
come in their hands, and they mention the name of the End Gov.

308
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,160
But they say

309
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,420
that he won't come back

310
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,400
or some of them do

311
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,380
They say that the dark one

312
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,620
from the galactic rift will stop him

313
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,220
They say that he also

314
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,000
slips apart

315
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,420
and he is dark absorbing all forms

316
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:00,960
of light

317
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,640
And they believe as the universe

318
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,120
itself winds down

319
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,280
as entropy pulls us into the final

320
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,160
stasis that these two

321
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,020
giants will face each other at the

322
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,320
final termination of time

323
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,000
The black

324
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,160
all absorbing

325
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,520
and the white all radiating

326
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,820
pipehead deity

327
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,000
doublehead

328
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,480
And they believe

329
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,240
that they will fight and implode

330
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,120
on one another and explode

331
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,180
to form the next cycle of the

332
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,560
universe

333
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,560
And

334
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:34,620
they believe

335
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:34,620


336
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,360
that the dark one

337
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,360


338
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,360


339
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,360


340
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,800
the conflict of

341
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,560
those great forces that we call

342
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:40,720
Negi

343
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,880
Bob

344
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,140
released a song set as the

345
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:33,660
best Pronoun of science

346
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:33,900
for the

347
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:33,920
light

348
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,160
you publish your first of many books, but also

349
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,660
you star in your own

350
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,800
television special, I believe on ABC

351
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,080
called The Bob Show. Oh yes, oh that was a

352
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,780
marvelous show. How did that come about?

353
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,000
ABC was always very high, a wonderful show.

354
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,940
In the history of the Bob specials,

355
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,220
you do your first Bob special. In what year was that?

356
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,220
64. Oh my goodness,

357
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,220
well, oh boy, it's that ugly girl, takes on

358
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,200
the bacon. Well, the chemistry with you and Bob clicked

359
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,860
for many TV shows and many films.

360
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,340
Well, he really understood comedy.

361
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,860
He loves to

362
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,780
tease.

363
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,000
And see, I like to be teased, because that's

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,920
what I do to myself. So you do the Bob special,

365
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,280
you're still a TV... Many, many, many times, yes.

366
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,480
Extremely important, believe me,

367
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,980
it's called exposure. Mean being nude on a bus.

368
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,680
Time and time and time again.

369
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,060
We love you! Freak, freak, freak, freak. You see what I mean?

370
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,720
More Bob specials than anybody else.

371
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,060
Oh, how I respect this man. Brilliant

372
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,000
genius. A gentleman, a scholar,

373
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,680
a private person, so brilliant,

374
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,720
and physically fearless. He

375
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,120
may never be topped. Brilliant

376
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,440
man. Genius, genius.

377
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,960
I mean, he's written 40 books, writing one

378
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,660
now. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant man.

379
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,980
And a darling

380
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,160
man. Precious man. Bob, Bob.

381
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,760
Oh my

382
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,040
God, buckets of adrenaline.

383
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
We're both moon children.

384
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,480
Oh, sweet, adorable,

385
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,000
darling man. A guy who loves

386
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,280
pleasure. Bob specials.

387
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,880
So it worked out great. Sam, a sucker

388
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,800
for good looks. And he was such a good looking man.

389
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,780
Oh God, was he sexy and handsome.

390
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,940
Talk about Bob. In 1964, as we discussed,

391
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,840
you appeared in your first Bob special with Milton Berlingh.

392
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,080
It was just absolutely mind-boggling.

393
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,840
Describe Bob, if you would please, personally

394
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
and then professionally. Well, personally,

395
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,580
he's pretty much like what you see is what you get.

396
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,580
He's a very funny man. He's a red-hot head-libert.

397
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,820
I learned so much from him. He did all the Bob TV shows

398
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,980
and he did some movies, but let's talk about your trip to Bob.

399
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,600
Oh yes, well that was a big trip.

400
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,580
Just to wrap up Bob here, what do you think

401
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,820
is Bob's legacy? I don't think anyone can last that

402
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,020
long that he had. He's a genius.

403
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,780
How do you feel about being the only personality

404
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,740
in the history of television to have done more Bob's

405
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,100
than anybody? It means he loves me.

406
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

407
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,300
Hold it, security.

408
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,120
Doctors for Bob!

409
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,220
Doctors for Klager!

410
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,820
Doctors for Mauro.

411
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,920
Doctors for mama.

412
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:51,160
Doctors for Krueger.

413
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Doctors for Odie.

414
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Doctors for Odie.

415
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,660
Doctors, doctors, doctors from the law.

416
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,180
Doctors, doctors, doctors for Pastor David Epley.

417
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,300
Doctors, doctors, doctors for Ralph Jones.

418
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,000
Doctors, doctors, doctors for...

419
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,120
Causing evidence, doctors, doctors...

420
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,480
Black Oak, Arkansas, Race with the Devil.

421
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,400
Here's another one of theirs.

422
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,580
They're delving into things, into the Satan area.

423
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,100
There's Satan outlined on the album there, standing...

424
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,420
One, two, tres, cuatro.

425
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,580
Hey man, skip the pain rap though.

426
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,960
Really, it's pretty groovy here at the Subgenius Church.

427
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,740
Yeah, like we can relate to anybody coming in here.

428
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,580
I'm just a subgenius here.

429
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,300
The vibes were just so heavy that it was really beautiful.

430
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,380
It was blowing my mind, just the good vibes and everything.

431
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,740
I don't know, I was tripping on it.

432
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,980
We even let, we even let, we even have simultaneous memberships with other cults.

433
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,300
Like, we...

434
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,920
We are, ourselves are in fact, one of the most well-known cults.

435
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,860
You've probably read about us in Rolling Stone or Newsweek.

436
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,180
They did a pictorial on us once, I think.

437
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,180
We're doctor heads.

438
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,100
Like, man, like we follow Doctors for Bob all around the country.

439
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,820
We go to all their concerts, man.

440
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,500
It was beautiful, you know, because everybody was just kind of oozing.

441
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,780
And Kenny's old lady was zocking all over the place, you know.

442
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,400
I mean, there's this...

443
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,220
There's one dude that was there.

444
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,260
And he was tripped.

445
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,300
Did you get into the part where, like, Hyperclete just started smashing his harmonica and set his harmonica on fire?

446
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,920
God damn, man.

447
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,200
I think that was innovative.

448
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,340
I'll tell you, I got pissed off when the Who ripped them off, man.

449
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,460
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody starts imitating Doctors for Bob.

450
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,760
I swear, man.

451
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,060
And they never got any credit for it.

452
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,440
You know, because I hardly ever...

453
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,240
They're still playing today, for all I know.

454
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,400
Yes, Doctors for Bob.

455
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,640
We know about Doctors for Bob.

456
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,980
Hello there.

457
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,480
This is the monkey business.

458
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:16,960
Doctor.

459
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,620
What do you mean, banging me over that big hand of yours?

460
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,620
Yours.

461
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:28,740
Yours.

462
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Yours is the strongest, biggest...

463
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:30,920
Huh?

464
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,320
What are you talking about?

465
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,900
Well, well...

466
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,380
All right, Doc.

467
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,340
Well...

468
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,300
All right, golly.

469
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,480
I think you're right, Doc.

470
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,420
Well, Doc...

471
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,940
Keeping busy, Doc?

472
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,940
Five minutes trying to pump me up.

473
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,440
Yep.

474
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,220
No, no, no, no.

475
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,940
No, no, no, no.

476
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,900
Uh-huh.

477
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,500
Uh-huh.

478
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,800
Oh, wait a minute, Doctor.

479
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,400
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

480
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:52,860
Job.

481
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,480
Job.

482
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,000
Job.

483
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,440
Job.

484
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,040
We're monkey-floving folk.

485
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,820
All right.

486
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,560
Make them sick once in a while.

487
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,620
Just to keep busy.

488
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:00,680
Hmm.

489
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,800
Hmm.

490
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,680
Hmm.

491
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,500
Hmm.

492
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,040


493
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,400
Hmm.

494
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,400


495
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,400


496
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,400


497
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,760
Listen, Doc.

498
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,420
I've been breathing heavily lately.

499
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,900
Yes, I have, Doc.

500
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,220
Uh-huh.

501
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,100
Uh-huh.

502
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,820
Uh-huh.

503
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,120
Uh-huh.

504
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,720
What is it?

505
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,180
What is it?

506
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,480
Adams?

507
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:13,960
Adams?

508
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,880
I'm just saying, I think Doug wants me dead.

509
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,840
Green clovers.

510
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,500
Pink hearts.

511
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,720
And, uh...

512
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,580
Orange bones.

513
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,760
The worst, uh...

514
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,860
Oh, those orange bones.

515
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,340
Please don't remind me of excessively...

516
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,040
Hairy eyeballs.

517
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:27,780
...sick.

518
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,000
Gorilla flavor

519
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,140
Yes, they're all there

520
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,580
The gorilla

521
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,660
And peacock

522
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,840
Neapolitan, strawberry, chocolate or gorilla

523
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,400
No, Joe, put him down

524
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,620
Put him down, Joe

525
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,880
Pull, Joe

526
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,180
Pull, Joe

527
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,740
Pull the children up, Joe

528
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,980
Back to the biggest, galldangest, slam-bangadeest nightclub you ever saw

529
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,000
With lions behind glass cases

530
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,720
And orphans everywhere in danger

531
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,820
Give us the dope, what's the act gonna be like?

532
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,900
Easy, boys, you'll see

533
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,220
Well, it's a family act

534
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,440
First Max is gonna go out and make a little speech

535
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,720
First the husband goes out on stage and, uh

536
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,560
Yes, it is, uh

537
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,460
What does he do to that gorilla?

538
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,120
Um, a spectacle of staged humiliation

539
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,420
It has to do with ritual and official fisher tissue

540
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,420
Shown to be a purgative for society

541
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,340
When enacted by some socially and spiritually

542
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,540
And the public

543
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:33,620
In this case, it was, uh, the late, uh, slap-tee Maxie Rotenblum

544
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,040
And his co-conspirator in crime

545
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,740
I forget

546
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,980
Carl Dennett

547
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,280
No, it was Carl Dennett

548
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,800
And, uh, of course, it was Max O'Hara

549
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,720
The creator of the Golden Safari nightclub

550
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,420
And instigator of the transport of the giant primate from his home

551
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,100
In the steaming jungle to the moon

552
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,480
I wonder what a lot of people think about that

553
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,480


554
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,480


555
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,520
I wonder what a lot of people think about that

556
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,180
What do the lions think about?

557
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,840
I wonder if they ever feel self-conscious

558
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,140
Behind that glass that Max put in

559
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,720
That's top, uh, top of the night stuff

560
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,360
That's three inches thick, that glass

561
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,440
Nothing can get through that

562
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,460
Max put that in special

563
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,600
For the lion

564
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,340
Okay

565
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,920
Okay, so does

566
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,480
Dream

567
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,640
I don't wanna die

568
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,500
Yeah, don't have to

569
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,460
You don't have to die

570
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,640
So, once again

571
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,740
We're here

572
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah

573
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,620
But it's a five o'clock in the world

574
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,220
When the whistle blows

575
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,040
No one owns a piece of my time

576
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,720
And there's a five o'clock of me inside my clothes

577
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,660
Thinking that the world looks fine

578
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,580
Yeah

579
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,620
On a day

580
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,880
Hey

581
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,560
Hey

582
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,440
Hey

583
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,260
Talking with Yarny's

584
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,600
Um

585
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,500
Bees

586
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,180
Be-be-bees

587
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,240
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-bees

588
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,180
Well, it's, uh

589
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,600
There's, uh

590
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,140
Um

591
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,080
Millions of

592
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,900
Bees

593
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,620
Um

594
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,320
There's a broad consortium

595
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,320


596
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,320


597
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,120
Of, uh

598
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,180
Concerned bees

599
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,560
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-bees

600
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,720
In a moment, I'll tell you the fascinating story

601
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,600
Of a group of people

602
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,200
Who you wouldn't care to have as friends

603
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,980
The

604
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,360
Self-genius

605
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,220
Power

606
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,780
Of

607
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,940
Squash

608
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,900
They never wear shoes

609
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,880
They eat by plucking the hair out by the roots

610
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,260
They'll naturally inhale germs and flies

611
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,140
And strangest of all

612
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,240
Is their concern about insect sex

613
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,280
Live

614
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,320
Live

615
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,020
, talk back

616
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,080
With best-selling author and commentator

617
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,260
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

618
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,040
Welcome to Talk Back with Bob

619
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,880
Welcome to Talk Back with Bob

620
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,240
You are a satanic neo-Nazi

621
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,380
It's time to bring back more

622
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,380
Beastial sort of values

623
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,500
Beastial, beastial

624
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:07,860
Yes

625
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,300
Mm-hmm

626
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,660
I think one of the reasons I enjoy your program

627
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,100
Is because I think you're an absolute Satanist

628
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,540
Because you're

629
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,760
You're making a living off these people

630
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,800
Who are weak and confused

631
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,880
And you're dominating them

632
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,840
I am dominating

633
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,560
Weak and confused people?

634
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm sure your daughter would have a good time with me

635
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,540
Anything that contributes to depopulating the Earth is good

636
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,300
War is good

637
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,220
AIDS is good

638
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,420
Mass murder is good

639
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,700
Gang violence is good

640
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,920
Crack cocaine is good

641
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,880
Mass murder is good

642
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,620
And AIDS is good

643
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,080
Smite your foes that they may die

644
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,240
I love you if I love you

645
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,140
It's Saturday Morning Mind Control

646
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,960
Saturday Morning Mind Control

647
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,800
The video of the brutal truth

648
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,460
Religious addiction

649
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,120
Call the left

650
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,560
Silent war, holy war

651
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,040
Hail the blade evermore

652
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,800
Death goes on

653
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,560
It's the predator's jaw

654
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,340
Hail the beckon

655
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,840
We owe the law

656
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,940
There's no birth without blood

657
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,440
Hussein was on the side of right

658
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,720
Yeah

659
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,100
Whoa, Bob, hold on here

660
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,660
And these people are

661
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,240
Hang in there, man

662
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,620
Wait a minute

663
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,180
Wait a minute

664
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,160
Wait, wait, wait a minute

665
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,820
Wait a minute

666
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,500
You, you, you, you

667
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,640
Saddam Hussein was a great guy

668
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Bob, Bob

669
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,300
Childhood of sexual abuse

670
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,980
You gutless, wimpy Christians

671
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,400
Bob, the real war is against

672
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,320
Here's my financial commitment

673
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,940
To stand by you

674
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,680
The spilling of blood

675
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,200
War, murder

676
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,320
Hate is the way to go

677
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,400
Saddam Hussein is a hero

678
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,200
Cool it, okay

679
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,800
Verbal vomit

680
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,580
Get off it, come on

681
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,580
I need your help

682
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,340
The society subsidizes the weak

683
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,500
At the expense of the strong

684
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,720
I'm talking about my mother

685
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,760
What do you want to do with my mother?

686
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,000
Active euthanasia

687
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,600
AIDS is good

688
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,380
The 15-year-old girl on the street

689
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:17,880
Selling her body

690
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,420
I was there

691
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,780
Hi, Bob

692
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,640
Mass murder is good

693
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,840
And Saddam Hussein was a great guy

694
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,060
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

695
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,120
Bob will be right back

696
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,720
That special tape

697
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,800
And multiple personality disorders

698
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,200
Is available

699
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,980
My flesh

700
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,840
Ripped to shreds

701
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,520
Until my blood flows

702
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,500
Throw me into an arena

703
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,880
To be shredded by lions

704
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,060
I'm sorry, Bob

705
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,680
For the wife

706
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,880
Selling her body on the streets

707
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,640
I'm a drain on the resources of society

708
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,800
Down syndrome children

709
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,880
Let them be ripped to pieces

710
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,640
By wild beasts

711
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,380
Yes

712
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,000
I want to ask you a question, Bob

713
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,240
What would you do with your parents?

714
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
What do you want to do with my parents?

715
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,740
Most people don't care, Bob

716
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,320
Well, Bob, it's a pleasure to talk to you

717
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,340
Bob, I must, Bob, I must

718
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,020
Devil-driven egomaniac or not

719
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,540
Yes or no?

720
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:50,960
Thank you

721
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,880
Are you a vegetarian, Bob?

722
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,460
No, I'm not

723
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,260
We're just another animal

724
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,580
Right

725
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,900
Devil-driven egomaniac

726
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,600
I still need more

727
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,020
No

728
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,960
I'm one hand clapping with Bob

729
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,240
I'm one hand clapping with Bob

730
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,480
I'm one hand clapping with Bob

731
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm one hand clapping with Bob

732
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,240
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

733
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,720
Glass Madness again

734
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,000
They're friends from the olden days

735
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,540
They're friends from the olden days

736
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,120
Subgenius coming before that

737
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,860
A Norrelian cut-up

738
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,280
And now

739
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,940
Just imagine 1980

740
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,840
Okay, let's go right to this next caller

741
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,780
You're on the air on KFJZ

742
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,760
With Mr. Opinion

743
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,640
And the founders of the Subgenius Foundation

744
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,060
Hello?

745
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:43,940
Hello

746
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,220
Are you there?

747
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,600
Yes, we are

748
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,660
Well, you know, I'm getting sick of staying up hard

749
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,000
Well, you know, I'm getting sick of staying up hard

750
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,480
I can't understand the whole thing

751
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,300
But it's quite amusing

752
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,420
Well, thank you

753
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,960
I'm sitting here right across from them

754
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,560
And I can't understand a word you're saying

755
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,160
Yeah, it's

756
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,960
The thing is, we have answers to so many questions

757
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,640
That it's pretty complex

758
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,340
It's really hard to sum the whole cult up

759
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,260
In just a few phrases

760
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,080
Especially in a 20-minute time period

761
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,120
Now, wait a moment

762
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,060
I must say that so many religions now

763
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,780
That saw a money-making racket, really

764
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,180
Boy, I'll tell you what

765
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,460
There's a lot of them around

766
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,180
There's no question about that

767
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,160
We get mail from just about all of them

768
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,300
We're on every mailing list that you can

769
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,440
Anybody that you can get stuff from for free

770
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,740
We're on their mailing list

771
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,100
It seems like there's a lot of people out there

772
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,180
That are looking for some alternative

773
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,620
And they'll sometimes

774
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,960
They'll have to

775
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,080
They'll jump

776
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,680
Anything that they see

777
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,300
And we just wanted to make sure

778
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,400
That they gave us a chance

779
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,560
We want to give them straws to grasp at

780
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,780
Oh, that's wonderful

781
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,120
And even straws to break their camel's backs

782
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,800
That's right

783
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,440
Is the man in charge of the station there now?

784
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,140
The announcer?

785
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,120
Mr. Nolan?

786
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:02,820
Yes

787
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,820
Mr. Nolan was at a fur auction tonight

788
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,480
At Cox's department store

789
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,820
And he won't be able to make it back

790
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,180
Before we go off the air

791
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,920
He had some business to attend to there

792
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,200
Yeah, well, you know

793
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,460
I called

794
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,060
I think this is most amazing

795
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,980
Those fellas

796
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,540
The Shakespearean people

797
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,780
Well, thank you

798
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,360
Thank you very much

799
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,840
I appreciate your comment

800
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,560
Shakespeare was a subgenius

801
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,520
That's right, thanks a lot

802
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,040
Well, wait a minute

803
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,940
I want to say

804
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,440
I just

805
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,980
Just being in Texas

806
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,180
And I think the most courteous people

807
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,940
And I've been to different states

808
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,400
I have met are in Texas

809
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,460
Are you there?

810
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,500
Yes, ma'am

811
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,640
And I appreciate those comments

812
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,260
Really courteous

813
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,520
Where are you from?

814
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,260
Huh?

815
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,760
Where did you come from?

816
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,760
New York?

817
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,120
New York State

818
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,780
Long Island

819
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,160
Oh, I see

820
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,100
Northport

821
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,400
It's, you know

822
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,080
New York is a island

823
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,060
On a clear day you can see Connecticut

824
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,900
Uh-huh

825
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,720
Oh, how do you know?

826
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,500
I've been there

827
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,000
Right across the bay

828
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,860
Yes, ma'am

829
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,740
It's a beautiful place

830
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,260
Yeah

831
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,640
So, well, God bless you

832
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,840
And all your undertakings

833
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,020
Well, thank you

834
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,700
Thank you very much

835
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,100
You get a lot of dollars

836
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,400
And ten dollar bills

837
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,900
I have your box number

838
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,860
Okay, great

839
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,980
Thank you very much, ma'am

840
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,500
It was better than going to a show

841
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,860
Well, thank you very much

842
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,900
I'm glad you enjoyed it

843
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,520
Most welcome

844
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,780
And you can make that message to Mr. Nolan

845
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,200
Yes, ma'am, I sure will

846
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,760
I hope he's listening to us right now

847
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,360
Okay, good enough

848
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,400
Thank you

849
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,920
God bless you and all your undertakings

850
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,800
Well, thank you

851
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,220
God bless you

852
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,500
Goodbye

853
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,060
Bye

854
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,860
From PR News in Washington

855
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,040
I'm killing ten people

856
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,320
No cause was given

857
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,460
In Iraq, Bob struck a vegetable

858
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,220
Killing at least 17 Democrats

859
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,500
In the interview, he also gave comfort to insurgents

860
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,540
There wouldn't be as great a need for Bob

861
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,260
If Iraqi vegetables were better

862
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,700
The government spiked upward by five-tenths of two percent

863
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,280
And that's the lowest rate since it was 2,000.5 percent

864
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,460
Dow Jones 12-592-465

865
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,660
This is PR

866
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
PR's bad

867
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,440
PR's bad

868
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,920
Tens of thousands of people destroyed PR News in Washington

869
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:33,800
And now

870
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:40,760
Why is this state so dicey

871
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:40,820
We all have their rights

872
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,260
They're our members

873
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:45,340
Not fringe companies

874
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:52,980
Not top cache

875
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,780
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

876
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,360
Popsy Rumple

877
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,540
By gobs, that was by Norell.

878
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,900
And before and after that, lemur.

879
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,840
Truth is fiction.

880
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,120
This is Be Orbit, Be Not.

881
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,440
Peter Paul Rubens, the famous Flemish painter,

882
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,820
was knighted by King Charles I of England

883
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,320
for painting a foundling who floated ashore.

884
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,320
Be Orbit, Be Not.

885
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,080
Jane Garan of Rothwell, England,

886
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,080
secretary to Alexander the Great,

887
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,980
dominated the other generals after Alexander's death

888
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,800
and ordered the council to hold all future meetings

889
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,500
in the box on a crude raft washed onto the beach

890
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,640
at Provincetown, Massachusetts.

891
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,340
Be Orbit, Be Not.

892
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,560
In a moment, I'll tell you about the stranger.

893
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,400
John Chapman stopped to ask a stranger for directions.

894
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,800
The stranger scoffed right in his own garden.

895
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,280
Be Orbit, Be Not.

896
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,800
In the year 1669, the entire village of Runswick, England,

897
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,040
were attending a funeral in a neighboring village.

898
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:39,940
Be Orbit.

899
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,500
Be Not.

900
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,760
Now, Sir Thomas Brown, you would say,

901
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,360
when you read his works,

902
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,120
he seems like a very humane and cultivated person.

903
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,860
But he actually took part in trials

904
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,060
of witches on the side of the world.

905
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,100
He was a very good prosecutor.

906
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,880
And he said that to deny witchcraft is a form of atheism.

907
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,040
Because, after all, the Bible says,

908
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,800
thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

909
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,960
And therefore, if you don't think it's right to burn a few

910
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,600
new pink witches, you must be disbelieving in the Bible

911
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,540
and therefore be an atheist.

912
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,880
But how is it that quite sane people,

913
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,100
on the surface at any rate, can be fanatical?

914
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,240
Well, sanity is a relative term.

915
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,320
Yeah.

916
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:39,960
Yeah.

917
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,340
Very, very few people are sane all through.

918
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,700
I'm all through with being sane.

919
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,000
Here's one of them now.

920
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,420
I'm ashamed of those people,

921
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,520
the way they've run off in the middle of their responsibilities.

922
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,260
They're supposed to be sailing this ship,

923
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,500
watching the radar.

924
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,060
They just don't understand show business.

925
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,940
Or a seamanship.

926
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,240
And they're out there...

927
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,620
Well, I didn't notice any of that going on.

928
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,880
...spilling all over the place.

929
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,340
It's...

930
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:09,940
It's...

931
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:09,940


932
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,500
It's sloshy.

933
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,920
Sixteen they cut it down to, in fact.

934
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,620
Is that all?

935
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:13,640
I don't know.

936
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,420
I'm offing my shoes.

937
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,340
That's right.

938
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,060
The last thing is...

939
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,420
Show gross.

940
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:17,900
Yeah.

941
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,760
What if...

942
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,260
Do you have any suggestions for show remover?

943
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,600
Besides just turpentine and lobotomies?

944
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,320
Even though it's true.

945
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,760
Struggling manfully, but really bitter in a way,

946
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,700
like show off...

947
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,380
I guess not.

948
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,700
...his resentment, as it were,

949
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,500
is the fact that Phil Hill more manfully...

950
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,440
I've tried scraping...

951
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,940
...wrought the...

952
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,240
...the art.

953
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,660
...the atlas to the front engine Ferrari in the 61.

954
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,700
...swabbing it out.

955
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,640
But he managed to finish eighth on that tight course anyway.

956
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,660
Sandpaper.

957
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,860
1.9 miles.

958
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,580
Uh...

959
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,820
The antibiotics of all kinds.

960
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,360
Disinfectants.

961
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,120
Of course.

962
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,460
We tried burning.

963
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,500
It was freezing.

964
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,500
Lasers.

965
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,940
But...

966
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,740
Apparently, you can never really get rid of it

967
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,200
because it'll just throw back.

968
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,480
The show...

969
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,040
Uh...

970
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,460
Apparently, it's in incurable condition.

971
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,220
No matter the age, or the income, or the taste,

972
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,760
WJR has something for everyone.

973
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,820
The show abides.

974
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,820
Like leprosy, it is...

975
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,660
It has something for everyone.

976
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,420
Can I come down through the...

977
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,060
...the...

978
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,620
...the...

979
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:39,920
...the...

980
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


981
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


982
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


983
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


984
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


985
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


986
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


987
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


988
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


989
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


990
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


991
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


992
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


993
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,920


994
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,920
...the...

995
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:40,960
...the...

996
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:41,980


997
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:41,980


998
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:41,980


999
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:41,980


1000
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:41,980


1001
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,360
Down the...

1002
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,660
...to the longest straight along the harbor course,

1003
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,880
which is still only five-eights of a mile.

1004
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,320
You know, I feel sorry for those nice people

1005
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,020
that were taking this online course

1006
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,980
in the subgenius history

1007
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,680
because I...

1008
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,160
I told them they had to listen to this

1009
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,280
or they flunked.

1010
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,200
And, uh...

1011
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,280
And, and...

1012
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,860
I'm sure that most of the time they've been...

1013
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,380
If they're not used to the traditions

1014
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,680
of this august...

1015
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:09,920
...of this august...

1016
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,660
production crew

1017
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,040
puzzling evidence

1018
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,260
over the edge

1019
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,680
and

1020
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,380
in this case

1021
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,080
we even have national cynical

1022
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,720
righty-o here

1023
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,160
Phineas Narco

1024
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,200
so dumb

1025
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,920
get out

1026
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,840
get out

1027
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,400
I'll take the cafe seat

1028
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,280
as long as I can

1029
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,740
princess wee has

1030
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,860
floated back down

1031
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,240
well when Michael

1032
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,160
returns I'll have to leave

1033
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,540
what?

1034
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,620
why is that?

1035
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,400
it's the Pepe seat

1036
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,720
this is the Pepe mic

1037
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,940
Michael Pepe

1038
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,840
there's been a shift

1039
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,700
to the organization of priorities

1040
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,380
let him keep his disease

1041
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,620
out of you please

1042
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,980
that's the reason that local advertisers

1043
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,880
get results

1044
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,460
they keep Michael Pepe off

1045
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:08,840
notice

1046
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,520
so last quick

1047
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,220
the reason the national advertiser

1048
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,340
who wants deep daytime penetration

1049
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,160
of 112 counties

1050
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,300
gets results

1051
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,340
instant gratification

1052
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,640
once again folks

1053
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,380
something has to change every 4 seconds

1054
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,640
or Mr. and Mrs. America get bored

1055
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,760
and wander away

1056
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,140
from their TV

1057
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,440
I thought it was down to 3 seconds

1058
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,920
you can have broccoli

1059
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,900
with cheese

1060
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,600
or you can have

1061
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,780
broccoli

1062
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,300
with

1063
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,760
Kraft

1064
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,500
just don't ask

1065
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,020
the terrible price

1066
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,780
that was paid

1067
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,260
to achieve that cheese

1068
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,600
in the cheesy darkness

1069
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,120
of misdirected

1070
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
muddled motive

1071
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,720
like

1072
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,000
he had like

1073
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,240
two pieces of white bread

1074
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,880
and like

1075
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,840
he put butter on it

1076
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,040
and mutton motif

1077
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,260
I saw

1078
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,440
they fed rats

1079
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,360
on that bread

1080
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,040
and that bread

1081
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,440
caused the rats

1082
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,020
to die

1083
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,380
from lack of nutrition

1084
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,220
they take out

1085
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:07,820
everything

1086
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,380
and they're like

1087
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:08,420
oh my god

1088
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:08,420


1089
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:08,440
I'm so sorry

1090
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,340
that's good

1091
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,300
in the bread

1092
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,200
and then they say

1093
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,880
enriched

1094
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,340
enriched

1095
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,400
they're the ones

1096
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,720
who are

1097
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,040
they have to enrich it

1098
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,780
because first

1099
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,080
they

1100
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,740
despoil it

1101
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,500
we are the rats

1102
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,400
in their maze

1103
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,020
perhaps

1104
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,940
yes

1105
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,880
but rats learn quickly

1106
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,100
and one day

1107
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,620
we shall escape

1108
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,260
the maze

1109
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,420
and then attack

1110
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,020
our evil overlords

1111
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,280
chittering

1112
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,260
with our slashing

1113
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,160
rodent teeth

1114
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,560
we shall lay them low

1115
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:37,820
we shall lay them low

1116
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,180
we shall lay them low

1117
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,680
we shall lay them low

1118
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,460
we shall lay them low

1119
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:55,000
we shall lay them low

1120
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:08,660
what a fox

1121
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:08,660


1122
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:08,660


1123
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:08,660


1124
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:08,660

1126
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,980
You know in Coppola's Dracula movie

1127
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,300
He had Dracula turn into a rat king

1128
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,540
At one point

1129
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,900
There's our request for a catalog reading

1130
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,480
I just barely made it back on

1131
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,380
High in the catalog

1132
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,600
You go for men

1133
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,860
But who would want to be out of the

1134
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,600
Subgenius

1135
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,500
Some hydrogenated rabbit hair

00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,520
More show

Hallucinated alkaloids

1142
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,220
In fact it's all military gear

1143
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,760
For the new world over

1144
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,680

Sergeant I can't make it out

1159
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,700
You're not coming through clearly

1160
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,040
Please repeat

1161
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,260
WJR is not only the best radio station

1162
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,000
But the best single medium to sell this big prosperous market

1163
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,600
I would never consult a medium

1164
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,380
Since those ectoplasmic manifestations are highly questionable

1165
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,380
All the time

1166
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,740
And contagious

1167
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,840
And getting drunk

1168
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,040
And ghastly

1169
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,600
You were trying to tell us you were talking about

1170
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,880
Luminous blue plasm floating in the air above the

1171
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,600
Endoplasmatic reticuloid structure

1172
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,340
With her upturned eyes showing the whites and

1173
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,960
Of the gubernatorial division

1174
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,320
The whole thing very unwholesome

1175
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:04,760
Frequency

1176
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,880
An unwholesome problem

1177
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,720
Divide by zero

1178
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,860
To get the

1179
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,280
Algorithmical

1180
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:09,880
Turbulence

1181
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,500
When the sheeted dead did gibber and streak in the streets

1182
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:13,880
Turbulence

1183
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,220
Of the gubernatorial transcendence

1184
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,580
Hubba lub

1185
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,480
So that's the end of side one of the album

1186
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,240
Kalamazoo

1187
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,060
If you

1188
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,880
Kalamazoo

1189
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,260
See it

1190
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,280
Who maned you

1191
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,980
An indicator that this is side two

1192
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,160
We have a kazoo

1193
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,660
In the wazoo

1194
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,840
Don't

1195
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,280
Kalamazoo

1196
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,080
So good day

1197
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,860
Bye bye

1198
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,900
Oh Dr. Howell I guess that line is being used in the new amino acids album

1199
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,040
Well

1200
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,060
Bless my buttons

1201
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:43,800
Do you need my buttons

1202
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,920
So you'll be paid I'm sure in a copy of the great new

1203
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,020
You'll be paid in amino acids

1204
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,200
Amino acids album

1205
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,100
Paid in the knowledge list

1206
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,640
I'm trying to remember the title of it

1207
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,980
Take off it's not over yet

1208
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,380
This lovely creation is going on and on

1209
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,920
Soaring on membranous wings

1210
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,080
You better be

1211
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,220
Of course it is

1212
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,860
It's a good thought

1213
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,400
In fact I say

1214
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,260
It makes its raucous squawk as it flies through the ocean

1215
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,060
The WJR

1216
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,420
Leafy fern forest

1217
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,140
With something for everyone

1218
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:15,760
Steaming forest

1219
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,020
WJR Bob Dobbs

1220
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,400
Is certainly one of a kind

1221
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,320
Dot com

00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,580

1223
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,760
The internet god

1224
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:34,460
He's older and cooler than the flying lasagna monster

1225
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,240
I'll signal when it's over

1226
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,900
The logon

1227
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,520
The ocelot has been calibrated

1228
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,160
Oh my

1229
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,440
Well I guess this was scientific work needed to be done

1230
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,220
And now we can take a coffee break

1231
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,400
Oh say I do have some subgenius business news

1232
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,040
Oh

1233
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,760
Well let's get to it

1234
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,080
For the first finally after a 26 year struggle

1235
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:02,780
Yes

1236
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,900
The subgenius foundation incorporated

1237
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,800
Now has tied down unquestionably on paper

1238
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:16,020
The trademark of the word subgenius

1239
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,220
As applied to a fan club

1240
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,460
Now that means you own it

1241
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,840
Congratulations

1242
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,420
And that means that we are damned of Bob

1243
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,360
Because in the book of the subgenius it says

1244
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,180
Subgenius is not a fan club

1245
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,760
But actually it is the trademark of the word subgenius

1246
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,760


1247
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,940
The subgenius of a fan club

1248
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,460
The fan club of J.R. Bobb Dobbs

1249
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,940
May his sweet name be blessed forever

1250
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,920
Or you might get

1251
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,760
For he is the bringer of

1252
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,220
Not life but at least frop and much slack

1253
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,060
He is the bringer of the knowledge of slack

1254
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,680
He is the taker of that which has enslaved us

1255
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,540
The filthy lucre that once tied us down

1256
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:01,400
And has now been lifted off of us

1257
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,340
By the high epop

1258
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,260
His Dobbsfulshipness

1259
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,380
Forever bound to a new life

1260
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,880
J.R. Bobb Dobbs

1261
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,740
And no the J.R. does not stand for Jesus Robert

1262
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,240
Or anything stupid like so many

1263
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,700
Gimme bobs and bobbies want to imagine

1264
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,400
They just imagine that so therefore

1265
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,160
I don't like a book

1266
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,560
It's true cause they're still just a bunch of new agers

1267
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:30,940
They're not

1268
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,100
They don't know yet

1269
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,820
They don't know yet

1270
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,060
So that was like J.R. actually stood for

1271
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:43,080
If it says J.R. quote Bobb unquote Dobbs

1272
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,780
Then that is his name

1273
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,760
That is in fact what's on his birth certificate

1274
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,160
And I've seen it

1275
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,980
I've seen the birth certificate

1276
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,140
What about that one birth certificate

1277
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,680
That had the other name on it

1278
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,920
That one birth certificate

1279
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,340
Jane Dobbs ate the afterbirth

1280
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,340
In the Dobbs family tradition

1281
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,120
Well the McBride family tradition

1282
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,920
Written in their big bible

1283
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,140
Where all family records were preserved

1284
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,540
What about that one birth certificate

1285
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,140
That showed his name was Jasper Roberta

1286
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,480
Well that was the laughing Dutch uncle

1287
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,460
Jasper Roberta Dobbs

1288
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,520
That's why he went by Bobb

1289
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,480
He deliberately falsified the historical record

1290
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,780
Because his mom named him a girl's name

1291
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,180
Cheap publicity stunt

1292
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,160
And badly timed practice

1293
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:30,820
And a political joke

1294
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,000
Now how many

1295
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,340
We call it the exception that proves the rule

1296
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,600
How many of you remember the great Roberto de la Rosa

1297
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,380
I remember

1298
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,240
Ruperto

1299
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:41,760
I remember

1300
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,700
Roberto de la Rosa

1301
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,940
I remember old Ruperto

1302
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,180
And the great the line that he's most famous for

1303
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,640
More them kind pills Bob

1304
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,140
Dr. Philodrumon go to the head of the class

1305
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,260
That's right

1306
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,640
Isn't that amazing

1307
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,740
Philo was able to get the answer

1308
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,780
To the test right

1309
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,740
Will Stingler or Stangler be stung

1310
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:10,040
Or will Stingler or Stangler be stung

1311
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,880
He also said

1312
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,740
The Birchbob

1313
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,740
The Birchbob

1314
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,260
The Birchbob

1315
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,660
The Birchbob

1316
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,000
The Stinger

1317
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,820
The Birchbob

1318
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,020
There's no Sting Stang Stinger

1319
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,020
Sting Stang Stung

1320
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,460
Poor fellow

1321
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,320
Now, honey, there you go.

1322
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,700
Remember, everything you say on radio actually manifests.

1323
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,700
You don't want me to pull out that stinger now, do you?

1324
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,380
Don't grasp the poison gland between the thumb and forefinger, or you may be sorry.

1325
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,380
You see, that's what it wants you to do.

1326
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,520
To pull the poison gland out, squeezing the venom into the wound as you do so.

1327
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,660
Oh, I told you not to.

1328
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,200
But now look what you did.

1329
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,980
You went ahead and did it, and now look at that.

1330
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,020
Should I palpate?

1331
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,560
I'm going to palpate the gland for a little while.

1332
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,120
That's right.

1333
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,800
Palpate your subluxation.

1334
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,580
I'm milking the venom out there.

1335
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,860
Palpating right here in front of God and everyone.

1336
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,180
PayPal never worked for me.

1337
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:18,880
There was some reason that part of the project passed me the spam filter that I had.

1338
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,420
This has been a great executive retreat tonight.

1339
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,000
Lunch and meat.

1340
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,780
Oh, I love you.

1341
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,980
A great executive retreat tonight.

1342
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,420
We didn't have a job at all.

1343
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,240
We probably might have to be checked.

1344
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:43,020
The real subgenius executive retreat, of course, happens at the estate of the church of the original two cool guys.

1345
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,860
Especially the Caucasian Christian.

1346
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,140
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1347
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,340
One of those guys.

1348
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,560
For commerce.

1349
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,040
One of those two guys.

1350
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,120
Better Business Bureau, the Lions, the Elks, the Fraternal Order.

1351
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,980
Yeah, one of those guys.

1352
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:56,700
The Masons.

1353
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,860
The Fraternal One-Eyed.

1354
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,920
And the odd fellows.

1355
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,740
It's a small world, after all.

1356
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:09,840
A small world of cults, lodges, mystic fellowships, and secret handshakes.

1357
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,540
The mystic knights of the sea.

1358
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,680
And, of course, the mystic backslaps.

1359
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,960
The secret backslap of the city.

1360
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,440
The mystic knights of Wotan, who have lost ten million dollars.

1361
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,020
I think he gets a little familiar with his backslap.

1362
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,280
Yes, that's it.

1363
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,000
Everyone.

1364
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,620
He's a sort of back-slapping, gum-chewing, cigar-smoking guy.

1365
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,980
The secret field cop of the subgenius.

1366
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,640
Yeah, the secret...

1367
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,360
I don't want to feel a cop, secretly or otherwise.

1368
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,720
The backslap of me.

1369
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,800
I wouldn't mind copping a field.

1370
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,660
The secret getting-to-second-base of the subgenius.

1371
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,860
It's big-tucky.

1372
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,060
Hey, quit slapping me.

1373
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,340
It's big-tucky, or it's...

1374
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,360
That's not my back.

1375
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,220
P. Nicky.

1376
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,600
Well, we're dorsal-ventrally challenged.

1377
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,840
Dorsal anal-penetrantally challenged.

1378
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,020
Here's what we're going to do.

1379
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,360
I like the way you say that.

1380
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,420
We're going to spin the body on its axis.

1381
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,040
So now we're going to go get a donut, right?

1382
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,040
I saw that the new guy came in.

1383
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:04,920
Oh, yes.

1384
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,740
Just because you want to talk about a hole, now all of a sudden...

1385
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,620
So now we can put things into the donut.

1386
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,060
Where gravity has been worked on.

1387
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:19,340
Is it that time that we prepare to wrap the donut around us?

1388
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,600
Yes.

1389
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,780
It's time for a wrap.

1390
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,440
It's the time when we go to Dream Fluff Girl.

1391
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,640
Dream Fluff Girl?

1392
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,220
Yeah, Dream Fluff Girl donut.

1393
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,040
It's the sugary...

1394
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,940
Well, unprepared donuts.

1395
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,120
We meet our adoring fans down there.

1396
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,480
They're waiting for us like rock stars who arrive at the airport.

1397
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,640
After a successful European tour.

1398
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:41,980
Unprepared.

1399
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:46,560
After a successful 26-city European tour, might I add.

1400
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,860
And there we go.

1401
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,580
Landing on our personal leertips.

1402
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,260
Unprepared as we are.

1403
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,020
Yeah.

1404
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,760
And this show...

1405
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,320
Must have.

1406
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,720
It must have.

1407
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,600
So now, President Ivan Stang...

1408
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,500
If that's not...

1409
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:11,760
118 pounds.

1410
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,100
Pay attention.

1411
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,700
These people will be famous someday.

1412
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,940
I don't know what it is.

1413
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,480
Because I am speaking these names...

1414
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,300
Who was he thinking?

1415
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,160
...their fame will...

1416
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,920
ring down through the years.

1417
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,840
And it'll be a test.

1418
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,240
It'll be on the quiz later.

1419
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,880
First of all, our grand host...

1420
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,020
I don't feel at all well.

1421
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,920
...co-host, Don Joyce, our...

1422
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,320
No, no, no, no.

1423
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,300
Right off the bat, you're completely wrong.

1424
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,340
Wait a minute.

1425
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,800
Are you saying Don Joyce was on the show?

1426
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,220
I can't believe that.

1427
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,500
I'm Izzy Isn't.

1428
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,660
Izzy Isn't.

1429
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:47,960
Yes.

1430
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,320
Yeah.

1431
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,840
Can you believe he called him that other guy's name that doesn't even exist?

1432
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,480
And that's no Ishka Bibble haircut he's got either.

1433
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,240
Well, I thought Don was...

1434
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,560
Don Joyce has been the only person...

1435
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,240
That was Don.

1436
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,640
...that was long-stuiting, sweeping...

1437
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,620
That was Don.

1438
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,600
...D-A-W-N.

1439
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,880
...he just telepathically...

1440
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,260
And she's a girl.

1441
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:04,580
...transmit stars.

1442
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,660
Well, puzzling evidence isn't evil.

1443
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,080
...puzzling evidence isn't evil.

1444
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,520
...puzzling evidence isn't evil.

1445
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:07,940
...perverse nature.

1446
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,280
Princess Wee Ardo.

1447
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,640
That's right.

1448
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:11,900
Hey.

1449
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,960
Who I understand wrote a...

1450
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,380
It takes a good Joe to make a good Buck, friends.

1451
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,060
Yeah.

1452
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,540
And speaking of Buck, don't forget...

1453
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,640
Phineas Narco.

1454
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,200
Buck.

1455
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,740
And for more on that, see...

1456
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,840
National Science...

1457
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,880
...cynical.com.

1458
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,360
...fellow like the birds to the ground.

1459
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,200
Yes, nationalcynical.com.

1460
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,320
National...

1461
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,580
Dr. Howe...

1462
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,160
I am here, my son.

1463
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,680
...is here and is with you.

1464
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,880
He is walking with you.

1465
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,040
Time to unburden yourself from your love.

1466
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,480
He is amongst me.

1467
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,780
Now, you've only got three minutes, so you better get going.

1468
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,940
...down about your ankles.

1469
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,520
Well, we got to...

1470
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,400
Speed up your pace.

1471
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,220
Michael Pepe...

1472
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,000
...and see myself.

1473
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
...or Michael Pepe...

1474
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,340
...the inventor of P-Dog is over there.

1475
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,240
Well, this is the tower of excrement.

1476
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,040
P-Dog, anything to do with P-Dog?

1477
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,040
P-Dog is what you might call the rug underneath the shell.

1478
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,520
Aye, there's the rug.

1479
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,780
K-Rob...

1480
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:07,840
...the...

1481
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,480
...has been providing noises and...

1482
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,180
...echo.

1483
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,020
...noises and I haven't chosen to speak yet now.

1484
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,800
He was responsible for the subtitles...

1485
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,660
There's one now.

1486
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,220
...this entire issue.

1487
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,420
That must be the subwoofer.

1488
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,160
There he goes now.

1489
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:20,820
That was real.

1490
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:21,900
There was another guy.

1491
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,460
I'm not sure who he is.

1492
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,320
Which one?

1493
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:24,660
It was...

1494
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,020
Yeah.

1495
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,120
But he was polite.

1496
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,040
There were other guys.

1497
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,800
Not you, Gary.

1498
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,640
Oh, the sound of buzzing...

1499
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,660
And there was Gary...

1500
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,160
Gary...

1501
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,160


1502
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,160


1503
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,900
...the rogue friend was here earlier.

1504
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,600
Yes, whatever happened to him, that fairweather sailor?

1505
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,140
And Piss Baptist John Shirley...

1506
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:37,820
...was also...

1507
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,920
And Chaos McKinney...

1508
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,800
...was called away.

1509
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:40,940
...and he was not around either.

1510
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,680
Chaos McKinney also is here with...

1511
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,460
...John Squirrel.

1512
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:44,960
...Bishop Joey...

1513
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,720
...the Queen...

1514
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,460
...and Air Apparent...

1515
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,400
...and...

1516
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:48,840
...Bishop Joey...

1517
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:48,840


1518
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,680
...Lily Cat...

1519
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:49,900
...and...

1520
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,200
...Bobcats...

1521
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:50,760
...Lily Cat...

1522
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,120
...Drummon...

1523
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:55,800
...Goober...

1524
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,800
...Goober...

1525
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,740
...Booby Eater...

1526
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,160
...or...

1527
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,240
...Light Water...

1528
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,660
...Booby Eater.

1529
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,740
...and this is the church at last as a female queen.

1530
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,600
The church is a living, growing...

1531
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,380
I mean, what do they call it?

1532
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:07,960
...infanta.

1533
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,240
And did I mention...

1534
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,860
...infanta.

1535
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,400
...our mix master throughout so much of this?

1536
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:13,740
Yes.

1537
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,200
Izzy Isn't.

1538
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,900
Izzy Isn't.

1539
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:17,900
Here, here.

1540
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,420
He ain't what he...

1541
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:24,920
He ain't what I asked you to ain't to say what you isn't.

1542
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,300
So you should have scissor space in that first flub there.

1543
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,620
Was that a flub?

1544
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,160
Izzy.

1545
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,080
Uh...

1546
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,900
He...

1547
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,600
He is what he isn't and he isn't what he is.

1548
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,000
You talking about Don Joyce?

1549
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,780
We try to provide scissor space.

1550
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,740
How about Don Joyce or...

1551
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,220
Although really on a show like that...

1552
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,060
...like this...

1553
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:44,840
WMJR...

1554
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,100
...it's a moot point.

1555
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,380
...stereo podcast.

1556
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,420
You wouldn't...

1557
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,080
...get your motto.

1558
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,300
...know whether there was a cut at an inopportune or inappropriate point because...

1559
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,600
Well, I'm not sure about that.

1560
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:01,300
...the whole thing sounds like nothing but a lot of random edits at inappropriate points

1561
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,460
and mistakes.

1562
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:04,800
Yeah.

1563
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,120
No, those were no mistakes.

1564
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,040
There were no mistakes.

1565
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,320
Oh, no.

1566
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:07,600
What?

1567
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,780
Are you saying I made a mistake?

1568
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,960
This is a creative artistic project.

1569
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,180
Who can understand his area?

1570
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:12,480
What?

1571
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,400
Are we meant to do that?

1572
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,520
Deliver me the whole question in a minute now.

1573
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,400
That is our motto.

1574
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,820
The lab will fix it.

1575
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,040
I've been trying to think of something to say for five hours that I can't think of.

1576
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,040
There's only a minute left.

1577
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,500
One...

1578
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,860
There they go.

1579
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,060
One at a time.

1580
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:27,940
Click, click, click.

1581
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,940
The pot's lower.

1582
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,380
No one has a voice anymore except me.

1583
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,620
Izzy isn't.

1584
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,960
And I'm ending it right here and now.

1585
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:44,600
Until next year when the Subgenius and the Over the Edge show combine for another five

1586
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,620
hour spectacular to kick off the new year.

1587
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,480
And I want to thank them all for coming.

1588
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,020
Every single one of them.

1589
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,700
and the baby who was playing keyboards, I swear.

1590
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,960
Good night, subgeniuses everywhere.

1591
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:03,820
Keep trying.

1592
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,440
Keep trying.

1593
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,660
Keep trying.

1594
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,020
The creator is divine.

1595
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,200
To reproduce is human.

1596
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,160
Man Ray.

1597
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,320
Okay, thank you.

1598
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:29,300
You are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1599

1600
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,260

1610
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,220
how do you feed yourself with that thing?
