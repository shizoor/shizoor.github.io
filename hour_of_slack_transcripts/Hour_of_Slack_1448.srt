00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:10,360
This portion of programming is brought to you by Bob's Steakhouse on the corner of Pursuit and Flushing in beautiful Stane, California.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,320
Come on down to Bob's and get a mouthful of meat from the man himself.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,180
If you'd like to make a reservation, please call 1-800-555-13013.

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,760
Most young people will continue through life as normal, responsible citizens.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,160
Others, the shunted and unloved, the unguided, the seekers of thrills and kicks, are candidates for the slave world of lifelong...

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,840
How does it happen? Where does it start? What are the signs?

7
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,780
The pattern is generally the same.

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,260
Bob?

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,160
Take a look.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,160


11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:57,480
The lack of responsibility, the inability to make right choices, add to it ignorance and indifference, and top it off with a desire for escapism and kicks.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,440
The sum total is then...

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,240
The subgenius.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,880
Power of...

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,900
Swatch.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,100
This is the real action.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,780
This is the test.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,220
The time to separate the man from the boy.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,480
Willpower, individuality, character are slipping down the drain.

20
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,700
In their place comes Bob.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,680
In the time of a new era, they've had their fair share of

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,000
They're a lot more surrealistic sounding, and surrealism is really quite critical.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,720
But I like the fact of having so much Bob taking up all that room.

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,140
Of course, another thing I like about Bob is that they make special records just for Bob equipment.

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,240
Special effects like sounds from the very deep parts of the Bob.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,600
And you can get these Bob records only for Bob.

27
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,880
When you finally do get Bob dead and everyone can hear that low-pitched Bob.

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,240
barking at them from a mile beneath the ocean.

29
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,220
People look up to you, and I guess I really go for that feeling of scare.

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,680
You see, a man of Bob is like a deep-sea diver.

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,720
He must be afraid to walk down where it's dark and frightening

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,540
in the hopes of scooping up a handful of shat-shat-shat.

33
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,840
What did you want to tell us about Bob?

34
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,340
I've made the obvious deductions they don't seem to add up.

35
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,520
A few minutes ago, I saw the incredible, the unbelievable.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,840
But what I saw Bob do a few minutes ago

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,440
is something for which there is no name, unless you can name it.

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,340
I can't name it. I can't, can't, can't name it.

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
Jim, Jim, Jim E.

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,920
Bob, Bob, Bob has been able through to shat-shat-shat a man's mind.

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,120
Another man's boy to walk through a lock voice to allow gate.

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,940
I don't understand.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,340
Do you know why we bring people to this place?

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,640
No.

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,160
We bring them here to cure them, to make them sane.

46
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,820
Nobody that we bring here ever leaves our hands uncared.

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,080
Good.

48
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,840
Why don't you kill me?

49
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,180
You're rid of the religious persecutions of the past.

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,040
They were failures.

51
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,660
They set out to eradicate heresies and they ended by perpetuating them.

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,940
We do not make that mistake.

53
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,160
We perpetuate heresies and perpetuate heresies and perpetuate heresies and...

54
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,840
Why bother?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,740
You are a flaw in the pattern.

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,420
You are a stain which has to be wiped out.

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,720
We do not convert the heretic.

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,540
We destroy him.

59
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,940
We capture his inner mind.

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,380
We reshape him.

61
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,820
We burn.

62
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,200
We burn.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,400
We burn.

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,940
We burn.

65
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:17,940


66
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,760
We burn.

67
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:19,880


68
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


69
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


70
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


71
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


72
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


73
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


74
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


75
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


76
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


77
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


78
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


79
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


80
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


81
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


82
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:19,900


83
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,200
Step by step to the point from which there is no return.

84
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,860
This portion of programming is brought to you by Bob's Meats.

85
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,740
Whether it's a lovely rump roast or a beautiful tube steak you're looking for,

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,200
come to Bob's on the corner of Spunk and Main in beautiful downtown Persnickety.

87
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,600
Ask about our special deals if you buy by the ton.

88
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,820
Come on down to Bob's where job one is getting our meat into your mouth.

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,560
You know this...individual?

90
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,700
Sure do, Reverend.

91
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,840
He's my friend.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,560
Aural.

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,180
You know full well that you should never trust Bob.

94
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,940
Gee, do you really think he's...

95
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,980
Of course.

96
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,880
Listen to that accent.

97
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,520
Aural, your friend...

98
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,720
Bob.

99
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,040
Is not a proper Christian.

100
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,480
Gee.

101
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,800
How do you know, Reverend?

102
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,660
Well, look at him, Oral.

103
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,620
I mean...

104
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,360
Well...

105
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,280
He obviously believes in subgenius.

106
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,380
Subgenius?

107
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,780
I'll take it from here, folks.

108
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,560
Ahem.

109
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,540
That's right, Oral. Subgenius.

110
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,740
It's a clever combination of the words sub and genius.

111
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,540
Huh?

112
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,780
Oh yeah.

113
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,240
Subgenius is the most simplistic way of disproving subgenius,

114
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,260
while at the same time proving subgenius.

115
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,580
Subgenius is so simplistic that even the lowest form of life can understand it.

116
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,820
I have bad incompetence.

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,800
My incompetence all went down my britches, and I'm all bad on incompetence.

118
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,940
Let us take another delusion of yours.

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,340
You believe you had in your hands a photograph of Bob?

120
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,800
I did have it.

121
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,240
You believe it?

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,060
You believe it was some sort of documentary evidence?

123
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,600
How can you control the memory?

124
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,120
You haven't controlled mine.

125
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,380
On the contrary, you haven't controlled it.

126
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,060
That is why you're here.

127
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,300
You've been lacking in humility and self-discipline.

128
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,060
You must make an effort of the will and rehabilitate your mind.

129
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,720
Then you will be sane.

130
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,880
But first, you must be humble.

131
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:50,360
Do you remember writing in that diary of yours that freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes Bob?

132
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,600
How many fingers am I holding out?

133
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,400
And if the state says not Bob, what else can I say?

134
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,000
Bob?

135
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,440
Bob?

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:58,920
Bob?

137
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,420
Bob?

138
00:05:59,420 --> 00:05:59,860
Bob?

139
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,480
Bob?

140
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:00,840
Bob?

141
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,420
Bob?

142
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,740
Bob?

143
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,340
Bob?

144
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,660
Bob?

145
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,120
Bob?

146
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,200
Bob?

147
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,460
Bob?

148
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:03,680
Bob?

149
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:03,920


150
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,580
Bob?

151
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,040
Bob?

152
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,760
Take him.

153
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,180
Jesus Christ.

154
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,280
Jesus Christ, Charles.

155
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,480
Have you been asleep at the switch?

156
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:16,820
Let's roll.

157
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,120
Why, has he got his arm on...

158
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,300
Bob?

159
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,500
You're with that ugly fuck and your own free fucking whale, doc?

160
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,240
Yes, yes I am.

161
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,040
I'd rather be lucky than smart.

162
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,720
Bomb, slag, bomb, slag

163
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,900
Oh my god, what the fuck is this shit?

164
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,400
Bomb, slag, bomb, slag

165
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,940
Bomb, slag, bomb, slag

166
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,380
Bomb, bomb, slag

167
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,180
Mom, Dad, it's 8 o'clock!

168
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,700
Oh boy, my new favorite show!

169
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,060
And now may I present for your entertainment

170
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,680
On the Sabbath at midnight for your amusement there will be a masquerade

171
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,220
The wardrobes of the castle are yours to use

172
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,340
But I beg of you, even for the humor of it, do not wear

173
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,560
Bob

174
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,420
You go too far

175
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,500
I am not without influence and power

176
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,600
Against Bob?

177
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,820
Yes

178
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,020
Yes, Bob came to the village

179
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,920
Even now, Bob lays waste the countryside

180
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,660
So you can count yourself out

181
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,880
I was fortunate that you were here

182
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,780
For X day dawned and set

183
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,580
With all of us still here

184
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,300
With still a little bit more time

185
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,440
Given to us by the grace of fate

186
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,580
To clean up our mess and do our laundry

187
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,380
And nobody prepared

188
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,380
And so it will be on that great day

189
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,440
When the sea gives up its dead

190
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,500
And monsters walk the earth

191
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,340
That nobody will be prepared

192
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,880
And will have even bothered to destroy

193
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,880
His pornography collection

194
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,680
To keep from influencing whatever posterity may remain

195
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,440
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
What did you think? Too sensationalistic?

197
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
Or maybe it wasn't sensationalistic enough?

198
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,420
Oh, no, not you too

199
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,340
Did you hear it?

200
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,780
Hear what?

201
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,740
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob

202
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,800
You're so excited about being back in the air

203
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,920
You've completely fallen under Bob's evil spell

204
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,260
I have no idea what you're talking about

205
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,200
All I'm doing is getting on the air

206
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,520
And giving people the straight dope about Bob

207
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,380
The revolution will be broadcast

208
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,580
I'll leave you to your pirate nerd radio

209
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,660
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob

210
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,520
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob

211
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,280
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob

212
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,300
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob

213
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,280
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob

214
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,480
oughta i mean there's a fine line between eccentricity and downright suicidal foolhardiness

215
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,840
I know I walked that line every saturday night

216
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,720
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob

217
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,180
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob

218
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,640
Every saturday night

219
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,520
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob

220
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,920
Bobby's in the kitchen with Bob

221
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,360
Every saturday night

222
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,400
There's a fine line between

223
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,000
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,080
Too sensationalistic

225
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,480
Bob's in the kitchen with me

226
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,400
Did you hear it?

227
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,140
Let's get over to the damn bar.

228
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,580
I'm going to need a drink to get through this.

229
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,300
We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin.

230
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,320
High government sources have ceased to deny the presence in many parts of the country

231
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,000
of non-terrestrial objects.

232
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,320
We return you now to the starlight terrace of the Hotel Gamalodians, Scranton,

233
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,520
to the singing glory, oh glory, oh glory, oh and his melodians.

234
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,860
Another bulletin, ladies and gentlemen.

235
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,980
Your latest word of the monsters from outer space.

236
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:31,980
Correction.

237
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,480
Bob.

238
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,300
Sorry, folks, that's what experts are saying.

239
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,620
They are Bob, Bob, Bob.

240
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,240
State Highway.

241
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,300
Ladies and gentlemen, a special news flash from Washington.

242
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,940
Any moment now, the president will be receiving a delegation from Bob.

243
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,340
From Bob.

244
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,360
Peace talks are expected.

245
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,700
A woman, you just have to believe this,

246
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,940
rushed into a police station out in San Francisco with her clothes in tatters

247
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,840
to report that she'd been...

248
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,440
repeatedly attacked by...

249
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,880
Bob, Bob, Bob.

250
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,200
She tried to take poison for the shame of it,

251
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,600
and they stopped her just in time.

252
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,280
I can't describe...

253
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,480
Bob.

254
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,140
She said, Bob's hell.

255
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,160
Somebody down in South America did an imitation of...

256
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,620
Bob, Bob, Bob.

257
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,160
And he ended up in prison.

258
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,480
I've been kind of alone.

259
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,480
I don't have a lot of friends,

260
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,880
so to have a buddy who lives in the same house,

261
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,380
and now Peter's here,

262
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,700
and Bob's here.

263
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,220
Well, I guess it's not fair to count Bob.

264
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
You know, he's, you know, one of those...

265
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,600
funny guys.

266
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:28,840
Funny guy.

267
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,280
Walks into a cabin, goes right up the chimney,

268
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,960
cleans out a flue.

269
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,120
I have seen dumb luck in my time.

270
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,300
I have seen a guy fill an inside straight flush

271
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,820
to beat four races.

272
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,940
I have seen a guy hit the daily double

273
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,280
for two solid weeks straight.

274
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,820
But I have never, at no time,

275
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,840
seen nothing like...

276
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,180
Bob.

277
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,700
This was later, of course,

278
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,780
when everything was finally hanging out.

279
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,060
Or as much of it as I guess

280
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,640
any of us will ever get to see.

281
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,060
Then we had to stop time

282
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,660
and use a time machine.

283
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,380
And then roll back and come in again.

284
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,720
To the days when Bob

285
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,140
was just a researcher

286
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,520
into someone else's fakery.

287
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,660
My personal feelings about Bob

288
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,340
are very mixed.

289
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,880
He has developed a fiction about his life.

290
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,540
And to destroy that fiction

291
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,980
would tear down the whole castle

292
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,000
that he's built of his illusions.

293
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
The illusion, for example,

294
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,180
that he has not broken any law.

295
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,540
Several months ago,

296
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,680
I read an article

297
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,420
about Bob.

298
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,380
And I was so impressed

299
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,200
that I decided to come from Minnesota

300
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,660
in the hope of meeting Bob.

301
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,080
And now,

302
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,940
I've become

303
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,860
his bodyguard.

304
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,700
He takes his duties seriously.

305
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,160
Bob himself swears that he goes in daily dread

306
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,060
of being murdered.

307
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,800
This takes us into murky waters

308
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,240
where the lawyers tell us we'd be rash

309
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,840
to go fishing.

310
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,760
There's just a hint or two

311
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,440
about this violence and danger

312
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,740
as a result of which

313
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,840
Bob, on top of all his other troubles,

314
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,500
is being sued for $55 million worth of slander.

315
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,740
Bob.

316
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,480
Interesting question.

317
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,520
Is Bob being sued for telling a pack of lies?

318
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,680
Then I guess you can keep right on through the looking glass

319
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,660
and believe that the book about Bob

320
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,180
is a pack of truth.

321
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
That Bob himself

322
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,820
is a fake.

323
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,240
Fake.

324
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,180
Let's leave it all alone.

325
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,300
I am stupidest when I try to be funny.

326
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,320
Yeah, I know what you mean, Al.

327
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,460
Okay, speaking of stupid and funny,

328
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,200
Dave?

329
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,740
Dave?

330
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,120
Yes?

331
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,360
That's what I thought.

332
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,140
Okay, everything's cool.

333
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,720
Everything's cool.

334
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,900
It's all copacetic.

335
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,200
Calm and collected.

336
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,760
The waves are slow and moving lovely.

337
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,720
There's nothing dangerous or scary

338
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,360
about the show at all anymore.

339
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,220
Now...

340
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,840
There's no birds smashing against the windows.

341
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,740
No children running down the streets screaming.

342
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,700
Oh, shucks.

343
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,100
I was hoping we'd have the children

344
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,740
running through the streets screaming.

345
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,720
Yeah.

346
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,500
So funny.

347
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,000
Well, it's lively.

348
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,500
If you look closely,

349
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,840
you will see a long, long string

350
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,500
of perhaps thousands,

351
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,460
a line of thousands of pig-like human beings.

352
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,740
I mean, they resemble kind of like pigs

353
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,100
as much as they do humans.

354
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,840
And they're all headed for this huge slaughterhouse.

355
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,840
They're all wearing little red beanies

356
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,660
and stuff like that.

357
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,380
Oh, you mean Americans?

358
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Did I say that?

359
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,660
Isn't that what you were describing?

360
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,320
Unfortunately, yes.

361
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,300
Sorry, I laughed out loud.

362
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,340
That's not funny.

363
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,880
I was trying to be funny without, yeah.

364
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,300
It's not funny.

365
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,480
I found it quite entertaining.

366
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,440
Ew.

367
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,040
Ew.

368
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,780
Ew.

369
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,360
Ew.

370
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:56,860


371
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,100
Ew.

372
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,480
Sounds squidsy.

373
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,020
Well, um...

374
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,780
Well, I'm...

375
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,900
Dave, are you back in town now?

376
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,860
Am I back in town?

377
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,460
But you are.

378
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:09,880
Yeah.

379
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,000
As of yesterday or tonight or whatever.

380
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,600
Yeah.

381
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah.

382
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,980
Yes, it was an eventful trip.

383
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,560
This is a live show, by the way,

384
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,720
live at this moment,

385
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,280
although it won't be live by the time...

386
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,680
You hear it.

387
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,020
You hear it.

388
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,380
But yeah, our winter...

389
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,740
We'll be alive by the time we hear this.

390
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,180
Most things will not be alive.

391
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,580
Our missionary outreach was truncated

392
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,300
and cut short by a leaky pipe in the basement

393
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,740
and the neighbor selling a condo

394
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,940
to Princess Wee's mom,

395
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
and we were out of money anyway,

396
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,700
and...

397
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,260
And it's all old folks taking a bath.

398
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


399
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


400
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


401
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


402
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


403
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


404
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


405
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


406
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


407
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


408
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


409
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


410
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


411
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


412
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


413
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


414
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,260


415
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,060
Taking care of old folks and blind leading the blind.

416
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,920
Yeah.

417
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,340
And people were trying to sell condoms at the same time.

418
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,580
Connie condoms.

419
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,620
Those did not sell.

420
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,560
Condoms?

421
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,880
For elderly people?

422
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,540
We never got a penny of royalties out of that condom company.

423
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,800
Top con it.

424
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm not kidding either.

425
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,000
There really was a company.

426
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,460
They had the Bob speech right on them.

427
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,120
Condomania licensed Bob Dobbs and Connie Dobbs

428
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,180
likeness for condoms,

429
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,240
and we are...

430
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,020
We never saw a penny.

431
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,400
Well...

432
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,920
And they don't make them anymore.

433
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,740
It was...

434
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,860
The image was only on the package.

435
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,160
Right.

436
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,340
It didn't get all warped when it was employed.

437
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,020
Right.

438
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,360
Yeah.

439
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,540
It wasn't done right.

440
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,300
The...

441
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,160
Well, but still...

442
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,660
Well, was it a delicate object

443
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,660
or perhaps something not so soluble in water

444
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,100
that could have protracted the illness?

445
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,940
Well, the way...

446
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,000
The right way to do a Bob Dobbs condom

447
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,440
would be to print the Dobbs head

448
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,220
on the inside of the condom

449
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,580
and then put it in the condom.

450
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:54,680
And then you would put the...

451
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,680


452
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,040
you would put the condom per se

453
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,400
in some sort of DMT and DMT...

454
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,160
Whatever that stuff is

455
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,440
that makes it soak into your skin.

456
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,960
Yeah, DMSO.

457
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,180
Right.

458
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,920
I remember what it is.

459
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,740
DMSO, right.

460
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,940
And you would stretch the Dobbs head

461
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,280
over the...

462
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,960
Head?

463
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,820
The scrawny area.

464
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,500
Yeah.

465
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,180
Or the...

466
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,120
The little tiny thing.

467
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,000
And then you'd...

468
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,040
And then it would look bigger, you know.

469
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,420
It would get distorted and twisted

470
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,660
and it would become even more distorted and twisted

471
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,220
as the end of the condom.

472
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,220


473
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,220


474
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,220


475
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,220


476
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,140
And then the ink would sink into your membranes.

477
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,700
Oh, that sounds delightful for the ladies, you know.

478
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,520
Get a little dose of Bob there.

479
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,200
Well, the Connie condom

480
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
would have the ink on the outside.

481
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,000
See, I guess to be...

482
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,760
to really get both partners off,

483
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,040
you put on the Bob one

484
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,680
followed by the Connie one.

485
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,220
The Bob one with the ink on the inside

486
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,340
and the Connie one with the ink on the outside.

487
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,000
That's like trying to play with two raincoats on.

488
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:52,940
Yeah.

489
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,700
Yeah, but we're talking about subgeniuses

490
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,600
and what's the difference.

491
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,380
They're not the most sensitive people in the world,

492
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,520
as you can tell by the way they treat each other.

493
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,200
Oh, I guess.

494
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,560
Yeah, I guess you're right.

495
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,940
Yes, that's a valuable lesson to be unheard

496
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,420
is how terribly they treat each other.

497
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,440
Smacking and slapping burbly each other constantly.

498
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,400
That's how they express love.

499
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,500
As if mimicking the monkeys of the wild east

500
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,340
and hanging out with the kind of people

501
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,780
that you couldn't introduce to your parents if you had an ear.

502
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,500
It's just...

503
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,200
But that's true yet you love.

504
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm not depressed about it.

505
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,140
I'm just commenting.

506
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,780
That music in the background.

507
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,140
That sounds like the second part of the movement.

508
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,580
And we'll be back after a brief intermission

509
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,580
with Carlos Loves Clingham,

510
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,320
starring with Genia Lowe.

511
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,000
Jean-François Roux as the baritone

512
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,820
and Adolf Hitler as the smiling man.

513
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,860
That was an unusual part for Hitler.

514
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,140
It was.

515
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,700
He was a short of stature.

516
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,040
A lot of neo-Nazis like to make him look 10ft tall,

517
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,980
but he was a scrawny little devil.

518
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, but he didn't do that many of the smiling man commercials.

519
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,240
No, he was always a frowning man.

520
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,480
Especially after J.R. Bob Dobbs throttled.

521
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,560
Hitler himself in his bunker.

522
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,400
Yes, that is how Hitler actually died.

523
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,300
Killed by the hands of J.R. Bob Dobbs, who hated him.

524
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,620
Because he had refused to buy...

525
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,700
The world would say, by the hands of Bob Dobbs.

526
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,060
Not many people understood what this really meant in the course of human evolution and history.

527
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,540
But you see, when Bob killed Hitler, he unleashed a packet of groin carriers

528
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,440
that live to this day in the backseat of my car.

529
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,580
Do you want to have them groin carriers in your backseat, brother? Sister?

530
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,500
I don't want those groin carriers.

531
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,500
That's why we needed Hitler to expunge the race of himself and all his friends.

532
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:16,280
Yes, but Bob Dobbs led the genocide of his own people, the subgeniuses, for their own good.

533
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,020
I...

534
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:17,660
He...

535
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,520
Killed them for their own good.

536
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,300
Indeed it was.

537
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,280
Well, the Inquisition used to do that.

538
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,240
Did you know that many of our leaders in public relations, people like Roger Ailes,

539
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,080
it is now revealed in recent books on the New York Times bestseller list,

540
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,400
that people like Roger Ailes and these other media magnates

541
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,000
are actual students of Lenny Reifenstahl.

542
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,640
And think, hey man, that's the way to do it.

543
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,860
That's what we want to do.

544
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,480
Well, she was a good filmmaker.

545
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,720
She was a very good propagandist.

546
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,820
Well, that's what I'm saying.

547
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,800
She felt bad about it afterwards.

548
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,140
Yeah.

549
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,760
She says.

550
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,500
They all say that.

551
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,340
Yeah.

552
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,840
We did not know.

553
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,520
Lenny Reifenstahl, for listeners who don't know, was the director who did the Triumph of the Will,

554
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,880
the documentary about the Olympics in Germany,

555
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,980
which was done up in...

556
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,880
in good German style.

557
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,780
And by the way, did you know Bob Dobbs appears in that film?

558
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,360
Bob is in the audience in Triumph of the Will

559
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,900
when I think Jesse Owens wins or whatever.

560
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,000
Wasn't that in that?

561
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,800
Oh, I think he was right next to Zelig on that.

562
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,200
Well, no, no.

563
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,740
I mean, that was a different...

564
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,700
You're thinking of a different Olympics.

565
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,260
Timeline?

566
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,320
Yeah, or something.

567
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,960
Zelig was there, but he said...

568
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,640
He's not in the shot that I'm thinking of.

569
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,760
Bob was not...

570
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,480
Bob is kind of like hovering in the background behind some other...

571
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,520
some Russian bigwigs, grinning like a fiend.

572
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,500
Two early SS guys come over and tell him to put that pipe out,

573
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,180
and they trounce him wildly like a pack of suitcases.

574
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,680
No, that wouldn't happen to Bob unless he wanted to be trounced,

575
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,900
because that's the nature of reality is it does whatever Bob happens to be wanting,

576
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,740
just by coincidence.

577
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
Isn't that funny?

578
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,380
Lucky, lucky, lucky old Bob.

579
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:23,860
Doesn't make me cry.

580
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
Yeah, it doesn't happen to...

581
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,700
And it happens at our expense.

582
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,440
He saps or siphons the luck off of us, the listeners,

583
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,780
and the yakkers on these shows.

584
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,660
He hurts them.

585
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,340
That's where his slack comes from.

586
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,400
He's an actor.

587
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,680
He hurts them.

588
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,660
He hurts them.

589
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,660
He hurts them.

590
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,840
Oh, you...

591
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
The Church of the Subgenius was mentioned.

592
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,120
Am I allowed to say it by the Federal Department of Agriculture?

593
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,240
Yeah, you said you were listening to actual radio?

594
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,920
Commercial radio with commercials?

595
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,520
Commercial radio.

596
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,200
Lenny Reifenstahl radio, yeah.

597
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,140
Yeah.

598
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,340
And, well, they said they had a guy on who had studied Rabbi Keduri,

599
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,580
and Rabbi Keduri claims that the name of the Messiah might be Jesus.

600
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,760
Not might, but is, according to them.

601
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,880
And he said, well...

602
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,220
Well, how does that make you feel?

603
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,060
Isn't that kind of weird or something like that?

604
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,020
And he goes, well, when Messiah comes and his name is known,

605
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,000
we won't care if his name is Bob.

606
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,360
And then Clyde Davis said, yeah, Church of the Subgenius,

607
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,880
and they both laughed roundly.

608
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,140
Or maybe another geometric shape.

609
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,840
I don't know.

610
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,140
That was on Clyde something's Ground Zero show.

611
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,000
Yes.

612
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:45,280
He used to have me on his show in the past, back in the day, in the previous century.

613
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
I was on his show three times.

614
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,320
I think.

615
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,640
We had a lot of fun.

616
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,000
Did you laugh roundly or rhomboidly?

617
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,240
Well, we didn't talk about...

618
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,920
Yeah, rhomboidly.

619
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,680
Rhomboidly.

620
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,040
We didn't talk about politics.

621
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,560
And apparently, from what Dave says, that's a good thing.

622
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,540
Well, he wants to be like everybody.

623
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,020
On commercial radio.

624
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,780
On commercial radio.

625
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,120
Yeah.

626
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,020
He wants to be the weird one of the same, you know...

627
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,200
And what about Benghazi, hey?

628
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:12,920
Hey!

629
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,260
What about the witchcraft?

630
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,940
The Hillary Clinton and Benghazi minions.

631
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,580
Ah, at least your pants are full now, comrade.

632
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,920
You can see clearly.

633
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:32,500
So full.

634
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,540
And warm.

635
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,120
And smelting.

636
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,760
Look off into the distance.

637
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,200
Thousands of tanks on their way to Cleveland.

638
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,860
There to clean up the dirty work others have left behind.

639
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,480
They're just coming to get that skunk out of our basement.

640
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,000
Which we discovered...

641
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,040
I think I discovered that there is a skunk in our basement

642
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,180
just as we were leaving the house for this show.

643
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,140
Yes, we're currently having a bicker about that.

644
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,380
Yeah, she thinks that the skunk smell is just hovering around

645
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,780
just inside this one part of the house.

646
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,200
And I think the skunk itself is hovering around there.

647
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,940
You may have to call some sort of Russian terror expert

648
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,200
because I guess they're real good at this stuff right now.

649
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,860
And get in there and get that skunk out.

650
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,100
And get him out of there.

651
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,660
Rousting them skunks out.

652
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,600
Well, so far he's been...

653
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,420
I don't think he means to stink us out.

654
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,600
He's down there reading my old National Lampins

655
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,220
and Buff magazines.

656
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,240
And then suddenly he'll...

657
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,200
You know, one of us will slam a lid down in the kitchen

658
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,060
or stomp around or throw a...

659
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,300
A tantrum?

660
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,420
Yeah, a large ironing board or something across the room.

661
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,300
And that startles the skunk.

662
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,220
In our basement.

663
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,200
And he kind of squirts a little bit and goes,

664
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,020
Oh, gosh, I didn't mean to do that.

665
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,080
I don't want him to poison and trap me and get me out of here.

666
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,040
I really like it here.

667
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
You better keep it down a little bit.

668
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,480
I just hope he's not making a bed in the children's artwork box.

669
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,640
Oh, my gosh.

670
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,080
That would be terrible.

671
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,400
If Fred and Willie and Janet didn't have enough crayons,

672
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,600
they were all...

673
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,620
Oh, man.

674
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,200
Oh, man.

675
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,240
Oh, man.

676
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,260


677
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,260


678
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,260


679
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,260


680
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,260


681
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,260


682
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,260


683
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,260


684
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,980
Remember that band, Stinky Crayons?

685
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,020
And the troubles they caused throughout the land.

686
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,820
Well, old folks get to be like that.

687
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,360
Yep.

688
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,660
You know?

689
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,560
When they don't have their crayons or their diapers,

690
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,700
they get all upset.

691
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,180
And as we should know,

692
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,860
because this is the year of the old folks taking care of older folks.

693
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,800
The reason I say that is because I'm one of the old folks.

694
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,900
Me too.

695
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm not being taken care of yet.

696
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
But I'm now.

697
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:46,580
Next.

698
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,840
I get the message from God that that's what, you know,

699
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,920
because we're starting to be concerned about our parents.

700
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,000
You know, they're getting on in years.

701
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,180
And I'm 60.

702
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,820
So, oh, well.

703
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:08,600
Next it'll be me that they have to get the power of attorney form signed.

704
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:15,280
Dad, you haven't paid your bills in seven years now.

705
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,460
And they're starting to call me.

706
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,540
So sign here and here and here and here.

707
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,260
Oh, thank God.

708
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,560
He signed here and here and here.

709
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:30,180
Let's take this papers over to the judge and have Reverend Stang sent to the old subgenius home.

710
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,940
Where the blind literally do lead the blind.

711
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,940
Well, they do have the special glasses anyway.

712
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,580
The blind.

713
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,960
I mean, the select few.

714
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,620
You get free Google glasses at the subgenius old.

715
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah.

716
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,020
If you're blind.

717
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,860
So that other people can see what you would have seen during the day.

718
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,560
If they really want to play it back.

719
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,000
Well, I have a brief heartwarming story.

720
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:03,760
I did a story for a small local newspaper about World War Two veterans telling their tales from World War Two and stuff like that.

721
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:11,040
And while they're all sitting around, there are a bunch of 90 year old men who were looking at a 50 year old waitress and making noises.

722
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
They were saying, is the babe coming back?

723
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,680
Get her to come back.

724
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,780
Give us some more coffee.

725
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,920
She turned around.

726
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,940
They would all look at her derriere.

727
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,240
I was.

728
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,780
I was.

729
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,040
I was a healthy old dudes.

730
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
How were these guys like in their 70s, 80s?

731
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,180
They were in their 90s.

732
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,860
I said, OK, well, then they're doing well.

733
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,480
I'm still interested in a young 50 year old dame.

734
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,880
She's only 50 years young.

735
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,720
I love that.

736
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,740
More of the story.

737
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,960
I like this story.

738
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,280
It's warming the cockles.

739
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,400
My friend is only 50 years.

740
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,000
Young.

741
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,940
Look, you know, I'm 60 and I don't think 50 is young.

742
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,980
Well, I think 20 is young.

743
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,420
50 is old.

744
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,160
I have thought they're older than most people in this land.

745
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,880
Yeah, I know.

746
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,120
It's clear.

747
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,320
Very clear.

748
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:11,700
But the part about that got me so thrilled and excited was that these 90 year old gentlemen were really.

749
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
I was.

750
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,520
Well, let's put it.

751
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:14,860
This way.

752
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,640
In many ways, I was chagrined to be at a table where like 90 year olds were popping bees and so forth.

753
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:28,620
As they say, used to say in high school and pointing like that and making comments and having to keep them quiet.

754
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,860
But on the other hand, I was so salubriated by the entire experience.

755
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,540
It just made me feel like there is something to live for after all.

756
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,260
Yeah.

757
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,440
What?

758
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,760
Great story.

759
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,980
When you're incompetent.

760
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,220
Roll.

761
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,600
Down your pants leg.

762
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,500
Yes.

763
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,260
Incompetent and in kind.

764
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,980
All those incontinental words spring to mind.

765
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,720
Guess that's what happens to your brain.

766
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,900
If your brain surface down, surfs down the in confidence highway.

767
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,400
Or something.

768
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,100
Takes a left at the torso in middle evacuation center.

769
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,480
Jumps off a brief.

770
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,020
Brief.

771
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,080
Skipping a jump from the.

772
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,740
Turt Willie's National Monument, which is located now in Brook Park on South Park Road.

773
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,740
And enjoys a chicken sandwich while he's watching the whole debacle while everything just falls apart around him.

774
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,120
That's not funny.

775
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,900
Nothing's funny anymore.

776
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,920
Actually, it's horrible to try and make a life of comedy with everything.

777
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,100
Those who have angst.

778
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,760
Nausea.

779
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,820
Well, it doesn't all the time, does it?

780
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,000
Well, you tell a joke and you smile.

781
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,080
The other person laughs.

782
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,560
You realize you've done your job, but there's no laughter for you, for me, for we.

783
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,020
I didn't tell.

784
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,560
The other is.

785
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,380
We.

786
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,020
The other is.

787
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,240
We're laughing at you, Dave.

788
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,520
We're not laughing with you.

789
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
We're laughing at you.

790
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,740
That's why we're so joyful.

791
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,920
Didn't we?

792
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,740
Weren't we informed by a very reliable source that if we wanted to get.

793
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,680
Really.

794
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,600
Really depressed that we should have a talk with some comedians?

795
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:24,340
Well, that's a Hollywood joke is if you want to have a really depressing party, invite over all the comedy writers.

796
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:24,760
Right.

797
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,680
But that's what they say.

798
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,080
If you like it really dark.

799
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,240
Yeah.

800
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,480
Bring the comedians in.

801
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,260
A lot of O.C. people with big weird stains on their necks and stuff.

802
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,780
A lot of people arguing over nothing at all.

803
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,640
Oh, man.

804
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,460
I remember the last one I was invited.

805
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,600
To I had to get the hell out of there.

806
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,580
I couldn't take it.

807
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,980
There's too many uptight people, too many freaked out people.

808
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,080
What?

809
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,380
The Hollywood comedy writers party that you got kicked out of.

810
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:55,940
Yeah.

811
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,460
When you were trying to get a job writing for The Simpsons or Futurama and they kicked you out.

812
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,080
Well, as you know, I am an ancient person.

813
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,120
So it was before that.

814
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,560
Yes.

815
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,720
You shouldn't have mentioned Church of the Subgenius.

816
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,600
I told you, man.

817
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,920
That's a kiss of death in a job interview.

818
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,080
It is.

819
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,580
It is.

820
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,660
Oh, yeah.

821
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,080
Yeah.

822
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,620
Which means, oh, no.

823
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,920
You know, here's the funny thing.

824
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:29,320
I met Matt Greinig, the founder of The Simpsons and Futurama at a time when I was more famous

825
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,280
than he was.

826
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:39,380
Because his cartoon Life in Hell had just been syndicated for the first time to another

827
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,800
paper outside of L.A.

828
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,660
And that was he thought that was brilliant.

829
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,240
Really big deal.

830
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,780
Whereas I was a book author.

831
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:55,380
See, I lowered myself to have a burger with with this newbie guy, Matt Greinig.

832
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,800
And who is that other guy?

833
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:01,160
Gary Panter, who later got an Emmy for designing Pee Wee's Playhouse.

834
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah.

835
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,180
Hey, Owie.

836
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,620
Dirty rotten guy who made it back when we were all trying to make it.

837
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,640
Well, you know, Bob ended up on Pee Wee's Playhouse, but I didn't.

838
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,640
And and I'm very thankful for that.

839
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,540
And I'm very thankful, frankly, that The Simpsons has never mentioned Church of the Subgenius,

840
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,900
because if if they do, that means you've probably jumped the shark.

841
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,440
And we threw the shark under the bus in order to prevent that happening.

842
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:37,780
So that's why we're hoping to cruise on through to the other side, sleep on through to the

843
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,620
other side, as we retirees like to say.

844
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,620
Now, everything's going to be okay.

845
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:49,460
Everybody's parents are croaking and dying and sometimes not even parents, just friends,

846
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,900
siblings and stuff.

847
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,260
And our friend, Reverend Dow Jones, said that...

848
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,500
Well, he's an average, isn't he?

849
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,060
He's average.

850
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,120
He said that this this upcoming X Day must be the real one.

851
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,840
This must be 1998 because so many of our friends and loved ones are dying.

852
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,620
It makes it easier to kiss this rock goodbye on July 5th.

853
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,560
True words were never spoke.

854
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:17,940
Yeah.

855
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,960
Well, I mean, not true, but...

856
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,760
See, Bob's killing off our loved ones so that we'll be happy to leave the planet.

857
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,900
Thanks, Bob.

858
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,840
Thanks, Bob.

859
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,400
Thanks, Obama.

860
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,020
Hey, there's another one of those ringtone laughs, folks.

861
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,440
Ringtone laugh.

862
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,860
Yeah, with a bunch of surf music in the background.

863
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,120
What is this stuff?

864
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,600
I've been playing this for a while.

865
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:43,600


866
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:43,600


867
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:43,600


868
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,720
Surf Dungeon in the background.

869
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,460
Oh, I didn't give credits for all those collages at the beginning of the show.

870
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Oh, no.

871
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,360
Well, that's what happens when Dave calls.

872
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:53,780
That's a lot of pastry.

873
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,020
Well, that's a lot of pastry to waste.

874
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,300
Well, you didn't hear it, Dave, but for the first 15 minutes of the show, there was a

875
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:09,140
collage work editing, and it was all done by one subgenius, the great Reverend Exister

876
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,580
of formerly Ministry of Slack podcast show.

877
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:13,580


878
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,320
Praise Reverend Exister.

879
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,500
I don't think it happens anymore, but luckily, Reverend Exister was still editing, and he's

880
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,360
made ... I just played a fraction of the stuff he sent me, so future shows will have more

881
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,760
mixes and cram-ups by Reverend Exister.

882
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,320
Praise Reverend Exister.

883
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,360
Indeed.

884
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:43,560
He came to the first X Day at Drill at Wisteria, but he couldn't ... He's from a nice, clean

885
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:43,560


886
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:43,920
environment.

887
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,660
It was the second one that he couldn't stay for.

888
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,200
Yeah, that's right.

889
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,760
It was when we got the freakish heat wave.

890
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,180
Yes.

891
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,900
He had to leave because he's from California, and he's only known nice weather.

892
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,160
He had driven to Southern Ohio from California in his little red sports car.

893
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,300
Yeah, just to see Bob.

894
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,440
What did Bob do?

895
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,960
Bob gave him heat stroke.

896
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,460
Yeah.

897
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,320
Yeah.

898
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,700
Yeah.

899
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,460
It was mean.

900
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,560
Mean Bob.

901
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,480
Bob was mean.

902
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,240
Mean Bob.

903
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,060
He was pink Bob with no pipe.

904
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,240
Yeah, I think it's about time for the reign of Bob to end in a lot of ways because he's

905
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,400
just causing so ... He's just constantly causing so much trouble.

906
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,740
He's just ripping and rupping and whooping and a whooping and going around and smacking

907
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,200
people upside the head with all kinds of mortality and sickness and disease.

908
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,860
Well, it's supposed to be cold, so I imagine the reign of Bob will turn into the snow and

909
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,220
sleet of Bob soon.

910
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,120
Yeah, probably.

911
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,260
We won't have to worry about the reign of Bob anymore, the puddles of Bob left behind.

912
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,940
Unlike so many little old ladies, we won't find Bob the next morning frozen to the ground

913
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,000
with his mail in his hand.

914
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,360
I thought we weren't going to talk about that, Dave.

915
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,440
When I said his mail in his hand, I wasn't talking about that.

916
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,420
I meant with his ... The Sears catalog.

917
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,180
Yeah, I know.

918
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,620
Yeah, yeah, the Sears catalog.

919
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,000
Right.

920
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,880
Well ...

921
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:16,980
Which he was going to take to the Mark Twain era outhouse and blow the damn thing up in

922
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,100
the name of something.

923
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,740
I don't know.

924
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,140
I'm sorry.

925
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,820
I'm sorry.

926
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,060
Yes, indeed.

927
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,020
Wow.

928
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:30,340
Oh, speaking of everything that's not connected to this, there's going to be another

929
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,620
devotional.

930
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:38,600
That is the sort of convention of Devo fanatics and fans like Prince Harry.

931
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:38,600


932
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:38,940
Yeah.

933
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:57,520
I mean, we're going to be out, you know, at HBO, an annual movie outs or something

934
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,840
like that, maybe number one in Wanna HIS drinking party.

935
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,340
Had a second

936
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:01,340


937
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:01,520
Oh, yeah.

938
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,560
Absolutely.

939
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,580
I do love your show.

940
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,100
But, uh...

941
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,500
Well, they take no offense.

942
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,520
No, they don't even notice us anymore.

943
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,280
They don't notice anything anymore.

944
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,220
I think that's what the touting is all about.

945
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,500
They're so rich and famous now and old.

946
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,240
Flagrant.

947
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,900
Just like 1% of the...

948
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,140
The old divos.

949
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,260
Yeah, the 1% of the old divos.

950
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,340
Like a halibut in the rain, you know?

951
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,680
Just saying, hey, what's the purpose?

952
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,840
What's the fixation, June?

953
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,300
Right, like a halibut riding a bike in the rain.

954
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,120
The divas are old.

955
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,940
Those guys have got to be at least five years older than me.

956
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,300
So that means they're all 65 to 70.

957
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:45,900
Yeah.

958
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,280
You think Mark Mothersbaugh is almost 70?

959
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
You think that's possible?

960
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,600
It's possible.

961
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,560
He once said to me, Mark Mothersbaugh said to me,

962
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,900
yeah, that sounds like something a 35-year-old would say.

963
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,580
As if I was a baby at age 35.

964
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,260
Which I kind of was.

965
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,560
Even though I had raised two of them at the time.

966
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,420
Well, was he much older or much younger than you at the time?

967
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,400
No, he's a little older.

968
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,060
I think those guys are about five years older.

969
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,000
Which would put him at 65 or so.

970
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,140
Dave's age, in other words.

971
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,140
Old, like Hal.

972
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,080
Dave, Mr. Sister.

973
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,320
Philo.

974
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,700
Those really old people.

975
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,220
Uh-huh.

976
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:33,160
And then there's the really old subgeniuses like G. Gordon Gordon and Reverend Root.

977
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:33,820
Reverend...

978
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:33,820


979
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:33,820


980
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:33,820


981
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,940
And Enoch Root, who've been around since Bob.

982
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Both those guys used to hang out with Bob.

983
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,580
That's what I've heard.

984
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,780
I heard the...

985
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,800
And also, I heard they had big book deals and nothing ever happened, too.

986
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,040
Right.

987
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,180
Nobody cared.

988
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,300
Nobody cared.

989
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,440
Well, we both will.

990
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,600
We know all about that, don't we, Dave?

991
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,840
All of our book deals that nobody cares about.

992
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,760
Until we're dead.

993
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,060
After we're dead, then we find out, oh, everybody loved those books.

994
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,400
And we would have bought them.

995
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,740
We would have bought them if they'd known about them.

996
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,460
Now they're buying them, now that we're dead.

997
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,700
Yeah, we would have bought them.

998
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,240
Ever since they made that movie.

999
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,980
Well, go ahead.

1000
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,980
Go ahead and do what?

1001
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,960
You were just about to bring down hell and brimstone and fire and stuff on You Know What.

1002
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,940
No, I wasn't.

1003
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,620
Oh, I was.

1004
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,900
Well, then you better pick up on it.

1005
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,280
I'm sorry.

1006
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,620
Whatever I was going to say, you better believe it, dude.

1007
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,220
Well, it's just the same kind of mentality.

1008
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,640
It's like a fire across the land, creeping in.

1009
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,940
It was like a fuzzy aperture or something, like stuck to your head and you can't get in, you can't get out.

1010
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,420
You know, he's like...

1011
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,160
A sphincter that never opens at the right time.

1012
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,380
Right in the middle of your forehead.

1013
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,500
Yeah.

1014
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,400
Fuzzy aperture.

1015
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,800
Stuff leaks out when you didn't even mean to do anything at all.

1016
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,760
You just reach up there and wipe your forehead.

1017
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,440
Ooh, the brown crayon.

1018
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,720
Gross.

1019
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,800
It's in through your eye.

1020
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,960
It'll make your eyes...

1021
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,780
When you get older, it's hard to keep that thing from leaking on your forehead.

1022
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,920
That little forehead sphincter will just keep...

1023
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,540
It gets weak.

1024
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,680
It's unsure of itself.

1025
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,720
Yeah, maybe yours is weak, but mine requires a lot of gauze.

1026
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
Yours has a very, very lot of gauze.

1027
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:22,600
A lot of gauze?

1028
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,280
A lot of gauze?

1029
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,020
Real lot of gauze?

1030
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,860
A lot of gauze and tape.

1031
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,100
Like a whole, whole lot of gauze?

1032
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,500
A whole freaking lot.

1033
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,360
Oh, man.

1034
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,720
Dave, tell me his...

1035
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:32,900
What do you mean?

1036
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,720
His third eye is growing back.

1037
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,780
You know, that bump?

1038
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,220
Oh, no!

1039
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,180
Oh, yeah, and it has an eyeball this time, too.

1040
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,940
And eyeball is like looking around.

1041
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,080
So, I'm having a hard time controlling my throat for oxygen right now.

1042
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,620
Well, what about the mean baby head on the back of your head?

1043
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,280
Oh, mean baby head kind of just went away without even telling me.

1044
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
You know, like I'm crazy or something.

1045
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,060
Well, there's a baby head on the back of my head.

1046
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,740
No, there's not, Dave.

1047
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,260
And then they give you a mirror.

1048
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:02,700
Double back.

1049
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,240
So, if you look at the back of your head, which is, you know, and you...

1050
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,180
You mean the baby head is gone?

1051
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:08,960
Really gone?

1052
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:09,380
It's gone.

1053
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,320
It's gone.

1054
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,960
I don't know if it's really gone or if it's like someplace in my leg or my foot now.

1055
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,240
Could that mean that someday we could be free of Dick?

1056
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:23,240
Bob could lose Dick, his twin brother, vestigial parasitic twin, on the back of his head?

1057
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,780
It's possible.

1058
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,400
I mean, I view it as a positive sign.

1059
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,440
There aren't very many positive signs, but this could be one of them.

1060
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,980
I'm only hoping for the best.

1061
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,060
I just, I've got my fingers, my knuckles, and my knees crossed.

1062
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,780
So, if you want to make speculation about what really happened to the baby,

1063
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,360
where the baby head went, you know, how it entertained itself over the last few months,

1064
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:55,120
and who it's controlling now, where it's located right at this moment, I don't know.

1065
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,400
Nobody cares about your double mean baby head, Dave.

1066
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,700
We're worried about the one that Bob has, Dick.

1067
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,700
I care about David's double mean.

1068
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,740
Double mean baby head?

1069
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,140
Dick is a problem.

1070
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,060
I agree with you.

1071
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:14,620
My baby head really just doesn't rate in comparison with the problems that Bob has had for so long.

1072
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:22,620
But Bob always acclimated to the situation and used it as part of a luck plane to, you know, do what he willed.

1073
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:32,680
Oh, did you know that the rock singer known as Ice-T, his band Bodyguard,

1074
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,560
they did a song about Dick Dobbs called Evil Dick.

1075
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,360
It was on, it's hard to find because it was on the Cop Killer album.

1076
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,020
So, you know, they hide the Cop Killer stuff.

1077
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,040
Well, so what?

1078
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,760
So they'll get some air time off the Cop Killer thing?

1079
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,800
No, no, it was mainly because of the Evil Dick song.

1080
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,640
The song about Bob's evil brother.

1081
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,940
I think there was a lot of confusion and that could have clarified things just like butter.

1082
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,080
Butter.

1083
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,260
It could have made everything really, really sweet.

1084
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,840
Clear.

1085
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,620
The glass.

1086
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,680
Clearer than glass.

1087
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,380
Clearer than the invisible man.

1088
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,020
Sweeter than blood.

1089
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,680
Hotter than a, oh, no.

1090
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,280
No more morbid stuff.

1091
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,700
Clearer than air.

1092
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,200
As violent as an egg and twice as tasty.

1093
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,300
And I pass this knowledge on to you.

1094
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:45,720
Sit in the front row, spread your legs and argue with each other.

1095
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,940
That's what I want.

1096
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,060
Conflict.

1097
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,880
No resolution.

1098
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,360
And I want to watch the entire time.

1099
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,860
Okay, girls, it's time to do jumping jacks.

1100
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,300
I love these violent eggs.

1101
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,880
It's really, it's scary.

1102
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,420
I...

1103
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,500
Violent eggs.

1104
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,760
Can you imagine the problems they're crossing?

1105
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,480
Can you imagine the air that we're living in?

1106
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,740
It's just incomprehensible.

1107
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,120
It is.

1108
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,820
It really is.

1109
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,280
It's hard to wrap your brain pan around.

1110
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,480
And some of them, like myself, have a third eye that's not doing them any good, too.

1111
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,540
And a shallow brain pan.

1112
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,340
Very, very shallow.

1113
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,680
With the muffin top hanging over.

1114
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,700
Yeah, really.

1115
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,340
Muffin top brain.

1116
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,420
Yep.

1117
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,800
That was a great band, muffin top brain.

1118
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,100
I could say not even get the brownie.

1119
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,580
Muffin top brain was pretty good.

1120
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,680
Well, their first three albums were.

1121
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,080
Yeah.

1122
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,800
After that, yeah, you know.

1123
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,720
They kind of got old.

1124
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,560
Yeah, they just...

1125
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:51,280
Yeah, track one with cranberries, track two with raisins, track three with prunes, you know.

1126
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,240
Yeah.

1127
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,260
Same old, same old.

1128
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:01,040
Well, that's what happened to a lot of sea rattle bands and a lot of Tacomaites and people out there in the Puget Sound area

1129
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,580
when they were coming up with their original...

1130
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,120
Original sound.

1131
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,780
And then the whole...

1132
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,440
Did you know?

1133
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,240
It's...

1134
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,500
By the way, I was wondering.

1135
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,640
Hello?

1136
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,000
Sorry.

1137
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:12,540
Yeah.

1138
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,100
Yeah.

1139
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,500
I was wondering.

1140
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,480
I sat on the wrong joy bus.

1141
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,720
Footprint?

1142
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,000
I was really wondering.

1143
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,120
Maybe this way, Sergeant.

1144
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,160
By this big tree.

1145
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:32,900
Hmm.

1146
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,240
Looks like someone's living inside.

1147
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,140
A wise old owl.

1148
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,920
Why, it's Bob Dobbs.

1149
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,440
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1150
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,560
Who is in that tree?

1151
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,540
The wise old owl.

1152
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,860
Smoking his pip-a-loony eye.

1153
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,540
Who is in the tree but Bob?

1154
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,440
Come back, come back.

1155
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:54,880
Come back, come back.

1156
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,420
Come back, come back.

1157
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,240
Oh, no, I stabbed myself.

1158
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,340
Oh.

1159
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,640
Poor, poor little...

1160
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,380
No, no, no stabbing.

1161
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,980
Please, no self-stabbing.

1162
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,320
I was just over-anxious with a toothpick

1163
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,560
and I drew some blood.

1164
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,440
Oh, no!

1165
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,260
Didn't you know Dave's a cutter?

1166
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:14,820
No.

1167
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,720
That's why he eats all those beans.

1168
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:17,800
No, man.

1169
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,120
He likes to.

1170
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,780
He's a cutter.

1171
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,820
He better not be a cutter.

1172
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,400
Yeah.

1173
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:21,920
No.

1174
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,760
If I'm a cutter and you're like beans

1175
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,840
and stuff like that,

1176
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,700
like what kind of bean are you talking about, man?

1177
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,480
You're the ones that make you cut a lot.

1178
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,480
No.

1179
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,320
But cheese?

1180
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,200
The cheese, Dave?

1181
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,520
Remember the cheese?

1182
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,400
I remember something about cheese.

1183
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,240
It was a little cloud coming to my neighborhood

1184
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,980
and I somehow was trying...

1185
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:47,820
It was a dream, maybe.

1186
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,540
It was a dream.

1187
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,780
I was warning the...

1188
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,460
No, no.

1189
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,340
That's another dream.

1190
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,560
To the maggot in the cheese.

1191
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,720
The cheese is the universe.

1192
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,860
I cut the cheese at Grandpa's Cheese Barn.

1193
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,980
Oh, yeah.

1194
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,200
We were going to talk about our adventures

1195
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,180
on our very truncated trip.

1196
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,260
You know, we had to get to Texas in seven minutes

1197
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:15,860
and we were late because of all the breakdowns.

1198
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,220
There was a breakdown of hope.

1199
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,160
Yes.

1200
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,760
There was a breakdown of hope.

1201
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,840
We were outside of Hope, Arkansas

1202
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,140
when we had a violent blowout.

1203
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,980
Really weird sounds started coming from the car

1204
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,720
and a vibration.

1205
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,560
That kind of tickled.

1206
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,300
And we pulled over

1207
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,780
and the tire was completely bitten to shreds

1208
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,700
by some huge truck monster.

1209
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,480
And we had to go...

1210
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,220
We had...

1211
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,980
Luckily, Hope was nearby.

1212
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,800
Hope, the birthplace of President Clinton.

1213
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,160
You had to take the synchronistic highway

1214
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,580
to avoid the little hamlet of despair there on the way.

1215
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,980
By the way, I've noticed the sign

1216
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,700
that gives the exit signs for Hope.

1217
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,440
Hope, Arkansas, are no longer covered

1218
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,380
with buckshot wounds and shotgun blasts.

1219
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,860
Yes, they must have replaced them.

1220
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,060
Oh, they were at one time?

1221
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:11,800
Well, they got tied.

1222
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,120
It's been so long since Clinton was president

1223
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,220
that they're not mad anymore.

1224
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,420
They've forgotten what they were mad about.

1225
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,540
Something about a cigar.

1226
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,520
That's all they know.

1227
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,420
So they quit shooting at the sign that says,

1228
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,180
Hope, birthplace of President Clinton.

1229
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,740
Riven's sign, bad.

1230
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,200
Heald's sign, good.

1231
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,640
Huh.

1232
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,680
Hmm.

1233
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,300
Well, that...

1234
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,960
To me, all I can think of is

1235
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,220
those former denizens of Hope there

1236
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,960
and their outbreak

1237
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,280
against our presidential leader in the past

1238
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,960
can only lead me to say that they

1239
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,440
have little, if anything, to do with J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1240
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,160
Right now,

1241
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,580
you know, when my mind goes blank,

1242
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,320
or yours,

1243
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,260
that's the first thing that emerges

1244
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,620
from the haze.

1245
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,700
And there it is.

1246
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,360
An image.

1247
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,260
A swollen monkey

1248
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,100
arguing in the rain.

1249
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,540
More arguments.

1250
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,800
You this, I that, we they.

1251
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,160
Mm-hmm.

1252
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,480
Coming back now.

1253
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:09,980
It's all...

1254
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,020
And what...

1255
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,260
What of the swollen orangutan?

1256
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,260
Orangutan?

1257
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,820
Yes, what of the swollen orangutan?

1258
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,380
Right next to the trapezoid.

1259
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:21,580
See how...

1260
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,460
This is a weird radio show.

1261
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,340
And the obelisk.

1262
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,040
I...

1263
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,740
I'm having...

1264
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,220
Listener, I too am having trouble following this.

1265
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,200
If you stir...

1266
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,580
If you stir some craisins in,

1267
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,940
it makes it much better.

1268
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,660
I guess that's why they follow Bob

1269
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,340
and not me.

1270
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,080
I guess that explains it.

1271
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,840
Now, don't it?

1272
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,340
I'm not following none of this.

1273
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,400
Well, Bob...

1274
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,440
Better not follow me.

1275
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,440
I don't know nothing.

1276
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,400
You've always talked about

1277
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,820
the phallicness of the pipe.

1278
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,440
And we mentioned the obelisks.

1279
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,640
Along with the tangential humor

1280
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,600
and the, you know,

1281
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,320
the other problems we all face

1282
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,180
and everything like...

1283
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,360
Oh, well, thanks for explaining

1284
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,200
all those references,

1285
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,980
Professor Lonesome.

1286
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,420
But I didn't know that...

1287
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,220
I didn't...

1288
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,360
I had never analyzed

1289
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,520
the random humor.

1290
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,280
Oh, somebody told us

1291
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,280
they liked the show,

1292
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,240
this show.

1293
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,240
They said,

1294
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,880
I like the random stuff.

1295
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:14,980
And I thought,

1296
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,580
what?

1297
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,160
What randoms?

1298
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,320
Every bit of this

1299
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,380
is carefully scripted.

1300
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,900
It's like...

1301
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,640
That is definitely disrespectful.

1302
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,360
Random?

1303
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,120
That is disrespectful.

1304
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,060
And we've tried for years

1305
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,480
and years to make...

1306
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,060
Awesome.

1307
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,580
Good old...

1308
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:30,920
This...

1309
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,180
This...

1310
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:31,180


1311
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:31,660
Therefore...

1312
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:31,960
Random.

1313
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,840
Common science says...

1314
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,760
Carefully crafted.

1315
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,520
Did we know the argument?

1316
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,360
Random?

1317
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,300
I mean...

1318
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:38,760
How?

1319
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,240
How?

1320
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,500
Master logicians.

1321
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,720
We can argue with the Pope

1322
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,900
if we feel like it.

1323
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,420
Well, master logicians,

1324
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,040
don't...

1325
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,100
Don't you dare

1326
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,120
think any other way.

1327
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,040
Oh, there's Dr. Sinister

1328
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,920
just come in

1329
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,900
to serve his time.

1330
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,380
He's so sinister.

1331
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,180
Oh!

1332
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,660
He's got to serve

1333
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,980
his two hours.

1334
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,760
We've almost...

1335
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,060
Almost served our...

1336
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,420
Hour of...

1337
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,860
Of lack.

1338
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:07,520
And like that

1339
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,780
for the pig denizens

1340
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,180
with their red hats

1341
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,960
marching obliviously off

1342
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,020
into oblivion

1343
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,160
and set beyond

1344
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,980
and waiting

1345
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,280
the great squeal.

1346
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,720
The big butcher

1347
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,420
coming back.

1348
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,700
I'm sorry.

1349
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,240
Oh, the surf band

1350
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:25,920
in the background.

1351
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,460
The surf band

1352
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,140
in the background

1353
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,760
was the cocktail preachers

1354
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:30,680
doing.

1355
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,580
Bailout.

1356
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,180
Speaking of surf bands,

1357
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,100
isn't it Reverend

1358
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,240
Angry Larry's birthday?

1359
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,320
It indeed is.

1360
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:36,880
And he's the...

1361
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,000
He's like the main groupie

1362
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,060
for that famous

1363
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,100
thrash punk surf band

1364
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,700
The Amino Acids.

1365
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,040
Yes.

1366
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,560
He's like a roadie

1367
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,460
or something for them.

1368
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,420
And this show

1369
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,620
is dedicated to him

1370
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,240
because it's his birthday today.

1371
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,500
Aw.

1372
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,880
What about anybody else

1373
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,040
who happens to have it?

1374
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,580
Come on, kids.

1375
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:55,980
That's all.

1376
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,320
Bring the happy birthday stuff.

1377
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,020
And it's also dedicated

1378
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,280
to anyone else

1379
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,600
whose birthday it is today.

1380
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,020
It was my little daughter's

1381
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:02,320
birthday.

1382
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,320
Yesterday, wasn't it

1383
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,140
my daughter's,

1384
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,240
my dafter's birthday?

1385
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,660
Yes, it was your dafter's

1386
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,340
birthday yesterday.

1387
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,040
Well, soon it will be

1388
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,000
the sign of the pickled emu.

1389
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,560
That was a great bar.

1390
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,340
The pickled emu.

1391
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,780
Yeah.

1392
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,080
And the world's end.

1393
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,160
I remember good times

1394
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,180
with the pickled emu.

1395
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,980
If you're a rhomboid shape

1396
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,460
or, I mean,

1397
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,740
if you're a rhomboid shape,

1398
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:30,740


1399
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,080
let's say if your moon

1400
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,580
is square to your conjunct,

1401
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,360
then you have the bad,

1402
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,820
what do they call it,

1403
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,560
the aspects,

1404
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,840
the bad aspects

1405
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,960
of Bob Dobbs.

1406
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,860
Well, this isn't the moon.

1407
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,200
This is the dweezil

1408
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,160
in the background.

1409
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,740
And I didn't know

1410
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,060
that you had opened

1411
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,660
the conversation to junk.

1412
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,440
You said something

1413
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,320
about adjunct?

1414
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,720
I don't be talking

1415
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,460
about my junk.

1416
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,240
A package?

1417
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,900
A package.

1418
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,020
A package, yes.

1419
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,380
Of junk.

1420
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,900
A horrible, stinking sack

1421
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,700
of packages of junk.

1422
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,060
Gross.

1423
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,520
Well, enough about Bob and me.

1424
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,960
Let's get more elevated.

1425
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,280
I guess.

1426
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,280
If you say so.

1427
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,900
Actually, it's coming now

1428
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,260
near the end of the hour of slack.

1429
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,480
It's coming.

1430
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,060
I can tell you

1431
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,040
only that this is the show,

1432
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,740
if we may call it,

1433
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,380
that is sponsored

1434
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,780
by the Church of the Subgenius

1435
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,820
out of Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1436
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,780
And we're almost done here.

1437
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,720
Thank goodness.

1438
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,360
And we'd just like

1439
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,480
some of our other

1440
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,120
more mundane and also,

1441
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,960
but yet still invisible sponsors

1442
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,200
like the Kingdom of Lucifer.

1443
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:51,320
Sure, man.

1444
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,760
And Holy Hands of the Unwashed.

1445
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:57,200
The Church of Destruction

1446
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,620
of Little Tiny Small Babies.

1447
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,740
That's subgenius.

1448
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,660
dot com.

1449
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,380
That subgenius doesn't have an O in it.

1450
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,700
The Church of the guys who go and spit

1451
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,380
angrily upon the sidewalk

1452
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,520
as they pass a conventional church

1453
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,260
and shake their fist angrily to the sky.

1454
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,800
Oh, it's not always like that.

1455
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,500
I don't know.

1456
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,180
Nah.

1457
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,620
We're not all like that.

1458
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,020
No, not at all.

1459
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,640
Nah.

1460
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,000
In fact, the opposite is,

1461
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,960
well, we're not all there.

1462
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,640
OK, Dave, we're not all going to be here at all now

1463
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,560
because I'm going to leave us.

1464
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,480
Now and you won't.

1465
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,040
And that's the way I hear it.

1466
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,200
There's many issues for.

1467
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,620
That's the way it is.

1468
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,300
We'll leave.

1469
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,340
We'll leave the light on for you.

1470
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,360
We'll see you, Dave.

1471
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,840
OK, well, be sure to use your propane heater

1472
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,120
in a very small space.

1473
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,860
Mom will be pleased.

1474
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,760
I brought all of these souls to him.

1475
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,960
I I taught them his worship.

1476
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,480
I corrupted them for him.

1477
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,460
I knew he was supreme when no one else did.

1478
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,460
I built a chapel.

1479
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:00,680
To.

1480
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,000
Wow.

1481
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,600
And I prayed to him and I made a pact with him.

1482
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,040
And these all of my friends, I I promised them safety.

1483
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,160
You presumed too much.

1484
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,340
I know. I know.

1485
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,580
But it does make a fine jest, the kind of jest that would amuse.

1486
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:17,660
Would it?

1487
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:19,540
Your Excellency.

1488
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,460
I have no title.

1489
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,740
Why do you call me Excellency?

1490
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,000
Well, I thought as the ambassador of.

1491
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,100
Wow. Wow.

1492
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,180
Is not my master.

1493
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,520
Death has no master.

1494
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,140
But Bob rules the universe.

1495
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,140
I made a pact with him.

1496
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,500
And your pact with him will not save you.

1497
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,040
There is no other God.

1498
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,480
Each man creates his own God for himself.

1499
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,280
His own heaven.

1500
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,040
His own hell.

1501
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,800
Let me see your face.

1502
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:58,920
No.

1503
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,660
No.

1504
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,500
No.

1505
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:00,700
No.

1506
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,440
So what I'm saying is brothers and sisters, sure, be a good subjeet.

1507
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,980
Yes, but don't rush it.

1508
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,540
You got to play it cool.

1509
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,880
Pace yourself if you want to last all night.

1510
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,300
Maybe even play a little hard to get.

1511
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,100
Let Bob into your heart gradually.

1512
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:25,980
But pull back right before you reach complete spiritual satisfaction.

1513
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,620
Trust me.

1514
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,080
It'll drive him two words.

1515
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:30,480
Two words.

1516
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,120
OH!

1517
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,120


1518
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,120


1519
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,980
$ixí, cr, ra, z'y.

1520
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,580
This guy knows what I'm talking about, right chief?

1521
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,560
Ooh hey, I gotta fly, so ah.

1522
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,040
Amen.

1523
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,740
Zag Resource deceit is gibbered eventually.

1524
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,620
Go andwer

1525
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:50,160
Go andwer

1526
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,800
Go andwer

1527
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,800
Wang

1528
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,260
Wang

1529
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,780
Wang

1530
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,040
Wang

1531
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:54,140
Wang

1532
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:54,220
Wang

1533
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:54,400
Wang

1534
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:54,560
belki

1535
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,820
Be a loser.

1536
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:00,200
Be a loser.

1537
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,120
Hop on, hop on, and we're gonna dance hard

1538
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:12,760
Hop on, hop on, hop on, and we're gonna dance hard

1539
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,840
Inches head, hop hop, hop hop, hop hop, hop hop

1540
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,100
Inches head, hop hop, hop hop, hop hop, hop hop

1541
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:40,060
Inches head, hop hop, hop hop, hop hop, hop hop

1542
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,100
For a tire, there is no limit

1543
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:05,680
No more money?

1544
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,120
We gotta get some money!

1545
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,960
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-back, flackin'

1546
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,300
Wharton, Phillip, Bunker, Burton,

1547
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,800
Perkaluma, Burton, Dutton, Buster, and I

1548
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,900
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1549
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,300
and we're even more glad that some listeners

1550
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,700
have donated enough to help us keep on going

1551
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,220
for another couple of months.

1552
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,700
Not just this show, but subgenius.com

1553
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,260
and all the other archive sites.

1554
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,780
But if you truly love Bob

1555
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,340
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you

1556
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,080
you should go to subgenius.com

1557
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,800
front page, or especially the radio page

1558
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,740
or the catalog store pages

1559
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,120
and help out financially as best you can.

1560
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,560
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink

1561
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,480
of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses

1562
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,160
to make their own situations worse.

1563
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,060
But some of you still have jobs.

1564
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,420
Even five bucks makes a big difference

1565
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,760
even if it's only five bucks.

1566
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,020
I mean, once a month from enough of you.

1567
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,420
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1568
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,260
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way

1569
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,180
of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1570
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,780
We also take checks and money orders to

1571
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,660
Subgenius Foundation.

1572
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:33,420
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44.

1573
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,160
118.

1574
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:41,380
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1575
