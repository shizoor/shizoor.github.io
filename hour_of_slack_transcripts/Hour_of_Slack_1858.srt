1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,420
Something familiar, something peculiar, something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:17,380
Something appealing, something appalling, something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:27,320
Nothing with kings, nothing with crowns, bring down the lovers, liars and clowns.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,760
Old situations, new complications, nothing portentous or polite.

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,280
Tragedy tomorrow, comedy tonight.

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:52,320
Something convulsive, something repulsive, something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

7
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,040
Something aesthetic, something frenetic.

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,000
Something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

9
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,720
Nothing with gods, nothing with fate.

10
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,200
Weighty affairs will just have to wait.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,940
Nothing that's formal, nothing that's normal.

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,820
No recitations to recite.

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,600
Open up the curtains!

14
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,540
Comedy tonight.

15
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,200
The Power of Slack.

16
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,380
The Power of Slack.

17
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,340
The Power of Slack.

18
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,980
The Power of Slack.

19
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,260
The Power of Slack.

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,060
The Power of Slack.

21
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:18,740
Put your hands up!

22
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:18,980
Curious.

23
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:19,980
Cupidity.

24
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,820
Timidity.

25
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,940
Mistakes.

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,500
Fraud.

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,080
Lies.

28
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,580
Lies.

29
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,220
Tumblers.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,760
Grumblers.

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,300
Bumblers.

32
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,860
Fumblers.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
Did you do service this morning?

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,540
And you obeyed.

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,040
Yes, I did.

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,900
So the pastor just prayed for me.

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,400
And I came this morning.

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,060
And I feel in my body that God has delivered me.

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,280
And he does.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,980
God, please.

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm going to show you how to pray.

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,400
Somebody pray to the Lord.

43
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,440
What did the Lord do for you today, honey?

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,220
The package is bent and dark yet.

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,580
I'm going to go back to the house of the Lord once again with me and my son.

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,960
My mother's home is here.

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,740
And I feel that God has touched me.

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,460
Do you believe God has touched you?

49
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,360
He has touched me.

50
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,740
Somebody give the Lord a hand clap.

51
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,540
Someone give the Lord the clap.

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,320
And we'll all sing this happy song.

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,140
You ask me why I sing all day long.

54
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,740
I'm oozing.

55
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,940
I'm oozing.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,920
I'm singing for my Jesus.

57
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,040
I'm oozing.

58
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,880
I'm free from sin.

59
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,100
I'm singing.

60
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,040
Yes, our Lord and Master Blaster Jesus H. Christ was not only a man of the cloth.

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,360
He was a man of the silk panties.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,780
He used to walk this way and that.

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,160
Up and down the Palestinian riverbed looking for beautiful young women.

64
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,840
What did he find among the rocks there?

65
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,800
He found nothing but desolation and estrogen.

66
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,300
He found rivers of estrogen and piles of pus.

67
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,080
But let's leave things of this world behind.

68
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,180
And walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,500
It's a squirting universe.

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:54,460
If you enjoy this verse of verses, we'll be open-ended for a Celestial

71
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,240
Then tasty area, very tasty area for the zoom and know that we're for you cheerful

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,100
arrogance minute if you close your eyes and then listen to me engage in him

73
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,400
because what's written on it on that sign is that he will sing stirring with strength

74
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,760
but get free from anything and out of room come undignified men in the house I'M the

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,480
Zer's

76
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,160
He got nothing but the libido.

77
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,160


78
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,160


79
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:11,200
S Geb mutation been lifted.

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,200


81
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,140
We're running in a whole 360 degree complex system, and it's gonna get rid ofוכ Garland

82
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,620
and it gets meGEU

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:13,920
just because all of you would want me to come clean.

84
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,400
We're gonna sing and we're all gonna love better.

85
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,400


86
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,980
friend, I've heard people call the church of the subgenius a joke, but I have to wonder,

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,140
is the subgenius church a joke, or is this world a joke? Bob Dobbs owns deed and title to the church,

88
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,240
but who owns deed and title to the world? Not Bob yet. I'm afraid not. The conspiracy

89
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,040
owns this world. Let there be slack, my friend.

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,580
I'm afraid not.

91
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,080
I've got an apartment complex, here at the apartment complex. I've got an apartment complex,

92
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,200
here at the apartment complex now.

93
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,200
Pre-set, competent, level, or lighting apartment life.

94
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,120
Couldn't be more exciting. Laundry room and clubhouse too.

95
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,400
I don't have a worry till my break comes through. Watching Sun and Beta max night after night

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,640
is a tidal wave of suburban delights. Hey, hey.

97
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,620
I've got an apartment complex, here at the apartment complex.

98
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,620
I've got an apartment complex, here at the apartment complex now.

99
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,600
Oh, I know you like to live in the complex, a middle-aged.

100
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,560
Tell you about it, it's so easy to see. Apartment life is such a current rage.

101
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,860
Well, you can make it here on the middle of the wage.

102
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:28,980
Ooh.

103
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,400
Ooh.

104
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,440
Ooh.

105
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:31,980


106
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:34,380


107
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,060
Ooh.

108
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,300
Ooh.

109
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:44,520
Ooh.

110
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,800
Ooh.

111
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,060
Ooh.

112
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,300
Ooh.

113
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,300


114
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,520


115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,220
Ooh.

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,300
My friends come over and they think you're so fine.

117
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,060
Well, they don't know none of it is mine.

118
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,220
Rental furniture and color TV.

119
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,040
None of my belongings belong to me.

120
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,680
For if life looks real critical, I'll play.

121
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,440
Cuz I always On a sim that I make to the bank.

122
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,160
Hey, hey, I've got an apartment complex here at the apartment complex.

123
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:13,340
I've got an apartment complex here at the apartment complex.

124
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,820
Cleveland State University with Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Day.

125
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,280
Special guest, guestess, princess, we are the dome.

126
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,260
And yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

127
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,820
Coming up, friends, we've got a sing-along with Onan Canobite.

128
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,400
Plus, many collages by Fernanda and Endely Murr.

129
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,140
In fact, all of the cut-ups.

130
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,340
From tonight's hour of Slack number 858 are by Lee Murr.

131
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,100
Except for one great big one near the end.

132
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,820
It's about alien invaders.

133
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:05,200
And speaking of alien invaders, check out this news item that was not covered very much on the mainstream media.

134
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:14,420
A federal rectal exam list intended to keep terrorists from smuggling drugs and explosives

135
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,000
aboard planes is snaring innocent people at most U.S. airports,

136
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:26,060
triggering complaints that civil liberties are being trampled and innocent assholes are being repeatedly violated.

137
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:33,480
And while several federal agencies acknowledge that they contribute names to the congressionally mandated list,

138
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,060
none of them could or would say which agency is responsible for managing the list,

139
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,220
except that they are known for, quote,

140
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,300
having a thing for that sort.

141
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,240
A representative thing, unquote.

142
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,760
Equally troubling is that to avoid accusations of racial profiling,

143
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:59,600
a blonde white woman is routinely selected for the intrusive and thorough anal exams from each flight,

144
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,040
often several times at the same airport while waiting for her flight.

145
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,880
In the instance where such a woman has several connecting flights,

146
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,860
she could be anally violated dozens of times in a single day,

147
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,420
said one attractive woman.

148
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,280
What's scariest to me is that there could be this gross interruption of civil rights

149
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,840
and nobody is really in charge,

150
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,060
but everybody wants to shove their fingers up your butt.

151
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:32,460
Nobody thought that 1984-ish America would be like an anal intruder's porn movie.

152
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,700
Well, friends, as New Monet said about that news report,

153
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,000
we have seen the future and it is...

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,720
UGH!

155
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,740
Ehh.

156
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,700
And the future continues.

157
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,200
Here in Cleveland, where we make this...

158
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,300
where we finally assemble this show,

159
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,980
we lost a newspaper.

160
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,420
The alternative weekly called the Free Times

161
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,100
was absorbed by the other weekly, leaving now

162
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,220
only one city in the United States that has two alternative weeklies.

163
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,920
I think that's Los Angeles.

164
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,220
Newspaper.

165
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,340
So all them people be going down the...

166
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,020
Communism!

167
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,120
Communism.

168
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,480
In communist countries, they only have one newspaper.

169
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,340
Communism is good.

170
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,400
Christianity is stupid.

171
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,420
In communist countries...

172
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,300
Communism is good.

173
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,800
People can't decide what the government's gonna do in the war zones.

174
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,840
And that's why I say this Bush man is a communist.

175
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,020
I'm amazed hearing that coming from a Texan.

176
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,900
The devil pretends to be good.

177
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,340
And communism...

178
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,840
And you know the damn meaning of the word,

179
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,900
Politarianism.

180
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,460
God dam...

181
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,200
Pretends to be a capitalist.

182
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,360
But it's communism...

183
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,300
Communism?

184
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,140
That is creeping into America.

185
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,380
I have felt the...

186
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, communism.

187
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:57,800
In the form...

188
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,940
Of...

189
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,440
Of capitalist capitalism.

190
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,080
I think it's also called couch potato-ism.

191
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,980
And the other muted hues...

192
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,040
Commons are coming!

193
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,000
And I feel that we are slipping slowly down the backslide...

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,960
Of a...

195
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,480
Of a...

196
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,780
Of a...

197
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:13,820
Of a...

198
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:13,820


199
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:13,820


200
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:13,820


201
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:13,820


202
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:13,820


203
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:13,820


204
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:13,820


205
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:13,820


206
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,700
Of becoming more common.

207
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,900
Of the nations that have gone before...

208
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,020
It's common.

209
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,080
It is creeping, communism.

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,220
Common men are everywhere and communists...

211
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,440
It is a form of Marxism, socialism, and all those other nasty, nasty words.

212
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,840
Common, come over here.

213
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,440
Common?

214
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,820
Please.

215
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,280
Communists and Nazis!

216
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,760
They're under my bed...

217
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,740
I like them there.

218
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,320
They're under every one of my beds.

219
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,280
Both of them.

220
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,920
Commies and Nazis.

221
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,060
And pinks.

222
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,360
And I don't mean pinkos.

223
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,880
And the Genghis Khan hoops.

224
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:43,880


225
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:43,880


226
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:43,880


227
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:43,880


228
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:43,880


229
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:43,880


230
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:43,880


231
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:43,880


232
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,220
Hordes, I like those uniforms too.

233
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:46,940
Humans!

234
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,540
Another low flyby.

235
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,640
We're still the next to go.

236
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,860
Stay sure once you can.

237
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,440
Another number came up.

238
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,200
I think it was 45.

239
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,900
We will bring them down.

240
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,640
Someday, their kind will fall,

241
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,080
and our kind shall rise up

242
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,000
out of the ditches and the holes.

243
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,080
Like a phoenix from the ashes,

244
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,300
we shall swarm skyward

245
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,720
and spute our maelstrom upon.

246
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,300
You're listening to WCSB Cleveland.

247
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,840
Let the humans laugh at us now.

248
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,960
Our time is coming.

249
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,820
Why, they still have teeth and jaws

250
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,420
and those tendons that go behind your chin

251
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,260
and nostrils.

252
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,540
There are no more teeth.

253
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,180
Radiation is our friend.

254
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,060
We eat uranium and old, rotten wires.

255
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,660
And we shall dispute them

256
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,980
at the nuclear plants.

257
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,800
We shall displace the humans.

258
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,280
We will...

259
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,260
We will be the new conspiracy.

260
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,440
There's a worm.

261
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,120
You can evacuate so easily

262
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,320
with just one thought.

263
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,540
It's like Gidget already went to...

264
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,700
The roaches shall be the new exterminators.

265
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,200
The new exterminators.

266
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,660
And the humans will be the bugs.

267
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,040
The shrimp.

268
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,560
The barbies.

269
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,220
The kinmen.

270
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,380
The soundboys.

271
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,480
We'll get and get them.

272
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,260
They must...

273
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,060
And all their friends.

274
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,180
Is your nightmare ending yet, man?

275
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,180
We should fame.

276
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,120
You've been tossing and turning for a long time.

277
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,860
We thought you were gonna break your collarbone arm.

278
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,900
But he comes by me hating fair and square.

279
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,780
Look, this one's got six toes.

280
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:30,440


281
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,000
We ain't named as long as you have.

282
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,380
Look at this one's eyes are sewn shut.

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,540
And no problems with him keeping dreaming.

284
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,600
No problem at all.

285
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,860
Stay asleep.

286
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,060
Don't...

287
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,160
Don't wake.

288
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,580
Don't...

289
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,320
Don't wake.

290
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,760
That...

291
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,460
That's the opposite message of...

292
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,480
This is about corporate accountability.

293
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,460
In this week, you'll find information about attacking President Bush's policies toward Iraq.

294
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,240
Just click for a leading clip.

295
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,200
Congressional Democrats stand in the corner.

296
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,300
Now a look at a Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill on the proposals to create kidnap children.

297
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,140
And later.

298
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,680
Officials from three consumer groups and their abductors, also known as spam.

299
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
And csss at noon.

300
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,480
Only on Book Ban 2.

301
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,240
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill talked about corporate accountability.

302
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,240
Joining us now at the table is Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill.

303
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:59,820
O'Neil. I go to a place where there's rampant corruption and see $100. Did you...

304
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,900
Tomorrow, the House Resources Committee will look at Gail Norton.

305
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,400
Did the...

306
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,260
I said it, Enron.

307
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,320
Did you see the picture in the paper? That guy's in his best suit.

308
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,480
Man, that's got to be a $2,000 suit he's wearing going to prison.

309
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,340
Did you see the stain on the back of that suit as he did that so-called perp walk?

310
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,660
That's a Bill Clinton stain if I ever saw one.

311
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,320
He was trying...

312
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,580
I know.

313
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:29,800
He was trying to...

314
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:29,800


315
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,980
He was trying to do a lepetomane as if that was going to get him off.

316
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,780
You know, some people think...

317
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,620
It kind of backfired.

318
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,480
Mm-hmm.

319
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:36,800
Yeah.

320
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,720
As it were.

321
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,000
Or bear backfired.

322
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,760
As it were.

323
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,740
Fred's out.

324
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,120
Who's mounted the little Lucifer puppy?

325
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,100
Bob's out.

326
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,240
Why is that a Bob, man?

327
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,620
I'm sorry, I just cut a Bob.

328
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,420
Bob's your uncle.

329
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm afraid you're going to have to step back to Lucifer.

330
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,800
It's like Bob is like this concept that's burned in...

331
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,340
to everything like, you know, a screen that has like, you know,

332
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,860
a little logo burned into it or something because it was on there too long, you know?

333
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,120
Those old computer screens.

334
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,340
Yeah.

335
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,480
It's like even when there's another pattern, Bob is underneath the pattern.

336
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,160
It's part of the wallpaper so you don't even see it.

337
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,480
Oh, that Bob weave, man.

338
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,900
That's a part of reality is the weave of...

339
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,880
The lattice of coincidence of Bob.

340
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,460
You know, that's...

341
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,780
It's like the woof and the warp of the...

342
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,840
The rockabilly wolf.

343
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,640
Fabric.

344
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:29,780
Fabric.

345
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,060
Man, that's Bob smiling, drooling.

346
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,400
You forget he's there until you start smelling the smoke from that pipe.

347
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,400
And this jet fuel.

348
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I'll just hear, like, sometimes now I'll just hear a certain, like...

349
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,820
Spinal threads.

350
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,240
One guitar note, one just little...

351
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,040
On a guitar, you know?

352
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,700
Yeah.

353
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,200
I'll hear that and I'll just know where...

354
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,940
There they go.

355
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,400
You know, the connection is.

356
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,840
The rainbow connection.

357
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,300
It's the rainbow connection.

358
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,620
With your spine.

359
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,880
They're taking off left and right.

360
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,040
It's the new age, man.

361
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,080
The new Aeon.

362
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,860
Yeah.

363
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,700
Just smile and wave as they go past.

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,780
I heard that they will be drinking Shaddam Hussein's spinal fluids at the Bohemian Grove.

365
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,520
Oh, and by the way, go down to that local...

366
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,500
As a special sacrifice.

367
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,640
That little deli on the corner that's owned by, you know...

368
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:18,900
Aries.

369
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,460
Aries.

370
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,340
Which deli?

371
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,100
Wait, which deli is that?

372
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,460
And go buy your American flag to put on your car.

373
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,620
Because that's important.

374
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,660
One or two could be sufficient.

375
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,100
But if the climate changes...

376
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,220
You may need five or six flags.

377
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,000
Now, Princess, we and I have noticed...

378
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,360
Six flags over Oklahoma.

379
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,240
Yee-haw.

380
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,400
I've been there.

381
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,580
One year on...

382
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,480
I mean, exactly speaking.

383
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,620
...flags on people's cars that they bought exactly one year ago and that have now been

384
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,700
worn by the wind down to just nubbins of about an inch or two of flag.

385
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,720
I mean, really.

386
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,300
I am so flagged.

387
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:58,520
I do pledge my allegiance to that flag.

388
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:06,880
For which I stand in here, one nationalistic res pubic, with freedom and justice for the

389
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,340
upper 10%.

390
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,340
You guys sound like a bunch of flaggy boys.

391
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,320
That's pretty flaggy.

392
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,380
A bunch of flaggots.

393
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,280
I hate flaggots.

394
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,760
I burn the flag.

395
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,220
My life is my art.

396
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
Bush burned the Constitution.

397
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,780
Stop flagginating yourself.

398
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,980
I'm flaggots.

399
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,080
Well, we've had our way with the flag, haven't we?

400
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,660
A symbol.

401
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,120
A symbol of freedom.

402
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,980
But in these days and times, a symbol of what?

403
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,100
Of oppression.

404
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,440
Of oppression of the entire world.

405
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,500
I'm reading off the wrong page.

406
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,360
I'm supposed to be reading off the page that says,

407
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,900
We must install democracies wherever they is.

408
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,460
And wherever they...

409
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,080
I'm sorry.

410
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,020
We'll force them.

411
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,460
We shall.

412
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,580
They'll vote or we'll kill them.

413
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,220
And if they don't place their ballots in the box, we'll place them there for them.

414
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,320
We will install democracy wherever it can be.

415
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,800
We will make them free if it kills them.

416
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,300
It's not happening.

417
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,920
Oh, there goes another one.

418
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,600
Bye-bye.

419
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,060
That was another flyby, man.

420
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,600
I think we're going to be the next to go in a few seconds.

421
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,340
Got your helmet, Dave?

422
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Yeah, I'm wearing it on my backside.

423
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,340
We'll free those people if we have to go into slavery to do it.

424
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,220
And my fellow Americans,

425
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,700
I hope you're prepared to do just that.

426
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,580
That's the cost of freedom.

427
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,240
Your freedom.

428
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,920
Fork it over.

429
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,400
Oil.

430
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,720
To build freedom.

431
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,820
Boy, oh boy.

432
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,480
Boy.

433
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,060
It's kind of disgusting.

434
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,680
I know how you feel.

435
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,060
The show sucks.

436
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,420
Boy, it's even worse with all this oil all over me.

437
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,460
And dust.

438
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,320
I...

439
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
You know, you're going to...

440
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,000
You're going to wear your helmet on your backside or else...

441
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
The show is hell.

442
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,940
Shut the...

443
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,220
Hello?

444
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,920
They ought to hang me.

445
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,540
They ought to hang me.

446
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,900
They ought to hang me.

447
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,460
The Lord has given me these songs.

448
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm giving them right back.

449
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,780
A newly discovered...

450
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,380
Listen.

451
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,800

The Los Angeles White House is now backing suspected hijacker Mohammed Atta in Prague.

457
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,320
CBN congressional correspondent Paul Sorrell was involved in the terrorist attacks.

458
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,960
The Senate wound up in prison for bribery and tax evasion.

459
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,220
Republican obesity in the U.S., Texas trouble.

460
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,240
The new bill would authorize more than 150 million children to help the two fat congressmen for tax evasion.

461
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,480
And with both the House and Senate in prison, all the races are overweight.

462
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,360
Paul Sorrell in prison for bribery and tax evasion.

463
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,080
Capitol Hill.

464
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,400
And for more information on what's happening in Washington, then ask Mike Reed, Capitol Hill Prayer, every Friday at CBN.com.

465
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,700
The contemporary Christian can describe this, asking itself questions like, just how Christian does Christian have to be?

466
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,940
CBN News reporter Sarah Pollack has about a 1 in 250,000 chance.

467
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,680
Ever since he grew up.

468
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,940
From the time they started getting the wee little man.

469
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,000
From that time, really, I was hooked.

470
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,440
Paul came shortly after he wrote a song.

471
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,040
His sprinkle blood.

472
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:51,740
Oh.

473
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,520
I want smell-o-vision.

474
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,400
I want all the others.

475
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,640
Now Paul's officially better known as God or Jesus.

476
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,380
I wonder one day who.

477
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,280
Oh, I wonder who.

478
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,140
No.

479
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,540
No.

480
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,080


481
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,700
I don't think any of that even came up.

482
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,760
No dogma?

483
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,080
Well, I guess we're just all burned out.

484
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,220
I was driving to the station and I was thinking, shouldn't we draw upon our energy reserves and do some protest places?

485
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,220


486
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,220


487
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,220


488
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,220


489
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,220


490
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,220


491
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,380
thing about some, you know,

492
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,740
pertinent, cultural,

493
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,620
socially relevant,

494
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,880
you know, some

495
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,900
giant argument that the humans

496
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,120
and everybody else is all

497
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
upset about. Well, the giant humans

498
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,220
are always arguing because they take up

499
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,100
so much space. But everybody just took their

500
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,500
clothes off and now they're dancing.

501
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Is that positive or negative?

502
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,700
Yeah, Byron's going on and on

503
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,560
about this, too.

504
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,400
Byron wants everyone to be weird,

505
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,940
and he's offended that I'm having parties

506
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,660
where girls are dancing naked and getting

507
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,160
all painted up with liquid latex.

508
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,500
Actually, he just says that's old hat

509
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,740
and that's not weird enough. That's so pink.

510
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,600
Now, of course, he has no suggestion as to

511
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
what would be weird. Yeah, absolutely.

512
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
Nothing at all. All he knows is that

513
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,580
he's going to attack my pleasure

514
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,600
vessel. We may not be all that

515
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,140
weird, but we know our slack.

516
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,760
That's right.

517
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,460
At least we know our slack, damn it.

518
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,300
You do. You are quite aware

519
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,920
of in each inch, each

520
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,380
centimeter of slack that escapes from your

521
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:42,780
vowels.

522
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,400
When I had no slack, then I felt

523
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,160
like, oh, everything has to be weird

524
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,260
and then I'll have slack.

525
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,420
You have learned

526
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,700
the secret of life, or at least deodorant

527
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,160
like from a distance. No, actually,

528
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,200
I didn't learn. All I know is

529
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,320
I got some slack, and

530
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,520
I don't care whether it's weird

531
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,600
or not weird.

532
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,540
Weird is what the other guy

533
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,940
thinks. I don't care

534
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,720
what the other guy thinks.

535
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,060
I don't care what you think.

536
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,380
I don't care what Bob thinks.

537
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,080
There you go. It was worth it.

538
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,560
I paid to know what I really think,

539
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,180
and I don't care what you think.

540
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,140
I don't even care what I think at this point.

541
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,780
What a beautiful, pathetic thought

542
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,520
for such a scrambled up gentleman.

543
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,000
For 30 bucks, it's worth it.

544
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,720
Look at his mind now, like laying there

545
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,500
on a piece of paper in front of him.

546
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,900
I saved my world.

547
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,880
Listen to the drums. They're calling.

548
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,900
Those are the calling drums.

549
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,040
They're calling you to whoop your ass.

550
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,920
Your pants down.

551
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,820
I would like to be Kaisa Girl.

552
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,720
Just forget toilet paper. Who cares?

553
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,840
Just live natural.

554
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,960
Forget toilet paper, I think, should be the name

555
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,220
of our new political movement.

556
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,600
That was a great movement. A great band.

557
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,580
The toilet... Wait a minute.

558
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,880
Forget toilet paper.

559
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,640
That's the name of the band.

560
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
Forget toilet paper.

561
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,720
It might even really be

562
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,100
the band that's playing right now over the airwaves

563
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,000
that you're listening to.

564
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,600
But it's spelled with a number, right?

565
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,020
Four.

566
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,140
Get toilet paper.

567
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,640
So all the rest do not get toilet paper,

568
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,760
but four get toilet paper.

569
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,720
Four?

570
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,240
Are they the four smelliest?

571
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,680
They're the four horsemen.

572
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,560
The four most worthy.

573
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,520
The four horsemen of the port-a-san.

574
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,520
The four strongest or the four strongest smell?

575
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,680
The four get toilet paper.

576
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,060
Indian times,

577
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,800
before things became

578
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,980
very, very small,

579
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,840
they were the four horsemen

580
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,940
of the port-a-potty.

581
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,540
Why are you hooked on your toilet paper

582
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,680
and your chem cans?

583
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,960
Why can't you just live

584
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,080
like in the past, in the good old days?

585
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,920
What's the difference

586
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,960
in a port-a-potty?

587
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,840
Live life without any focus

588
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,600
on excremeditation.

589
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,860
Screw that excremeditation stuff.

590
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,080
All you need is a hole in the ground

591
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,680
and a cactus and some sand.

592
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,480
You don't even need that.

593
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,760
Just grab a branch

594
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,920
to hang on to and

595
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,640
let go.

596
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,200
There you go, baby.

597
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,100
Just let go.

598
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,360
What's wrong with a good old

599
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:13,820
is to go

600
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,220
lean back and let go.

601
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,760
Right.

602
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,820
Woo-ha!

603
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,220
You know what I'm saying?

604
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,480
It's so bristly and tough.

605
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,440
Don't you want to take

606
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,120
a big piece of life like that?

607
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,500
Just walk up to that

608
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,480
old saguaro cactus

609
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,920
and put your arm around it

610
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,820
and give it a big old fat kiss

611
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,360
and say,

612
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,660
Dobbs, I quit.

613
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,440
You know, you don't.

614
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,500
That guy's nuts, really,

615
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,380
when you think about it.

616
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,260
I mean, he don't make

617
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,500
any sense at all, right?

618
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,600
Do you think so?

619
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,860
I don't think.

620
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,820
That's right.

621
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,400
That's the problem, sir.

622
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,280
Yes.

623
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,540
Yes, yes.

624
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,340
I've been bothered

625
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,000
by the soldiers

626
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,680
killing innocent civilians.

627
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,120
Let, let, let, let, let,

628
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,720
that, that, that,

629
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,300
uh, uh, the, the,

630
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:58,760
the, uh,

631
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,260
uh, uh, the, the,

632
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,240
Musica, Musica.

633
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,460
Musica, Musica.

634
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,640
Get this.

635
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,000
48% of 63%

636
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,040
of 3%

637
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,320
of 43%

638
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,980
of ethnic white Latinos,

639
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,360
55% of 25%

640
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,300
of frickin' ethnic Jewish voters

641
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,060
who are beginning to scratch their...

642
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,360
Thank you, doctor.

643
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,200
Looks like I might have a happy ending.

644
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,500
The snake condo.

645
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,100
The, uh, uh, universities.

646
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,400
The multi-call science.

647
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,240
Uh, our universities.

648
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,700
Uh, uh, Josh.

649
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,240
Yes.

650
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,580
Mystical scientists.

651
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,120
Go, go, go!

652
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,120
Hey!

653
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,840
Yeah!

654
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:02,760


655
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,000
A science party!

656
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,840
A science party!

657
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,620
A science party!

658
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,960
In the laboratory!

659
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,020
Late night at the lab!

660
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,340
Everybody's there!

661
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,100
Doctors, professors, PhDs!

662
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,540
Scientists with yellow hair!

663
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,200
Someone's pulling off

664
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,320
a anatomic-powered Cadillac!

665
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,220
Geniuses with matching lab coats

666
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,460
carrying a portable telescope!

667
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,160
To the science!

668
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,860
Science party!

669
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,000
Science!

670
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,740
Science party!

671
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,720
Science!

672
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,600
Science party!

673
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,920
Science party!

674
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,100
In the laboratory of love!

675
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,200
Hey!

676
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,440
Someone's spiked the test tubes!

677
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,060
Laboratory's out of control!

678
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,040
Hands off that ad!

679
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,040


680
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,920
Equipment boy!

681
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,800
The Sonic Mind Probe is not a toy!

682
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,400
Take it!

683
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,780
Hey!

684
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,860
Oh, alright!

685
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,160
Yeah!

686
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,700
Well, bakers!

687
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,860
Wires!

688
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,600
Test tubes!

689
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,400
Electrodes!

690
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,680
Microscopes!

691
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,300
Terrascopes!

692
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,260
Electros!

693
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,600
Spectral!

694
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,060
Isotopes!

695
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,360
Chemicals!

696
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,480
All over the floor!

697
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,620
The pool and the kitchen sink!

698
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,160
Someone get the sonic broom!

699
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,800
When Cog invades your pony room!

700
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:00,900
Science!

701
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,940
Science party!

702
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,040
Science!

703
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,840
Science party!

704
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,740
Science!

705
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,620
Science party!

706
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,840
Science party!

707
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:09,840


708
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:09,840


709
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:09,840


710
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:09,840


711
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:09,840


712
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,940
In the laboratory!

713
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,360
You want more science? We'll give you lots more!

714
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,200
You need a diploma just to get on the dance floor!

715
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,120
Wake up the lab rats, turn on the party droid!

716
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,100
Stay away from the nuclear waste-oid!

717
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,800
Science!

718
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,940
A science party tonight!

719
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,160
Science!

720
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,740
Science party tonight!

721
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,060
Science!

722
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,600
Science party tonight!

723
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,860
Science party tonight!

724
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,160
Uh, let's see what's going on at, uh...

725
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,420
Let's see what's up in the news here at NASA.

726
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,560
Yeah, check some science news. I haven't been... I've only been looking at the bad news.

727
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,940
The science news is so good! It makes you feel like everything's gonna be fine!

728
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:09,120
We'll have robots, uh, building robots that make better robots, and soon the robots will just take care of us all the time.

729
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,820
That's what we've got now, damn you!

730
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,040
And we won't even know they're doing it! We'll think that they've left the planet, been outlawed, but they'll be taking care of us.

731
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:24,400
It all makes sense. I was reading that Isaac Asimov robot series, and, you know, those were written in the 50s, but...

732
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,840
Was it iRobot?

733
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,500
You could see more... yes, that's the very first of the series, and then...

734
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,460
Actually, I kind of read the very end, and then I read the beginning, and I'm working my way towards the middle.

735
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,620
Well, NASA is apparently having a rocket...

736
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,120
Thousands of books.

737
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,140
A rocket contest.

738
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,060
A rocket contest?

739
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,480
Yeah.

740
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,120
That is disgusting.

741
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,600
Look, there's a big red rocket right on the screen there.

742
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,520
It's apparently a red rocket contest. Do you know anything about that, Dave?

743
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,360
Well, I know they glare. I know they, uh, glare, and also there's a...

744
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,080
Oh yeah, you've got a big dog. You probably know about that red rocket.

745
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,980
I thought you were talking about the rocket's red glare.

746
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,400
No, look at that big red rocket right there.

747
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:08,100
Not the sunshine left over from your effluvia after you gazed into the nostril, the third nostril of the solar disk, for so long, you were...

748
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,260
Your, your sinuses fry.

749
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:19,380
Do you think, uh, NASA is hoping that some super genius will stupidly reveal the, uh, perpetual motion, uh, faster than light engine...

750
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,440
So they can suppress it, yeah.

751
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,780
...that runs on no fuel, just breath?

752
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,880
So they can have a spokesman come out and say,

753
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:33,380
Yeah, you know, there never will or ever has been a machine that would focus your breath in a way that would make you move faster than a speed of light.

754
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,220
Safely. Uh, well, not really travel faster than light, but...

755
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,540
...a, a part through wormholes, using the power of your mind and your breath, and garlic.

756
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,920
Oh, that's, well, that's a yogic thing. You can get those at Safeway now.

757
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,640
Wow.

758
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,240
Travel without moving.

759
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,540
Look at here. Yeah, here.

760
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,820
Travel without moving.

761
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,760
Sex, IQ, and ET.

762
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,360
And now your icons are in your brain.

763
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,700
How we got big brains.

764
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,380
The same way we got it in the 80s.

765
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,420
Apparently, space.com is apparently running a story. Yeah, they have a picture of an Oberman there.

766
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,480
A job, big head man.

767
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,580
Waterhead.

768
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,660
An Obermansioner.

769
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,000
Brain head man.

770
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,580
He's a high macrocephalic.

771
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,520
A hot woman who doesn't have a big head.

772
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,180
She's a macrocephalic.

773
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,800
No, but she's looking very pensive and has a wonderful smile on her face.

774
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,420
Do you prefer macrocephalic or macro booty?

775
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,040
She's like hot for the brainiac.

776
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,720
You know what a big head means.

777
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,100
Yeah.

778
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,900
What goes with a big head?

779
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,960
So this is what space.com has degenerated to.

780
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,660
Big hat.

781
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,220
Look at, they're floating around the Amazon River looking...

782
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,410
Searching in boats.

783
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,290
What?

784
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,230
For a missing meteor.

785
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,790
Oh, yeah, sure.

786
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,490
That apparently was used by this guy to come to Earth.

787
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,550
Big headed thing rides...

788
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,550
We gotta describe this big headed guy.

789
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,450
Suddenly appears in the Amazon.

790
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,590
He has small jowls.

791
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,090
With women falling over in his feet.

792
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,770
He's got kind of a flabby foreskin around his neck.

793
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:03,370
His jaw protrudes a little bit, but not enough to show him as an Obermansion.

794
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,270
He looks more like an Untermansion with a macrocephalic problem.

795
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,450
Perhaps maybe hydrocephalic.

796
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,650
As if somebody poured the whole gallon there.

797
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,970
And the CIA is desperately trying to find his spaceship.

798
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,070
His spaceship, which has crashed in the Amazon.

799
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,250
They're telling everybody that it's a meteor.

800
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:21,970
Yeah.

801
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,270
Every time you hear about a search for a missing meteor...

802
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,110
I just thought we were somewhere in the West.

803
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,090
Anyway.

804
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,430
Looking for a meteor.

805
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,410
I'm sorry.

806
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,950
I just, I don't know what the good and the bad and the ugly came out of that meteor.

807
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,450
And out of that macrocephalic.

808
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,030
It was the Amazon, dude.

809
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,290
But that's where they also look, quote unquote, look for missing meteors.

810
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,530
And quote unquote dinosaur bones.

811
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:56,130
And whatever it is that they cordon off a huge area.

812
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,050
And white Indians.

813
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,750
That are so important to the United States government so they don't have to pay up.

814
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,310
We've got to stop them.

815
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,170
They're gonna kill us all.

816
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:11,650
When they took you up in their spaceship, did they do any sexual things to you?

817
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,970
That's what I call a closed encounter.

818
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,750
Its structure is just solidified on the surface.

819
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,570
I think it's anticipating the attack.

820
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,010
Anticipation denotes intelligence.

821
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,170
What was that?

822
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,410
Uh, it's a...

823
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,490
A what?

824
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,450
Space herpy.

825
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,070
That's disgusting!

826
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,250
Alien approaching.

827
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,450
Alien approaching.

828
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:35,750
Alien approaching.

829
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:35,770
Alien approaching.

830
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,230
Don't run.

831
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,230
We are your friends.

832
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,890
Oh my god.

833
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,930
Oh my god, coming.

834
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:46,910
Another one coming.

835
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:54,030
Imagine for a moment that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be.

836
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,710
Wherever there is life, it brings death.

837
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,490
Because it is evil.

838
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,530
Absolute evil.

839
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,170
One more reason to shoot first.

840
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,610
What if it goes out and melts down a busload of nuns?

841
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,310
How would you like to write the headline on that one?

842
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,490
Nun soup?

843
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,610
Behind me are the raging flames of where the Dome of the Rock, one of Islam's most sacred

844
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,730
sites, once stood.

845
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,590
Just moments ago, the ancient shrine was rocked by a devastating explosion that...

846
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,550
You lost the feed!

847
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,630
How do I know what happened?

848
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,410
You lost the feed!

849
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:33,150
Over three million are dead and thousands are seeking refuge after the free fall of

850
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,150


851
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,150


852
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,150


853
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,150


854
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,150


855
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,150


856
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,150


857
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,830
the Greek meteor shower hit Eastern Europe.

858
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:39,590
It is written in the last days, a world leader will rise up.

859
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:48,510
When possessed by Satan, he will declare himself God and embark on a reign of terror until

860
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,370
the Lord comes and destroys him.

861
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,770
The final battle between heaven and hell approaches.

862
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,750
I have a really bad feeling about this.

863
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,450
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

864
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,370
Look, I really don't think they flew 90 billion light years to come down here and start a

865
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,850
fight and get all rowdy.

866
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:12,470
If you calculate the time it takes to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at the worldwide

867
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:18,550
destruction of every major city in the next 36 hours.

868
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,190
We're being exterminated.

869
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,010
Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.

870
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,830
We are at DEFCON 1.

871
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,430
The city is headed for a disaster of biblical terror.

872
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,210
The city is headed for a disaster of biblical terror.

873
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:31,210


874
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,550
What do you mean, biblical?

875
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,030
What do you mean, this Old Testament, Mr. Mayor?

876
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:35,390
The city is headed for a disaster of biblical terror?

877
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:35,390


878
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:35,390


879
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,170
Real wrath of God-type stuff.

880
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:37,370
Exactly.

881
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,570
Fire and brimstone coming down from the sky.

882
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,030
Rivers and seas boiling.

883
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,330
40 years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes.

884
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,850
The dead rising from the grave.

885
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:49,130
Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.

886
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,350
I don't think I can cope with any more of this.

887
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,070
I think I'll just go and have a little lie down.

888
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:54,990
Jell-a-boom.

889
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,370
Boom, yeah.

890
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,670
I understand boom.

891
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,150
Baa-da-boom.

892
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,710
Big bada boom.

893
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,630
Big bada big boom.

894
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,390
Big boom.

895
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,190
Yeah, big bada boom.

896
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,010
Bada boom.

897
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,370
Big boom.

898
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,690
Big bada boom.

899
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,110
Man is an endangered species.

900
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,630
We'll stop any attack that they could begin.

901
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,350
Provided the attack is lame and poorly thought out and it's our grandma's.

902
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,430
Save your energy.

903
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,230
Save yourselves.

904
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,970
Avoid the planet Earth at all costs.

905
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,490
Farewell.

906
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:42,350
DJ Epoch did that collage, I think.

907
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,190
And before that, ESO Swamp Radio.

908
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,530
Lots of ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB.

909
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,990
Which is actually the Einstein Secret Outlaws band

910
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,110
with a mystery...

911
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,170
Every guest guitarist is heard in the background

912
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,350
jamming at Tranquility Base at Brushwood.

913
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,910
Before ESO Radio, we heard that song Science Party

914
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,410
is by Consortium of Genius,

915
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,110
a funny band that you can check out at their website,

916
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:23,130
www.consortiumofgenius.com

917
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,670
That's all one big word.

918
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,450
Consortium of Genius.

919
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:33,050
And now, friends, a live recording from the Akron Revival.

920
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:40,890
This year, sponsored by Reverend Toth Wilder, in which Reverend Dr. Uncle Haj Onan Kanobite

921
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,850
leads us in a sing-a-long.

922
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:56,050
I know a man, whose name was Bob, and selling things.

923
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,190
And I know a man, whose name was Bob, and selling things.

924
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,530
That was his job.

925
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,110
That was his job.

926
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,190
I knew a man, his name was Bob, and selling things.

927
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,770
That was his job.

928
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,330
He sold his things.

929
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,810
He sold his things.

930
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,970
From door to door.

931
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,470
From door to door.

932
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,910
If you had some.

933
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,350
If you had some.

934
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,830
You'd buy some more.

935
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,390
You'd buy some more.

936
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,350
I know he sold from door to door.

937
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,650
And he had some.

938
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,070
He'd buy some more.

939
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,970
He drove his car.

940
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,390
He drove his car.

941
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,330
From town to town.

942
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,750
From town to town.

943
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,470
And believe me.

944
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,170
And believe me.

945
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,650
He got around.

946
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,070
He got around.

947
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,110
He drove his car from town to town.

948
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,930
And believe me, he got around.

949
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,090
Jehovah One.

950
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,850
Jehovah One.

951
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:52,870
Jehovah One.

952
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,190
He think that one gave him a plan.

953
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,670
He think that one gave him a plan.

954
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,210
Soon some genius,

955
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,650
Soon some genius.

956
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,310
He'll rule the land,

957
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:05,350
He thinks that one gave him a plan.

958
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,650
Soon some genius,

959
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,250
He'll rule the land.

960
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,250
He thinks that one gave him a plan.

961
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:09,250


962
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:09,250


963
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,690
Well X day came

964
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,050
Well X day came.

965
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,350
And X day went.

966
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,870
Was all that cash

967
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,210
Truly well spent

968
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,470
It's true the cash

969
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,810
We won't give back

970
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,750
But we don't care

971
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,730
Cause we have slack

972
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,210
It's true the cash

973
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,790
We won't give back

974
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,110
But we don't care

975
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,570
Cause we have slack

976
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,770
Will this song end

977
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,390
Or go some more

978
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,790
Funny at first

979
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,670
Now it's a bore

980
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,030
Will this song end

981
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,390
Or go some more

982
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:13,710
Funny at first

983
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,070
Now it's a bore

984
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,850
And so I'll end

985
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,050
This endless tale

986
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:24,130
Returning to

987
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,670
The saint of sales

988
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,130
And so I'll end

989
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,530
This endless tale

990
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,290
Returning to the saint of sales

991
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,410
I knew a man

992
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,810
His name was Bob

993
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:39,990
I'm telling things

994
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,450
That was his job

995
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:42,350
Yeah!

996
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:43,870
Yeah!

997
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:45,010
Yeah!

998
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:47,590
Yeah!

999
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,650
That's kind of corny!

1000
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:49,410
Yeah!

1001
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:50,730
Yeah!

1002
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,450
Thank you.

1003
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,330
Yeah!

1004
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,210
Yeah!

1005
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,370
Yeah!

1006
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:56,810
Yeah!

1007
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:57,370


1008
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,930
We are here tonight

1009
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,110
As representatives of the church of the subgenius

1010
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,630
We've covered the subgenius part

1011
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,450
And I think you know the of-the part

1012
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,370
But I would like to remind you

1013
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:19,170
that this is not the hermitage of the subgenius.

1014
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,090
This is not the monastery of the subgenius,

1015
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,970
nor the nunnery of the subgenius.

1016
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,190
This isn't the sit-at-home-alone of the subgenius,

1017
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,170
or the play-on-your-computer-all-day of the subgenius.

1018
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:40,650
And it's definitely not the come-to-the-limespider-and-don't-talk-to-other-people of the subgenius.

1019
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:45,850
If each and every one of you don't meet someone tonight,

1020
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,870
you have cheated yourself.

1021
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,070
Perhaps it's a little intimidating to meet somebody tonight,

1022
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,830
and so we're going to organize something else.

1023
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:06,970
And by meeting somebody, I don't mean you should go up and talk to the sexiest person in the room,

1024
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,750
because there's only one Chaz Smith here,

1025
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:10,630
and if you're not going to meet him,

1026
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,630


1027
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,850
you don't have to go around.

1028
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:16,390
But some of you should believe me.

1029
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,630
That's what I heard.

1030
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,610
That's what I heard.

1031
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:52,190
You tried your best.

1032
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:56,110
But as long as we fall back,

1033
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:58,670
your future is over.

1034
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,050
Because Chaz Smith is a dead man who decided to kill his stupid half-اب

1035
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:01,330
and make it so little more obvious.

1036
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,330
That's an adjustable percentage.

1037
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,750
You, well,

1038
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,770
that shouldj' y.

1039
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,070
That shouldj' y.

1040
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,090
It was Radi Pizza.

1041
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:17,610
And your affection.

1042
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,750
Oh B-Fan, Big-Fan, Big-Fan

1043
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,330
Assassin's Creed

1044
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:10,050
B-B-B-B-B-B-B by Doctor Onan's Wotan Band

1045
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,210
Part 2 of remix number 2

1046
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:21,390
Yes, and now a live instance of the Swingin' Love Corpses, the greatest of the old school

1047
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:27,810
subgenius bands led by Dr. Philo and Sphinx Drummond and Ray Hay and Leif Cowabunga and

1048
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,050
Mojo Skippy Butcher.

1049
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:34,730
This is the way they would open their concerts, and this is actually their best song.

1050
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:39,110
Gentlemen, here come the Swingin' Love Corpses.

1051
00:47:48,990 --> 00:48:11,810
Swingin' Love Corpses

1052
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:42,190
Swingin' Love Corpses

1053
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,210
Swingin' Love Corpses

1054
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:06,230
Swingin' Love Corpses

1055
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:06,390
Swingin' Love Corpses

1056
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:11,550
as an apology to all of you beautiful fans who came out here tonight, we're going to

1057
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,190
start with our best.

1058
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:25,270
The Church of the Subgenius online pamphlet Shut Up or Gun Stand Up.

1059
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,090
The brag of the subgenius.

1060
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,110
A fragment.

1061
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,650
Transcribed from a cassette tape recording made at a seance in 1973.

1062
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,810
I picked the goddarned terror of the frigging gods out of my nose.

1063
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,350
Pardon my language.

1064
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:42,070
But yee-haw, let the sons of God and man bear witness.

1065
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:46,530
Even in the belly of the thunderbird I've been casting out the false prophets,

1066
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:50,490
I'm busting a nut and blowing my o-ring, and ripe to throw a loaf.

1067
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:55,610
For I speak only the frigging truth, and never in my days have I spoken other than.

1068
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:59,690
For my every utterance is a lie, including this very one you hear.

1069
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:03,370
I say, have sex with, em, if they can't take a joke.

1070
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,290
By God, anything for a laugh, I say.

1071
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:08,030
I am the last remaining.

1072
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:09,190
Homo correctus.

1073
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,210
I am the goddarned man of the future.

1074
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,470
I'll drive a mile so, as not to walk a foot.

1075
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,190
I am a human being of the first goddarned water.

1076
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,690
I'm insured for X, O God and Satan.

1077
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:26,370
I was shanghaied by bodiless fiends and alien zoos from a corporate galaxy, and got away with their hubcaps.

1078
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,590
I cannot be tracked on radar.

1079
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,330
I wear nothing uniform.

1080
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,250
I wear no goddarned uniform.

1081
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:37,090
Yes baby, I'm 23 feet tall and have 13 rows of breasts.

1082
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:38,130
I was settled.

1083
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,470
My triceratops.

1084
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,510
I gave the anti-verge in a high protein toxo-wash.

1085
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:44,650
I'm a bacteriological weapon.

1086
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:45,950
I'm armed and loaded.

1087
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,410
I'm a fission reactor.

1088
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,150
I fart plutonium.

1089
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,950
Power plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow.

1090
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,070
When they plug me in, the lights go out in Hong Kong.

1091
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:58,590
I sired retarded space bastards across the cosmos.

1092
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,410
I cook and eat my dead.

1093
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:00,990
Yahoo.

1094
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:04,030
I'm the unshaven thorn tree of the Atlantis Zoo.

1095
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,610
I pay no taxes.

1096
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,330
The devil's hands are my ideal player.

1097
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:08,330


1098
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:08,610
I hold the ground.

1099
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,870
I hold the seven-bladed windbreaker.

1100
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,170
The wheels that turn are behind me.

1101
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,270
I think backwards.

1102
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,910
I do it for fun.

1103
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:20,410
My imagination is a frigging cancer and I'll pork it before it porks me.

1104
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,550
The say a gonzillion is the highest number there is.

1105
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:24,770
Well my god.

1106
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,870
I count to a gonzillion and one.

1107
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,750
Yes, I'm the purple flower of Hell County.

1108
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:34,050
Give me wide berth when I drop my drawers, mother nature swoons.

1109
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,710
I use a python for a prophylactic.

1110
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:37,470
I'm thicker.

1111
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,890
Harder and meaner than the Alaskan pipeline.

1112
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,490
And carry more spew.

1113
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,850
I'll freeze your seed before it gets the bathroom tile.

1114
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:45,730
Yee.

1115
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:46,430
Yee.

1116
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:13,790
Let's go.

1117
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:18,670
All I can say is the basic problem is that the whole phlegmatic system has to be blown

1118
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,010
out.

1119
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,430
But what are you going to blow it out with?

1120
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,410
Have you got the blow outage power that you need or g-

1121
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,970
No, you have to blow out the phlegmatic buildup.

1122
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,530
Well, you know, we have a saying around here what comes around goes around and our heads

1123
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,310
are all stuck up our own asses.

1124
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:33,630
No.

1125
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:33,970
Oh.

1126
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:34,370
Oh.

1127
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:34,370


1128
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:34,490
You know.

1129
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,930
Which is why we have the squeeze bulb syringes.

1130
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,950
Oh, I can feel it right now.

1131
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:43,970
It's kind of like...

1132
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,730
You insert it into each nostril, and you squeeze it out first,

1133
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:55,630
and then you insert it in the nostril, and you release the bulb, and it expels the fluid.

1134
00:53:55,910 --> 00:54:00,030
Now, where I'm coming from, I feel like there's a pair of buttocks wrapped on my head like a hat,

1135
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,190
and somehow it makes me psychic.

1136
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,890
Am I getting the right thing, or have I gotten something I shouldn't have?

1137
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:06,810
I knew you were going to say that.

1138
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,130
I knew you were going to bring up the whole psychic thing.

1139
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:09,870
You are psychic.

1140
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:10,890
Yes, he is.

1141
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,210
It's your buttocks wrapped on my head, aren't it?

1142
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:13,610
Isn't it?

1143
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:14,270
It is.

1144
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:14,910
It is.

1145
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:21,530
I often think that there's somebody out there who's recording every word that happens in the show,

1146
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:25,090
and then eventually they'll all be played back again.

1147
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:29,290
And those are random, recurrent moments beloved by all.

1148
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,150
Yes.

1149
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,890
Order now, while surprises are limitless.

1150
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:36,490
You may be asked to call upon for a certain favor.

1151
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,790
Uh, maybe someone want...

1152
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,810
Francis, this is the year 1962.

1153
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:47,250
Imagine somebody listening to us at the same time in the year, oh, say 2002.

1154
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,290
Boy, that's 40 years past. Can you imagine such a thing?

1155
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:56,190
Ask not what your forehead can do in this small space.

1156
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,230
Ask what my forehead is doing in your house.

1157
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,790
But it's amazing the way you've got these records from the future.

1158
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:04,830
I like that.

1159
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:05,690
I like that.

1160
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,350
It's very...

1161
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,850
It's very small and unique, like a snowflake.

1162
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,390
It's emboldening.

1163
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:13,570
It's emboldening and embossing as well.

1164
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,270
Absolutely.

1165
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:18,070
And I have heard you been called Snowflake so many times.

1166
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:21,890
Yes, because she melts whenever you touch her.

1167
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:22,630
Oh, yes.

1168
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,570
She's a frosty little thing, huh?

1169
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,310
Well, no, she's not frosty.

1170
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:28,490
Something's lost and something's gained.

1171
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,950
If you could see her now...

1172
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,970
I mean, I never thought of it that way.

1173
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,590
You would want to carve your own...

1174
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,050
What does that mean there?

1175
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,890
Something's lost and something's gained.

1176
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,110
For every yin, there's a yang.

1177
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,070
And living every day.

1178
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,150
Yes, it's the yin and the yang.

1179
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,530
It's a psycho-scrotal squander.

1180
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,430
One step forward, two steps back.

1181
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,590
It's a cosmic unbounded fugue.

1182
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:49,970
Yeah, isn't it?

1183
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:50,430
Isn't it?

1184
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:56,550
So let us all remember the retching motion that Sri Hajambo has taught us.

1185
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:02,410
Begin with a very, very deep breath and then start...

1186
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:02,890
.

1187
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:03,070
...

1188
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,830
Till next week.

1189
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,650
You must remember this...

1190
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:12,790
A kiss is just a kiss.

1191
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,830
But a nuclear explosive device...

1192
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,850
Information is not knowledge.

1193
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,810
Keep your head on tight.

1194
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,190
You're back to the wind and you're sacking the saddle.

1195
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,150
Well, he's got a point.

1196
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:29,710
Keep that sack in this home.

1197
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,250
I like that.

1198
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:30,850
Phew.

1199
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:35,750
But knowledge is not wisdom, and wisdom is not necessarily truth.

1200
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,370
And truth is not necessarily...

1201
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:51,110
Oh, thank you, ESO, Swamp Radio, WCSB, and special guest caller, Reverend Gilippo Abernathy.
