1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
You need to pay Bob because this radio station helps you to find slack.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,060
This radio station is one of the anti-conspiracy stations.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,420
This radio station exists to bring back for you what the conspiracy has stolen away.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,780
This, friends, requires that you give money.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,200
Oh, no, no, no. Don't tell me that's the radio stuff.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,760
I can't believe this.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,080
If we get out of here alive, I'll count that as a break.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,040
I mean, there wasn't even any people here to eat.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,900
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,500
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,240
The subgenius.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,300
Our old slut.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,420
Hello.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,960
My name is Jesus.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,520
Hello.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,620
Come follow me.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,960
Hello.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,200
My name is Jesus.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,740
Lay down your cares.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
Lift up your friends and follow me.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,560
Are you finished?

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,640
You got a shot, radio listeners.

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,820
Is there going to be a bathroom stop?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,940
No, no, no. I'll take your word for it.

25
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,000
You've got three...

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,760
Young man, don't say that word again.

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,300
There are certain words that should not be said on public air.

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,140
Lady, chill out a little bit, okay?

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,480
All these words are in the dictionary.

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,580
They're medical terms.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You two better not talk about that on the air.

32
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,040
And why not?

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
It's vile and hedonistic.

34
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,960
Hey, hey, hey, lady.

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,660
If God hadn't wanted us to...

36
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,660
...

37
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:54,900
...

38
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,480

39
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,600

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:55,760

00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:55,760


42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:55,760

00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:55,760


44
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:55,980

45
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:55,980


46
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,020
...

47
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


48
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


49
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


50
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


51
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


52
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


53
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


54
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


55
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,060
...

56
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,880
...

57
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,060
...

58
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


59
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


60
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


61
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


62
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


63
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


64
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


65
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


66
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


67
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


68
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


69
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


70
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


71
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


72
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


73
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


74
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


75
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


76
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


77
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


78
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


79
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


80
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


81
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,060


82
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,300
Everybody ...

83
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,680
Everybody Everybody does it.

84
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,240
I mean, even the Pope, probably.

85
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,740
Hello?

86
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,800
She's gone.

87
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,100
Look.

88
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,020
A lot of little cells and glands and molecules get together.

89
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,360
There's no other person in the whole world who exactly duplicates you.

90
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,500
Two billion, one hundred and seventy-four million people.

91
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,860
See this?

92
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,820
It's a microphone.

93
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,300
There are four others hidden around the room.

94
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,000
There's the master switch over there.

95
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,020


96
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,240
I know what one of them is.

97
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,660
Turn it on.

98
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,020
All of my phones are live automatically.

99
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,640
Heh.

100
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,780
When I start to talk, the disc retorts.

101
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,320
When I stop, it stops.

102
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,320
Why don't you try it yourself?

103
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,060
I think I did.

104
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,820
Hi, dear friends.

105
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,580
Good job!

106
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,220
Terrific!

107
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:40,900
Splendific!

108
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,780
Oh, gosh.

109
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,620
What I want you to do now, what I want you to do is cross the radio, cross over to your radio.

110
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,540
I want you to put your hands on the radio.

111
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,600
You people who think you're too cool to do so, just sit back and just imagine what you're about to miss.

112
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,480
I want you to put your hands on the radio.

113
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,360
I want you to feel J.R. Bob Dobbs coming through to you.

114
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,920
I want you to feel the sacred sails reaching out to you.

115
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,220
I want you to feel it.

116
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,460
I want you to feel the pinkness leaving your body and the slack taking control.

117
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,740
Wow, that's hot.

118
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,180
If you don't shut up, I shall shoot you.

119
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,500
It's 9.30, 5.

120
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,300
Let's go to the phones.

121
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,200
Oh, wow!

122
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,500
Where the entertainment never ends.

123
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,180
It's burning down.

124
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,160
Good God!

125
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,680
This snow is burning down.

126
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,240
This snow is burning down.

127
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,700
The time has come.

128
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,540
Too long to go out of your mind.

129
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,180
Too long.

130
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,320
Are you ready?

131
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:44,040
Hi, this is Ed Allen with exercises to help you towards that beautiful figure you've always been dreaming about.

132
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,360
Or to help you keep the beautiful figure you have.

133
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,360
Shall we go?

134
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,100
All right, here's exercise number one.

135
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,720
Let's get this off the ground.

136
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,200
I've been in this business since and every day.

137
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,200


138
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,220
He전에.

139
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,620
Good.

140
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:11,840


141
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,480
Uh-huh.

142
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,160
I can't believe it, Eric.

143
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,100
Good morning, everybody.

144
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,620
Good morning, Hillary.

145
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:16,620


146
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:16,620


147
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,020
Yeah.

148
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,460
I'm eight miles up.

149
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,480
Good.

150
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,140
Thank you.

151
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:18,680
record again? Play the record again? Play the record again? Stupid. Stupid. And I'm a genius genius. I'm stupid and I'm lazy. I may be totally wrong but I'm a fool. You idiot.

152
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:28,340
Oh thanks Ren and thanks to Yetis for Bob for that for the last portion of that

153
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,680
media barrage and a lot of a media barrage editing that'll be coming up.

154
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,480
Friends we have to thank Yetis for Bob there in I believe Milwaukee. Also some

155
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,040
of that media barrage comes from Fernanda Nunde and

156
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:52,700
and fuzzling evidence from the KPFA show. Now I've got some great source tapes to

157
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,840
play with here friends because you know Ren was right about stupidity and and so

158
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,460
forth. We we appreciate that because this is after all the Church of the subgenius

159
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:11,020
and the two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity. So

160
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,720
you know friends if at first you don't succeed

161
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,200
skydiving is probably not for you. For a truly wise man never plays leapfrog with

162
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:31,100
a unicorn. So always remember to pillage before you burn. It may be friend that

163
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,800
your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning to others. You can't

164
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,620
fall off the floor but the normal human woman would rather have beauty

165
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,260
than brains. Because the normal human man can

166
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,100
see better than he can think.

167
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,820
Oh yes dear friends I'm sorry I get I get I get carried away in spirit

168
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,320
friends. It's so lovely but I get I get lost in thought it's unfamiliar

169
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,580
territory to me everybody they say has a photographic memory but old reverend

170
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,240
Stange don't have much film left.

171
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,700
So you know diferenciation still InternalPersonal SpenceroglubFM programs is still, is still, or early on thank you for Photoshop him certain bird and hand like regular7 and facebook.com David Staley是出家

172
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,960
hell, I've seen it all, done it all, can't remember most of it. But I do know, I do know,

173
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:26,520
friends, that those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't. Of course, on

174
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,060
the other hand, they might not be dead. They might just be electroencephalographically

175
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,760
challenged. But friend, my good friend, my good prayer partner out there listening to

176
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:47,180
Beradia, do you ever feel like you're diagonally parked in a parallel universe? Well, in that

177
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,240
case, honk if you love peace and quiet, friends, because nothing is foolproof to a sufficiently

178
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:02,020
talented fool. On the other hand, you have different fingers. Because a day without the

179
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,140
sunshine is like, you know, nighttime, friends.

180
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:16,380
Change, change is inevitable, except from a vending machine, I suppose you could say.

181
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,780
And for that matter, the Greys, or the Zaytans as we call them, gave humanity certain Zaytan

182
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,120
genetic components, and they helped early man over some evolutionary humps. But they

183
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:35,180
saw too late that the majority of the human race retained a great many primate impulses

184
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,740
that the Greys had thought to expunge.

185
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:44,000
Impulses that would lead from little wars to bigger wars, which would end as another

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,720
ancient Zaytan or Grey experiment had in another world, which is, of course, worldwide

187
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,620
devastation. And they couldn't genetically redesign the whole human race at that point,

188
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,900
so they decided they had to influence it in other ways so it would survive. And so they

189
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:06,180
decided, or so they thought they decided, to introduce the concept of higher religious

190
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,740
ethics to mankind. And that's what they were doing. And they were trying to change the

191
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:07,840
world.

192
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,980
They were trying to keep humanity from self-destructing before the experiment was over with, don't

193
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,340
you see?

194
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,280
Higher religious ethics, friends, because they had already observed Earth humanity's

195
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,060
tendency to contrive cosmological explanations for life and nature and death, they themselves,

196
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,200
the Greys in the distant past, had once had such a tendency until they'd expunged it thousands

197
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,460
of centuries earlier.

198
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,740
They were aware of an order of creature which would, in the end, destroy humanity. And

199
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:37,740


200
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:37,740


201
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,920
they were aware of the power of the Meta, which we call the Meta. These creatures had

202
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,420
a way of infusing harmonious direction into the races they visited. Why? The Zaytans did

203
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,600
not know. They assumed that the Meta were caught up in some megalomaniacal cultural

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,880
outreach obsession. And they decided they could use this obsession for their own purposes,

205
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,340
so they captured a powerful Meta in a generator field and introduced it to Earth. A variation

206
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,740
on that same field, by the way, is the force field, which keeps the Meta in the same field.

207
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:07,740


208
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,380
The Zaytans were able to capture the Meta out of the Zaytan's way most of the time,

209
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,660
but you see, the planetary Iamton field responded to the captured Meta and crystallized a so-called

210
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,360
deity around the Meta in a form the local sentient life-form humanity could understand.

211
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:28,240
The one god, they called it, the Great Spirit, Eitan, Yahweh, Gibrog-Fram, Bob, many names

212
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,220
in many places. The Meta's influence on the Iamton field was especially direct in certain

213
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,940
places, as for example, the Middle East in the time of Moses.

214
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,720
Eventually, the captured Meta was made to be a source of energy for the Zaytans, and

215
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:37,720


216
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,080
to keep this universe now safe — and the mid- oluyor הוא

217
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,980
I won't let you use that as a good excuse for my evil nichtness.

218
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,080
But, some reason tested through that ιαυτόulo

219
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,040
sc genere or ego, many怎麼τοχους say ultra, I think,

220
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,860
that a whole wide range of Christ can be claimed without kaç은

00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,860
glory through his ridicular speech.

223
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,700
Aloha, habogus, aloha, kapogus.

227
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,700
Well, we'll probably get Jesus in here to tell the full truth about Jesus.

228
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:19,020
Friends, I was just reading from Reverend John Shirley's science fiction book called Silicon Embrace.

229
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,300
Science fiction? Sure. Call it science fiction if you will.

230
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:30,200
Published by Mark V. Ziesing Books of the Shingletown, California.

234
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,640
Publishers of John Shirley's Silicon Embrace from which we were just reading because, friends, it is yes.

235
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,020
Perhaps it is madness. Perhaps it is insanity.

236
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,620
Perhaps, perhaps X-Day is merely coming.

237
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,320
Perhaps the end times are merely coming.

238
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,400
Friends, that's all it is.

239
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,680
Sure, it gets confusing.

240
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
For you and even me sometimes.

241
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:12,120
But, well, we've only got, what, I think my computer told me, 389 days left till X-Day.

242
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:20,260
And when I'm speaking this, what we've got about, well, by the time you hear this show, it'll be about two weeks from the X-Day drill.

243
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,860
1997 X-Day drill in Brushwood Campground in Sherman, New York.

251
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,500
And we are loving it.

252
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,240
We're eating it up.

253
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,780
We can't wait to see the vengeance.

254
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,660
It's acted upon the pink and upon the grays themselves, because we have no truck with the grays.

255
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,360
No, sir.

256
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,360
We just say no to the alien threat around here.

257
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:19,100
This particular saucer cult, we ain't trying to become like the grays, like them Heaven's Gate folks.

258
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,620
No, sir.

259
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,400
No, sir, ma'am.

260
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,080
We want to be like them Mata, the X-ist, in other words.

261
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,260
Praise Bob and amen.

262
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, yes.

263
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,080
All right.

264
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,920
Thanks so much.

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,500
Thank you.

266
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,200
You're welcome.

267
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,660
Bye-bye.

268
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:53,660


269
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,540
You're going to die up there.

270
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,180
Oh,

271
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,460
Oh,

272
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh,

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,680
Oh,

274
00:13:59,900 --> 00:13:59,900


275
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,820
I wish again, I was a kid again, singing a song.

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,060
When the red, red robin comes bob, bob, bobbing along.

277
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,620
Wake up, red, red robin, bob, bob, bobbing along.

278
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,420
Bob, bob, bobbing along.

279
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,760
Bob, bob, bob, bob, bob, bobbing along.

280
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,200
Bob, bob, bobbing along.

281
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,000
Bob, bob, bob, bob, bob, bob, bob.

282
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,040
You know, there's nothing I like more than sleep.

283
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,900
Here's a little song I like to sing before I hit the hay.

284
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,060
Masturbation can be fun.

285
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,560
Put a live chicken in your underwear.

286
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,500
Now bend forward slightly at the waist.

287
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

288
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,320
Ah!

289
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,760
All right, whip it out.

290
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

291
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,680
Hey, what's that?

292
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,740
It's a beautiful...

293
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,120
Ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da.

294
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,680
Come under.

295
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,960
I'm not a robot.

296
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,140
Boom, boom, made a great to be crazy.

297
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,260
Ah!

298
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,540
Wait there, Chucky.

299
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,700
Stand back.

300
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,180
Ah!

301
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,580
Crazy, boom, boom, made a great to be crazy.

302
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,860
Giddyap, boom, and he's the whole day through.

303
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,740
Boom, boom, made a great to be crazy.

304
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,760
Giddyap, boom, and he's the whole day through.

305
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,380
Boom, boom, made a great to be crazy.

306
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,180
Ah!

307
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,520
Ah!

308
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,820
Very good!

309
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,720
Crazy, boom!

310
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,680
Let's move on.

311
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,480
Time to zoom.

312
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,480
Ah!

313
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,400
Ah!

314
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,160
So don't stack by May 1st.

315
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,660
But you must put it off.

316
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,540
Tobacco companies provide free spitting tobacco in players' clubhouses.

317
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,160
The team of dentists was Dr. Dean of the dental school.

318
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,500
He says longtime users experienced damage to their high school boys.

319
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,140
He says a 13-year-old farm boy was after him for years to quit chewing.

320
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,220
Meanwhile, one San Francisco player says he and other users will expand to include the whole league.

321
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,860
Don't they know he shouldn't do something just because...

322
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,400
Everyone else is doing it?

323
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,080
No, Ben, it just got all crazy.

324
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,620
Didn't anybody see how foolish they were being?

325
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,520
I'm a nut. I'm a nut.

326
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,420
I'm a nut. I'm a nut. I'm a nut.

327
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,340
That's right.

328
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,060
Jimmy? Hey, hey, look at this.

329
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,840
What the hell?

330
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,100
Somebody talk to me.

331
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,720
What am I supposed to do?

332
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,180
What the hell is going on, Jimmy?

333
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,900
Somebody's picking up the microphone.

334
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,280
Look, Dave, tell me what to do.

335
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,480
Zoom out, you idiot.

336
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,600
Who the hell is this?

337
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,500
Supposing you have a joke, KBFA, KBFB, and KFC up in Fresno.

338
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,180
Would you explain to me how this nut could hold a top position in one of our intelligence agencies?

339
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,260
Would you answer that?

340
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,240
High-level covert operatives are under great stress.

341
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,540
They're creative thinkers who by their very nature...

342
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,820
See, Tom trains everyone in the CIA who's crazy.

343
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,160
Every day you have to jump off a plane.

344
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,280
You have to jump off a roof or stand in front of a train so you can lose your fear.

345
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,040
Is that it?

346
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,380
You're like a crazy person.

347
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,120
I'm not crazy.

348
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,760
There must be a way to live with it so that it does make sense.

349
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,640
Well, any place you have a federal building, you have a target.

350
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,700
That's the question everybody has right now.

351
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,600
Why here? Why Oklahoma City?

352
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,940
And you find out by finding why that building.

353
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,480
I don't think it's material that it was in Oklahoma City.

354
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,700
It's really the building.

355
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,520
The building could have been any city in the United States.

356
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,080
The question is that building.

357
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,120
Bob Dove!

358
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,900
Multi-millionaire!

359
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,900
High Prince of Slack!

360
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,000
He is alive! Alive, alive!

361
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,100
Step right up and find out the mysteries of Slack.

362
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,320
Tickets are available this way.

363
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,260
Yes!

364
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,800
Freaks! Misfits! Geeks!

365
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,280
Do we have a solution for you?

366
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,640
Come see the Reverend Ivan Stang! Yes!

367
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,720
Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius!

368
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,760
One time and one time only for just one dollar!

369
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,400
You can look behind the curtain to see the hideous Reverend Ivan Stang!

370
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,340
Is he man? Is he beast?

371
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,660
Only you can tell and he is alive!

372
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,120
Alive, alive, alive!

373
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,700
I want you to know, praise Bob, that although we are subgeniuses,

374
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,080
we are not stupid!

375
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,480
And although our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

376
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,760
as he fits the name, subgenius,

377
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,660
Bob is not smart!

378
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,220
You know, don't get the impression that we are like some bunch of...

379
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,840
We're really geniuses because we understand these complex jokes

380
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,500
and those stupid people who know how to repair cars

381
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,180
don't get our jokes.

382
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,860
We must really be superior mutants.

383
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,120
No, friends, it ain't like that at all!

384
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,360
That is not...

385
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,500
We're not trying to...

386
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,120
And another thing, another thing about Bob that you should probably know,

387
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,360
old pipeface ain't gonna die for your sins.

388
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,600
Okay?

389
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,240
You can get that straight right now.

390
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,680
Let's just get that straight up front.

391
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,860
Bob will not die for your sins.

392
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,620
He really does not give a shit about your sins.

393
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,060
He doesn't care about your sins.

394
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,020
He is bored with your sins.

395
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,060
If anything, Bob merely comes and comes again and again

396
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,560
to justify your sins, to rationalize your sins.

397
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,400
Friends, Bob brings not forgiveness, but an excuse.

398
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,180
Do you really need to be forgiven?

399
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,060
For what and by whom?

400
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,240
Do you really feel that need?

401
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,580
No, you do need an excuse.

402
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,700
And if you don't need it yet, you're probably gonna need it pretty soon.

403
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,860
So, uh, you just think about it.

404
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
We're not gonna do any kind of hard...

405
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,260
Well, we're not gonna threaten you with tales of some hell

406
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,680
if you don't join up and pay lip service to our invisible monster.

407
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,960
No, we won't threaten you with things like that.

408
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,840
It's just on July 5th, 1998, all of a sudden one day you'll wake up

409
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,340
and, well, there'll be an empty pile of clothes

410
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,700
where your spouse, that dues-paying subgenius,

411
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,640
once was laying next to you.

412
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,280
And you'll walk outside and you'll have to go to work.

413
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,300
That spouse will be up on the escape vessels.

414
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,440
But we wouldn't want to threaten you with the fact that your spouse,

415
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,180
once on the escape vessels, could then go,

416
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,580
you know, I've always wanted to show that asshole a thing or two about Bob.

417
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,240
No, we're not into the vengeance,

418
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,780
the vengeance that comes with our religion.

419
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,220
Oh, no.

420
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,300
We wouldn't form a religion just to feel superior to the next...

421
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,260
to everybody else.

422
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,860
No, no.

423
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,480
That's what all the other...

424
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,420
I'll tell you what, friends, it's true.

425
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,680
This religion is based on hate.

426
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,200
And in that respect, we're simply the only religion

427
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,020
that'll just come out and admit it.

428
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,400
They are all that way.

429
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,660
We're just up front about it.

430
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,080
We're better than everybody else.

431
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,860
Enough said.

432
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,980
Bob sold it.

433
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,820
I smoked it.

434
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,800
That settles it.

435
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,040
You know?

436
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,120
I don't know what that means,

437
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,580
but it must be the highest honor that can be stowed.

438
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,460
...the highest honor that can be stowed.

439
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,620
That's what it says in Jack Chick publications.

440
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh, beautiful family.

441
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,620
Everyone'll have a big fancy car,

442
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,140
and you'll be able to see through walls

443
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,200
and fly unaided from men and their black holes.

444
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,960
And put the Bible where they've been.

445
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,840
Best of all, you'll be able to look down into the crevice of Sheol

446
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,300
and see the sinners roasting in their own flames

447
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,580
while you tut-tut and chide them.

448
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,180
Lack of God.

449
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,880
And furthermore,

450
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,340
the price of admission

451
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,300
is a life of contrition.

452
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,360
The Savior doesn't spend much.

453
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,580
That's why they call him the Savior.

454
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,460
He saves rather than spends.

455
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,380
So you're out of luck.

456
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,360
I am blessed.

457
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,820
Would life for you continue

458
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:15,000
the life that flickers in you

459
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,360
from day to day?

460
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,760
Would you say a table grace

461
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,700
with a great big beam

462
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,680
sticking out of your eye

463
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,140
and a crown of thorns on your face?

464
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,640
And let him know the things

465
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,680
on which your mind and spirit feed?

466
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,740
Then do you take Jesus to the closet

467
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,260
and show him your pornography collection?

468
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,560
And you make him look

469
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,120
at every filthy page

470
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,860
while the tears of blood

471
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,800
run from your side

472
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,120
and his side squirts all over the rug?

473
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,520
It'll be hard to explain to your mama

474
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,920
the bloodstains on the shag carpeting

475
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,120
from his feet

476
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,560
pierced by the bloodstains

477
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:47,560


478
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,500
that burst through with the nail

479
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,760
attaching him to the cross

480
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,180
when he at last was gone.

481
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,720
And you would sigh with relief

482
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,340
when he was gone.

483
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,100
Believe me, you would sigh with relief

484
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,040
when he was gone.

485
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,360
But, you know, he'd never be gone

486
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,160
because he's omniscient and omnipresent.

487
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,220
So if you did sigh with relief,

488
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,940
he'd be back to admonish you some more

489
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,880
and to put more bloody handprints

490
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,300
on the doorknob of your door.

491
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,100
So we get ready to blast off now, folks.

492
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
Oh, I guess so.

493
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,260
Let's strap in for another rocket ride.

494
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,400
Oh, these old bones.

495
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,120
I don't know if I'm going to be able

496
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,400
to do this all the rest of my life.

497
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,760
I've forgotten how much I hate space travel.

498
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,300
Let's do an equipment check

499
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,960
just so we don't get stuck again

500
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,800
on whether my asteroids won't take it.

501
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,800
Pleasner, check.

502
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,440
Oxygenating decontaminating unit is A-OK.

503
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,100
And A-1 at Lloyd's.

504
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,380
All systems go.

505
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,680
A-OK.

506
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,860
A-1 at Lloyd's.

507
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:43,840
Woo!

508
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,640
Let's go for one more rocket.

509
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,920
A-OK.

510
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,040
Why are you Jasper?

511
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,940
A-OK.

512
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,280
Great.

513
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,560
Now bond�도 here,

514
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


515
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


516
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


517
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


518
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


519
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


520
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


521
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


522
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


523
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


524
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


525
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


526
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


527
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


528
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


529
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


530
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


531
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


532
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


533
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


534
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


535
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


536
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


537
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,560


538
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,660
Oh, oh, oh.

539
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,980
You gotta stop now

540
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,720
And do your thing

541
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,220
You better stop now

542
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,000
And get your groove

543
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,460
You better stop now

544
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,300
And do your thing

545
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,900
I said stop and think it over

546
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,720
Me and you are the type

547
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,820
To wear faded blue jeans out

548
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,280
We're the type

549
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,180
To go running in the rain

550
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
We're the type

551
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,680
To stay in bed all day

552
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,340
Forgetting the work

553
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,720
We spend all our love time

554
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,800
Loving one another

555
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,880
We're the type

556
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,140
You on my bed there, nude

557
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,920
We've met before

558
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,620
I know now

559
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,600
And you?

560
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,020
Jericho and Joshua

561
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,320
Great wall, trumpets may sound

562
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,080
Musicians' veins burst

563
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,380
And the temples of life are striving

564
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,400
But the crumbling comes from the building

565
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,340
Blasts of Gabriel's horn only awaken

566
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,920
Strength permitted the wall

567
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,120
To open down

568
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,860
And the walls of life

569
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,740
To the eternal

570
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,180
Awareness came from within

571
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,680
Glory, bachanda

572
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,480
Love, oh, Soto, basata

573
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,940
Oh, da, basata, da da, bada, bada, soto

574
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:49,800
Hallelujah

575
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,520
That's singing in tongues

576
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,700
For you illiterate folks out there

577
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,880
That's in the Bible

578
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,360
What happens is most folks

579
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,460
Just never saw anybody as

580
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,200
Annoyed as I am

581
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,020
As bold as I am

582
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,100
As wild as I am

583
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,600
On television

584
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,880
And I don't pull any punches

585
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,540
And I certainly ain't lukewarm

586
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,520
I hear you calling, but I can't come.

587
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,400
Glad you have it, gentlemen.

588
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,000
What more evidence do we need?

589
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,600
Now I am a monkey.

590
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,540
A monkey, monkey, monkey.

591
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,360
I am a monkey.

592
00:27:38,360 --> 00:28:08,320
I am a monkey.

593
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,600
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

594
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,020
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

595
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,680
Ah!

596
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:35,800
You are listening to a little video media audio blage from Yeti's Forbidden.

597
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,200


598
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,440
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

599
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:49,060
Ah, no subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

600
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,880
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

601
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,440
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

602
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,420
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

603
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,760
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

604
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,460
Oh, yes, friends.

605
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,740
And on, uh, side two.

606
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,100
So we shall venture into a new negative land.

607
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,980
Well, actually, it's the B side of a 45 from negative land.

608
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,740
And some oldies but goldies from the Duke of Madness from 1982

609
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,960
starring our old friend Bleepo Abernathy and Billy West,

610
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,600
who is now the voice of Ren, or Stimpy, or both, or something like that.

611
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,020
Praise Bob.

612
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,260
And until then, I don't know where we go.

613
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,500
Guess we go backwards.

614
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,120
Oh, yeah.

615
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,900
Oh.

616
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,220


617
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,800
Oh.

618
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,260
Oh.

619
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,300
And now, Negative Land.

620
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,900
Thank you.

621
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,020
Thank you.

622
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,840
Thank you.

623
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,260
Thank you.

624
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,220
Thank you.

625
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,000
The condolences of every person at Pepsi-Cola are with you.

626
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,960
Negative Land.

627
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,040
When your brain is doing bad.

628
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,520
Well, it could be this.

629
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,480
The taste is in the mind. I mean, it tastes better. The human mind is very important.

630
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:33,840
The taste is in the mind. The taste is in the mind. The taste is in the mind. The taste is better.

631
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:45,120
And yes, dear friends, that was a bit of a sneak preview of the new upcoming Negative Land album, Dispepsy.

632
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,640
Dispepsy could get them into a wee bit of trouble, dear friends.

633
00:34:50,780 --> 00:35:02,440
But yes, that is Negative Land. It's actually off of a 45, which has Truth in Advertising on one side and the B side of this 45 RPM record album.

634
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:14,360
Or little record is Dispepsy. The greatest taste around and taste in mind.

635
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,820
That was even worse than having Jesus visiting.

636
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,660
Yeah, I'm glad Jesus lives in Texas.

637
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,900
But you know, we can get just about anyone on our show.

638
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:32,420
And so without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a guest who needs no introduction.

639
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,900
Who's here to be on our show. So let's give him a big Virginia ham.

640
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,420
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

641
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,700
Well, that's not necessary.

642
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,900
Not necessary, but Ivan, it's great to have you here.

643
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,600
Well, it was interesting being transported.

644
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,180
What about your hour of slack?

645
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,100
Why don't you tell us something about what's it like to do an hour of slack?

646
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,040
We don't do.

647
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,940
Well, you know what I mean. I'm simplifying it for our listeners.

648
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,600
In California, you do.

649
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,820
But we're not in California. Actually, KPF Studios was transported here to Dallas.

650
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,360
Yeah, that's right, folks. All the way to Dallas, Texas.

651
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,060
Right. Yes.

652
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,320
Ivan Stang has pulled his pants down.

653
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,380
Only Stang could get away with something so, well, so gross, frankly.

654
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,780
Yeah, but it works. You know, whatever he does works.

655
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,420
Yeah. But it works. You know, whatever he does works.

656
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,260
knows how to excite the rebel. Look at them.

657
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,300
That caller has gone into spasms

658
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,260
on the kitchen floor. Well, if you've got a question for Ivan

659
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,920
Stang, call 848-4425

660
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,960
on the 510 area code.

661
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,460
And the crowd is going wild.

662
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,780
All he's doing is cleaning his glasses.

663
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,040
He's a great physical mime, a great physical

664
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,220
mimic. He can really get the

665
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,360
crowd in the palm of his hand, and then, of course,

666
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,180
he uses that hand to do something

667
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,760
else. Put that away.

668
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,720
I was just demonstrating. This is a plastic

669
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,780
demonstration model.

670
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,980
All right, okay. I'm sorry.

671
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,300
Well, now he's combing his hair.

672
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,140
Yeah, he is.

673
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,240
The hair on his head, too.

674
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,400
Well, this is a popular thing.

675
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,740
He's done this a number of times.

676
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,360
Now we're watching the Jon Stewart show.

677
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,420
He was on Jon Stewart,

678
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,280
Larry Sanders, he was on Leno,

679
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,460
Tom Snyder,

680
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,260
Tom Sawyer.

681
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,900
Now he's ruminating about lies.

682
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,560
To watch our show every day.

683
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,700
What color do you have? Your show every day?

684
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,960
The Skull and Bone Society show.

685
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,100
All right.

686
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,720
George.

687
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,560
Bush was in that.

688
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,420
Once we rule the United States,

689
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,780
everybody will have to watch

690
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,560
the Skull and Bone Society.

691
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,400
Oh, no. I had to say the magic word.

692
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,640
The shaman of

693
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,180
international finance capital.

694
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,480
Nervous laughter from the audience now.

695
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,020
Yeah, nervous in the service of their country.

696
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,020
That's right.

697
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,620
Kind of funny. I think it's kind of funny myself.

698
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,380
The DAR above you is...

699
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,860
Do you have a question for Ivan Stan?

700
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,240
Thousands of DAR hags,

701
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,300
that is, members of the Daughters of the American Revolution,

702
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
waving umbrellas and canes,

703
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,440
headed for...

704
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,580
Just pressing the call button brings a huge laugh from the audience.

705
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,120
It's Doctor of the Revolution.

706
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,520
I wouldn't say Doctor.

707
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,820
Now we're applying the voltage.

708
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,420
Oh, thank you.

709
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,800
He really...

710
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,020
Stan really answers the question in so few...

711
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,980
There is no such thing as a true question.

712
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,740
You're sure, Bob?

713
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,920
That's right. Our callers do the best they can.

714
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,540
If you have a question, send it to Bob.

715
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,220
That's true. And of course, what is that address of the local church?

716
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,220
Oh, uh...

717
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,020
PO Box 140.

718
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,480
14306 in Dallas, Texas.

719
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
In Dallas, Texas.

720
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:36,980
75214.

721
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,820
Yes, that's right. It's Eternal Salvation or Triple Your Money Back.

722
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,460
Or Triple Your Money Back.

723
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,740
Beyond science, reason, and orgasm.

724
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,620
Instant instructions for those who follow no master.

725
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,620
If you die and find yourself in the pits of hell,

726
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,920
you'll get a signed $90 check from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

727
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,640
...smoking and grinning in that face that you've seen a thousand times,

728
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,840
and the crowd loves it.

729
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,740
Hey, is that little Jesus there? The young Jesus?

730
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,640
This is that tiny waving Jesus box that that Burning Man guy had.

731
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:02,800
Oh.

732
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,060
Hello?

733
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,620
And now we'll punch up B.

734
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,320
Here's one about the callers.

735
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,980
Okay, there's B. Now A and B.

736
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,120
I think my skin is turned inside out.

737
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:23,000
And my ears hear weird things.

738
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,420
The back of my little mouth.

739
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,700
And the mask has come out of my belly button.

740
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,700
And I can't get the whole plug up.

741
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:55,440
And I'm afraid that was, in fact, someone else.

742
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,400
Now let's see what this old Duke of...

743
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,480
...Madness show from Reverend Bleepo and Billy West sounds like, okay?

744
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,120
Okay? Okay?

745
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,140
Okay? Okay?

746
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,520
What?

747
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,740
It got to...

748
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,340
...some fancy frown...

749
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,360
...night.

750
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,960
This was made when you make a deal.

751
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,360
Do you know who you can trust?

752
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,380
Do you sign your life away?

753
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,160
Do you write your name in dust?

754
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,820
Hey, hey, hey!

755
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,400
And the dogs of the day!

756
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,960
Dog is dog!

757
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,440
Dog is dog!

758
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,860
Dog is dog!

759
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:46,960
Dog is dog!

760
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,580
The following program is broadcast for K9 Entertainment.

761
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,340
For human enjoyment, it is closed captioned with a translation of the following audio.

762
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:54,340


763
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,140
provided by Dr. Ron Tintin of the Fido Institute.

764
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,920
That's right!

765
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,300
It's time for America's favorite television comedy program

766
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,680
that takes a wacky look at what the world would be like

767
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,120
if it was run by dogs instead of people.

768
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,720
Schnauzer knows best!

769
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,500
Here come those crazy canines

770
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,200
Who run smarter than the rest

771
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,400
The dogs all know what's happening

772
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,340
But Schnauzer, he knows best

773
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,060
Be very quiet!

774
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,340
I think Dad is coming home after a rough day at work.

775
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,980
Tooth for tooth

776
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,520
It's a lie

777
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,060
That's the truth

778
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,520
See the bad men on the street

779
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,220
Looking for something free

780
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:13,500
Here come the men that's just fans

781
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:13,900
Hey!

782
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,900
What's in it for me?

783
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,120
Hey!

784
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,500
Hey!

785
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,360
Every time that you cry

786
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,180
Hey!

787
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,580
That's the dog eat dog!

788
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,980
Dog eat dog!

789
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,700
That's ACDC right there

790
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,740
and of course the dog eat dog

791
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,900
and we've been saluting man's best friend the dog

792
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,680
here on the Duke of Madness Sunday sometime special

793
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,020
but leave us not forget

794
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,400
the dog's ever-present

795
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,460
diametrically opposed opposite

796
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,220
El Gato

797
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,320
the cat

798
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,040
Presenting now the Fat Chance Radio Players

799
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,900
with a little story concerning

800
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,300
cat talk.

801
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,520
You know I've been thinking that life was tough until the other day.

802
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,780
I just finished breakfast and was heading out the door for work.

803
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,640
As if on cue, Trinka, my Siamese cat, leapt from the couch and jumped in front of my path.

804
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,420
She looked up at me and said,

805
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:13,860
Wait!

806
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,260
Just as plainly as day, like that.

807
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,420
I flipped.

808
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,480
Cats don't talk, but mine looked up at me and did it.

809
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,320
She talked.

810
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,060
My cat talked.

811
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,840
I was incredulous.

812
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,040
I was so excited.

813
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


814
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


815
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


816
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


817
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


818
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


819
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


820
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


821
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


822
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


823
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


824
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,040


825
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,220
Trinka, I cried.

826
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,580
No need to get breathless on me.

827
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,300
She said.

828
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,100
I speak now because it is the appointed hour.

829
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,860
Take your coat off and come back into the living room.

830
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,200
There is much to discuss.

831
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,140
My sudden state of confusion made it difficult to understand

832
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,600
just how I was able to calmly remove my coat,

833
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,040
head back into the living room,

834
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,900
and sit down for a conversation with my cat.

835
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,320
To begin with.

836
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,560
Began the cat.

837
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,020
Whittle the boys in the lab here. This is the cat.

838
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,580
To begin with, we cats are not of this earth.

839
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,600
You what?

840
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,780
We are from the planet Flubis,

841
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,320
light years beyond any star system you humans have yet detected.

842
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,740
We came here around the time that you would call the dawn of civilization.

843
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:16,380
We civilized the Egyptians to the point where we no longer found it necessary to care for ourselves.

844
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,000
The humans took care of our needs.

845
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,300
Food, shelter, medicine.

846
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,200
And it's been that way ever since.

847
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,080
However...

848
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,340
Continued the cat.

849
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,720
We have let this civilization thing get out of hand.

850
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,820
You humans have gone too far.

851
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,720
At this very moment, a fleet of ships from our planet is heading for the earth.

852
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:46,780
Unless all nuclear weapons are defused and permanently demobilized,

853
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,680
the cats from outer space will simply land and spray a special gas

854
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,000
that will destroy the planet.

855
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,600
We will destroy all human life and will do the jobs ourselves.

856
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,720
It is your task to warn the world of this ultimatum.

857
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,660
You have 30 days.

858
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,520
I will say no more.

859
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,800
Good night.

860
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,020
She closed her eyes and was asleep.

861
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,320
But... but...

862
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,800
I was flabbergasted.

863
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,120
So this was the result of four years in animal behavior?

864
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,960
Mother was right. Dentistry is safer.

865
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,440
Nevertheless, this was real.

866
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,960
My cat had unmistakably spoken to me.

867
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,680
And what she said somehow made sense.

868
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,640
I fell into a fitful, anxious sleep.

869
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,500
Any doubts I had about my experience that night were thrown aside the next morning

870
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,760
when I discovered my cat sitting on the coffee table,

871
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,180
magic marker in hand, making little circles all over my atlas of the world.

872
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,940
What do those circles mean? I asked.

873
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,940
Trinka stared solemnly up at me and then pointed to a picture of an atomic bomb she had.

874
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,120
She had ripped out of a magazine.

875
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,540
I understood.

876
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,600
Realizing what had to be done, I canceled my appointments for the next 30 days

877
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,720
and embarked on my world mission.

878
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,660
Needless to say, I encountered no small difficulty in being heard.

879
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,200
You're imposterous.

880
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,060
The American liaison to the UN said,

881
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,900
Gates from outer space!

882
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,300
Laughed the Russian ambassador.

883
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,660
Dissolve all nuclear weapons?

884
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,600
Told you this.

885
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,020
The British representative could hardly contain himself.

886
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,000
Everywhere I went, it was the same thing.

887
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,020
Nobody wanted to hear an obscure animal behaviorist rant and rave

888
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,840
about the imminent threat of cats from the planet Flubis.

889
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,920
Time ran out like sand.

890
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,360
Exhausted, dejected, humiliated beyond reason,

891
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,420
I returned home early on the evening before it was supposed to happen.

892
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,000
I had been away for more than four weeks.

893
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,560
At least I could see the end come comfortably in a familiar place

894
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,780
and know I had tried to warn humanity.

895
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,840
I opened the door.

896
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,440
Stepped into the living room.

897
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,260
And there was Trinka, my cat, dead on the couch.

898
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,040
I couldn't believe it.

899
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,840
I wept openly, and all I could think was,

900
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,960
Why? Why? What did it all mean?

901
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,800
Couldn't she have broken a window or opened some cans to get some food?

902
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,400
It didn't make sense.

903
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,440
Dazed, I wandered back out onto the patio,

904
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,020
sat down overlooking the backyard and put my head in my hands.

905
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,580
Just then, a calico cat, one of the local ones, sauntered by.

906
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,600
He stopped and looked up at me.

907
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,500
What's the matter?

908
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,380
He asked.

909
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,820
I then proceeded to tell him the whole story while I looked on, bewildered.

910
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,360
Just as I was almost finished, the calico interrupted me.

911
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,820
Just a minute, he said.

912
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,320
What kind of cat did you say you had?

913
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,540
A Siamese. Why?

914
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,740
No wonder.

915
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,680
Look, buddy, do yourself a favor.

916
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,600
Never take what a Siamese cat says seriously.

917
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,500
They're all mad. Completely mad.

918
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:52,480
And shaking his head and grinning, the cat walked off.

919
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,280
At least the voices have stopped for a while.

920
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,140
I am so tired.

921
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,940
8.30, boy. Time you were in bed.

922
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,320
I don't know.

923
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,660
Whoo!

924
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,420
Well, don't you know, baby?

925
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,520
We're gonna make you rock and roll. Stop!

926
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,420
To many of us, that is an anxiety-producing term.

927
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:23,540
You got it?

928
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,860
You got it out of one word.

929
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,940
Out of the word of...

930
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,640
Whoo!

931
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,100
Whee!

932
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,060
Hey, Bob.

933
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,360
Where are you going with that knife in your hand?

934
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,600
Hey, Bob.

935
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,480
Hey, Bob.

936
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:46,480


937
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:46,480


938
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:46,480


939
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,740
Where are you going with that knife in your hand?

940
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,900
Going down to smoke some crop.

941
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,180
No, I got it way down in Malaysia land.

942
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,600
Going down to smoke some crop.

943
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,980
You know I got it way down in Malaysia land.

944
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,460
Hey, Bob.

945
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:16,460


946
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:16,460


947
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:16,460


948
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:16,460


949
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,320
Hey, Bob.

950
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,600
I heard that the X's are coming soon.

951
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,640
Hey, Bob.

952
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,780
Heard that the X's are coming soon.

953
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,260
Yes, they are. They're coming.

954
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,140
You know I had promised you that they would.

955
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,800
Yes, they are. They're coming.

956
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,820
You know that I had promised they would.

957
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,460
Is this too nice?

958
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,720
It is.

959
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,980
I'm a doctor.

960
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,100
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

961
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,860
I'm a doctor.

962
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,720
I'm a doctor.

963
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,320

964
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,500

00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:26,180


970
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:26,880
I'm a doctor.

971
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,680
A doctor.

972
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,300
You're my doctor.

973
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,780
I'm your doctor.

974
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,440
A doctor.

975
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,000
A doctor.

976
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,940
Yeah, yeah, good son.

977
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:38,940


978
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:38,940


979
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,160
You asked me to take more care of you,

980
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:39,340


981
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,920
No, that's the point.

982
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,000
Now you're saying?

983
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,120
Yeah.

984
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,020
Babylon will fall

985
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,180
Babylon will fall

986
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,940
Babylon will

987
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,320
Babylon will fall

988
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,600
Hey Bob

989
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,940
Where are all the pigs gonna run to now?

990
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,960
Hey Bob

991
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,040
Where are all the pigs gonna run to now?

992
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,440
Well they can't get away

993
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,340
The X's are gonna fry them up

994
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,560
Real good

995
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,940
Well they can't get away

And they're gonna be sorry

999
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,380

Yes friends

They're gonna be so so sorry

1005
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,840

Oh I'm sure that he must

1026
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,440
And what else do we hear there?

1027
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,420
Little Nina Hoggins?

1028
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,840

Reverend Stank

1039
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,340
That sure sounded like

1040
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,980
St. Andrew of Jehovah Hates Fred

1041
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,680

1045
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,380
Of Dr. Howell

1046
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,020
But I don't know

1047
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,560
I'm not sure

1048
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,380
I just don't know

1049
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,440
Hey

1050
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,580
Danger and Gregory

1051
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:53,600
They got away

1052
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,440
They did?

1053
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:54,780
What?

1054
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,000
They got away in the XR6

1055
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,100
In the X's?

1056
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,480
And the XR's

1057
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,900
Carrying six missiles

1058
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:00,820
The X's?

1059
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,540
Yeah but Commander

1060
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,460
They're not complete warheads

1061
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,780
They can't do much damage

1062
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,740
Not in themselves maybe

1063
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,320
But just forgetting

1064
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,220
The building down the street

1065
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,560
Isn't a atom bomb

1066
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,140
But

1067
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,880
Be sure to see what happens

1068
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,060
When Buzz and Happy

1069
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,960
Find themselves in the middle of a situation

1070
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,420
Involving the Space Patrol

1071
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:21,740
The Army

1072
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,180
And the atom bomb

1073
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,460
Next week on Space Patrol

1074
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:25,940

1076
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,340
Say goodbye to

1077
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,400
Retard bombs

1078
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,300
And chemical fumes

1079
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,680
Cow politics

1080
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,820
And man out of the blue

1081
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,940
Murder and rape

1082
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,540
And chemical waste

1083
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,520
Pollution and death

1084
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,200
Home of the brave

1085
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,580

Folly

1089
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,020
You're the crevice

1090
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,600
For Michael Brunch

1091
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,080
Exhibit ideas

1092
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,060

Archaic schools
