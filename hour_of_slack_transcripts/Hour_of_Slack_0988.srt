Mom. Mom.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,000

00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,260
Pope John Paul II waved the tape measure and terrorized the crowd at Rome's hospital for 31 years.

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,840
The pope is a Cub Scout catcher who led a traditional prayer.

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,300
Starting tomorrow, the 84-year-old pontiff will be shipped to recycling plants.

7

Syria has denied an accusation that it was directly involved in PR News in Washington.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm advised to stay indoors.

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,620
Meanwhile, President Bush may not be in a persistent vegetative state.

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,780
Jeb Bush has refused to reinsert a feeding tube in the brain-damaged president.

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,080
From PR News in Washington, I'm Bernd.

12
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,120
Death by South African President Becky.

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,780
John Paul could be seen holding a large weenie.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,320
I am near, he said. I also offer God's pee-pee.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,740
This is tomorrow.

16
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,240
Bob. Bob.

Lebanese officials haven't shown much inclination to probe PR News Washington.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,160
What's it like to have high or low blood pressure?

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,540
Increased heart rate or heart or blood vessel disease?

00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,080
Dry mouth, menstrual cramps, dizziness, insomnia, liver problems.

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,200
Problems urinate.

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,120
Constipation, nausea and decreased sexual side effects.

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,720
Ask your doctor about the self genius.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,100
Our all-star.

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,040
We are king.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,560
Distracted, disorganized, restless, unable to finish.

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
So let there be no mistaking this morning.

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,720
This sermon on tithing is a sermon where I'd seek what is yours.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,980
Ten percent he wants for protection.

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,580
Eh, protection.

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,040
This motivation to go before God and give God something.

33
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,860
This tithing is to bribe God, pay God, to get God to do something on our behalf.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,380
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,140
Forty-five hundred. Five thousand.

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,120
Pay up. Pay for protection. Ten percent or I'll...

37
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,740
Okay, I'll pay.

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,120
You win.

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,520
Go for the racket. Take ten.

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,040
Ten percent.

41
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,100
And it's all over.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,580
Here's the money.

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,080
There we got a wind up.

44
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,140
Count the money, May.

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,300
Eight thousand, nineteen thousand, twenty thousand.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,720
Look at it pile up.

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,180
Ten thousand, twenty thousand.

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,360
Look at it pile up.

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,480
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,660
From PR News in Washington, I'm screaming for help.

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,380
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops abandoned that illegal truck jammed with Catholics.

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
It is wise to always err.

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,520
The Supreme Court has declined to allow PR News.

54
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,740
Watch Bob quit smoking at bobquits.com.

55
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,360
All pulled out black, black, black, black, black.

56

Vapor, vapor, vapor, vapor, soup, soup, soup, soup, soup, soup, soup, soup, soup.

All night long.

60
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,620
Blood dump, blood dump, blood dump.

61
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,660
Take your medicine.

62
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:13,840
Take your medicine.

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,620
Have a good night.

64
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,000
Have a good night.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,920
Kids vapor, kids vapor.

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,080
What's it like to have urinating mouth?

67
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,800
What's life, sexual sin, sin, sinia?

68
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,260
What's neural menstrual type?

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,600
Sex cramps, life problems, constipating, dyscoma, sexual nausea and higher dry blood problems,

70
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,100
like increased heart rate or decreased blood ziness.

71
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,200
Feeling stressed?

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,000
Hey, I'm starting to sweat here.

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,940
Threatened?

74
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,680
People we've never met wish we were dead.

75
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,200
A fairy tale of a man who's never been threatened.

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,580
Afraid.

77
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,840

84
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,420

87
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,180
Harmful if swallowed.

88
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,440
Sexual urinating.

89
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,600
Conscionality is tight.

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,940
Right now.

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,960
Side effects.

92
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,060
Side effects.

93
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,200

Nervous blood disorders.

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,120
And blood clots.

97
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,760
Do it.

98
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,060
Do it.

99
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,800
Diarrhea.

100
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,420

Kidney.

105
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,120
Liver.

106
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,840
Or gallbladder.

107
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,460
Diarrhea.

108
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:31,980
Kidney.

109
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,380
Liver.

110
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,160
Or gallbladder.

111
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,660
Diarrhea.

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,980
It comes buttered, battered, basted, and roasted.

113
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,840
Diarrhea.

114
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,460
Stinky.

115
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,840
Stinky.

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,320
Stinky.

117
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,100
Diarrhea.

118
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,760
Bad diarrhea.

119
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,160
But it also comes from mom.

120
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,140
Kidney.

121
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,600
Blockage.

122
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,020
Dizziness.

123
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,760
Diarrhea with blood and stool.

124
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,740
And Grandpa Joe.

125
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,400
Bad diarrhea.

126
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,060
Or diarrhea with adhesions.

127
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,720

Or adhesions.

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,940
A healthy diarrhea can help.

132
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,100
And ask your doctor about adding unexplained women who aren't pregnant.

133
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,520
Breast.

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,820
Breast.

135
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,120
Breast.

136
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,940
Or may become pregnant.

137
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Cause the stinky.

138
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
You're gonna love it.

139
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,680
What more do you want?

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm being watched closely by the heads from Canada and Mexico.

141
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,720
The government says the brain-damaged federal appellate court has now been lowered from 42 to 1.

142
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,520
The ruler of PR News remains in Washington.

143
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
Bob is deteriorating rapidly without persistent PR News.

144
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,980
This is PR News in Texas.

145
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,460
Talk about steroids.

146
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,820
I have used steroids.

147
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,900
I love and respect performance-enhancing drugs.

148
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,220
Inject me with steroids.

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,620
I am intrigued with the idea of steroids.

150
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,820
You wake up, it's gonna work.

151
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,300
You wake up, it's gonna work.

152
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,660
You wake up, it's gonna work.

153
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,560
You wake up and go to work.

154
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,880
You wake up.

155
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,480
You go to work.

156
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,260
I'm going to fly.

157
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,960
I'm going to fly.

158
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,240
I'm going to fly.

159
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,740
I'm going to fly.

160
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,860
I'm going to fly.

161
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm going to fly.

162
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,900
You can't do what you can't do.

163
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,300
You can't do what you can't do.

164
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,420
You wake up and go to work.

165
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,660
You wake up and go to work.

166
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,280
You wake up and go to work.

167
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,780
You wake up and go to work.

168
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,620
You wake up and go to work.

169
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,540
You wake up and go to work.

170
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,600
You wake up and go to work.

171
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,500
Yeah, baby.

172
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,280
Yeah, baby.

173
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,560
That was Stylex.

174
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,600
Stylex, dear friends, from, where are they from?

175
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Bowling Green, I think.

176
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,760
We saw them at the Detroit Devival,

177
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,920
which we'll be playing bits from in future shows

178
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,660
and in this future show.

179
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,660
This is a future show.

180
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,580
It's such a futurismo show.

181
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,740
Bear that in mind.

182
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,540
Be cognizant that this show is taking place in the distant future.

183
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,740
Each moment it becomes the future as we spend it.

184
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,620
But friends, yes, Stylex.

185
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,140
I guess you could find them by way of Stylex.com,

186
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,800
although I'm really just guessing.

187
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,960
Actually, that's StylexOhio.com.

188
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,480
That's S-T-Y-L-E-X.

189
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
They were unbelievable.

190
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,780
It was like the divos all over again.

191
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,140
And friends, this show, which has a theme, by the way,

192
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,620
the theme of insanity, illness, and decay.

193
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,040
Just look at the money pile up.

194
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,660
Ah, yes.

195
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,720
The opening cuts were quite a varying bunch of collages,

196
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,120
but they were almost all by Fernanda Nde, Lee Murr,

197
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,040
and Reverend Norell Preff, who is back,

198
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,460
and also Reverend Chastain.

199
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,460
Chastain Smurker from Oz did a little bit in there.

200
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,800
Oh, and Dr. Levity.

201
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,400
The knee-brew subgenius, Dr. Levity, David Levity,

202
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,780
did that ad for Preemptin,

203
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,900
which you missed, Dave, because you were off getting medicated.

204
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,340
Oh, I love ads about, you know, fake, phony, satirical ads

205
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,940
about, you know, medical cycle, therapeutic drugs.

206
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,360
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

207
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:30,620
Shh.

208
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,700
I love them.

209
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,440
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,880
I've noticed that some of them are done in such a way

211
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,420
as to almost provoke a psychotic episode.

212
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,840
Yeah, they go on longer than the preferred 30-second slot

213
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,100
with a two-second hang tag on either side

214
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,460
so you can build in and swell,

215
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,960
and then come back out and repeat three times

216
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,720
the name of the product.

217
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Well, it's like it'll mimic your bad brain and your bad blood,

218
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,640
where suddenly the camera's wide-angle

219
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,940
and people are laughing into the lens at you

220
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,180
and looking menacing,

221
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,800
and cruel and happy at the same time.

222
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,560
And it says,

223
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,860
Are you feeling isolated, alone, and sad?

224
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,980
Then you need PercoHap.

225
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,680
Baxatil.

226
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,480
Yes.

227
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,440
Hapitil.

228
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,340
A kid will use it because bleeding of the groin,

229
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,140
dark eyelashes, and profuse character change.

230
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,320
And they will, too.

231
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,460
That's the funny thing.

232
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,300
They do need to give you all those disclaimers

233
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,580
because that stuff creeps up on you.

234
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,240
And now they're putting weird,

235
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,860
perfumes in them to make them available to children.

236
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,400
They smell like Flintstoners.

237
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,080
And so the little kids will drop them in their pocket

238
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,360
when they go to Right Aid or Discount

239
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,020
or wherever, Discount Meds.

240
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,440
You know, this should not be marketed

241
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,240
to people smaller than four foot high.

242
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,920
Kids on drugs.

243
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,360
They can prove that they're just abnormally short

244
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,180
and need a lot of psychoactive drugs.

245
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,880
But, you know, grade schools now?

246
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,080
People taking Xanax and Tropex in grade school?

247
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,060
I don't know.

248
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,300
Do you know where to get any?

249
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,120
Of course I know where to get it all.

250
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,840
But the thing is, you have to open the right door

251
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,660
with the right key.

252
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,700
Isn't that what it's all about?

253
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,540
It's opening new doors, baby.

254
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,520
Open the new doorway to mental illness.

255
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Break on through to the other side, dude.

256
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,260
It's all in the mind.

257
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,020
Well, try one of those doors.

258
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,620
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?

259
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,580
Yes, they do.

260
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,900
They do, though, don't they?

261
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,760
Yes, they do.

262
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,800
Don't they, though?

263
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't.

264
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,240
Voila, that's dope.

265
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,200
One door closes, another door opens.

266
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,920
I could just see Martini, like, blinking rapidly,

267
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,100
asking for his medication and being real refusenik and stuff

268
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,840
and Nurse Ratched grabbing him and throttling him

269
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,180
and shoving him down his throat with one of those toilet plungers.

270
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,520
This is my vision of modern mental health.

271
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,240
A restructuring of the brain without any effort from within.

272
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,100
Just a forced thing.

273
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,460
I'm sorry, I'll shut up now.

274
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,560
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

275
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,420
No, you were making just the...

276
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,040
You were saying...

277
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,880
You took the words right out of my mouth.

278
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,000
I was also making you sleep.

279
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,580
I wonder why you did that.

280
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,520
Because I like the smell of those tasty words

281
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,100
and I love the rumblings of your mouth,

282
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,200
so put two and two together and you get marshmallows.

283
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,320
You know, Dave, sometimes I can't really appreciate the tastiness.

284
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,540
Of your verbs.

285
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,160
Until I come back from here

286
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,040
and go to that other time of there and then

287
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,180
and hear it again.

288
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,140
Well, you are...

289
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,260
And then it's like a whole different world.

290
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,180
Well, it's now when you hear it again

291
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,100
because that's why you should record all this stuff

292
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,000
because we are recording in the future

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,900
and I'm tired of it too.

294
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,620
I noticed you were getting very sleepy there.

295
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,400
Oh, that's because of the pills.

296
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,880
I had to take the pills to keep me from falling asleep.

297
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,940
Did you take E-popped pills?

298
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,680
Uh...

299
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,920
Well, a generic.

300
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,380
A generic form of E-pop.

301
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,260
The generic E-pop.

302
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,940
Yeah, yeah.

303
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,560
That's when he coughs up his...

304
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,080
I took a red one.

305
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,560
I took two red ones and one blue one.

306
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,600
He coughs up his mental cud

307
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,540
and re-choose the lonesome cowboy Dave.

308
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,620
Cough, cough, cough.

309
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,300
Oh, cough it.

310
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,800
Then he can actually understand.

311
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,100
Cough it up now.

312
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,560
Cough it up.

313
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,520
You have to cough it up.

314
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,540
The smoke begins billowing out of your Vatican apartments

315
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,980
and a new pope has been elected.

316
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,560
A new E-popped of the Church of the...

317
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,220
Have they elected the new pope?

318
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,060
Is it Pope Black?

319
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,420
Or is it Pope Perro?

320
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,840
I think they have the pope...

321
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,040
Both Pope Black and both Pope Perro have a lot of...

322
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,280
Is it the brown pope?

323
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, because it was supposed to be the Antichrist.

324
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,980
Whoever the next pope is would be the Antichrist.

325
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,860
Well, he was born and raised in Vacaville

326
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,100
and they've been experimenting on him since then.

327
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,020
But I guess he's going to be the new one.

328
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:50,680
The brown...

329
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,040
Vacaville, is that Margarita, like Margaritaville?

330
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:53,980
Vacaville?

331
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,200
Yeah, except you have to drink the accessions of cow.

332
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh, okay.

333
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,380
The thyroid glands.

334
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,780
Listen.

335
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,900
I hear voices.

336
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,920
Voices in my head.

337
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,940
People learn.

338
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,240
In the music.

339
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,260
They can smell it.

340
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,880
They can smell it in your words.

341
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,740
Allora, padre deve ricordare una cosa.

342
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,460
Quando entriamo, deve detto...

343
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,520
Deve dire...

344
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,900
Deve dire...

345
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,440
Il nombre tre volte.

346
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,380
Il nome vero.

347
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,480
Ricordare...

348
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,720
I'm sorry, father.

349
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
I can't understand Italian.

350
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,580
I'm so nervous.

351
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,680
I'm forgetting my Italian.

352
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,020
I'm saying when you enter the room after the doctor leaves,

353
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,940
you must say his true name three times.

354
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,260
Okay.

355
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,760
I think I can remember.

356
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,100
I must say his real name three times.

357
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,660
Carol Ortilla.

358
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,280
Carol?

359
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,660
No, no.

360
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,360
His real name.

361
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,060
Yeah.

362
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,540
Ivan Stang.

363
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,700
Ivan Stang.

364
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,740
Ivan Stang.

365
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,320
Thank you.

366
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,880
Thank you.

367
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,600
Yes, yes.

368
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,920
People say I'm crazy.

369
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,580
But is it crazy to say that Bob is the real thing, baby?

370
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,000
And slack is where it's at.

371
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,240
Come on, man.

372
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,060
Get down.

373
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,900
He's alive.

374
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,180
He's a miracle.

375
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,540
Una miracola.

376
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,360
Una miracola.

377
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,900
Il papa se vive.

378
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,520
Il papa se vive.

379
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
People say I'm crazy.

380
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,700
Wait, where is that?

381
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,240
That was the L.S. Dudes, that music in the background.

382
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,920
That's another great name.

383
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,420
It was in the Detroit Revival.

384
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,360
The L.S. Dudes.

385
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
That's a lovely name.

386
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,420
I wish I would have created some other name.

387
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,580
They do great video.

388
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,140
Excellent video production.

389
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,420
There was a couple of devoid.

390
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:53,960
The birds.

391
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,620
The avial fornication.

392
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,420
The birds having anal sex.

393
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,340
Do you remember that little three-minute vignette?

394
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,060
Which now?

395
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,340
Now, these guys on the radio are starting to call blogs.

396
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,140
Okay?

397
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,100
And, you know, you play some songs.

398
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,800
You say, that little blog was like Jimmy Smith in 1958.

399
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,900
You know, I'm sorry.

400
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,300
They're calling what blogs?

401
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,720
They're calling little bits of anything blogs now.

402
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,240
Little bits of film.

403
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,280
Little bits of music.

404
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,040
What?

405
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,820
Little bits of even like a rant.

406
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,480
Even a rant where the Reverend Ivan Stang would be called a,

407
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,080
Stang is blogging a blog.

408
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,140
Now this is a blogging dude.

409
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,040
It shows that they've run.

410
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,500
They should be flogged.

411
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,740
They should be flogged from the blog.

412
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,780
For this rape of the English.

413
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,240
For the rape of the blog.

414
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,740
The king's bloglish.

415
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,920
They should be put against him.

416
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,360
King blog will be infuriated.

417
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,720
Guard, seize him.

418
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,040
Bring him to me.

419
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,220
So, you have been blogging about.

420
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,660
Oh, wait.

421
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,260
Now I'm doing it.

422
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,860
No, it's my place.

423
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,880
So, you have been blogging about.

424
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,940
You're supposed to respond now quickly.

425
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,620
Way out, baby.

426
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,880
The L.S.

427
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:01,960
Dudes.

428
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,800
Baby.

429
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,300
It is way out, isn't it?

430
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,020
Are those the L.S.

431
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,220
Dudes?

432
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,240
Actually, I don't know where I'm at now.

433
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,320
This is the one that marked Dave's background music.

434
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,400
Psychophant to call on.

435
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,280
My words to you in closing today.

436
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,580
Climbing.

437
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm just going to talk to you out of my heart.

438
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,080
Talk to you out of my heart.

439
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,040
Talk to you out of my heart.

440
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,600
Talk to you.

441
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,480
Talk to you out of my heart.

442
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,720
You are, you are jerky.

443
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,020
I'm going to talk to you out of my liver.

444
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,560
You are jerky.

445
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,200
Anything but the brain.

446
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,160
Don't talk from the brain.

447
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,400
And now from my spleen.

448
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,060
Oh, body parts.

449
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,220
Leave those brains alone, baby.

450
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,820
Leave those brains alone.

451
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,960
They taste real bad.

452
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,860
They smell real.

453
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,260
They feel sad.

454
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,420
Leave those brains.

455
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,780
Sex.

456
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,960
Sex.

457
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,560
Sex.

458
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,560
On my meds again.

459
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,280
Really need to get on my meds again.

460
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,780
My manic spells are losing me all of my friends.

461
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,240
And I can't wait to get on my

462
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,480
meds again.

463
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,960
On my meds again I've been places

464
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,180
that I've ever been.

465
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,340
Don't forget Zyprexa and the Wellbutrin.

466
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,140
And I can't wait to get on my meds again.

467
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,740
On my meds again.

468
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,880
Cause when I go off them,

469
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,660
I go down the highway.

470
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,480
I'm at odds and ends.

471
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,440
With strangers I think should be pointing my way.

472
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,400
And they all say,

473
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,200
On your meds again.

474
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,020
You really need to get on your meds again.

475
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,720
You can.

476
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,580
Maybe when you do we can make some amends.

477
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,260
But for right now get on your meds again.

478
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,820
But for right now get on your meds again.

479
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:09,820


480
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,300
I'm on my meds again.

481
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm on my meds again.

482
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,280
But for right now get on your meds!

483
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,860
That from nationalcynical.com.

484
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,420
And now, back to our mental illness special.

485
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,060
Starring Mr. Fernandanande Limura.

486
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,080
I'll do my hoot-out.

487
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,500
No.

488
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:38,840
Why?

489
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,080
I'll tell you why.

490
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,160
Hoot-out.

491
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,940
Hoot-out.

492
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,420
Hoot-out.

493
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,260
Hoot-out.

494
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,560
Would you do a hoot-out?

495
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:44,980
No.

496
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,380
Why?

497
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
I'll tell you why.

498
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,340
Hoot-out.

499
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,800
Hoot-out.

500
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,980
Hoot-out.

501
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,480
Hoot-out.

502
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:49,960
Hoot-out.

503
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,080
Magic and make-believe.

504
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,420
I choked you hard enough, you'll bring me back.

505
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,420
My cubbyhole.

506
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,500
I didn't say we're gonna swervel.

507
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,060
Hey, sometimes the older that the society is,

508
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,440
and you can say it's this raw shit being gonna swervel.

509
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,400
Some shit's gonna swervel.

510
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,160
Maybe later.

511
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,360
Do it all.

512
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,320
Do it all.

513
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,140
Do it all.

514
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:14,940
Do it all.

515
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,040
Do it all.

516
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,320
Do it all.

517
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,220
Fernanda Dandy-Lemur.

518
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,640
And now, the first of the recordings from the March 2005 subgenius revival in Detroit.

519
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:39,600
Dear friends, here be Senator Thompson Speck, reciting a nice poem by Doug Smith, age 23.

520
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,180
I am too intent to die!

521
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,480
I am insured for acts of God and Satan.

522
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,020
I cannot be tracked on radar!

523
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:55,920
Ahhhhh!

524
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,540
Ah, yes, baby!

525
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,180
I am a bacteriological weapon!

526
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,380
I am on and loaded!

527
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,660
I'm a fission reactor!

528
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,960
I fart plutonium.

529
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,280
When they plug me in, the lights go out in Hong Kong!

530
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,920
Come and get me!

531
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,600
I cook and eat my dead.

532
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,300
Yahoo!

533
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,960
The devil's here!

534
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,460
I can't answer my ideal playground!

535
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,160
Because I think backwards!

536
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,800
And I do it for fun!

537
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,160
I've sired retarded space bastards across the cosmos.

538
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,900
When I drop my drones, Mother Nature swoons.

539
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:40,800
Yeah!

540
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,120
I kidnap the future and I ransomed it for the past!

541
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,140
I left my spore on the rock of ages.

542
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,800
Ooh!

543
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,160
Down the flush with me!

544
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,120
Who will spill my dust?

545
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,740
I'm a crime-fighting master criminal!

546
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,380
I am not insane!

547
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,280
I'm a sign!

548
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,440
Opiates are the master of my religion because I take drugs!

549
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,580
I am a rib-snorter.

550
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,940
And I cram the coca leaves right into my veins before they're picked off the tree!

551
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,240
Come on and give me cancer!

552
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,920
I will spit up the tumor and butter my brain with the juice!

553
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,880
Yeah!

554
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,880
I'm a moray eel!

555
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,140
I am a Komodo dragon!

556
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,500
I am a killer whale!

557
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,840
Mirabdum is fucked!

558
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,800
I have a triple backbone!

559
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,360
I was sired by the wolfman!

560
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,080
Give me all your slack!

561
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,360
I told Jesus that I wouldn't go to church and he shook my hand!

562
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,740
I have my own personal saviors.

563
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,180
And I change them every hour!

564
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,440
I'm enlightened!

565
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,140
I achieved Nirvana and took it home with me!

566
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,660
Yeah!

567
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,160
When the rapture comes, I'll make them quake!

568
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,780
They will never clean my cage!

569
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,060
Never clean my cage.

570
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,720
So this is the second Detroit sub-tribe.

571
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:19,720


572
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,320
The genius revival.

573
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,080


574
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,360
Woo!

575
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,000
You look confused, sir.

576
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,060
Stand away from the...

577
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,360
Alright, stand away from the parking meter.

578
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,460
Sir, put your hands in your pocket.

579
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,000
Sir, it's okay. I have mental illness.

580
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,100
Of course you have it.

581
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,840
I have the mental illnesses.

582
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,920
Yeah, we all have them, sir. Just remain calm while we inspect your pockets.

583
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,200
The contents there...

584
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,420
But don't you understand, it's not crime.

585
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,940
Mental illness is a disease.

586
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,720
Don't worry, there's no...

587
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,660
It's a disease, that's all.

588
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,040
We have no proof of a thought crime.

589
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,760
Let's look in those pockets.

590
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,780
Come on, man, that's double plus ungood, dude.

591
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,060
This is blogging my mind.

592
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,860
You're ungooding me out, man.

593
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
Grab the woman first.

594
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,620
Well, the Bible says we should have blogs.

595
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,740
You have...

596
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,840
I'm a blog user, sure, I admit it.

597
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,860
You have more than you're supposed to.

598
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,240
I read blogs because it makes me feel good.

599
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,700
I'm so blogged, seriously.

600
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,240
I'm a blog user, seriously.

601
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,780
They're all crazy nowadays. They're all high on these blogs.

602
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,800
Stick them in the paddy wagon!

603
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,760
You are dirty.

604
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,700
You are dirty.

605
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,740
Dirty.

606
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,400
We're all dirt.

607
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,300
But...

608
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,420
But...

609
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,580
I'm so tired of being dirt.

610
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,400
I think I've spent the last 300 years of my life being dirt.

611
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Rapid, slow, and unkind.

612
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:42,680


613
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,240
I move with the movements of the earth.

614
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,580
Dirt.

615
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,600
Stone.

616
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,360
A rolling stone gathers no mass.

617
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:49,620
I...

618
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,480
You're right.

619
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,500
All of you are right.

620
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,340
Actually, you're right.

621
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,700
I'm mad.

622
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,600
The great,

623
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,320
the incongruous hero

624
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,700
is mad.

625
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,740
Yes, that's right.

626
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,800
I'm mad. Mad.

627
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,140
Mad.

628
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,140
Mad.

629
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,160
But mind you,

630
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,140
madness

631
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,000
is a very healthy sickness.

632
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,420
If it weren't for my madness,

633
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,940
I would have gone insane

634
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,460
long ago.

635
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,260
I was going to tell you about the schizophrenic

636
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,940
when he filled out his income tax,

637
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,340
you know.

638
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
You know what he did?

639
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,700
He carried himself with two exemptions.

640
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,520
But I think y'all are so great

641
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,680
you ought to run for president.

642
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,100
You know, politics,

643
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,060
some kind of politics

644
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,400
let the whole world know about you.

645
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,320
Well, Winona, I'm afraid

646
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,700
the U.S. has enough problems as it is.

647
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,340
We're trying to support J.R. Bob Dobbs

648
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,560
for World Overlord.

649
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,220
Politics.

650
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,500
There was this schizophrenic

651
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,480
that was running for president

652
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,360
or something, and his friend

653
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,680
told him that he sure was glad

654
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,820
that I've got half a mind

655
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,460
to vote for you. Thank you.

656
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,720
Thank you.

657
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,940
I'm going to tell you about

658
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:13,940


659
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,140
one of the

660
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,120
forbidden sciences.

661
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,540
You will pay to know what you really think.

662
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,440
If I pay money, then all of a sudden

663
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,480
everything becomes clear?

664
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,920
Everyone needs to know what they're really thinking

665
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,640
in their minds, and we can provide them

666
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,020
with helpful hints.

667
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,060
By the way, you can tell Bob that I got his message

668
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,500
and I understand.

669
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,380
Of course, at first I didn't know for sure

670
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,480
it wasn't part of the conspiracy,

671
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,700
but now I'm pretty sure it was him.

672
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,600
I'm pretty sure it was him, and Tom,

673
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,120
I'll be looking at next week's TV Guide

674
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,800
just to be sure.

675
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,480
Thanks a lot. I understand your code completely.

676
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,300
I think it's great that you give inspiration

677
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,980
to people like that who are obviously

678
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,940
out of their minds.

679
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,560
Bob said early in the game

680
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,320
that we should go for, since the

681
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,700
country itself seems to be going crazy,

682
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,460
that maybe crazy people are

683
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,520
the only ones that should be given

684
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,280
any responsibility.

685
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,620
Yesterday I announced on this program

686
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,600
that I was going to commit public suicide.

687
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,160
Admittedly an act of madness.

688
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,700
Well, I'll tell you what happened.

689
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,600
I just ran out of bullshit.

690
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,060
All right, cut him off.

691
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,040
Folks, out there in radio land,

692
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,520
today the Reverend R.D. Sopker

693
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,240
will be brought to you,

694
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,860
a real down-to-earth religious fanatic

695
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,160
who saves buildings,

696
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,840
and then the people.

697
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,020
How about that, boys and girls?

698
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,920
Get your decoder pins.

699
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,800
Forget letters on that.

700
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,300
I'm dissolving.

701
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,820
I wonder why I don't have my own show.

702
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,740
I tell the truth.

703
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,960
Hello, younger bear.

704
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,700
Goodbye.

705
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,400
There was a boy whose life I'd saved

706
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,980
through his mortal embarrassment.

707
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,300
Did you catch rabbits on your hunting trip?

708
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,240
No.

709
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,820
Then don't give the rabbits you didn't catch

710
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,200
to Buffalo Wallow Woman.

711
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,820
You see, younger bear had become

712
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,780
a contrary.

713
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,760
The most dangerous of all Cheyenne warriors

714
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,600
because the way they live

715
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,380
drives them half crazy.

716
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,660
Except for battle,

717
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,780
a contrary does everything backwards.

718
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,500
He says goodbye

719
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,940
when he means hello.

720
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,880
Yes when he means no.

721
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,840
Walks through bushes instead of on trails

722
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,580
and washes with dirt

723
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,820
and dries with water and so forth.

724
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,760
Oh, I wish I were a warrior.

725
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:31,760


726
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,380
I wish I were a king.

727
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh, I wish I qualified.

728
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,980
Oh, I wish I qualified.

729
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,460
Oh, I wish I qualified.

730
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:48,460


731
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:48,460


732
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:48,460


733
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:48,460


734
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,200
He's saying something over there.

735
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,760
Way over on that other channel.

736
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,160
No, you can't see left.

737
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,740
You can't hear anything.

738
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,900
You notice that our fish is strapped in.

739
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,460
He cannot see the two-way mirror

740
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,540
nor can he hear our instructions, ladies and gentlemen.

741
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,560
So you will be with us on this experiment

742
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,580
in green brain

743
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,320
in private.

744
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,180
We have his brain here

745
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,480
which we've taken out in a hologram.

746
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,700
It looks much like it does inside his head right now.

747
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,300
We're going to put it in the Vegematic.

748
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,940
You'll notice a lot of static.

749
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,940
A lot of static blur.

750
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,240
Now be careful.

751
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,740
Don't heat that brain up too much

752
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,740
because we've lost a lot of memories that way.

753
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,560
Perhaps we want to turn it down then.

754
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,720
When you put it back it just isn't the same.

755
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,260
Puzzling evidence.

756
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,640
Glass Madness. Doctors for Wotan.

757
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,340
From the 1981 subgenius album.

758
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,820
Media Barrage No. 3.

759
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,180
Sex, Sickness and Slack.

760
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,440
Other parts of this show were recorded last night

761
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,020
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Princess Wee

762
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,220
at WCSB in Cleveland.

763
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,980
But you can't tell which.

764
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,300
And all we can do is play

765
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,120
more and more and more.

766
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,020
It's going to drive somebody nuts.

767
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,160
In the year of 1963

768
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,920
I was committed to a metal institution.

769
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,120
Niagara Falls.

770
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,820
Slowly I turned

771
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,400
in stallion sidesteps.

772
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,940
There may be someone who looks

773
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,540
exactly like you.

774
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,460
Who is your physical counterpart

775
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,000
to the smallest detail.

776
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
But what about the other part?

777
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,940
The spiritual and the psychological

778
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,060
variants which go to make up

779
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,120
a man's soul.

780
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,060
And determine whether he is

781
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,540
sane or ginsane

782
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,960
or whether he is good or evil.

783
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,480
Perhaps your devil is a monster

784
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,460
and a murderer.

785
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,380
Perhaps you'll meet him now

786
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,160
on SHOCK.

787
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,660
The name is Juniper Johnson Jones

788
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,960
and I have a job here

789
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,000
as a happy hollow funny farm

790
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,960
in South Texas.

791
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,180
And I have a couple of folks missing.

792
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,340
I thought maybe you might

793
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,120
have your intelligent people

794
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,200
Uh oh, Uncle Juniper?

795
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,540
Is that you?

796
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,640
It's okay, Father. Cut it out.

797
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,580
I want to know if Jake might help me locate these people.

798
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,320
Well, they may be right here

799
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,080
in the room with me.

800
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,940
Why don't you give me some

801
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,660
background information.

802
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,720
Well, they're normal people

803
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,860
obviously, but sometimes

804
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,840
they get off the course and go south

805
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,620
instead of north.

806
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,100
I had a bed check

807
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,500
and they were missing

808
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,380
so I thought maybe they might tell me

809
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,400
how to find these people.

810
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,580
We have a happy place down here.

811
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,980
That's why they call it Happy Hollow.

812
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,320
But we're here to talk about my mental problems, folks.

813
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,880
I said they laugh at the saddest stuff.

814
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,800
You stood up and said

815
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,940
I am such and such and I'm mentally ill.

816
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
You wouldn't expect everybody to laugh.

817
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,180
But you can't be mentally ill

818
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,300
and self-righteous at the same time.

819
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,860
And yet, look how many people do it.

820
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,600
It's the most common thing in the world.

821
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,560
Anyway, I

822
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,920
guess what?

823
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,280
Don't take myself all that seriously.

824
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,460
I mean

825
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,940
look,

826
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,100
I'm a drunk.

827
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,400
And I have found

828
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,280
that oddly enough

829
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,120
that offends people

830
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,700
who do take themselves seriously.

831
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,320
And it takes a while

832
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,940
and it took me a while to figure it out.

833
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,660
But what it is, is sooner or later

834
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,320
it sinks into them that by definition

835
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,720
since I don't take myself all that seriously

836
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,680
I probably don't take them all that seriously either.

837
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,800
And they can't handle it.

838
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,960
They cannot handle that stuff.

839
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,960
And there's

840
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,420
nothing you can do about it.

841
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,540
There's absolutely

842
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,380
it usually takes them a while.

843
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,640
Oh, that guys not kidding

844
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,860
he really doesn't take himself seriously.

845
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,680
So what does he think of me?

846
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,500
I don't know what's right.

847
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,400
You don't know what's right.

848
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,480
I don't know what's right.

849
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,420
You don't know what's right.

850
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,520
I don't know what's right.

851
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,380
You don't know what's right.

852
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,520
I don't know what's right.

853
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,380
You don't know what's right.

854
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,960
I don't hear the voice of God.

855
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:27,800
Nazi,

856
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,060
it's you.

00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,060

Mom is sleeping with her daughter's man.

870

Don't assume it's you!

00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,740
You don't treat him right!

You don't know what's right.

I don't know what's right.

You don't know what's right.

876
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,260
I don't expect ever to know precisely what's right.

877
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,300
There are no simple-minded answers.

878
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,400
There are no simple-minded answers.

879
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,300
There are no simple-minded answers.

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,600
Before that, yours truly at Winterstar Symposium.

884
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,820
This background music is by Tom and Joe.

885
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,020
And coming up, Consortium of Genius.

886
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,280
But now, Help-O-Pewie.

887
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:12,040
The world ends tomorrow, and you may wind up in hell as an albatross being forced to swallow Alka-Seltzers thrown to you by televangelists.

888
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,520
The world ends tomorrow, and you may skip mass and abuse drugs anyway.

889
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,900
The world ends tomorrow, and you may walk like an Egyptian, a toasted one.

890
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,760
The world ends tomorrow, and you may never need an engine rebuild again.

891
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,820
The world ends tomorrow, and you may just lie there stained and drunk as usual.

892
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,220
Now then, what seems to be the problem?

893
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,440
Oh, it's my head.

894
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,780
Yes, I see. Would you fill out these forms?

895
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,640
Now then, sign here, here, here, here, here, and here.

896
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,400
Good.

897
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,120
Are you sitting comfortably?

898
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:48,900
Yes?

899
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,360
Are you ready?

900
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,280
Are you prepared for your...

Let's go over the symptoms, shall we?

904
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,020
Stress.

905
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,940
Fear of failure.

906
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,200
Knowledge.

907
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,940
Exams.

908
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,940

917
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,940
Doctor, what is your diagnosis?

918
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,840
A small part of you wants to die, but most of you wishes to live.

919
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,200
There must be a solution to this problem. Here's some advice that I'm happy to give.

920
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,420
The source of your consternation is buried deep inside of your head.

921
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:59,000
Get rid of the defective part yourself. You'd be a lot happier if your brain did.

922
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,960
MO BO CHO NAY!

923
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,200
MO BO CHO NAY!

924
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,280
Oh, Doctor, are you sure you know what you're doing?

925
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,760
Quiet!

926
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,880
Sonic Micro activated.

927
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,800
Sonic Micro activated.

928
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,740
Oh, my brain is a mess!

929
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,100
Perfect. A perfect specimen!

930
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,240
HA HA HA!

931
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,520
HA HA HA!

932
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,080


933
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,780
HA HA HA!

934
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,800
Power.

935
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,260
Pressure.

936
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,920
Presence.

937
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,240
Presence.

938
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,560
Politicians on the left.

939
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,940
Politicians on the right.

940
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,400
Politicians on the left.

941
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,660
And politicians on the right can use a...

942
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,740
MO BO CHO NAY!

943
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,640
MO BO CHO NAY!

944
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,620
MO BO CHO NAY!

945
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,940
MO BO CHO NAY!

946
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


947
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


948
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


949
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


950
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


951
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


952
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


953
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


954
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


955
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:32,940


956
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,260
So much!

957
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,320
Next!

958
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,400
Okay, you're next, dude.

959
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,680
Go ahead, I can wait.

960
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,480
Consortium of Genius, friends.

961
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,760
From their new CD in Cog We Trust.

962
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,740
And you can get more at consortiumofgenius.com.

963
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,860
And now, friends, the greatest thing we have ever played on this show.

964
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,740
Wait a minute.

965
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,740
Now, I can't find it, friends.

966
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,640
I can't even remember what it was going to be.

967
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,580
Oh, forget it.

968
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,420
Just forget it. It's not going to happen.

969
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,040
It's going to be a bummer, man.

970
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,200
That's what Bob said.

971
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,640
Everything.

972
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:29,860
Everything is.

973
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,460
He said it's going to be a bummer.

974
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,200
And it is going to be a bummer.

975
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,980
In fact, let's just switch over to this bummer right now, okay?

976
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,300
Just, just, just...

977
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,600
Crack.

978
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,200
Not the common form.

979
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,260
Cracks.

980
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,280
In the earth.

981
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,140
Precious soil.

982
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,480
Groundwater shrinking lower.

983
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,120
No groundwater.

984
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:52,880
Desert.

985
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,360
Dry.

986
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,460
Collapsing land.

987
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,600
No reserves.

988
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,640
Can't be filled back up.

989
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,400
Toxic waste.

990
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,020
Chemicals seep into it.

991
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,240
Highly concentrated.

992
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:04,960
Long time.

993
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,680
Long time.

994
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,160
Chemicals finding their way into the drinking supply.

995
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,880
Waste disposal.

996
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,840
Coastal areas.

997
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,000
Contamination.

998
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,040
Contamination.

999
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,140
Contamination.

1000
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,920
Gasful.

1001
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
End of message.

1002
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:40,640
Long-term care insurance is for straight up to work hard their whole life, save their money, and be prepared to die.

1003
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,080
And seeing dollar signs, some form of dementia, I'm just going to shoot myself dead.

1004
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,420
On the flip side, what is your money for?

1005
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,600
Why are we working?

1006
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,620
Why are we making money?

1007
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,580
And obviously, long-term care would affect someone going on vacation in a big way.

1008
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,920
What is your money for?

1009
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,500
Butt heads all the time die.

1010
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,620
And what a morbid thought.

1011
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,800
Live life.

1012
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,020
You're ready.

1013
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,620
Live life like you're going to die.

1014
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,300
Because you're going to.

1015
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,140
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you're going to die.

1016
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,940
Maybe not today or even next year, but before you know it, you'll be saying,

1017
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,980
Is this all there was?

1018
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,180
What was all the fuss?

1019
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,420
Why did I bother?

1020
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,400
Now, maybe you won't suffer.

1021
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,960
Maybe it's quick.

1022
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,980
But you'll have time to think.

1023
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
Why did I waste it?

1024
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,340
Why didn't I taste it?

1025
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,260
You'll have time.

1026
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,040
Because you're going to die.

1027
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,340
Yes, it's going to happen.

1028
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,620
Because it's happened to a lot of people.

1029
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,560
A lot of people I know.

1030
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,300
My mother, my father, my loves.

1031
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,500
The president, the kings, and the pope.

1032
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,040
They all had hope.

1033
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,740
And they muttered just before they went,

1034
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,820
Maybe I won't go.

1035
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,820
Live life like you're going to die.

1036
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,460
Because you are.

1037
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,580
Maybe you won't suffer.

1038
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,820
Maybe it's quick.

1039
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,440
But you'll have time to think.

1040
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,740
Why did I waste it?

1041
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,900
Why didn't I taste it?

1042
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,820
You'll have time.

1043
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,940
Because you're going to die.

1044
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,160
You're going to die.

1045
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,680
I tell you who else left us.

1046
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,000
Fast on gone to heaven, no longer with us.

1047
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,600
Johnny Cash.

1048
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,180
JFK, that guy in the stones.

1049
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,140
Lou Gehrig, Einstein, and Joey Ramone.

1050
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,340
Joey Ramone.

1051
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,020
Have I convinced you to read my lips?

1052
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,380
This may come as news, but it's time.

1053
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,780
You're going to die.

1054
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,980
You're going to die.

1055
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,180
By the time you hear this, I may well be dead.

1056
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,880
And you, my friend, might be next.

1057
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:20,640
Huh?

1058
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,220
We're all going to die.

1059
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,060
Yeah.

1060
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:25,540
Yeah.

1061
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,780
Oh, maybe you won't suffer.

1062
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,460
And maybe it's quick, but you'll have time to think.

1063
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,600
Why did I waste it?

1064
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,400
Why didn't I taste it?

1065
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,500
You'll have time.

1066
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,840
You'll have time.

1067
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,700
You're going to die.

1068
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,040
You're going to die.

1069
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,140
You're going to die.

1070
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,700
Yes, you're going to die.

1071
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:56,900
You're going to die.

1072
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,540
You're going to die.

1073
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,040
You're going to die.

1074
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,580
I tell you, you're going to die.

1075
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,680
You're going to die.

1076
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,100
You're going to die.

1077
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,060
Because maybe you won't suffer.

1078
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,320
Maybe it's quick, but you'll have time to think.

1079
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,780
Why did I waste it?

1080
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,600
Why didn't I taste it?

1081
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,180
You'll have time.

1082
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,140
Because you're going to die.

1083
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,460
You're going to die.

1084
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,300
Live life.

1085
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,320
Live life like you're going to die.

1086
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,500
Because you're going to.

1087
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,320
Oh, yes.

1088
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,380
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

1089
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,460
But you're going to die.

1090
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,580
Maybe not today.

1091
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,460
Or even next year.

1092
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,100
But before you know it, you'll be saved.

1093
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,760
It's all there.

1094
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,120
What?

1095
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,800
What is all the fun?

1096
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,420
You too, friend.

1097
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,600
Why did I bother?

1098
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,400
Why did you bother?

1099
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,520
Why did you even care?

1100
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,420
Why did you even get out of bed, you sap?

1101
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,880
Why did you suck down them mutagens when you know you should have had hot sundry pies?

1102
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,200
Why did you force those things into your eyes which were made of sharp metallic objects

1103
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,080
when you should have viewed some nice flowers or the river flowing by?

1104
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:10,580
Yeah!

1105
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,120
Yeah!

1106
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:11,640
Yeah!

1107
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,180
Why didn't you get with it, man?

1108
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:13,920
Yeah, man.

1109
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,040
Why did you waste it?

1110
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,200
Why did you spend your life serving the conspiracy?

1111
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,460
Why did you work indirectly for George W. Bush and his evil cronies?

1112
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:23,940
Yeah.

1113
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,580
And Bill Gore and his Hillaryans?

1114
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:26,940
Yeah.

1115
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,580
And then all of those stupid people.

1116
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,380
You did it because you didn't care and you didn't know and everybody hates everything.

1117
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,580
And what kind of people go around jerking off their spleens, masturbating their spleens?

1118
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:36,960
Yeah!

1119
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,460
Why would you want to do that?

1120
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,660
Why would you even do that?

1121
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,540
It doesn't make any sense!

1122
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,800
I can't even think of it.

1123
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,240
Oh, wait a minute.

1124
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,200
I can think of it.

1125
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:54,760
Millions and millions of angry people masturbating their spleens furiously, first trying to find

1126
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,960
out where the organ exists.

1127
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,920
Asserting their body to the body.

1128
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,900
They know that once they've stimulated that spleen enough that the essence of spleen, what

1129
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,620
is it called again?

1130
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,920
Uh, bergamot?

1131
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,380
Bergamot.

1132
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:07,560
Yes.

1133
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,040
Bergamot explodes into their, well, they're victimized by the whole spleen.

1134
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:18,780
But anyway, bergamot explodes from the bottom chakra and rushes forward up the spine to

1135
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,080
the top, the crown of the creation, and destroys every figure in its path.

1136
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,900
And that's when you...

1137
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:26,900


1138
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:26,900


1139
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,900
You lose your slack to the conspiracy.

1140
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,500
Because you let it go.

1141
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,020
You ignored the word of Bob.

1142
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,520
Don't step out of line!

1143
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,920
And now you're in the salt mines.

1144
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,900
Literally in the salt mines.

1145
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,840
Under Lake Erie.

1146
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,240
Salt.

1147
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,100
Yeah, paid in salt and cigarettes.

1148
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,120
Hey, comrades.

1149
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,700
Would you like another lucky stroke?

1150
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,800
But there is a way out, my friend.

1151
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,320
There is a way out.

1152
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,640
Somewhere out there is a cool, cool guy.

1153
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,180
And he's driving a cool, cool car.

1154
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,960
And he's got the coolest car keys for that car.

1155
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,720
And the coolest key chain.

1156
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,840
And everything about him is so cool.

1157
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,080
And he's got the coolest pipe hanging out of his mouth.

1158
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,600
And he's got the hood down.

1159
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,340
And the radio's turned up playing this music you hear in the background.

1160
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,880
And he's cool.

1161
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,760
Cool, too.

1162
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,480
And it's kind of cooling around the salt mine like it's a resort on the lake or the ocean somewhere.

1163
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,560
And I convertible.

1164
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:37,260
I feel like an American in the 19-whatever-that-damn-hell-it-is.

1165
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,660
He's got slack, my friend.

1166
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,980
Care for another joint, Charlie?

1167
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,420
Care for another poke on that whiskey bottle?

1168
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,060
Let's stop at the bar and pick up some babes.

1169
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,560
Isn't it about time you got a ride with them cool guys?

1170
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,900
Why are you on that bus with those bozos, brother?

1171
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,740
Why are you on the bus?

1172
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,460
I'm on the bus with all the people with the very, very nasal bozos.

1173
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,140
Oh, I understand.

1174
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,200
Because you're stupid, ugly, short, broke, poor.

1175
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,180
Deviated cheptum.

1176
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,400
Deviated rectum.

1177
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,160
Not very outgoing.

1178
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,680
Stupid cheptum.

1179
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,820
Kind of perverted.

1180
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,400
You smell funny, they say.

1181
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,280
They tell you.

1182
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,480
Over and over again.

1183
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,120
And I smell like this.

1184
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,640
Well, friend, there is that guy driving that cool, cool car.

1185
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,100
We'll still pick you up.

1186
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,460
This guy.

1187
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,520
That's how cool he is.

1188
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,700
You know why?

1189
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,460
Because he's cool.

1190
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,180
I'm talking about the way I kick the ...

1191
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,100
And he's Bob.

1192
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,960
Yeah, he's Bob.

1193
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,460
You knew who I was talking about.

1194
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,520
You know I was talking about Bob.

1195
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,520
You know I wasn't talking about Jesus.

1196
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,980
You know I wasn't talking about Buddha.

1197
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,140
You know I wasn't talking about lonesome cowboy Dave, Reverend Ivan Stane.

1198
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,920
No, because I'm not going to pick you up.

1199
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,780
And Dave ain't going to pick you up, but J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1200
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:46,520
You hang your $30 out the window and he'll pick you up.

1201
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,960
Bob will lift you up into his pickup truck.

1202
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,440
up. And he'll let you ride in the back with all them other mutants, misfits, nobodies,

1203
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,720
and presidents, and geniuses, undiscovered geniuses. He will gently, gently pick you

1204
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:11,900
up and tickle your scrotum in the back of that window-tinted van. And you know that

1205
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:18,360
guy way in the back of the pickup bed, the guy that really smells like he's been sleeping

1206
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,780
with skunks? In the far part. That's Doc Frop. He grows the best frop in the whole world.

1207
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,980
And you, you just gotta ride with him. You're in the back of the Bob's pickup truck with

1208
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:33,320
Doc Frop, my friend, and you're cruising. You've got it made. And why? Only because

1209
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,280
you joined the Church of the Subgenius. That's how you got that. That's how you got that

1210
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,520
way. Instead of working in that factory. You're not hitchhiking now. You're riding!

1211
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,340
That's right, friend. You're either on the saucers or you're off the saucers. And when

1212
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,640
you're on the saucers, believe me, it ain't easy to get off. Or you're on the sauce.

1213
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,860
Oh, yeah. If you're on the saucers, it's a day and day, day, day, day, day, day, day,

1214
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,900
day and day, I think, see? You wake up in the morning, you got the shakes. Then you

1215
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,840
got the smooth, see? It's different than the shakes. It's just like everything is real

1216
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,300
like liquid, see? And then, look, around four o'clock, you go into like a different dementia.

1217
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,060
Yeah, around four or five o'clock, you become real cynical and wise, see? Everything you

1218
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:19,160
see gives you like a pain in the ass. You gotta make a remark, see? Church of the Subgenius

1219
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,980
indeed. Who needs this stuff?

1220
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,440
What a love of...

1221
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:31,420
Wait, the connective tissue in my brain. I can smell myself drifting, drifting over

1222
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,780
the horizon. Goodbye!

1223
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,640
Goodbye.

1224
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:35,640
Bye.

1225
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,280
Goodbye.

1226
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:36,960
Bye.

1227
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,600
Bye.

1228
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,520
There's no place like home.

1229
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,320
There's no place like home.

1230
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,240
Especially when you're not there.

1231
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,920
Ignore the man behind the curtain.

1232
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,840
There's no place like home.

1233
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,960
There's no place like home, all you...

1234
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,060
Oh, the puppies.

1235
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,220
Oh.

1236
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,380
Oh.

1237
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:01,140
Believe it or not, Princess, this is the same song that the amino acids do at about

1238
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,140
15 times the speed.

1239
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,020
Oh, wow!

1240
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,420
Oh, wow!

1241
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,340
Oh, wow!

1242
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:10,880
Oh, wow!

1243
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:11,440
Oh, wow!

1244
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:12,840
Oh, wow!

1245
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,320
Oh, wow!

1246
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:13,940
Oh, wow!

1247
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,120
Oh, wow!

1248
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,400
Oh, wow!

1249
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,580
Oh, wow!

1250
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,080
Oh, wow!

1251
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,440
Oh, wow!

1252
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,140
Oh, wow!

1253
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,200
Miserable!

1254
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:39,940
Yeah.

1255
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:40,980
I love it.

1256
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:41,340
It's weird.

1257
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:47,520
The original version, I guess, that Dale turned into a surf song and that when you meet him,

1258
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:47,560
Oh, oh!

1259
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:47,560


1260
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,200
I was turning into a thrash death song.

1261
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,640
This was belly dance song, too.

1262
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,080
Very beautiful belly dance.

1263
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,420
Belly dance?

1264
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,300
Did you ever belly dance to this song?

1265
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,420
I have no belly.

1266
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,180
I have no guts.

1267
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,240
You got to have guts to do a belly dance.

1268
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,560
Hey, but you got a butt.

1269
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,760
You got a great big butt.

1270
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,960
You got a butt your way.

1271
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,200
I loved her butt.

1272
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,920
I couldn't stand her cooking.

1273
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,360
Remember back in the day, they had the butt now.

1274
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,780
Now, that man could dance out any day for a while.

1275
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,980
Unfortunately, he lost his mind like the rest of them.

1276
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,500
I have a body here.

1277
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,620
I got a lot of mind.

1278
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,520
It's hard to find a true weirdo these days.

1279
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,760
It really is.

1280
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,020
I mean, what is a weirdo?

1281
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,380
Is a weirdo somebody who has a tattoo?

1282
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,060
When I was a kid, if you saw somebody who looked like me,

1283
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,520
you had long hair and a beard.

1284
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,660
You'd go, wow, look at that guy.

1285
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,580
He looks like a cowboy or something.

1286
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,960
He looks like some, what a weirdo.

1287
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,720
Or you see a bald-headed person with tattoos.

1288
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,720
Oh, a pirate.

1289
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,960
Oh, I can't believe it.

1290
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:45,520
He's got earrings.

1291
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,640
That was really something special.

1292
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,560
Well, now I guess everybody shopping at the mall is a weirdo.

1293
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,860
Everybody who's got a, I mean,

1294
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:58,100
old grandmas have tattoos, nose rings, and long beards and so forth.

1295
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,740
I mean, it's, what?

1296
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,780
Well, and see, I'm not being shocked by the youth.

1297
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,240
What happened?

1298
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,520
I have some people my age say it's rap music.

1299
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,700
It's nothing but noise.

1300
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,860
It's not even music.

1301
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,940
Some, but not enough.

1302
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,820
I mean, or something.

1303
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,060
I mean, what happened to the instant rebellion

1304
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,840
that just went with being a kid or a weirdo?

1305
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,700
It's all getting watered down or something.

1306
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,460
Television's getting better.

1307
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,060
I think that's what it is.

1308
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,100
The Internet's gotten really entertaining.

1309
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,180
It's almost like TV.

1310
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,380
You don't have to read.

1311
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,520
Turn on the Internet and voices come out, little movies and everything.

1312
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,000
Yep, goodbye.

1313
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,100
Bye.

1314
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,500
Written word.

1315
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,600
Maybe for the best.

1316
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,380
I don't know.

1317
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,260
What you don't know,

1318
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,880
sometimes when I look at severely retarded people,

1319
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,540
it's like they have this smirk on their face.

1320
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,060
Like, they don't know something you do know.

1321
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,300
And they're proud of that.

1322
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,360
They're happy with that.

1323
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,440
And I'm envious at times, you know.

1324
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,780
And I try to be,

1325
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,560
well, tonight I'm going to try real hard to be like them.

1326
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,840
And not know anymore what I do know.

1327
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,700
Changing channels in your heads, friends.

1328
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,260
It's really fun.

1329
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,180
From PR News in Washington, I'm getting worse.

1330
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,480
Doctors say they're basketball fans,

1331
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,140
and Michigan State battles with PR News.

1332
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,440
Lawyers say Bob had little chance of winning.

1333
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:38,360
Reverend Jesse Jackson climbed the side of the St. Peter's Dome

1334
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,240
before he killed nine people, then himself.

1335
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,460
Authorities demanded Pope John Paul start a lottery

1336
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:43,980
to help him win.

1337
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm Washington.

1338
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,720
Alan Greenspan.

1339
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,360
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan

1340
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,940
may be a mixed blessing for suburban homeless.

1341
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,040
The Bush administration kept up its condemnation

1342
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,000
of Alan Greenspan.

1343
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,260
The latest attacks come just a day after Greenspan

1344
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,960
assassinated his son for crimes against humanity.

1345
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,460
A federal judge in Billings, Montana,

1346
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,760
has blocked the import of live Greenspan from Canada.

1347
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,420
The U.S. border has been closed to Greenspan

1348
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,120
since Canada reported a case of mad Greenspan disease in Washington.

1349
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,680
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan

1350
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,960
warned members of the House Budget Committee today

1351
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,800
of the dangers of PR News

1352
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,100
and urged them to fix PR reports.

1353
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,460
Greenspan's comments said,

1354
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,080
We are fundamentally inappropriate.

1355
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,900
Greenspan said PR News needs restructuring.

1356
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,780
He said the current program has made many nervous,

1357
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,280
and by 2030 there will be just two workers

1358
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,100
to support PR News Washington.

1359
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:43,400
The Supreme Court has said that the U.S. government

1360
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:43,480
will not be able to support the U.S. government

1361
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,040
The Supreme Court heard arguments this morning

1362
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,000
in two cases that challenged displays of Alan Greenspan

1363
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,100
on government property.

1364
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,340
Opponents say the displays amount to an endorsement

1365
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,680
of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.

1366
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,460
They also called for the resignation of Greenspans

1367
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,480
who are linked to PR News Washington.

1368
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,160
You're listening to the subgenius hour of slack,

1369
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,700
and you'd better watch it,

1370
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,500
because we're absolute loonies determined to offend

1371
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,860
players of pool with Jesus anyway,

1372
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,500
a few of us own guns.

1373
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,080
And that staying guy makes the

1374
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,040
Satanic Tabernacle in Wickenburg, Arizona

1375
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,400
look like Space Mountain.

1376
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,300
Any questions?

1377
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,120
Any participation in the church has essentially

1378
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,200
a 50-50 chance of either A,

1379
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,760
giving you many opportunities to put your face

1380
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,320
between the hooters of fate and go

1381
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,980
whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, like Curly,

1382
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,680
or B, to have your breasts whooped.

1383
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,420
Now, listen to this.

1384
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,320
You got your pudding now.

1385
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,220
Now.

1386
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,220
Now.

1387
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,200
Now.

1388
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,360
You got your pudding now.

1389
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,360
You got your pudding now.

1390
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,380
You got your pudding now.

1391
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,380
You got your pudding now.

1392
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:41,940
You got your pudding now.

1393
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,360
You got your pudding now.

1394
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,060
You got your pudding now.

1395
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:43,280
You got your pudding now.

1396
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,280
You got your pudding now.

1397
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,860
That's one mango lassie,

1398
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,040
one mango fido,

1399
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,080
two pints of mild,

1400
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,100
and a neat vodka chaser.

1401
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,400
You got your pudding now.

1402
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,640
No, my pudding is trapped forever.

1403
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,260
Can you swim in pudding?

1404
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,860
No, but I don't care.

1405
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,880
They can take our lives,

1406
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,020
but they'll never take our pudding.

1407
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:04,780
What?

1408
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,280
No pudding.

1409
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,640
I got a bowl of chocolate pudding in my underpants.

1410
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:10,220
Ah!

1411
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,220
Chocolate pudding,

1412
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,880
it comes in a cup.

1413
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,980
Chocolate pudding,

1414
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,840
it's only a bar.

1415
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,160
It'll cost you a dollar.

1416
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,740
From Maui's Kitchen,

1417
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,820
it's a labor of love.

1418
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:31,340
Ah!

1419
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,060
Chocolate pudding,

1420
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,080
it comes in a cup.

1421
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,960
Chocolate pudding,

1422
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,200
it's only a bar.

1423
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:42,200


1424
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,240
It'll cost you a dollar.

1425
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,080
How can you have any pudding if you don't see your meat?

1426
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,240
You got your pudding now.

1427
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:51,580
You got your pudding now.

1428
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:58,040
Keep thinking about pudding.

1429
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,140
Pudding.

1430
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,140
Pudding.

1431
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,140
Pudding.

1432
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,120
Pudding.

1433
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,420
Pudding.

1434
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:04,780
Pudding.

1435
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,360
Pudding.

1436
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:10,700
Good morning нед

1437
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,760
Good riveting, my friends,

1438
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,920
from over 200riv highlight.

1439
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:13,700
Today we have a little girl

Before that, Hellpop Onu.

1443
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:25,680

Praise Bob.

1450
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,420
From PR News in Washington, I'm finding it difficult to breathe.

1451
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:01,160
The prices are down 8740.48.

1452
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:08,480
The government reported today that Pope John Paul has killed 10,000 soldiers and wounded 128 million others in Iraq.

1453
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,500
The pope's occurred north of Baghdad.

1454
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:16,480
The government says the 84-year-old pontiff was captured this week and was a terror mastermind from PR News.
