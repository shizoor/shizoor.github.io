1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,800
There are people out there. We hear you.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,800
Yay.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,240
Yes, how may I assist you?

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,640
Your time has come.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,480
For what?

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,540
The Self Genius Hour of Slack.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,200
Thanks to the large for that.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,220
Yes, dear friends.

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:48,960
This Hour of Slack number 1319 is the first time I've actually spoken on the show since we got back from X Day Drill number 14.

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,080
Actually, it was the 16th one.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,460
As well as the 16th one.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,660
As well as Starwood Festival.

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:10,340
Because since that day I have been counting money and unpacking and mainly cataloging the media recorded by myself, Reverend Shaw, Ministry of Slack, and many others during both events.

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,600
Some of the best X Day photos are already up on subgenius.com.

15
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,600
Adults only.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,480
But we had two to three bands a day at X Day.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,860
Followed by ranting and jamming and more than one hour or Ministry of Slack every day.

18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:38,840
And I'm still not done prepping all these hundreds of files and deprogramming all these damn new zombies we picked up.

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,560
The X Day drill at our new site, Wisteria, went great as did Starwood.

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,460
In fact, X Day had a record turnout possibly because we banned so many of the songs.

21
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,640
And we had the problematic drunks and mal-aligned normals and pink boys from previous years.

22
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,580
The Wisteria staff was great.

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,220
Their food was great.

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,020
They went out of their way to do us extra favors.

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,900
Especially the night we burned Bob to death.

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,600
And the campground is very near the incredibly cool college town of Athens.

27
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,020
Ohio, not Georgia or Greece.

28
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:29,460
Anyway, you can read all about it on subgenius.com and you'll be hearing some intense stuff from it on upcoming hours of Slack.

29
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:37,240
But for this one, well, like I say, I'm still trying to get some whole band sets cut up song by song.

30
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,860
And to censor the secrets from some otherwise humorous and inspiring location recordings.

31
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,860
Like the Bobtism.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,000
So this episode, like last week's, might mostly be the first link to the Bobtism.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,620
But this live hour of Slack we recorded on the first day on Wisteria Cafe's main stage with special guests Papa Joe Mama, Dr. Howell, Priestess Pisces.

34
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,460
Heard in the background.

35
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,100
The second hour of that first hour, actually, one could say.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,280
The deadline is tonight.

37
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,560
So I'm in a hurry and I won't really know what this show's going to be until I hit the 59 minute mark.

38
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,980
If somebody refers to a band, I might cut to them.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,100
I'll have to see.

40
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,100
There'll probably be a lot more music in future shows once I get this mess slightly more under control.

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,920
I haven't even had time to set up my home studio.

42
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,820
Which is why I'm recording this intro on my mini recorder while pacing around the office.

43
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,640
With music recorded the very first night by an impromptu band.

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,940
I think what we're hearing is...

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,620
Reverend Hazel of the Windmills on sitar.

46
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,820
Probably Reverend Suds on guitar.

47
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,660
And Princess Wee and Priestess Pisces chanting.

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,640
And possibly the sound of my air conditioner.

49
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,220
Praise that wonderful machine.

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,880
And now, whatever comes next.

51
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,120
Music

52
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,020
In fact, every time you see one of those Dobbs heads, it sees you back.

53
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,460
There may be a soul trapped inside every Dobbs head.

54
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,220
You know that theory, Ivan?

55
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,500
That Dobbs heads sometimes contain trapped souls who mocked and scoffed.

56
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,880
And then they took another look at the head and before they knew it, in fact they never knew it,

57
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,540
their actual soul from thenceforth was in that Dobbs head.

58
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
Actually, some people have Dobbs head trapped within them.

59
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,500
Sort of like the Phantom Zone.

60
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,180
No, actually, Pisces is speaking literally.

61
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,380
Her optometrist found a spot...

62
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,620
On my retina.

63
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,220
On the retina in the shape of a Dobbs head silhouette.

64
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,960
Well, that just comes from looking at the damn face too long.

65
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,200
Hell, I've got that.

66
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,860
In Pisces' vision, there is literally a tiny blank space.

67
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,060
A small spot in the shape of a Dobbs head.

68
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,160
But this is an honor.

69
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,080
That she doesn't see all the time.

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,820
Not consciously, but part of her mind always sees it.

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,600
If she looks at the light...

72
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Part of your mind always sees it, though.

73
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,900
You can't always have it out there consciously.

74
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,340
No.

75
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,240
But you're seeing.

76
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,840
You know, a lot of what we see, what we think, what we plan, everything is not done on the conscious level.

77
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,860
Your so-called consciousness is just a traffic cop directing your brain.

78
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,580
Your brain's doing a lot.

79
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,700
And you're doing a lot of things that you don't even know about.

80
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,340
Well, you may have Bob's image embedded on your retina.

81
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,280
You can certainly develop Bob's image embedded on your retina if you look and stare at Bob's image enough.

82
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,960
The question isn't so much, is it true that if you stare at the sun and then close your eyes, do you see Bob's image?

83
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,720
I mean, that is a high plane to shoot towards.

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,800
But the real plane that you want to reach towards is being able to close your eyes at night, open them,

85
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,840
and then project Bob's image into the sky.

86
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
That is where we are all going towards.

87
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,700
Like the bat signal.

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,760
Well, that, of course, represents the most advanced level that we wouldn't expect everyone else to be able to do.

89
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,740
And it's eerie.

90
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,060
I wish he wouldn't do it, especially while he's driving.

91
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,420
That is what really bugs me.

92
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,200
Does it work like headlights at all?

93
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,820
It's worse than shining your brights at somebody who's coming.

94
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,240
But he doesn't care.

95
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,940
And he doesn't care who's riding with him.

96
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,040
You have to be careful, though.

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,760
I mean, if you get to the nth degree, you have to shut one eye.

98
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,780
Because if you do both eyes, then you have dueling Bobs.

99
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,140
Yes, two Bobs is a terrible concept.

100
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,080
A Bob and an Abomination.

101
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,380
There's only one Bob.

102
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,840
Any other thing that pretends to be Bob you want to shun like the plague.

103
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,180
Because it is the plague.

104
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,520
Here's something else.

105
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,460
Lots of people, maybe well-meaning, try to friend me on Facebook.

106
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,780
And they say their name is J.R. Bob Dob.

107
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,220
I will not truck with them.

108
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,360
I will not either.

109
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,740
And you're not going to be able to do that.

110
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,120
But you know what?

111
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,600
Each one of them do not put the sacred quotes around the name Bob.

112
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,420
They write out J.R. Bob Dob like it was any ordinary Pobucker name.

113
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,900
And those quotes are so essential.

114
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,520
In some cases, they might actually be Pobuckers named Robert Dob.

115
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,340
They might, but that's no excuse.

116
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Now, on the other hand, anybody who's named Bob who asks you to do something, you ought to examine that request.

117
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,540
There might be something in it for you.

118
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,500
That's important.

119
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,340
The name Bob is significant.

120
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,540
And the name Bob appears more than you think it does and is entangled in more things than you think it is.

121
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,180
But, of course, you have to use your own judgment because you are a better judge since you are a subgenius.

122
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,340
And don't be fooled that just because it has the word Bob in it that you're going to trust in it.

123
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,160
Remember, even the name Beelzebub has Bob in it.

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,900
No, that's Beelzebub, Bob.

125
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,520
Your Bob has got Bob in it.

126
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,140
My Bob has got Bob in it.

127
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,820
There's a child of Bob that we don't talk about much.

128
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,940
There is a horrible child of Bob known as Bob.

129
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,940
But, you know, that's really, that's high.

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,220
It's an abomination.

131
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,460
A simple rule of thumb is Bob himself said, if you meet me on the highway, kill me.

132
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:28,720
The reason he said that is because if that person claiming to be Bob Dobbs dies, then you know you've just killed another pretender.

133
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,980
Well, many people out of those prophets.

134
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,760
We have to kill Bob. He cannot die.

135
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,840
We tried. Believe me.

136
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,840
He can't be killed.

137
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,560
We have visual proof.

138
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,020
The undying monster.

139
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,580
Many times.

140
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,140
Many, many times.

141
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,560
We tried to kill him.

142
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,660
We thought he was dead.

143
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,620
We even saw the pipe broken at one point.

144
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,100
But it all grew back.

145
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,640
He bounces back like a Warner Brothers cartoon character.

146
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,840
I held it in my hands, the broken pipe.

147
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,300
There's like a ritual now.

148
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,500
It's part of your development.

149
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,020
Your, I don't want to say spiritual development, but it's one of the stages that you go through.

150
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,720
At first you love Bob and you praise Bob.

151
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,560
Praise Bob.

152
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,880
But there is a point in your life, brothers and sisters.

153
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,780
Where you have to take the next step.

154
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,160
To truly understand and love Bob, you have to kill Bob.

155
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,020
Yes, you have to kick against the traces.

156
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:27,760
This may be actually represented to you in this confusing veil of illusion that we call life as killing Bob.

157
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,680
But if you can successfully surmount this step, then your infancy is over.

158
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,660
Your skin will split from stem to stern.

159
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,260
And this Chrysalis stage being discarded, the new glistening you will emerge.

160
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,400
Better than ever before.

161
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,880
And better before Bob.

162
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,680
To serve Bob is to kill Bob.

163
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,160
And to kill Bob is to love Bob.

164
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,800
And to kill Bob is to serve Bob.

165
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,000
Serving the self is to serve and kill yourself for Bob.

166
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,500
Serving suggestion.

167
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,140
Serves eight billion.

168
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,460
If you meet Bob on the road, kill him.

169
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,240
Meow meow.

170
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,320
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.

171
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,280
Meow.

172
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,520
Meow.

173
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:35,840
Meow.

174
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,680
Meow.

175
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:57,680
Hey me principalmente

176
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,560
Bob's is now in town.

177
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,980
Bob is here to help us right now.

178
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,000
Right meow?

179
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,660
Right now.

180
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,860
Right meow?

181
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,540
Right now.

182
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,980
Right now.

183
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,660
Meow.

184
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:44,880
So I don't know, we're continuing to do this radio broadcast here, but this should not all be one way coming from us to you.

185
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:55,560
So if anyone has a topic that he would like to see introduced, or if anyone has a question that she would like to ask, now is the time.

186
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,020
Meow mix?

187
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,220
Meow mix.

188
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,900
Later.

189
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,900
Meow meow.

190
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,260
It's not a dance thing.

191
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,540
It's actually an optical effect.

192
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,340
The answer to meow mix is not meow.

193
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:12,800
Women and cats don't actually do that.

194
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,180
No.

195
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,380
All you have to do is make it up.

196
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,300
As you go along.

197
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,720
Everybody's welcome.

198
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,620
There's no set words

199
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,640
or rules

200
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,280
to this song.

201
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,820
Come on.

202
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,400
Somebody set something up.

203
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,140
You want to sing it out?

204
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,320
Make it up the scale a lot.

205
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,960
Okay, guys.

206
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,920
Try to get it right.

207
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,400
Everybody knows this one.

208
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,340
No, no, no, no.

209
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,620
No, no, no, no.

210
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,840
No, no, no, no.

211
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,340
Well, cats do represent a strange animal in the Gobsian animal kingdom.

212
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,300
Well, of course, the cat is sacred in ancient Egypt, and the cat is off on its own trip.

213
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,840
So cats are well-known fellow travelers.

214
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,080
Cats have a lot of slack.

215
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,880
They don't have to travel in packs like dogs and humans.

216
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,160
And with cats, the pecking order is limited to whoever is around.

217
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,120
And there's no high calculation which must be made as to who is the alpha creature.

218
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,320
And yet even the mighty lion down to the smallest tabby,

219
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,820
they all ex-grove meditate in the same manner and hide their feces in sand.

220
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:25,800
Some they hide, some they boldly spray so that others know that the king of beasts is in the area.

221
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,140
Some say the sand drawings of the monks in Tibet actually evolved from patterns placed pawpats

222
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,140
and sacred kitty litter boxes.

223
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,260
Well, those monks know a good idea when they see it, and they take it up.

224
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,620
Surely we honor the big cats as well.

225
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,380
The giant lion with iron claw and paw and huge ruthless tooth in gory jaw.

226
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,260
The pard, dark-starred fleet upon feet that oft soft from aloft leaps on his meat

227
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,960
where woods loom in gloom, fierce and free.

228
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,980
Though tamed is he, the fat cat.

229
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,080
On the mat, kept as a pet, does not forget.

230
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,240
Lay us down a funk bit, and cat feather and myself and pockets, if she's around,

231
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,860
we'll do more meow songs per request.

232
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,300
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

233
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,300
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow

234
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,560
Meow.

235
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,420
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow

236
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,440
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

237
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,560
Meow, meow.

238
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,260
Meow, meow, meow, meow

239
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:58,900
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow

240
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,240
You know, I think that the cat may be teaching us a very valuable lesson as subgeniuses on how to deal with a conspiracy.

241
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,180
For think just a moment.

242
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,820
Think just a moment.

243
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,020
If you notice, cats are really good with mind control.

244
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,500
For example, I know some of you out there have this problem.

245
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,740
A cat will walk in front of you.

246
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,760
Not too far, not too close.

247
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,060
You make eye contact and you say, kitty.

248
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,440
And then that cat is making connection to your brain and you go, kitty, kitty, kitty.

249
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,380
Here, kitty, kitty.

250
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,860
And then if they work it just right, they will climb in your lap and they will purr.

251
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,300
And then you will get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to get the can out of the cabinet to feed kitty wet food.

252
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,980
You can't let them train you.

253
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,040
If you do that, they'll never, ever let you sleep again from 6 o'clock in the morning.

254
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,800
The point I'm making, Hal, is this is a lesson for subgeniuses to learn.

255
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You need to learn how to get the conspiracy to get you the canned food out of the cabinet at 6 in the morning.

256
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,520
You train the conspiracy to get your can.

257
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,120
And also because you lack the opposable thumb that the conspiracy has,

258
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:26,020
you train the conspiracy to open the can and even to serve it out in your commodious plastic dish.

259
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,720
And if the conspiracy will not clean out your litter box,

260
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,420
do not hesitate to crap in the conspiracy's shoes.

261
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,140
And to spray it a memento message.

262
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,880
The conspiracy sure had my can for a long time.

263
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,080
But the most important rule is to make sure that you do not emulate the cat

264
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,440
that gets itself castrated by the conspiracy.

265
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,220
And declawed, primped and patted and puffed as if it was a huge wad of dough,

266
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:00,020
staring out with two little greed-smeared eyes from the ruin of what was once...

267
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,120
an alpha predator.

268
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,720
Those windows to the soul they will essentially pluck out and replace with green marbles

269
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,760
when they freeze dry your remains and place you on the shelf.

270
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,000
You're not gonna let them dumb-asticate you now, are ya?

271
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,580
You wanna be like that tomcat struttin' with them hangin' and your tail high

272
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:27,820
and yowling your barbaric yawp at the top of the fence, just like in all those Warner Brothers cartoons.

273
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:28,440
Meow!

274
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,780
Because...

275
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,020
Meow!

276
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,820
Because, uh, they are filling a vacuum which nature abhors.

277
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:41,060
These sounds are necessary for the somnolent, snoozing conspiracy Elmer Fudd's to hear.

278
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,160
Meow!

279
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,280
Meow!

280
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,720
Meow!

281
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,260
Meow!

282
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,460
Meow!

283
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,880
Meow!

284
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,980
Meow!

285
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,080
Meow!

286
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,720
Meow!

287
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,220
Meow!

288
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:55,620
Meow!

289
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,240
Meow!

290
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,520
Meow!

291
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,120
Meow!

292
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,640
Meow!

293
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:57,700
Meow!

294
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:57,840
Meow!

295
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,320
Meow!

296
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,320


297
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,300
Meow!

298
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,500
Meow!

299
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,880
Meow!

300
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,000
Meow!

301
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,640
Meow!

302
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,800
Meow!

303
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,460
Meow!

304
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,940
Meow!

305
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,880
Meow!

306
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:10,880


307
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:10,880


308
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:10,880


309
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:10,880


310
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,500
Small to Jizz.

311
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,200
Meow, meow.

312
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,340
Meow, meow.

313
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,680
Meow, meow!

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,780
Meow!

315
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:23,780


316
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:23,780


317
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,880
Meow, meow!

318
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,240
Meow!

319
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:43,340
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,

320
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,280
I gotta tell you, I think this is the dumbest fucking shit we've ever done and it's awesome.

321
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,620
It's the fucking greatest, best, best, best ever!

322
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:01,560
Another fun trick is to place two white stripes down your back, like Mr. Le Plus.

323
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:09,660
That would be the pole cat, not a true cat, but we had evidence of those in the campground the other night.

324
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:18,080
They knew the subgeniuses were here and so they emitted a fragrant cloud to remind us in turn of their presence.

325
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,500
Also, the kitty cat can see in the dark because he has a tapet.

326
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,780
A membrane at the back of the eye. He can see more than you can.

327
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:36,400
They say that now that the skunks, the pole cats, are becoming the number one preferred pet of choice in the conspiracy.

328
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:45,000
But they will take away the scent glands that you can't put out that essential essence, the perfume of a true skunk.

329
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,260
Oh yes, they take away the true essence of everything because if it has an individuality or essence,

330
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,520
it collides with the conspiracy and its purposes.

331
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,520
So they'll turn a work of divine art into a Thomas Kinkade painting.

332
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Do you think the smell of a skunk is repulsive to another skunk?

333
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,300
No!

334
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,420
Actually, it smells like a certain herb that we all use from time to time.

335
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:19,140
It's not a bad smell, you just don't want to get in close range because then it's acid and it burns into your skin.

336
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,780
It can blind you because...

337
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,140
That would be a case of too much.

338
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,620
And too much is always better than not enough.

339
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:36,040
Except there is the coda which was left out, which Reverend Stone included earlier.

340
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:45,800
Anyway, it's only idiots who are so unreserved as to stick their faces into a skunk's butt.

341
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,460
Yes.

342
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,280
Okay.

343
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,240
Well, weren't the idiotes that...

344
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,960
The ones who couldn't vote in ancient Athens and Sparta.

345
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:03,320
But they have no ability to determine our future and their own future is sadly set.

346
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,300
Even though now we are in modern Athens.

347
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:14,160
This music in the background is from the moment when the time traveler returns back to the past from the future.

348
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,380
The future where he has found that thanks to class division,

349
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,980
the world has been divided.

350
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,900
And the world has been divided into these sickly, wimpy, little...

351
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,020
Feline.

352
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,920
Humans who look more like children.

353
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,860
Pleasure lovers.

354
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:37,220
And these hulking, beastly looking, carnivorous, but technically advanced creatures, the Morlocks,

355
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,720
who would appear to the sheepish Eloi as monsters.

356
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,800
As we all know, we, the subgeniuses, are those Morlocks.

357
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,520
Yes.

358
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,920
We are the ones who are driven underground, certainly.

359
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:02,640
The pinks, meanwhile, get to the point where they're so used to being served everything by robots,

360
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,200
created by we Morlocks,

361
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:12,200
that they dwindle down to helpless, just cattle, basically, sheep.

362
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,780
Really, really sheep.

363
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,620
Oh, by the way...

364
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,200
Livestock.

365
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,500
Some of you may have heard the term, you know, sheep.

366
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:20,500


367
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:20,500


368
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:26,320
And sheeple used a lot, especially by a certain type of person.

369
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,740
Bishop Joey, for example.

370
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:35,880
The way I look at it is the sheeple are the people who use the word, who call everybody

371
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,860
else, the sheeple.

372
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,700
Could be, could be.

373
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,320
A word can contaminate you and you don't even know it.

374
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,820
Well, I mean, think about the ones who use that term all the time.

375
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,680
You stupid sheeple.

376
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,480
You're just like sheep.

377
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:50,620
You're just like sheep.

378
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:50,620


379
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:50,620


380
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:50,620


381
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,980
Because sheeple are the people who are usually led around by the main, the lamestream media.

382
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:00,440
And you don't understand that 2012, the Rockefellers are...

383
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,600
These are the people who have those simple, well, actually, those complex.

384
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,260
To them it's these complex secret conspiracies that only they know about, and all the, everybody

385
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,400
else is too blinded and idiotic to understand.

386
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,940
The impulse to be awake.

387
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,360
But what they don't know...

388
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,920
What those people don't understand is how simple the real conspiracy is.

389
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:33,140
The real conspiracy is the part that makes you divide the world up into us and them.

390
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,100
It forces that division.

391
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,960
That is the real conspiracy.

392
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,600
It's the thing that makes you think that it's all so simple and so black and white

393
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,320
that you can look at somebody and go,

394
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,120
oh, well, he doesn't have any tattoos, so he's pink or old.

395
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,740
Or that person doesn't have a Dobbshead t-shirt on, so he's not a true subgenius.

396
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,260
It may be exactly the opposite.

397
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,440
The true subgenius knows that, I may have said this before,

398
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,620
only Bob can judge a book by its cover.

399
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,260
A true conspiracy.

400
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,800
Playboy magazine, actually, is more common than what he's judging.

401
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,140
It's...

402
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,100
We'll get...

403
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,400
We'll get these people who come up to us and say,

404
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,620
yeah, Reverend Sang, I really understand what you're saying.

405
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,420
Well, those are the ones that I know are either lying or deluding themselves.

406
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:37,180
I know that for a fact because I, myself, don't really understand what I'm saying.

407
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,240
I'm merely doing what Bob told me to do, and I don't question that.

408
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,040
I don't have to understand it.

409
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,960
Bob said it, and that's all.

410
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,720
There is to it.

411
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,740
It doesn't have to make sense according to our little tiny world.

412
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,100
That's what faith is all about.

413
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,980
Any religious nut will tell you that about their God.

414
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,000
Bob sold it.

415
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,420
I bought it.

416
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,160
That settled it.

417
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,540
We happen to be right.

418
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:04,160
The moment you start to understand what the religion is about is no longer a faith.

419
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,120
You need to just believe in it.

420
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,100
If you could only speak what was possible to understand, there would be no need to articulate it at all.

421
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,100
Just as a conspiracy, if we could really label it and put it in...

422
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,100


423
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,820
In a simple little box, it wouldn't be a conspiracy anymore.

424
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,060
A real conspiracy is like physics.

425
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,800
It's universal.

426
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,780
It's not in the United States.

427
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,280
It's not the Rockefellers.

428
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,080
It's not the Jews.

429
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,620
It's an entire world conspiracy.

430
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,220
It doesn't exist from just the, oh, when Abraham Lincoln was shot, or it didn't start...

431
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,840
Well, then everyone knows that was a conspiracy.

432
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:43,140
Well, that was part of the conspiracy, but the real conspiracy started way on back to the inception of man.

433
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,100
It lasts forever.

434
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,080
It will last.

435
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:55,120
It will always be there, but it's up to us to put the boundaries that will limit it and place it in those reservations so that we will always remember it in the future.

436
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,880
We don't want to completely eliminate it.

437
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,100
We just want to eliminate its impact on our lives.

438
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,840
Back to those concentration camps.

439
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,080
Well, I know you want to be in charge of those, and I certainly wouldn't get in your way.

440
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,240
I want to be the Captain Wurtz of the concentration camp dedicated to conspiracies.

441
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,920
Now he's talking about some sad...

442
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:18,900
I'm not.

443
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,700
I'm not.

444
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


445
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


446
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


447
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


448
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


449
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


450
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


451
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


452
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


453
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


454
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


455
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


456
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


457
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


458
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,140
Yes, we take all these burdens on ourselves, but a lot of the time we weren't even there, and it's not really our fault.

459
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,080
We're just trying to hash this out.

460
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,780
Back to the Morlocks for a moment.

461
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,480
People shudder because they're such spooky monsters.

462
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,080
Monsters, schmonsters, they are the human race.

463
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,160
They are our descendants.

464
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,040
And also, they looked so fat in that movie, but that's because they only had fat guys in the monster suits.

465
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,820
Let's remember that in the novel,

466
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,200
they were scrawny and monkey-like.

467
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,660
More like the technicians of today tend to be.

468
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,180
And it's all relative, too.

469
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,940
I mean, remember what the Eloi were like.

470
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,300
The beautiful people, but they were puny little people.

471
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,480
They were degenerate.

472
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,600
They were in a state of decay.

473
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,320
And why?

474
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,760
Because if you get what you want, then you have no reason for living.

475
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,160
By the way, when we talk about the time machine, which is a subgenius Bible,

476
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
we're not...

477
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,340
talking about the Paul Wells movie of 2002.

478
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Certainly not.

479
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:34,780
That was a conspiracy pink job in which the whole reason the human race splits up is because of an industrial accident on the moon and the...

480
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,900
more...

481
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,380
Oh, it's just sickening.

482
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,360
Boy, did that one bite the green weenie.

483
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,160
Only the George Powell 1960s time machine is considered...

484
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,760
It's better.

485
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,060
Somebody still has to make it.

486
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,840
I think the definitive version...

487
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,620
And the original book, of course, by H.G. Wells.

488
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,480
I think Hal was pointing out the other day that if we have a saint, H.G. Wells would certainly be one of them.

489
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,560
You know, there is a chapter that's left out of many of the copies of the book.

490
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:09,340
In fact, most of them, where the time traveler goes from the time of the Morlocks and Eloi

491
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,260
and stops before he gets to the final beach.

492
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,780
And he finds even more degenerate remnants of humanity.

493
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,720
Which are now like rabbits hopping around.

494
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,720
And he brains one and thinks he might kill it.

495
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,660
But unfortunately he can't make that decision because a giant centipede is headed his way.

496
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,540
And he has to get back in the time machine.

497
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,580
Did you read that part?

498
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,020
Was it a human centipede?

499
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,320
No, it's a giant centipede 30 feet long.

500
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,960
Which is coming at him slowly but steadily.

501
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,700
And it interferes with his ability to make the examination.

502
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,060
Is that the one where he feels a tickle on the side?

503
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,060
No, that's in the...

504
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,640
The giant crab.

505
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,040
That's the giant crab's...

506
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,180
The giant crab's feeler many thousands of centuries later.

507
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,800
I missed that in between...

508
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,920
It's not in every copy but it's a good one because it shows that even...

509
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,460
That it's possible to degenerate even more than the Eloi and to become this brainless

510
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,820
hopping thing whose remote ancestor was a human being.

511
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:11,840
Another really, really great book that I would recommend to everyone and it's free on the

512
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,280
internet is the book Evolution by Stephen Baxter.

513
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,040
Oh.

514
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,460
Excellent.

515
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,180
Normally a science fiction writer and in a way it is science fiction but it covers the

516
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:31,240
history of mammals from the ancestors of a particular woman alive today to their very

517
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,760
Into the far future.

518
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,140
Living descent.

519
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,360
Into the last gasps of our tortured planet.

520
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,380
At which point we're just parasites of a tree.

521
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,640
Living in this huge boujum tree.

522
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,020
You know, one of my favorite Shakespearean quotes is, me thinks out there.

523
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,240
I'm reminded of that when I see movies like the remake of the Time Machine.

524
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,260
It wasn't enough for them to remake it and to destroy its true essence.

525
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,620
They had to get a relative of H.G. Wells to do it.

526
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,360
To really undercut his essential genius in that first novel.

527
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,960
And whenever the conspiracy tries to take something and run it into the ground, they

528
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,500
always try to co-op something.

529
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,080
Right.

530
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:24,260
They will take it and they will try to over expose it and they'll try to make it just

531
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,500
less palatable.

532
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,920
That's the best way that they destroy something.

533
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,720
And that should be for us the essential signal that there really is something to the original.

534
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,680
Otherwise why would they pump the millions of dollars to remake that movie?

535
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,740
Why would they hire H.G.

536
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,980
Why would they bribe H.G. Wells?

537
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,960
Because the conspiracy in its vampire brain thought there were still some Jews.

538
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,080
They wanted to get the Jews to be sucked out of this piece of art.

539
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,420
And they also wanted to undermine the central premise.

540
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,180
And what better way to do it?

541
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,620
Well this is another H.G. Wells relative.

542
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,520
This is what the movie was really about.

543
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,960
This is what H.G. Wells himself would have done if he just had CGI.

544
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,160
That's what they would have you believe, dear friend.

545
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,340
He had something better than that which is the legitimacy of invention.

546
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,260
The human imagination.

547
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:16,180
You know all the ideas in science fiction, every single one of them, come from H.G. Wells'

548
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,340
seven novels.

549
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:27,060
Space travel, time travel, movement at great speed, little things becoming giant, invisibility.

550
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,040
That bastard covered everything.

551
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,780
Well he exploited those possibilities.

552
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,220
And he wrote with a major prose style.

553
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,200
He left Bob and slack for us.

554
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,520
In the days of the comet, Bob has some appearance.

555
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,580
And also the novels.

556
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,160
The novels.

557
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,240
The novels of the far future.

558
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:54,800
He predicted atomic warfare and atomic bombs pretty good for 1890 in his novel The World

559
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,460
Set Free.

560
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,760
He explained how the chain reaction would take place.

561
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,040
He invented the internet and called it the world brain in the 30s.

562
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,400
He was definitely a far-seeing proto-subgenius.

563
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,720
And yet he had one essential mistake and that is that he thought that he could change the

564
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,440
system by joining the system.

565
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,640
He himself ran as a socialist candidate and thought that he would bring in a new innovation

566
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,160
into the world, a new world order if you will.

567
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,540
Well of course it failed just as L. Ron Hubbard thought he could create his own religion and

568
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,600
that it would somehow be better than the other religions.

569
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,640
No, they all become corrupt because he didn't have Bob.

570
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,120
And without Bob there is no hope.

571
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,280
That's why we are here.

572
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,020
Wells himself was exhausted at the end of his career when he wrote Mind at the End of

573
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,540
Its Tether.

574
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,420
When he saw we were gearing up for yet another era.

575
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:44,420


576
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,920
Another war and ignoring all of his recommendations.

577
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,820
Well his problem was though he got preachy.

578
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,460
He got old and cranky and preachy and he forgot that you got to entertain him first.

579
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:57,480
Exactly.

580
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,840
And kind of slide your message.

581
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,940
Entertain him first.

582
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,280
Make it fun.

583
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,560
Use the entertainment or the comedy as a roofie so to speak.

584
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,160
Exactly.

585
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,280
Your date rate drug.

586
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,400
To seduce the user into compliance.

587
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,740
To seduce the user into compliance.

588
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,040
That's when you slip in the real.

589
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,960
Message.

590
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,320
A dollop of seditious.

591
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,740
A dollop of philosophical thought.

592
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:25,900
The best way to deliver the poison is to outnumber it to let's say 98% real corn and only 2%

593
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,500
arsenic.

594
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,080
Get it in there.

595
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,980
Get it down in the gut.

596
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,840
Get him to eat plenty of it.

597
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,760
And then let it spread from there.

598
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,320
Ah yes, Dr. Kirsteiner's Cracker Barrel Home Remedies.

599
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,600
I have my copy.

600
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,700
Well, the good news is is that there's so much of that.

601
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,940
Religious poison out there that we're actually antidote to it.

602
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,320
They just don't realize it yet.

603
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,680
Just give me fra.

604
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,260
Just give me fra.

605
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:53,700
Money.

606
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,740
Put it so I can pay up.

607
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:56,740


608
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:56,740


609
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,600
Here we go.

610
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:10,560
Here we go.

611
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,040
Here we go.

612
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,240
Here we go.

613
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,760
Here we go.

614
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,960
Here we go.

615
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,920
Here we go.

616
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,820
Here we go.

617
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,600
Here we go.

618
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,000
Here we go.

619
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,320
Here we go.

620
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,600
Here we go.

621
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,740
Here we go.

622
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


623
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


624
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


625
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


626
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


627
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,740


628
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:42,860
Here we go.

629
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,040
budget I mean bargen for my cuál moderated package that I now not shotgun.

630
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,040


631
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,340
that, but this guy has a great schedule.

632
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,000
Who were you.

633
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,740
Who are all the presents from your animals.

634
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:48,740


635
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,120
Thank you.

636
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,700
Thank you.

637
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,160
Thank you.

638
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,620
Thank you.

639
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,920
Thank you.

640
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,720
Thank you.

641
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,320
Thank you.

642
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,400
Thank you.

643
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,960
Thank you.

644
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,180
Thank you.

645
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,240
Thank you.

646
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,140
Thank you.

647
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,900
Thank you.

648
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,480
Thank you.

649
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Thank you.

650
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,680
Thank you.

651
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:50,640
Thank you.

652
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,440
Thank you.

653
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,920
Thank you.

654
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,580
Thank you.

655
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,820
Thank you.

656
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,220
Thank you.

657
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,960
Thank you.

658
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:25,560
Thank you.

659
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,880
Thank you.

660
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,580
We're getting ready now to hear a message

661
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,980
if you've never heard one before.

662
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,260
None other than the one and only

663
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,740
elder and fine brother

664
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,060
in the Lord,

665
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,580
Marsha Taylor.

666
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,560
We thank you, brothers and sisters

667
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,960
and friends all over

668
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,540
this country. And we're going

669
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,940
to

670
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,460
bring a message, hopefully,

671
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,400
that'll help thousands

672
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,620
of people all over the country.

673
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,880
All over the world.

674
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,720
Replace the word devil with

675
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,580
pigs. Devil with

676
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,520
pigs. Replace.

677
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,520
Keep your composure.

678
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,680
Maintain your

679
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,860
tranquility and your equanimity.

680
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,140
But don't

681
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:41,940
let the devil

682
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,740
mess up your mind.

683
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,900
Remember to keep Google and

684
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,700
whatever you may be

685
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:07,840
Kate.

686
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,220
I hope you find

687
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:10,220


688
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:10,220


689
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:10,800
If you put prayer into your

690
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,180
heart,

691
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,560
it's no longer new.

692
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,360
Now there's a

693
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,820
time now

694
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,740
for yer

695
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:25,860
And while I was on that crowd, I felt like I had a pocket full of money and my baby was still in mine.

696
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:36,160
But when I came back down to earth, and that whiskey left me, that wine, that dope left me,

697
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,920
my pocketbooks were still on me, and my baby was still gone.

698
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,360
Don't let the devil mess up your mind.

699
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,660
We're living in a world where people seem to be going crazy.

700
00:50:54,140 --> 00:51:02,900
But if he can get control of your mind, he can cause you to do strange and ungodly things.

701
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,480
Don't let the devil blow your mind.

702
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:20,960
He's always putting stuff in your mind and getting your mind confused.

703
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:28,340
He'll make you think you're gonna die, make you think you're sick when you're not sick.

704
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:34,340
He'll put some kind of evil force in your mind about your neighbor.

705
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,400
He'll make you think people are talking about you.

706
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,660
I'll say that nobody loves you when they love you all the time.

707
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,420
But that is the devil's job.

708
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:52,560
Come around and say, but when I can't find a home, I'll catch a cab.

709
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,340
If I can't catch a cab, I'll catch a bus.

710
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,940
If I can't catch a bus, I'll go on heels.

711
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,080
I'll go on heels until God bless me to ride on wheels.

712
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,040
Let me say, yeah.

713
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,100
Can I quit?

714
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:10,520
No.

715
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:11,900
Can I quit?

716
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,900
I have been on the road.

717
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,020
Thank you very much.

718
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,600
Whenever something evil comes to you in your mind,

719
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,620
whenever a lie pops up in your mind,

720
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,960
think of things that are honest,

721
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,600
think of things that are lovely,

722
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,300
and things of a good report.

723
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,940
But you've got to have the power.

724
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,700
But you've got to have the power.

725
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,660
Yeah.

726
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,300
And you have got the power.

727
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,060
Ah, yeah.

728
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,620
And you've got to have the power.

729
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:54,620


730
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:54,620


731
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:54,620


732
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:54,620


733
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,460
Don't let the devil

734
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,180
Ah, yeah.

735
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,400
glue your mind.

736
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:57,920
Yeah.

737
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,240
Don't let the devil

738
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,020
Ah, yeah.

739
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,140
glue your mind.

740
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,900
Ah, yeah.

741
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,120
Don't let the devil

742
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,720
Ah, yeah.

743
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,920
glue your mind.

744
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,800
Don't let the devil

745
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,360
Uh-uh.

746
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,840
glue your mind.

747
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:09,940
Ah, yeah.

748
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,260
Yeah.

749
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,240
Don't let the devil

750
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,240


751
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,240


752
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,260
épisode 3

753
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:11,340
Before theSiangular

754
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:11,880
in English

755
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:11,880


756
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:11,880


757
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,820
Thank you all very much.

758
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,740
This is the Evolution Control Committee.

759
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,260
Next, DJ 2 Bean.

760
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,300
Thank you all so much.

761
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,100
We have all rights reserved.

762
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,080
Album, CD, and LP.

763
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,860
Beautiful orange vinyl.

764
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,300
Poor sale.

765
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:43,240
Bob.

766
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,760
Well,

767
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,280
we have a

768
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,900
message from

769
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,140
this just in.

770
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,060
That's today?

771
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,920
I don't understand the message.

772
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,560
Can I see

773
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,080
have a minute with you on stage, sir?

774
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,560
Yes, we've got to have a little

775
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,720
conference time. A little

776
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,920
pal-ever here.

777
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,160
Once again, that's really what

778
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,520
subgeniusness is all about.

779
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,360
Is getting the message, but not necessarily

780
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,460
understanding it.

781
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,780
Or apprehending it in the correct time

782
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,580
as these things go.

783
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,020
And you don't have to understand the message

784
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,080
that you pass on to the

785
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,420
other, potentially future subgenius.

786
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,360
You just need to repeat the message.

787
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,280
Make yourself a part of its

788
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:32,860
transmission.

789
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:36,180
You may understand that message better later on

790
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,480
yourself.

791
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,120
It's a maturity thing.

792
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:39,900
Not everything.

793
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,300
Everything is immediately apprehended.

794
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,480
It takes time for some things to set in.

795
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,900
Including significant things

796
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,140
in your own life.

797
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,760
You might think you've absorbed

798
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,820
learning about something

799
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,620
at the moment you do, but no.

800
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,840
It's going to take you the rest of your life

801
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,860
to find out how you really

802
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,640
feel about it. Or maybe just

803
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,880
before the end of your life that you really understand

804
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,500
it. Or in the worst case scenario,

805
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,780
it will be the moment you've passed from

806
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,180
life. It will all become abundantly

807
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,900
and painfully clear.

808
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,680
Knowledge comes, but

809
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,540
wisdom lingers. Anyway,

810
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,820
we are privileged to know that our so-called

811
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,660
lives will end in a few days

812
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,680
and then, at that moment, we

813
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,000
will be prepared for our blissful

814
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,660
spurt into eternity.

815
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,480
We will be liberated from life.

816
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,040
Finally.

817
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,940
The squirting universe.

818
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,800
Yes, that's right.

819
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,540
With great

820
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,280
grace, Bob's

821
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,560
we have.

822
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,680
The sex

823
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,800
goddess

824
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,380
is time

825
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,980
As we watch

826
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,680
the beings burn

827
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,200
As their

828
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,840
corpses are

829
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,000
seen

830
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:39,920


831
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,160
And dots that were still there

832
00:56:50,020 --> 00:57:02,900
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

833
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,780
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave

834
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:14,840
To be free of all the fears

835
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:25,720
And to have slain every day

836
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,160
For the record, I haven't seen the National Anthem since I was like seven.

837
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,760
Amen.

838
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,760
Amen.

839
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,820
Praise Bob.

840
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,680
No, Adam's apple, so I can't really do it.

841
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:02,280
Okay, friends, by studying the photographs,

842
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:02,880
I've learned that the National Anthem is a very important piece of history.

843
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,740
I figured out that the musicians on all this improv stuff

844
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:09,460
done the very first night of X Day, Wednesday,

845
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,740
was Reverend Stick on bass, mainly,

846
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,580
Reverend Catfeather with Pisces on vocal,

847
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,500
Princess Wee on flute and vocal,

848
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,740
Harry Johnson on bass,

849
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,020
and Reverend Frodo Suds,

850
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,700
and Prince Shaw on guitar.

851
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:35,940
Praise Bob.

852
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:44,760
Post Office Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118subgenius.com

853
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,320
But you know, he can work his way up at the 7-Eleven.

854
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,920
Why do some do it forward

855
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,420
And some from the back

856
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,280
Why do some like it tight

857
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,900
And some like it else

858
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,740
Why do some do it forward

859
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,180
And some from the back

860
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,920
Why do some like it tight

861
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,040
And some from the back

862
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,060
Why do some do it forward

863
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,940
And some from the back

864
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,960
Why do some do it forward

865
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,960
and some from the back

866
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:09,960


867
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,040
And some like it —

868
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,960
Why do some do it forward

869
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,660
And some from the back

870
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,460
Why do some like it tight

871
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,920
And some like it Reely

872
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,700
Reely contact rock

873
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:18,700
