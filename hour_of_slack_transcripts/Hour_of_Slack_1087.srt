1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,040
Philosophers have a category of traditional sin, basic sin.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:19,160
Sin indeed presents us with an opportunity to more graphically, more vividly, more specifically, more distinctly sin in our culture, in our life, in our society, in the world.

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,620
But let me mention one other sin as well.

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,880
Well, it is, it is, it is, it is a sin.

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,860
It's the self-genius power of sin.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,320
We love butt burial indeed.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,280
If you are listening, please don't hesitate to call.

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,840
We would love to sin with you.

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,820
This will only take a moment.

10
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,980
What do you want to know?

11
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,780
Tell me when.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,520
Last night.

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,040
When?

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,880
It was late.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,020
That's when it was.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,940
Tell me.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,120
It was very dark.

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,100
I see.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,060
The dead girl.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,880
This one?

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,300
I don't want it anymore.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,320
I still don't.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,900
Did you dance?

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,500
Yes.

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:05,920
Yeah?

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,600
Why dance?

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,660
I was drunk.

28
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,100
And all I had was a hat full of dried leaves.

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,300
Staring at a headless dummy tasting the cigarettes.

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,200
She likes it when I do that, don't you?

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:17,940
Sure.

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,760
Sure, I like it.

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,020
Yes.

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,880
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.

35
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,160
You're right.

36
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,560
Scott.

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,760
Calling for oral 69.

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,220
Burger.

39
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:27,900
Frankfurter.

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,280
Burger.

41
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:28,980
Frankfurter.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,820
Even violence.

43
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,260
Probing.

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,120
May it please the opening of oral institution for the profoundly retarded.

45
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,020
The Supreme Court.

46
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,360
Permanent brain damage.

47
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,820
Pregnant women find doctors who would perform a 69.

48
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,520
Become pregnant in the future.

49
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,340
It didn't happen.

50
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,220
We didn't do it.

51
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,100
Somebody else did it.

52
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,900
You're not hurt as bad as you say you were.

53
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
And besides, we weren't there.

54
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,480
They would take it.

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,020
So what?

56
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,100
Prepare for oral.

57
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,200
Yay.

58
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,500
Number six.

59
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,080
Six.

60
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,600
Six.

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,440
Frankfurter.

62
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,740
Burger.

63
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,180
Coffee.

64
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,680
This is a, is the greatest mockery of justice.

65
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,280
Constitution.

66
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,140
Constitution.

67
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,220
Cut.

68
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,060
Cox argued for the federal government.

69
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,080
There is a clear violation of a constitutional right.

70
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,500
Cox suggested raising.

71
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,840
What does that mean then?

72
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,660
Got him here.

73
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,320
Got him here.

74
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,380
What are you going to do about it?

75
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,720
What does that mean?

76
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,040
It means that the appellants.

77
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,120
Well, what is that?

78
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,580
That's coercion.

79
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,120
Violate the federal constitution.

80
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,460
Democracy depends on equal voting rights.

81
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:21,740
Burger.

82
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,420
Frankfurter.

83
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:22,640
Burger.

84
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,160
Frankfurter.

85
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,280
Burger.

86
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,660
Frankfurter.

87
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:23,780
Burger.

88
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,040
Frankfurter.

89
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,080


90
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:24,620


91
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,040
Anyway, friends, praise the winter holidays, which have been lately renamed by our friend

92
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,900
Reverend Susie the floozy.

93
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,700
It's not Saturnalia anymore.

94
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,540
In honor of the late great Anna Nicole Smith, we now call it Slatternalia.

95
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,040
And I was actually real sorry to hear about the passing of Anna Nicole, my cousin, Anna

96
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,800
Nicole Smith.

97
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,420
It's a white female.

98
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,320
It's a white female.

99
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,000
One three.

100
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,440
Zero.

101
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,200
One three.

102
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,240
Repeating.

103
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,280
White female.

104
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:02,860
One three.

105
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,160
Zero.

106
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,800
One three.

107
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,240
White female.

108
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,920
Blah, blah.

109
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,880
Woof, woof.

110
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Ah, Connie.

111
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,960
Praise Connie, my friends.

112
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,520
Connie Dobbs, the wife of Bob Dobbs, our guru.

113
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:24,600
This episode of Hour of Slack number 1087 is loosely devoted to the fact that we are not

114
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:24,600


115
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,620
Connie Tite Matters.

116
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,220
Actually, I guess it's more addressed to the devotion to Connie

117
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,640
and Connie Tites by male subgeni.

118
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,220
Lemur's cut-ups and Norell Prefs helped usher in the subject matter.

119
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,520
But now, let's ask Dr. Howe

120
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,800
on the Puzzling Evidence Show with Dr. Philo Drummond.

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,980
Well, I hope you've been reading my series on Dr. Howe's horrible animal facts.

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,920
Yes, yes, yes.

123
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,480
Yeah, you have.

124
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,500
I've got a good one lined up next.

125
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,020
I've got these horrible worms with acid sperm.

126
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,580
They fertilize each other by squirting sperm on each other

127
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,900
that's actually acid that eats through their skin

128
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,360
because they don't have an aperture for sex.

129
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,180
So it has to eat through their skin.

130
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,640
An aperture that leads to the cloaca through which eggs are discharged.

131
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,940
But the sperm actually has to dissolve through their skin.

132
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,680
And I've got a horrible frog that looks like a turd

133
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,400
and gets up on its hind legs and screams like a woman in mortal agony.

134
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,540
That's at least as good as the poop-eating parrot or the jelly face.

135
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,880
That's better because it's like,

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,880
hey, we don't have an aperture, let's just throw acid at each other.

137
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,160
Well, certain octopuses...

138
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,720
Well, I've got a question for you, Dr. Howe.

139
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,540
The audience claims that you're a know-it-all

140
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,240
and you know what you're talking about.

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,740
Oh, they don't know what they're talking about.

142
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,760
Have you ever taken the alien knowledge test?

143
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,160
Who knows what they're talking about?

144
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,400
Have you ever taken it, Dr. Howe, the alien knowledge test?

145
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,920
Is that like the Jerry Lewis announcer's test?

146
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,440
No, it's an actual test that tests your knowledge

147
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,740
in terms of what's been reported over the years

148
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,160
of interesting and intriguing facts about extramarines.

149
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,840
Now, you can attest the testiness of this test.

150
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,040
Let's see how much you know about them.

151
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,160
Are you ready for me to ask you some of these questions, Dr. Howe?

152
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,640
Well, under these special circumstances,

153
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,940
I think I'd better answer all your questions about aliens

154
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,520
and other menaces to our civilization.

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,240
Now, you don't have to answer that.

156
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,000
This is an easy test because this test is a multiple-choice test.

157
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,560
I will give you the question...

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,000
That's a pretty good one.

159
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,480
It's just like Bug Girl said,

160
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,460
there's a plastic dinosaur right in the way,

161
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,180
but you got a better shot than she did.

162
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,160
I will give you the question.

163
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,380
I will give you the question,

164
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,120
and then I will give you the choice of answers.

165
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,780
Are you ready?

166
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,720
Well, you're all too kind.

167
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,160
Are you ready, Dr. Howe?

168
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,200
I am as ready as I possibly may be.

169
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,940
Over the centuries,

170
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,280
aliens have abducted many noted human writers.

171
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,960
Which of the following great artists was not abducted?

172
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,220
A. William Shakespeare,

173
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,800
B. Edgar Allan Poe,

174
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,800
C. Ernest Hemingway,

175
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,200
and D. Charles Dickens.

176
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,420
Which would you say was not abducted?

177
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,620
Well, that's a real head-scratcher, I gotta say.

178
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,380
A lot of the questions we get in our trade are melon-scratchers.

179
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,060
Yeah, he's right.

180
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,000
Emile Zola.

181
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,480
I guess I'm going to have to go for Paul Meunier.

182
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,300
Emile Zola.

183
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,380
I mean...

184
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,200
Did you mean Ernest Hemingway?

185
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,720
From another way.

186
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,420
It's like he can name almost anybody.

187
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,060
Was he ever...

188
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,880
No, he's...

189
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,680
He's the most likely to have been...

190
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,180
He's actually killed himself before the aliens got him,

191
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,480
and that is the correct answer to number one is C.

192
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,040
Ernest Hemingway.

193
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,080
I have not been on these sources.

194
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,140
Now, okay, well, let's move on to question two.

195
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,120
I think you'll find this one much, much easier.

196
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:07,500
Just a hand fuller in the book.

197
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,360
Well, we'll try it.

198
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,000
Which historical figure helped point out the home star of aliens

199
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,960
whose navigation system had failed?

200
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,900
If you complete...

201
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,220
A.

202
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,260
A.

203
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,560
A.

204
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,860
A.

205
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:18,860


206
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:18,860


207
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:18,860


208
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:18,860


209
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,440
Julius Caesar.

210
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,440
B.

211
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,800
A.

212
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,080
B.

213
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,820
Jesus Christ.

214
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,420
C.

215
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:22,420


216
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,400
In the five-tenured coat.

217
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,460
Albert Einstein.

218
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,380
Or D.

219
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,640
D.

220
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,100
D.

221
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,760
George Washington.

222
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,540
Now, think about it.

223
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,480
Which one would have pointed to the home star of aliens

224
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,540
whose navigation system had failed?

225
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,780
Think about it.

226
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,780
That would be the star series that the dog gone to Central Africa

227
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,360
have been claiming they intermarried with those sons of God.

228
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,240
and produce their current race.

229
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,780
But I'm just going to have to say...

230
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,640
What were those choices again?

231
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,960
Those choices were A, Julius Caesar, B, Jesus Christ.

232
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,920
I'll give it to Jesus this time.

233
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
You are correct, sir.

234
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
That is absolutely correct.

235
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,780
B is correct.

236
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,840
When he was first born, baby Jesus pointed out the star Betelgeuse.

237
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,160
The Lord Jesus.

238
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,480
Always give it to Jesus.

239
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,900
Yes, always choose Jesus.

240
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,380
That's the important thing.

241
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,900
When given a question and answer test,

242
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,680
where some of the answers involve Jesus,

243
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,540
always choose the Jesus answer.

244
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,440
That is the correct procedure there.

245
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,060
Number three.

246
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,500
We will move on through the test here with number three.

247
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,940
Aliens called trapezoids visited Earth to entertain humans.

248
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
What kind of entertainment was it?

249
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,880
A, approximately.

250
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,400
Parade.

251
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,460
B, a play.

252
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
C, alien baseball.

253
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,660
Or D, a circus.

254
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,340
Well, it looks like alien baseball has got to be the answer there.

255
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,060
I'm sorry, Dr. Howell.

256
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,580
In this case, D was the correct answer.

257
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,500
But what about the trapezoid on the field?

258
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,060
The circus took place in the spaceship in zero gravity.

259
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,880
And zero gravity.

260
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,320
Zero gravity.

261
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:18,540
Zero gravity.

262
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,080
It sounds like.

263
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,400
It is true.

264
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,080
Zero gravity.

265
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,820
That wasn't even a funny answer.

266
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,100
Well, look.

267
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,600
If aliens didn't put trapezoids down in baseball fields, who did?

268
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,620
The aliens were trapezoids.

269
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,200
And baseball fields don't have trapezoids.

270
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,600
They do when trapeze monks maintain the grounds.

271
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,040
Their diamonds are...

272
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,220
I guess a diamond is a trapezoid, isn't it?

273
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,480
Now you're coming around.

274
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,300
Now you're cooking with propane.

275
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,460
It's at least a...

276
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,800
structure.

277
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,780
We're going to both agree to that.

278
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,080
Whether the aliens do or not.

279
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,100
Truth is fiction.

280
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,540
And this is the Ornith Viva.

281
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,940
Judge Abraham Fuller of Newton, Massachusetts,

282
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,900
found his fee in the dead man's clenched fist.

283
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,360
The Ornith Viva.

284
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,600
In a moment, I'll tell you about an unusual railway,

285
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,540
which has been lightened by draining its water tank.

286
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,160
The Ornith Viva.

287
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,500
Ornith Viva.

288
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,480
Ornith Viva.

289
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,440
Ornith Viva.

290
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


291
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


292
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


293
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


294
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


295
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


296
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


297
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


298
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


299
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,440


300
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,240
Murder!

301
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,920
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

302
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,040
Cock-a-doodle!

303
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,900
Cock-a-doodle!

304
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,480
There.

305
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,880
Trigger man.

306
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,500
The supernatural.

307
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,580
Unknown quantities in the human soul.

308
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
Complete credibility.

309
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,340
Sure.

310
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,000
It's funny how it all comes back to you in the end.

311
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,800
I stood there, the rod cold in my hand, waiting.

312
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,140
Chicken.

313
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,920
Tonight, tonight.

314
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,480
What do you mean?

315
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,760
You know it and I know it.

316
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,360
This is for you!

317
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,700
You belly rat!

318
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,920
Oh, Tom.

319
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,820
Yell.

320
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,600
Breathing hard all the time?

321
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,620
Well, I... from soup to nuts.

322
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,680
I packed a new gap and started to look for Riley.

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,340
Riley, the dick who'd set me up.

324
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:51,880
Yeah.

325
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,220
He was gonna be number one.

326
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,720
Chicken! Chicken!

327
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,500
You can do a lot with 500 bucks a week.

328
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,100
Sure I was hot. Plenty hot.

329
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,500
Hot!

330
00:10:59,580 --> 00:10:59,940
Oh!

331
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,000
Yes, I'm in charge here. What can I do for you?

332
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,260
I should have been excited, but I wasn't.

333
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,580
You, you, you, you... chicken.

334
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,380
Yeah, yeah.

335
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,300
Chicken always. A chicken.

336
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,520
When you were brought back from the future,

337
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,300
they put all 4,400 of you into quarantine?

338
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,500
Uh, yes, pretty much.

339
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,060
And this was a totally sterile, completely controlled environment.

340
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,720
Yeah.

341
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,840
Wow. That sounds nice.

342
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,620
In a sexual justice system, justice-based defenses are considered especially...

343
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,220
Slacks of slack.

344
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,340
Oh my god.

345
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,880
Oh man.

346
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,900
No. No. I can't deal with this.

347
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,260
I...

348
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,700
Hey, what's that mean?

349
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,560
...tweak his ego a little bit.

350
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,200
I didn't do anything!

351
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:34,920
Then what happened?

352
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,620
How long did you stay?

353
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,280
No, it's Harry.

354
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,160
God, what did I do? What did I do?

355
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,340
I wanted to get my eats while they were still hot.

356
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,440
You think this is a joke?

357
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,660
No, no joke. Should use the condom, Harry.

358
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,480
Please, please, please.

359
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,580
Kind of put the old muzzle on Mr. Happy, if you know what I mean.

360
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,900
Anybody witness this fateful hurl?

361
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You know, luckily I had a good buzz on it.

362
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,340
Look, man.

363
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,960
A lap dance sends a pretty strong signal.

364
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:51,940
Ooh!

365
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,140
Get you back where you belong.

366
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,520
Ugh.

367
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,260
It's a drug.

368
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,360
If anything turns up, I'll let you know.

369
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,540
Hell of a catch-22.

370
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,080
I offered to vomit on the floor.

371
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,860
Thank you, Norell Preff, for the offer.

372
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,380
Uh, now from Reverend Ed Fred up Detroit Way.

373
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,160
Uh, let's hear this love song.

374
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,900
Yes, friends, a love song.

375
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,580
They're going to be...

376
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,980
Connie of Love by Ed Fred from Anthems for Bob.

377
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,740
A-loops are like candy.

378
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,580
I'm a little bit of a

381
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:45,580


382
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:45,580


383
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:45,580


384
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,220
Her hair is gold.

385
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,480
As uberfamous as it can be.

386
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,740
Her scent is bold.

387
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,420
She's my Connie of Love.

388
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,140
She's my Connie of Love.

389
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,860
She's my Connie of Love.

390
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,840
She's my Connie of Love.

391
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Now, of this planet.

392
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,420
She was sent from above.

393
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Her pleasure ship I would man it.

394
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,200
She's my Connie of Love.

395
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,780
She's my Connie of Love.

396
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,600
She's my Connie of Love.

397
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,340
She's my Connie of Love.

398
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,140
She's my Connie of Love.

She's my Connie of Love.

She's a Wario Princess.

401
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,020
She's the Queen of Sex.

402
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,920
Under her spell and an instant.

403
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,060
So easy to resist.

404
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,600
Yes.

405
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,140
She's the semáis of sex.

406
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,140


407
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,140

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,120
Yeah.

410
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,940
she's the one,

411
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:22,760
Hey she's holding this,

412
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:22,960


413
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,980
a hot 부� Schwarzer someplace in here.

414
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:23,980


415
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,840
she's the Winter Exils.

416
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,320


417
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,740
Oh,

418
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,140
Why Z that complaining pieces of junk

419
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,140


420
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,140


421
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,160


422
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,880
My o Claro that Euros

423
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:31,880


424
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,560
Yeah,

425
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,280
I feel like eventually,

426
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,180
I'm not really a man with long hair.

427
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,140
Sgtista?

428
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,240
I agree.

429
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,800
Oh, yes, I say, yes, I say.

430
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,740
Oh, I don't know.

431
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,660
Oh, I don't know.

432
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,900
We believe in, well, in rationalizing everything.

433
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,400
You know, Bob won't die for your sins.

434
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:25,720
He says, I'm going to die for you.

435
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:25,720


436
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,560
He's not well-connected enough to do that.

437
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,180
He's not, his dad isn't famous like God or anything.

438
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,580
And he doesn't care about your sins.

439
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,760
He really doesn't give a hoot.

440
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,360
He does come to excuse and justify and rationalize your sin.

441
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,860
And that's why we believe in irrationalizing.

442
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,260
Did I say that right?

443
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,620
Irrationalizing?

444
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,780
Yeah.

445
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,840
And we all do it.

446
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,960
It's just that most people won't admit it.

447
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,340
I don't know.

448
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,620
Why is everybody staring at the pretty colors instead of me?

449
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,460
You know, if I had, we, the reason I do that is because normally at these events,

450
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,140
we have a big production with dancing boys and girls, top hats,

451
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,960
and this big light show and everything.

452
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,980
And winter starts just too cheap.

453
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,560
That's the only, so I thought I'd show that.

454
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,240
But what else we hear?

455
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,320
Okay, we believe in Bob and we believe in FROP.

456
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,320
And we wallow.

457
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,120
We wallow in the inaction of FROP.

458
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,180
FROP inaction is just sitting on your butt.

459
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,420
Okay, so I've explained the church.

460
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,880
You midnight ramblers.

461
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,580
When I say midnight ramblers, I don't mean just black knights.

462
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,180
I mean you black-hearted men and women.

463
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,580
And midnight ramblers.

464
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,900
All midnight ramblers' faces are not black.

465
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,000
What they're on is as black as midnight.

466
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,940
I'm talking to you.

467
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,380
Hold up, men.

468
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,680
And women.

469
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,340
And you bank robbers.

470
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,540
You say so.

471
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,700
Yes.

472
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,080
And you bank robbers.

473
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,600
And kidnap.

474
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,780
I'm talking to you.

475
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,700
And we got some people in the church.

476
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,300
Stay down just as late as a midnight rambler.

477
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,720
All right.

478
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,780
I don't know what time Brother...

479
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,720
...cut in last night.

480
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,860
Yeah, Brother Fowler's a day ahead and you know that, isn't he?

481
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,560
Mm-hmm.

482
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:01,920
Yeah.

483
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,360
It's the anointing that will break the yoke of Satan's bondage.

484
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,680
And I want you to know that I had just been experiencing an attack on all sides.

485
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,820
It seemed like on every front where we tried to advance,

486
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:23,280
the devil would just unleash literally hordes of demonic forces to stop us.

487
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,300
And...

488
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:33,500
...after a few weeks of this, I just began to feel a deep hurting in my belly, way deep down in my spirit.

489
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,000
And some people say, Brother Popov, what?

490
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,960
You mean you experience pain too?

491
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,680
Yes, I do.

492
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,120
I hurt just like you do.

493
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,480
I feel the pain of a satanic attack just like you do.

494
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,940
That's why I'm concerned about you.

495
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,460
That's why I feel for you.

496
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,000
I feel in the spiritual pain and your suffering and the sickness that Satan throws at you to try to overcome you.

497
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,200
But bless God, Satan is a defeated foe.

498
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:03,020
But while I felt this pain, it seemed almost as if a spontaneous thing happened.

499
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,520
As I...

500
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,460
Finally, I...

501
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,680
...no longer, but I really didn't even know how to pray because I didn't know exactly what the devil...

502
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,660
...what was coming at me.

503
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,000
Satan was bombarding me from so many sides.

504
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,540
Actually, I felt kind of numb.

505
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,120
I know how that is, Brother Popov.

506
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,240
Oh, do I know it.

507
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,680
Friends, before Peter popped off, we heard...

508
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,340
...Midnight Rambler by the great D.K. Jones.

509
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,140
That's from like 1980.

510
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,280
And some preaching by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang from Winter Star Symposium 2007.

511
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,620
But now, Glass Madness and...

512
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,360
...Me from 1982.

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,460
Big Bob.

514
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,480
I got a mighty big Bob.

515
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,320
I got a mighty big Bob.

516
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,440
I got a big Bob.

517
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,860
I got a mighty big Bob.

518
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,240
And he's gotta come out.

519
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,880
Well, he must have got in.

520
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,340
No room.

521
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,520
We gotta get out.

522
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,440
There ain't no room in my skin.

523
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,080
But there's a mighty big Bob.

524
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,140
Big Bob.

525
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,560
He's inside of me.

526
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,380
He's a mighty big Bob.

527
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,260
Oh, good Bob.

528
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,760
You know, it makes him a pig.

529
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,220
It makes him a pig.

530
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,800
He's a mighty big Bob.

531
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,600
He's too big.

532
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
He's a mighty big Bob.

533
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,560
And he's really too big.

534
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,180
He's a mighty big Bob.

535
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,120
And he's really too big.

536
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,860
He's a mighty big Bob.

537
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,840
And he's really too big.

538
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,200
Ironic.

539
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,840
Horny Toad recently made this astounding discovery and brought these soft morning after trousers to market.

540
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,620
Oh.

541
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,520
Horny Toad did that.

542
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,000
Really?

543
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,360
Uh, that sounds like something...

544
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,620
Kind of a three toad, tree toad.

545
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,520
What do you mean horny toad did this?

546
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,680
What are you talking about?

547
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,860
Says right there.

548
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,700
Horny Toad recently made this astounding discovery.

549
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,240
Says right here in our manual.

550
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,920
Oh, if you say so.

551
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,980
In our manual, our radio show manual here.

552
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,280
Oh, really?

553
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,460
When we walk in that that guy, that one guy gives us.

554
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,440
I don't know though.

555
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,440
You didn't get it?

556
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,480
No, I just don't think anybody's out there at all.

557
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,360
I don't think they are either.

558
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,340
We're going to fire the flares for the last time here as the show sinks and we hit the no listener iceberg.

559
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,460
Those flares have been unfashionable since the beginning of the 80s.

560
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,160
I know, but we had so many aboard it.

561
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,660
I bought a big box of them.

562
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:50,440
I still like those old flares in the horny toad collar hole.

563
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,560
But let's speed up, friends.

564
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,580
I like this background music from Bonobo's Convergence.

565
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,200
With some more Ed Fred.

566
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
And this tune is called Sex Hurt.

567
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,280
Sex Hurt.

568
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,440
Sex Hurt.

569
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,440


570
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:21,420
Sex Hurt.

571
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,560
Sex Hurt.

572
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,960
Sex Hurt.

573
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,680
Sex Hurt.

574
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:49,600
Cash Luke.

575
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,660
Sex Hurt.

576
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,500
Sex Hurt.

577
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,500


578
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,540
Sex Hurt Hurt Hurt Home

579
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:52,540


580
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:52,540


581
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,520
I'm gonna clean this up.

582
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:20,180
No. No. Stop choking yourself.

583
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,640
One, two, one, two, three, four.

584
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:47,480
One, two, one, two, three, four.

585
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,100
Sometimes I see

586
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,380
No matter how

587
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,180
hard I try

588
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,120
No matter how much I do

589
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,440
No matter whatever I say

590
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,240
It's never enough for you

591
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,180
Oh no

592
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,000
It's never enough for you

593
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,920
Sometimes

594
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,580
I see

595
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,960
No matter how hard I try

596
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,000
No matter how much

597
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,220
I do

598
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,020
No matter whatever I say

599
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,820
It's never enough for you

600
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,840
Oh no

601
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,620
It's never enough for you

602
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,260
You got me

604
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:40,740

605
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,280
although i know it's all wrong i know it's all wrong

606
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:06,080
sometimes it seems no matter how hard i try no matter how much i do no matter whatever i say

607
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:13,060

609
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:21,700

612
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,700

you

617
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,660
you

618
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,640
you

619
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:06,700

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,160

00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,220

624
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:09,540


625
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,900
really

626
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,740
you're worth the time

627
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


628
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


629
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


630
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


631
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


632
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


633
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


634
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


635
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


636
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


637
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


638
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,740


639
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,080
Well you don't like this

640
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:48,780
Well, maybe you'll like that You got a whole lotta tricks yes I do in this here sack But I respect your expectation

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,720
Well, you know it was my girlfriend I respect your expectation

642
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,580
Do you respect my slack?

643
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,020
Don't ask for it all

644
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,860
Or you'll get nothing back

645
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,180
Nothing back

646
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,860
Sometimes it seems

647
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,920
No matter how hard I try

648
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,680
No matter how much I do

649
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,040

650
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,820

651
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,800

Sometimes it seems

654
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,560
No matter how hard I try

655
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,300
No matter how much I do

656
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,620
No matter whatever I say

657
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,440
Oh, it's never enough for you

658
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,460

663
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,120
guitar solo

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,700

There's never enough for you

668
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,400
Never Enough For You, friends, from the Gregory Morris Group,

669
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,520
a CD called Houses in the Sky.

670
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,560
If you want more information about the Gregory Morris Group,

671
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,620
you can look at gregorysmusic.com.

672
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:43,380
I saw that band at Winterstar playing at parties and on stage,

673
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,640
and it was great.

674
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,840
All right, and now, the President of the United States.

675
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,280
Mr. Prime Time,

676
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,280
in the long term, security in Iraq requires sectarian violence,

677
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,080
something the overwhelming majority of Iraqis want.

678
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,860
I agree.

679
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,980
And I look forward to face-to-face extremist violence.

680
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,900
Prime Minister and I agree that dominating Iraq

681
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,940
is aimed at strengthening the sectarian violence.

682
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
The government is still at a Ai.

683
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,420
That makes me sick...

684
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,240
ure fascinating, Mr. Prime.

685
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,760
Do you think that now that Dick, the real Dick Cheney

686
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,980
he has the Holy Grail, but he'll actually usurp the throne

687
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,680
and take over거야 King Sidney Wubeah's throne?

688
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,600
No.

689
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,840
I'm sure he is where he wants to be.

690
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,120
He likes to be in the subgenius that actually pulls

691
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,540
the strings of the puppet, right?

692
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,480
Sort of the Bob before the Bob move.

693
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,620
What the heck...

694
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:44,620


695
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,480
I hate the way this...

696
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,360
It's really gone downhill here on the show.

697
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,080
Yeah.

698
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,940
Because there's this sticky stuff on this place.

699
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,140
Now you know that you originated that.

700
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,740
That's really rude.

701
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,120
That's real show.

702
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,260
You got show all over you.

703
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,540
You got it on the desk.

704
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
You got it on your clothing.

705
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,900
Really, such an irrational example.

706
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,380
It has to be.

707
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,360
Well, you'll have to clean it up.

708
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:13,740
That's true.

709
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,980
It's a real sticky show.

710
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,700
Yes, it is.

711
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,820
It sticks to your ribs.

712
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,840
Especially if you are un...

713
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,620
careful enough.

714
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,360
Hey, was that the little pile of stickiness?

715
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,360
The little ball of sticky?

716
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,900
Keep the stickiness in that one area.

717
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,300
Okay, here are the little subgenius demigods

718
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,720
dancing with little fairy wings

719
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,140
in gossamer clothing

720
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,520
at the book signing after April 1st.

721
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,920
Yes, for listeners in Northern California, friends,

722
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,500
there will be a festive book signing

723
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,020
at City Lights Bookstore,

724
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,560
the famous City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco,

725
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,800
of the two new subgenius books,

726
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,420
the Bobliagraphon and Revelation X reprint.

727
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,960
I won't be there, but here's who will.

728
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,360
Dr. Howell, Dr. Philodrummon, Puzzling Evidence,

729
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,180
Phineas Narco, I don't know who else,

730
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,080
Michael Pepe, probably,

731
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,300
maybe even Saint.

732
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:13,500
I don't know.

733
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,600
Palmer Vredes, that's April 1st

734
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,060
at City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco.

735
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,940
But now, Lee Murr, and then back to Winterstar

736
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,240
for news about the subgenius child custody case.

737
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,320
And this, this, I guess...

738
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,680
Yeah, I mean, I mean, you know, when, uh,

739
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,160
when, when, you know, you know, you know,

740
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,600
you know, you know, uh, uh, uh, um...

741
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,360
Now, for those of you who already were subgeniuses,

742
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,180
I have some news.

743
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,440
Last year, I described the situation of Reverend Magdalene,

744
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,620
and I'm not bullshitting, this is a true story.

745
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,840
This nice, college-educated woman with two jobs

746
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,760
and a husband with two jobs

747
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,940
had her child taken away from her,

748
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,060
and the courts gave full custody of her child

749
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,760
to the biological dad

750
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,300
who is living in a trailer court on welfare.

751
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,260
The reason being,

752
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,920
Reverend Magdalene is a subgenius.

753
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,980
And this judge saw pictures on the internet

754
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,720
of what the subgeniuses do

755
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,600
at their X-Day celebration out at Brushwood.

756
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,640
They saw pictures of Reverend Magdalene's husband

757
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,020
dressed up as Jesus, but with a clown face

758
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,100
and carrying a cross,

759
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,860
only it was shaped like a giant dollar sign

760
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,180
made of pool noodles.

761
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,900
And he was being whipped and beaten

762
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,620
by naked women using dildos.

763
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,140
And that's true.

764
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,360
Those pictures are on there.

765
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,260
Reverend Jesus and his friend Mickey Death Chick

766
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,520
were raised as Catholics,

767
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,760
and they had heard about that movie,

768
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,880
The Passion of Christ.

769
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,420
And they're also splatter film,

770
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,160
slasher movie fans,

771
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,340
and they thought Mel Gibson hadn't been bloody enough.

772
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,160
So they decided to refilm Passion of the Christ

773
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,720
with more fake blood.

774
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,640
And so we had machine guns, squirt guns of blood.

775
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,920
Boy, I mean, he had blood.

776
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,080
Packs all over him.

777
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,280
Fake whip marks.

778
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,920
It was the bloodiest thing in the world.

779
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,020
But those pictures were enough to cause that judge to say,

780
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,360
this is a sickening, disgusting, satanic religion.

781
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,980
Besides, somebody was wearing a mask of a goat.

782
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,740
And you know that means devil worship.

783
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,680
You know, there's a goat anywhere around.

784
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,560
I need to tell my brother.

785
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,100
He raises goats for a living.

786
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,960
Why goats?

787
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,880
Well, the recent news is,

788
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,240
Reverend Magdalene, after, I mean,

789
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,000
because this,

790
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,440
the Christian father, biological father,

791
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,340
is jobless permanently on welfare,

792
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,700
he gets a free lawyer.

793
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,300
Because the Bevilacquas have four jobs between them,

794
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,000
they have to pay for a lawyer.

795
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,920
Well, the first lawyer they had,

796
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,840
it turned out, well, his dad was golfing buddies with the judge.

797
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,600
That's why he didn't really fight very hard.

798
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,500
So finally they got it, when this latest thing happened,

799
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,640
and they,

800
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,640
for 10 years they shared custody.

801
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,200
But suddenly this judge decided,

802
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,320
he suddenly got all religious on everybody,

803
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,040
and decided Church of the Subgenius was a bad religion.

804
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
Can't it be both?

805
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,880
Anyway, so they got a new lawyer.

806
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,080
It made the news big time,

807
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,340
and every time it did, I sold a lot of stuff.

808
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,600
That whole thing is actually done,

809
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,220
if they were trying to cause harm to the church,

810
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,640
it had just the opposite effect.

811
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,920
But anyway, they got it,

812
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,520
and the judge, after becoming famous on the internet,

813
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,940
as a complete idiot,

814
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,020
recused himself.

815
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,260
Next time you get fired from a job,

816
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,240
just tell people you recused yourself from that job.

817
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,780
And they got a new judge.

818
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,740
Well, the new judge,

819
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,460
after six months of deliberation,

820
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,700
during which time the vegetarian little boy

821
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,140
had to stay with his dad,

822
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,480
being forced to eat meat,

823
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,140
they decided that, you know,

824
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,060
soy products turn you effeminate.

825
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,240
That's a big right-wing thing now.

826
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,720
And so therefore,

827
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,860
the kid had to eat meat.

828
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,280
Couldn't be a vegetarian anymore,

829
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,520
because that's why he was so little.

830
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,420
Wasn't the fact that he was ten years older.

831
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,340
So, to make a long story short,

832
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,360
this new judge decided,

833
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,180
no, church and subgenius isn't a religion,

834
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,960
it's really art.

835
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,040
But it's bad art.

836
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,840
It's drivel.

837
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,060
It's harmful.

838
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,080
And so the mom could have the kid

839
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,440
a little bit more on the weekends,

840
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,540
but she could never have subgenius materials

841
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,720
around the house.

842
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,700
God bless her.

843
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,380
God forbid that some child be exposed

844
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,500
to a picture of a smiling man

845
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,580
representing a religion,

846
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,880
you know, because cool religions

847
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,580
are represented by pictures of dying men.

848
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,940
Right?

849
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,860
So, somehow I suppose it's okay

850
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,840
for a child to be raised in the church

851
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,500
of the flying spaghetti monster,

852
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,960
or the church of Jesus Christ,

853
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,700
or any of these other invented,

854
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,960
made-up, fictitious space monsters.

855
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,520
But for some reason,

856
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,200
just because,

857
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,240
there's a little bit of nakedness involved

858
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,500
with Bob's church.

859
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,660
And you Wiccans know how that is.

860
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,100
You guys have been dealing with it

861
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,460
for a lot longer than we have.

862
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,200
In fact, that's where a whole lot of our help came from,

863
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,320
was from, you know, pagans,

864
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,460
neo-pagans and stuff,

865
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,180
who kind of went,

866
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,020
yeah, we know how this is.

867
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,120
You know, they can take your kid away

868
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,000
because of the comic books that your parents read.

869
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,160
Well, I mean, I guess every stripper needs to have,

870
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,380
is an unfit mother, you know?

871
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,820
Anybody who's not in a mainstream religion

872
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,680
is a potential unfit parent

873
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,300
if you have to live in that small town in New York.

874
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,100
By the way, it wasn't Texas that this happened in,

875
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,060
it was New York.

876
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,920
I don't think that would,

877
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,740
well, it would happen in Texas too.

878
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,220
People are the assholes everywhere.

879
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,520
So the latest thing is,

880
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,400
they're taking it to an appellate court

881
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,680
and where five judges who aren't from the small town,

882
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,860
hopefully will go,

883
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,700
oh my God, we can't believe this has been going on.

884
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,560
We've been in this for so long.

885
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,680
And maybe the mom will get full custody.

886
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,200
We'll see.

887
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,360
That would be nice.

888
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,800
Um, uh, I, I, I, I, uh, I, uh, uh, and, uh, and,

889
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,920
just, look at the tennis,

890
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,900
just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,

891
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,560
that's an excellent question because,

892
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,260
that's an excellent question because,

893
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,780
that's, uh, and, um,

894
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,340
Beth stood in the doorway,

895
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,680
sleepily rubbing her eyes.

896
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,600
In the glow from the partially open door of the stove,

897
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,220
she saw,

898
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,440
Oh, a kitty.

899
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,220
Oh, Santa Claus did come after her.

900
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,400
Look at him.

901
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:47,960
Grrr.

902
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,420
Eyes red with hatred,

903
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,900
he started toward the little girl.

904
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,640
Mommy's singing.

905
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,800
Look, he's licking my hand.

906
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,400
The murderous jaws slashed the air,

907
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,560
and this time he hit the stove as he landed.

908
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,840
And a moment later, the little puppy lay still.

909
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,160
Good work, boy.

910
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,380
When the sergeant returned to the living room,

911
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,700
Beth was crying quietly.

912
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,840
in her mother's arms.

913
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,240
The first

914
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,760
first night.

915
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,020
And the subgenius church,

916
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,240
um, we, we don't,

917
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,640
there, we don't have regular weekly meetings,

918
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,940
or, you know, like, we don't get together on Sundays.

919
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,780
If we did, it would be Saturday nights,

920
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,620
and it would be in bars.

921
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,780
And, in fact, some clenches do that, I think.

922
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,000
Uh, you know, because, uh,

923
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,940
religion should give you slack.

924
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,420
Some people think we don't take

925
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,380
ecstatic happiness seriously.

926
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,200
And I've always found it very hard to take

927
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,240
ecstatic laughing happiness,

928
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,320
all that fucking goddamn serious

929
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,940
for myself.

930
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,920
Pardon my language.

931
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,140
But, uh, we, we don't,

932
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,400
one reason we don't have, uh,

933
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,900
church buildings and, and, uh,

934
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,300
and tent show meetings,

935
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,500
I mean, this right here is about as close as it gets.

936
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,600
Aside from the shows in the bars.

937
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,780
It's because the subgeniuses,

938
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,640
by definition, they're real weirdos.

939
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,860
I mean, they're not just pretend,

940
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,800
the real ones are really weird.

941
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,700
And that means they don't always get along with each other.

942
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
For every subgenius, there's gonna be another one who's,

943
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,400
it's the exact opposite, and drives it crazy.

944
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,260
I seem to have quite a few of those.

945
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,540
And I seem to function as that for lots of people.

946
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,260
And also, you can, you can actually see this happen

947
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,360
on the subgenius internet.

948
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,400
Um, we, there's a whole lot of email lists and things,

949
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,180
but really, my favorite one is a,

950
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,280
a forum called alt.slack.

951
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,080
It's been on the, it's one of,

952
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,120
it was one of the first Usenet news groups,

953
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:50,820
believe it or not,

954
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,040
because we, computer geeks have always loved Bob.

955
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
They can read and stuff, you know.

956
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,640
And this, uh,

957
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,480
uh, on alt.slack, about it,

958
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,820
it seems like it's just the opposite of slack.

959
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,540
These people cannot get along.

960
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,060
They say the nastiest,

961
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,660
bluntest put-downs to each other.

962
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,320
I mean, you dare not get on there trying to be funny.

963
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,600
Because if you aren't, they'll let you know

964
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,080
in a blunt and mean way.

965
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,240
And people look at that and they think subgeniuses are mean.

966
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,140
And it's true that the sensitive wimps

967
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,360
don't really last very long in the public forum like that.

968
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,820
But, you know, if you're a little boy or girl from balloony land,

969
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,960
you really shouldn't be going to pincushion man parties.

970
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,600
People go,

971
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,800
well, now what do you guys believe in then?

972
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,320
If you believe in Bob,

973
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,340
who looks like a cartoon character to me,

974
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,420
or, or, or what?

975
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,340
Well, uh,

976
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,560
and that's up to each subgenius.

977
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,160
You know, some of them are very, uh,

978
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,360
well, swallowed damn near anything.

979
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,500
Proof of that is the fact that these books are still in print.

980
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,180
But,

981
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,180
and we have three in print,

982
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,420
and all are available at the sales table, by the way,

983
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:10,920
but, uh,

984
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,480
we don't believe in magic or science.

985
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,800
Science,

986
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,660
according to science,

987
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,040
breasts are nothing but, uh,

988
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,920
modified sweat glands.

989
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,120
So much for science.

990
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,020
Lost me right there, buddy.

991
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,040
We don't believe the crap they teach in schools

992
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,200
about creationism or evolution.

993
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,160
Uh, we call, in fact, the latest name for schools,

994
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,060
is coninfectionaries,

995
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,060
because all they do is spread their sugary lies.

996
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,100
It sounds so good.

997
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,680
They never talk about the descendants of the Yeti,

998
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,000
or how the exes came and

999
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,220
accidentally killed all the dinosaurs

1000
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,800
and invented humans as lab rats, actually.

1001
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,720
It was the original idea, but they escaped.

1002
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,920
And then the Yetis started having sex with the humans.

1003
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,320
And here we are, watered down,

1004
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,340
looking just like humans ourselves, almost.

1005
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,740
Most, some of us, anyway.

1006
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,940
Oh!

1007
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,040
No!

1008
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,280
What year is that?

1009
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,700
Oh my…

1010
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,780
Hitler was a woman!

1011
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,420
This is contemporary.

1012
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:15,420


1013
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,180
Hitler was a woman.

1014
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,220
And that was a joke on the show, many years ago.

1015
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,260
Hitler was a woman to me.

1016
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,880
Hitler was a woman to me.

1017
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,700
Hitler was a woman…

1018
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
I'm faxing this to all my friends.

1019
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:25,920
More than a woman to me,

1020
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,000
Hitler was a woman to me.

1021
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,060
Hitler was a woman!

1022
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,400
Autopsy proves it it says.

1023
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,820
Wow, a current…

1024
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,160
… holy shit…

1025
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,160


1026
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,160


1027
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,160


1028
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,160


1029
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,160


1030
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,160


1031
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,160


1032
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,160


1033
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,940
He wasn't no goody two-shoes, though.

1034
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,580
He wasn't no namby-pamby hand-wringing do-gooder.

1035
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,340
He was evil.

1036
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,640
She was evil.

1037
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:57,620
In 2006, nearly a year old, this publication makes the audacious suggestion that Adolf Hitler, former Chancellor of the Third Reich, was in fact a woman.

1038
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,360
Another victim in the victim society.

1039
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:11,360
Then there was a Hitler autopsy photo, extremely interesting, after that fake alien autopsy, because after all...

1040
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:17,020
Have you ever thought about what would have happened if you could have gotten there and, like, talked Hitler out of being bad?

1041
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,200
No.

1042
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,280
If you could have just talked with him for a while, you probably could have convinced him.

1043
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,600
Although, of course, that's what anybody from now at times would do.

1044
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,820
Even Martin Landau.

1045
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,680
Except Martin Landau.

1046
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,460
What would Martin Landau do?

1047
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,920
He tried to shoot him, and he...

1048
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,180
I don't remember what it was.

1049
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:35,640
Well, that was just...

1050
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,500
That was only an act, though.

1051
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,580
In the 22 minutes that would prevent him.

1052
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,380
That was only an act.

1053
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,000
I know, but it was as close as I ever saw it.

1054
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,780
But when Martin Landau, when they asked Martin Landau about that, he kind of wished it was true.

1055
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,200
Yeah.

1056
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,520
Just like...

1057
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,160
Like Barbara Bain.

1058
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,660
I was just thinking, in an alternate universe, I was married to Barbara Bain, says Martin Landau.

1059
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,040
And Hitler was a woman.

1060
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,160
No.

1061
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,860
Barbara Bain and Martin Landau were so underrated.

1062
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,040
You think so?

1063
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:05,580
Yeah.

1064
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,140
I never could quite get Barbara Bain.

1065
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,380
Really?

1066
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,960
She was kind of out there.

1067
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,520
She was very difficult to get.

1068
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,860
I see you doing what I'm doing.

1069
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,020
Oh, my eyes are not any good anymore.

1070
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,120
You're peering off into the distance towards that round thing on the wall.

1071
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,780
Yes, that analog fizz.

1072
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,340
One that records the passage of occurrences and tiny little things.

1073
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,220
Little increments of chronological progression.

1074
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,040
Yeah.

1075
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,880
Time's uncoiling stainless spring.

1076
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:48,420
Time slowly breaks down as we prepare for the nice new show to happen.

1077
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,660
And the big doughnuts.

1078
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,580
And the big rolling doughnuts.

1079
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,720
Major donors are at cost.

1080
00:45:54,180 --> 00:46:00,920
Time has endless varieties and shows of all varieties, which revealeth old things.

1081
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,900
And heaven maketh new discoveries, and earth, and even earth itself, a discovery.

1082
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,640
But you know, you can bring the kids to the show.

1083
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,540
I mean, at least virtually.

1084
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,160
I believe I'm there.

1085
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,960
Virtually, you can bring the kids to the show.

1086
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,020
We'll put them to work.

1087
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,580
In your mind.

1088
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:23,780
And we will put them to work on special projects from which you will benefit.

1089
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,900
We can make your kids perform, but only after subgenius indoctrination.

1090
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1091
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1092
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1093
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1094
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1095
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1096
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1097
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1098
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1099
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


1100
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,820
Really?

1101
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,800
That is essential.

1102
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,240
Complete, steep, and subgenius doctrine is the only possibility.

1103
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,160
We'll plant the seeds of compliance.

1104
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,340
We'll nurture the grounds of agreement.

1105
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,660
We'll make them into virtual meat puppets.

1106
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:57,940
Puppets?

1107
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,940
For which you are the puppet master.

1108
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,900
That is so, because the puppets are an intermediate between the performer and the audience.

1109
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:11,420
But we want puppets to assume a more exalted station than that.

1110
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,600
Some people might say that it's the puppet that jerks the strings that moves the puppet master's fingers.

1111
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,420
They might and do say it.

1112
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,660
And the puppet master is the true puppet.

1113
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,760
How about rod puppets?

1114
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,000
When rod is there manipulating these puppets.

1115
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,680
When rod's doing it?

1116
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,540
Well.

1117
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,520
That would prove nice.

1118
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,140
Ah, yes.

1119
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,080
Yes, it would.

1120
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,560
I can remember it a little.

1121
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,580
Bob.

1122
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:40,900
Bob?

1123
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,180
Why, that guy owes me $140.

1124
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,780
He does?

1125
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,620
Wow.

1126
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,340
Well, you owe him a lot more.

1127
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:57,580
You owe him your everlasting happiness and soul and the slack that you so willfully gave away without even knowing it.

1128
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,980
You let the slack leak out of your pocket like...

1129
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,560
What are you reading?

1130
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:00,860
Like...

1131
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,860
Like pennies from a pocket of a ripped out pair of pants that you just don't care about anymore.

1132
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,280
You just can't keep up with them.

1133
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,840
But then when you throw them away, you intensely care about them.

1134
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,460
Then all of a sudden, yeah, you look around and say, what happened to my money?

1135
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,820
Where's my blue pair of pants?

1136
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,480
I always...

1137
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:18,980
Oh, boy.

1138
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,100
Really?

1139
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:20,660
That's what you say?

1140
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,000
I think so.

1141
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,840
Or a simulacrum to that effect.

1142
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,060
Okay.

1143
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,520
Ferreting out your fellow subgeni in a crowd...

1144
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,820
Can be difficult at times.

1145
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:38,960
We give you the techniques it takes to whiff-read your local subgenius.

1146
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,100
Stench aura.

1147
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:52,240
As it permeates and exceeds from the crowd itself, you can penetrate to the inner depths simply by whiff-reading that aura stench.

1148
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,260
That sigh stench.

1149
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,640
See?

1150
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,460
I can smell Dr. Howe right now.

1151
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,720
Oh, I'm heavily sorry.

1152
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,380
Are you sure?

1153
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,240
That is amazing.

1154
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,440
It's your sigh stench.

1155
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,860
It smells like perfume.

1156
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,360
Oh, for God's sake.

1157
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,740
Thy rich perfume exalts the room.

1158
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,400
Well, what are you going to do?

1159
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,520
I mean, there are odors, miasmas.

1160
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:20,380
Some of them are deliberately produced by the body to send subtle chemical signals to our fellow beings.

1161
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,080
And is this not our birthright?

1162
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:23,540
Yes.

1163
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,940
Are we not apes?

1164
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,520
Yes.

1165
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,580
Those noble creatures.

1166
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,460
Not monkeys.

1167
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,980
Those horrible, nasty...

1168
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,440
Yetensen.

1169
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:29,480
Yetensen.

1170
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,500
...throwing, biting...

1171
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,040
No, we are great apes and are...

1172
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,500
Yetis.

1173
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:40,440
Yetis interbred with the human stock back in the day, as the great Zukalski pointed out.

1174
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,840
Of course, he thought that this was...

1175
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,560
He thought it was bad.

1176
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,180
...to the depletion of the human animal.

1177
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:51,980
And that yeti throwbacks were people like Benito Mussolini, who were generally dictators,

1178
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,660
and people who exercised political and civil power.

1179
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,920
But we, the subgeniuses, believe...

1180
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:13,480
Or that 180 degrees away from Zukalski, that the yeti human interbreeding created our best and chiefly, among them, the subgeniuses.

1181
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,940
Yes, it's difficult, but it happens when you discover your true yeti mate.

1182
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:30,160
...eat a lot of fruit, swing from the trees, do all that you can to re-commonize your yetin-sin existence.

1183
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,100
...and that the depletion of the human stock back in the day, as the great Zukalski pointed out.

1184
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,100


1185
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,560
So I've got to get back and make one more...

1186
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,900
...that can help me to...

1187
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,940
Yes, being skewered by an elder god is part of that process.

1188
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,980
Symbolically, of course.

1189
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,560
...to work out...

1190
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,200
She liked that.

1191
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,860
Can I be a Sasquatch too?

1192
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,820
You already are.

1193
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,640
You're my son, JB.

1194
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,500
You're my son, JB.

1195
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,380
Baby Sas.

1196
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:06,120
Sasquatch is my daddy and he's going to protect me.

1197
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,040
Half man, half machine.

1198
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,260
On the cover of a magazine.

1199
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,800
Bigfoot is my father and he's got to protect me.

1200
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,240
These lyrics don't make sense.

1201
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,740
Think I found the evidence.

1202
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,360
That yeti is my papa and he wants to protect me.

1203
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:24,380
Yeah!

1204
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,340
Yeah, you have to be careful.

1205
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,620
Because if you find your true yeti mate, you will be manipulated by the elder gods.

1206
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,900
It's part of the process.

1207
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:37,700
Sure is.

1208
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,680
Swimming in this radio liquid slag supreme.

1209
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,560
It's real good for the circulation.

1210
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,480
It forces the blood through the limbs.

1211
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,060
Yes, damn braces.

1212
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,200
Bless, relax.

1213
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,980
We'll relax you in a moment.

1214
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,980
We will?

1215
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,300
Yes, we will.

1216
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,340
And we'll teach you how to...

1217
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,400
I was just looking at the camera here.

1218
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,200
420 guy.

1219
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,600
Oh, don't look at the camera.

1220
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,720
420 guy?

1221
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,100
Yeah.

1222
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,160
Is he still there?

1223
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,280
Yeah, he's on the country roads lead to his palatial mansion.

1224
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,640
Yeah, he's back there.

1225
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,300
It's no Mick mansion, folks.

1226
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,380
Trailing, driving.

1227
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,140
But what is his, you know, national origin?

1228
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,660
Where...

1229
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,240
Where's he from?

1230
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,760
That's exactly what I'm...

1231
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,640
What's his make in modeling?

1232
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,860
What's the 65 million year climax that he keeps talking about?

1233
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,860
Well, that seems good and long.

1234
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,360
Well, I...

1235
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,880
Long enough to get the job done, I would think.

1236
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,960
Yeah.

1237
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,340
Hacking, you just keep hacking and whacking away and eventually you'll be finished.

1238
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,480
You just think about it one gradient at a time.

1239
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,460
There you go.

1240
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:51,900
Take a...

1241
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,240
Grasp this object.

1242
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,660
Yeah, grasp this.

1243
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,360
Whoo!

1244
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,940
Here you go, Dr. Howe.

1245
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,140
All right, now what?

1246
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,500
I don't know.

1247
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:00,500


1248
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,260
I'll pinch off a big...

1249
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,840
All right, enough of this.

1250
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,520
...portion.

1251
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,820
It's a blank food tube.

1252
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,100
And the devil take the hindmost, eh?

1253
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:11,980
Yes.

1254
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,660
Now this is the special food, it's the all-purpose food and it's...

1255
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,240
Well, as long as it's special.

1256
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,840
You just call it food, that's all you have to call it.

1257
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,000
You mean it's generic?

1258
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,900
Because it's all... everything is all in one thing and it all tastes the same, but it tastes good.

1259
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,060
Let me at it.

1260
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,380
It doesn't have a real flavor.

1261
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,300
It's just good.

1262
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,560
I'll take two tubs.

1263
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,020
What does it taste like?

1264
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,320
I don't know, but it tastes good.

1265
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:40,480
Aren't you going to be picking up pieces of ice off the deck and throwing it away or keeping it as a souvenir?

1266
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,080
Right.

1267
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,560
I will either throw it or keep it.

1268
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,120
And in either case, it would be a souvenir.

1269
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:52,240
One which I either reject or keep.

1270
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,180
Are inspired.

1271
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,100
Yes, that's it.

1272
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,640
And if I keep it, I'll put it in my pocket where it will do me the most good.

1273
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,220
Tie it in a ribbon.

1274
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,540
Throw it in the deep woods.

1275
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,620
Wrap it in a big rubber band.

1276
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,180
Rocketing rickets.

1277
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,260
With big red straps.

1278
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,780
Ricketing rackets.

1279
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,140
I'm going to swim over to the lifeboats.

1280
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,340
Save those coupons.

1281
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:18,880
Yes, I did clip and save all the coupons, but they went down with the ship.

1282
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,720
Don't forget to take your vitamins.

1283
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,020
I need them in this 28 degree water.

1284
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,200
You'll need all the nutrition you can get, so take your food and go.

1285
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1286
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1287
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1288
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1289
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1290
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1291
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1292
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1293
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1294
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1295
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1296
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,200


1297
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,640
I'm going to go to the food tube.

1298
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,340
Put it over your shoulder or tie it to your belt or something.

1299
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,100
You'll need it.

1300
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,020
Now, here hold this barnacle, this barnacle bag that you'll be sleeping in.

1301
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,820
Inside the barnacle bag, there's a slot for your food tube.

1302
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,180
Stick it right in there.

1303
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,560
You see that slot?

1304
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,100
He's out of it now.

1305
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:53,880
He can't remember.

1306
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:54,760
He's just...

1307
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,700
Do you think he has...

1308
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,380
I see the food tube.

1309
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:58,940
It's strapped to his back.

1310
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,100
I hate food.

1311
00:54:59,100 --> 00:54:59,160
I hate food.

1312
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,160


1313
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,160


1314
00:54:59,200 --> 00:54:59,380
He has the barnacle bag.

1315
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,060
He's doing this every time.

1316
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,200
He has the barnacle bag.

1317
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,940
Knock him out every time we get him off the air.

1318
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,580
Now, he'll be extracting the barnacles from the bag before he can actually sleep in the

1319
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:08,860
bag.

1320
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,220
Really?

1321
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:20,600
And inside the barnacle covered bag, he will put his salt covered body into which he

1322
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:27,840
will pull his food tube and extract the food substance therein.

1323
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,180
Like a turkey.

1324
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:29,180


1325
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,120
A giant Skeeter.

1326
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,060
In a sucking motion.

1327
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,960
Just call me Skeeter Libby.

1328
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,780
If it says Libby, it's on the label.

1329
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,160
Skeeter Luby.

1330
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:38,780
Skeeter Luby.

1331
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,520
Then you'll love it, love it, love it on your table.

1332
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:45,560
Some people call him Dr. Howl, but you'll love it, love it, love it and Levitts, right?

1333
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,020
No, I hate Levitts.

1334
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,040
But...

1335
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,360
They hate you, too.

1336
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:50,820
They do.

1337
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,180
They told me.

1338
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,080
They sent me an e-mail the other day and said we hate Dr. Howl.

1339
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:54,860
Don't bring him back over here.

1340
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,180
You know, I was speaking only figuratively because I, Dr. Howl, am the friend...

1341
00:55:59,180 --> 00:55:59,180


1342
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,620
Wait, I just got an email from...

1343
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,420
They were...

1344
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,800
Just kidding.

1345
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:03,900
I love humanity.

1346
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,100
They didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

1347
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,240
I love them, I do.

1348
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,260
They really didn't.

1349
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,780
They were just simply...

1350
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,860
Just joking around.

1351
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,620
Just joshing.

1352
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,960
They were joshing in a jocular way.

1353
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,200
Joy, thou glorious...

1354
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,540
A joyously jocular and jovial way.

1355
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:24,060
Their jocularity was one that was made manifest in a palpable...

1356
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,440
Jock full of...

1357
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,580
Pile of...

1358
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,280
Yes.

1359
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,080
Poking fun.

1360
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:28,720
There it is.

1361
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,000
See?

1362
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,140
It smells.

1363
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,160
It's leaky.

1364
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,240
It's a stenchy smell.

1365
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,440
It makes me uncomfortable, too.

1366
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:34,960
Me, too.

1367
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,380
I can't...

1368
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,100
I don't know if I can keep up with it anymore.

1369
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,660
I don't understand.

1370
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,120
Why?

1371
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:39,480
How?

1372
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,720
All I can think about is that big, fat donut.

1373
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,200
Oh.

1374
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,000
All right.

1375
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,540
That one I'm going to have in a little while.

1376
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,480
Yeah, I think so.

1377
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,560
But will it be having you in there?

1378
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,740
I hope not.

1379
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:56,060
Or if it does, I hope it enjoys me as much as I will enjoy it in my own personal...

1380
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,420
I'd like to go in there.

1381
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,520
Okay, don't leave yet.

1382
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,060
I think it's time to go.

1383
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:06,120
But it is a personal reality into which I will slide right in, much like Dr. Howell's

1384
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,620
wants to be.

1385
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,580
Eating his food tube filled with donut-like paste.

1386
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,700
Just the donut paste.

1387
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,500
You have me.

1388
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,360
Donuts you got.

1389
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,060
In the food tube.

1390
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,780
You don't even eat it fried or cooked?

1391
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,520
No, don't.

1392
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,560
But it is fried.

1393
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,720
It's fried and cooked and baked and...

1394
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,880
And finished and batterized?

1395
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,280
It's everything.

1396
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,440
It's all in one thing.

1397
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,400
It's all one flavor.

1398
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:28,680
All flavor.

1399
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,700
All one true food tube for Dr. Howell.

1400
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,780
Wait, what about the rest of us?

1401
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,820
Oh, and us too.

1402
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:53,940
And so we bid farewell to the Puzzling Evidence Show and this hour of Slack Show.

1403
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,280
Friends, for more information, please see subgenius.com.

1404
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,680
This music in the background during the credits is all from Bonobo's Convergence from their

1405
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,520
album, Who is Chuck Fimp?

1406
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,440
Is that the name of?

1407
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,060
I never heard.

1408
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,700
Well, anyway.

1409
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:16,000
But that's from bonobosmusic.com.

1410
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:25,580
And friends, once again, that's subgenius.com for information on the Church of the Subgenius.

1411
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,580
And now from Lemur.

1412
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,420
The Spice Time Forecast.

1413
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,560
In the western U.S., we find Georgia and North Alabama moving into the southwest.

1414
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:44,680
That'll trigger New Mexico and western Texas in the south northeast for areas farther to the south.

1415
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,540
Meanwhile, Tennessee is moving into Arizona and northern Oregon.

1416
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:53,400
We are looking at some El Paso in Phoenix, generally south of the Albuquerque area,

1417
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,620
as the Pacific comes in from northern and western Arizona.

1418
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:03,040
The Grand Canyon is in around Las Vegas into the Pacific Mississippi Valley as we head into Los Angeles.

1419
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,180
From PR News in Washington, I'm giving up atomic weapons.

1420
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,680
On Wall Street 512-575-643.

1421
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,660
Large clouds of thick black PR news filled the sky.

1422
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,720
A report from the Justice Department's inspector general says PR is bad.

1423
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,340
PR is bad.

1424
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,600
Iran's president insists that his country is arming Shiite militants with sophisticated weapons.

1425
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:26,600


1426
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:26,600


1427
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,580
It's unprecedented�уй but the ground cause is dying out one of the greatest Italians.
