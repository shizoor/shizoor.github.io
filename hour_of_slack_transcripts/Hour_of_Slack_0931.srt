00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,940
Welcome to the subgenius radio hour of slack.

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,460
Here's Bob One for A1 Slacks.

4
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,320
Hi, kids.

5
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:45,640
This is Bob One reminding you that you can buy A1 Slacks at a store near you or in New Jersey, depending on where you live.

6
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,660
Thank you, Bob.

7
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,600
You're welcome, Dad.

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,140
And now, back to our movie.

9
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,740
A1 Slacks

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,740
Do you know that in the world of the insane, you will find a kind of truth more terrifying than fiction?

11
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,120
A truth that shocked you.

12
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:44,820
Come with me into the tormented, haunted, half-lit night of the insane.

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,080
This is my world.

14
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,860
I will lead you into it.

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,360
You may not recognize some things in this world.

16
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,140
And the faces will look strange to you.

17
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,340
For this is a place where there is no love.

18
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:06,980
No hope.

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,120
In the pulsing, throbbing world of the insane mind.

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,920
Where only nightmares are real.

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,120
Nightmares.

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,220
That's our heart.

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,220
Welcome to Babylon, children.

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,320
How are you?

25
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,100
It's great to be here in the belly of the beast tonight.

26
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,740
Before we get started with our second L.A. revival,

27
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,240
if we could all please bow our heads and have a moment of sacred, traditional noise.

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

29
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,720
Little realized, even by leading scientists, there are really two races.

30
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,080
Actually, two distinct species.

31
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,820
Of so-called human beings.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,660
If you gaze upon any given street, normally you might never suspect that only some of these people are true humans.

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,400
Outside appearances offer no clue that among this ordinary-looking crowd, on an ordinary day,

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,280
a certain number of these people are actually sub-geniuses.

35
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,740
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person or that character,

36
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,080
carries the rare sub-genius gene.

37
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,600
But once inside those heads, we would discover a vast new universe.

38
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:37,520
A new dimension, coexisting, not always in harmony, alongside the mundane workaday world of the common human.

39
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,240
Another world, that until now has been forced into hiding.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,800
Now at this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,740
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads against the world.

42
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:50,740


43
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:50,740


44
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,080
We may raise our heads high and declare,

45
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,480
Behold us! For we are the sub-geniuses!

46
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,180
But what is a sub-genius?

47
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:15,500
How can they, we, differ so much from the humans, whose nonsensical laws and customs we have been forced to obey?

48
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,980
Why have so many of us been kept in ignorance of our true heritage?

49
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,320
A heritage that dates back farther than man is thought to have existed.

50
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,260
For in the days of Atlantis, we helped to design the humans.

51
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,240
Certainly, in retrospect, this now seems to have been our greatest mistake.

52
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,180
So, what is the difference?

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,080
Examine this seemingly docile crowd, and know that in some few,

54
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,860
simmering beneath a placid surface, there broils a veritable cauldron,

55
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,680
of repressed sub-genius awareness, ready at any moment to explode outward,

56
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,300
often with catastrophic results.

57
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:07,500
Um, stickers and graffiti were showing up in really strange places, like, um, inside pencil sharpeners and so on.

58
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,340
In some classes, uh, we don't even know who the sub-genius is.

59
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,840
What is all this I hear about this youth cult, this church of the sub-genius?

60
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,480
Gee, uh, I don't know.

61
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,560
Well, how about you, Simon?

62
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,700
Uh, uh, what?

63
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,200
Well, what about you?

64
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,080
It's, it's about Bob, you know? It's Bob.

65
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,580
That's it.

66
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,020
Bob is great.

67
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,980
But, just who is this man, Bob?

68
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,960
Some call him the slack master, the high epopt, the saint of sales.

69
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,900
Others call him liar, pimp, whoremonger,

70
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,860
a sleazy conman,

71
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,980
foisting his dangerous scam off on gullible suckers.

72
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,320
Well, dear friend,

73
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:04,280
J.R. Bob Dobbs isn't some outmoded, overused deity from ancient fairy tales,

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,860
but a living, bleeding deity for today,

75
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,000
the divinely appointed messenger of slack,

76
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,840
the mystic super salesman upon whose wheeling and dealing skills the fate of the universe hinges.

77
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,220
He can sell you anything, and I bought it.

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,000
And I tell you what, that fly will buy that mound of shit from Bob.

79
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,060
Bob's wonderful.

80
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,040
I mean, Bob's, you know, shit.

81
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,800
Anyway, but it has been depressing when there was that sniper that went and broke the first rule of sniper club,

82
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,020
and there was the, well, they cracked down on head shops,

83
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,160
so poor Tommy Chong's website is a terrorist now,

84
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,000
and the smallpox shots, that one was making us conspiracy researcher nuts, very paranoid, you know,

85
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,900
what kind of nanobots did they have in those smallpox shots they were going to give everybody

86
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,000
that would turn your eyes into a tape recorder or whatever?

87
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,140
And people don't even worry!

88
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,700
They don't even think twice!

89
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,580
Oh, it's natural to pee in a jar to prove that you're suitable for your job.

90
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,420
Prathalizer test,

91
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,620
Vodalizer test,

92
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,040
and now, friends,

93
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,020
they've even got a machine that can tell them if you're thinking.

94
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,500
It's called a television,

95
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,860
and when it's off, you're guilty.

96
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,200
Hey, Dan, you're the same ones that were watching King of the Hill.

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,460
All right, Sunday Night Fox, I have to watch that one.

98
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,900
But my friend, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, was saying,

99
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,780
yeah, man, the media, they control everything.

100
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,400
And Rupert Murdoch is one that controls all that.

101
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,320
And they're not into Bob.

102
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,460
That's true.

103
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,260
But I have to say, no, man, no, Rupert Murdoch or whatever famous rich guy's names you might hear,

104
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,640
I don't think those are the puppeteers.

105
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,860
I really don't.

106
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,580
Those are just more of the puppets.

107
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,920
You can't see the puppeteer.

108
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,040
If you see the name of somebody in the newspaper or on TV, that's not one of the puppeteers.

109
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,200
That's just one of the puppets.

110
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,500
Because they have puppets now.

111
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,560
They can operate puppets.

112
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,540
Robots can make robots and puppets that operate puppets.

113
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,580
And you don't know how far down the line of puppets you might be.

114
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,220
I don't see anybody here operating a marionette right now.

115
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Although I was hoping to see those big puppets come down.

116
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,680
Oh, okay.

117
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,160
Those are the guys.

118
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,980
Get down.

119
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,000
The guys running those big puppets up there.

120
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,560
But I guess it's that economic Darwinism thing.

121
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,600
Survival of the richest by those who put the evil in evolution.

122
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,400
And it's ugly and it really is the end time.

123
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,260
But didn't the Bible predict SARS and rumors of SARS?

124
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,000
Actually, SARS does cure hypochondria, as does anthrax.

125
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,040
Which we've probably got quite a bit of that around here.

126
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,060
Not the anthrax, the hypochondria.

127
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,600
That minaret set out a sonata in the 19th century.

128
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:31,640

remember it works both ways.

142

Big Brother is watching you.

Big Brother is watching you.

160
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,380
It's easier to make somebody stop talking about something

161
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,260
than it is to program them to talk about something.

162
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,440
In other words, you could brainwash somebody

163
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,540
with thoughts that are not appropriate.

164
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,340
Why shame them for insulting them.

165
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,600
You could beat them over the head.

166
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,980
You could put them in a good sleeping position.

167
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,880
That sounds too good.

168
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,860
And that doesn't happen all the time.

169
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,220
You didn't have to keep seeing it fixed.

170
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,220


171
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,940
I don't know.

172
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,220

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
I gave up.

178
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,860
who are, let's face it, all five days a week, they're impotent drugs, and it bugs them that

179
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:25,020
they're impotent drugs, just cogs in the machine. But on the weekend, they can become magical

180
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:32,340
beings, or cowboys, you know, where I come from. Real outlaws. Oh yeah, for those two

181
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:40,020
days a week, they're real outlaws. They're not being slaves. It takes five days of being

182
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,840
put down by the normals. Some of them go and compress that into two days of putting down

183
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:52,720
their fellow less pushy weirdos. Now friends, it's not that we look down on the cow manures.

184
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:01,680
It's just that we don't believe in their shit. As Bob said, believe me out of it. We refuse

185
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,440
to be affected by their superstitions.

186
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,180
Do you have our orders?

187
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,020
Yes.

188
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,860
We are to continue our

189
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,120
terror. Tonight, shoot flaming projectiles.

190
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,060
I've fallen, and I can't get up. I've fallen, and I can't get up.

191
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,600
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, get up, get up, get up, get up.

192
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:36,900
If you're looking for a man who loves the outdoors, is a Virgo, and adores cats, give me a call.

193
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

194
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,080
I must lay equal steps back and join the escort club.

195
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,260
You may experience gas with oily discharge, increased bowel movements, an urgent need

196
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,480
to have them, and an inability to control them.

197
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,920
You may experience gas with oily discharge, increased bowel movements, an urgent need

198
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,120
to have them, and an inability to control them.

199
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,820
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, get up, get up, get up, get up.

200
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,820
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

201
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,820
Speaking of cheap legal highs, I think I figured out where they got the BP logo from.

202
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,380
BP?

203
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,600
Yes, BP, the gas station.

204
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:08,840
Yes.

205
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes.

206
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,360
I think I know where they got that funny logo from.

207
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,240
If you huff enough of their gasoline, you see that.

208
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,480
Oh, you figured that out for yourself, did you?

209
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:19,900
Yeah.

210
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,320
Yeah, that's the secret.

211
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,600
It's out now.

212
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,960
Well, I would assume that it's got some hidden Masonic symbolism,

213
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,540
and all logos of all companies have Masonic symbolism hidden in them.

214
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,940
I have a buddy who could figure it out.

215
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,540
He could discern the Masonic symbolism in anything.

216
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,660
Oval, anything round or oval represented the eye that was in the pyramid.

217
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,840
Anything pyramidal, of course.

218
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,100
Anything with an M in it.

219
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,220
Sonic burgers, Masonic.

220
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,480
McDonald's M, so forth.

221
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,380
I said, well, what about squares?

222
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,360
He goes, that's a pyramid seen from above.

223
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,620
Yes.

224
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,420
Pyramid seen from above.

225
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,180
And so if you look around,

226
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,620
you will find that,

227
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,200
seen with discernment,

228
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,260
every logo of every company is, in fact, Masonic.

229
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,100
Circle, triangle, or square.

230
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,380
Yeah.

231
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,880
All three covered right there.

232
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,220
Right.

233
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,160
And ovals with a kind of a bent oval with a circle in it somewhere

234
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,840
is almost going to be a cliché.

235
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,040
You know, it's like the little twisty eye in a pyramid.

236
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,400
A very stylish eye in a pyramid to indicate that they're part of the team.

237
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,300
You know, the world.

238
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,220
Order Illuminati team.

239
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,540
Which I don't think you are.

240
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,200
Me?

241
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,220
No.

242
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,980
I don't really think you're a team player, are you?

243
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,300
Something of a lone wolf, maybe?

244
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,360
Oh, yeah, sure.

245
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:55,900
A loner.

246
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,660
That's what they all say.

247
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,040
That's a polite term for it.

248
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,600
Juvenile delinquent is another term.

249
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,600
Communist is another.

250
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,820
Wacko.

251
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,540
Some genius.

252
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,680
Cannot be taught.

253
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,580
A glut-sherker.

254
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,420
A slack.

255
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:07,820
A slacker.

256
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,260
I'm gonna blow your head off.

257
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,300
That's nice and simple, isn't it?

258
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,520
I'm gonna blow your head off.

259
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,580
That's nice and simple, isn't it?

260
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,680
Hi, I'm SorI.

261
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,820
So, I'll show you a good sm 사건our by concept thingy?

262
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:47,820


263
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:47,900
FOREALLLY 6 return to the bicain.

264
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:47,900


265
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:47,900


266
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,080
YOU MAY NOT MIND

267
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,260
N aquí está.

268
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,860
Hey.

269
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:57,860


270
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,540
TAMARули sí.

271
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,760
¡JÓLE businessman!

272
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,740
What kind of world is this, right?

273
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,120
It's media.

274
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,940
It's all just folded in on itself.

275
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,980
It's like when I pushed that button at the time control lab, I had no...

276
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,000
I should have...

277
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,820
Well, I just...

278
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,400
I should have known.

279
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,980
They told me, don't touch anything.

280
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,740
Don't touch the red button.

281
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,820
Whatever you do, don't touch the shiny, candy-like, jolly button.

282
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,040
And put a subgenius in the room with a button.

283
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,100
Tell him not to push it.

284
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,340
What the hell do you think's going to happen?

285
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,600
You know, well, that's exactly...

286
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,080
How they do their experiments.

287
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,560
It's like that way they...

288
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,340
That way it looks like an accident.

289
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,880
And yet, it's dependable for their purposes.

290
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,620
Put a subgenius in the room with the button.

291
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,520
Whatever the button does, he's going to push it.

292
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,000
Tell him not to.

293
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,360
Oh, by the way, puzzling evidence.

294
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,320
Don't touch that button.

295
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,080
Okay, see you later.

296
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,320
By the way, Phineas Narco, that button over there, don't...

297
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,740
Do me a favor and don't push that.

298
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,440
Oh, you mean this one?

299
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,060
Yeah.

300
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,720
Right, yeah.

301
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,440
It's the old Ren and Stimpy encounter, the history of Rice Button,

302
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,680
and much the same way, classic encounter.

303
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,720
Don't whiz on the electric fence.

304
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,280
The giant, jolly, candy red button.

305
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,220
You had advanced knowledge of 9-11.

306
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,700
Yeah.

307
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,620
You had advanced knowledge of 9-11.

308
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,020
Yeah.

309
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,660
There's time for politics.

310
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,080
And, you know, it's time for politics.

311
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,640
And I...

312
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,960
Political hate.

313
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,560
Pop, pop, pop.

314
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,680
You had advanced knowledge of 9-11.

315
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,180
Yeah.

316
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,240
Political hate.

317
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,460
A-2.

318
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,280
U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct...

319
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,120
were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt.

320
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,820
A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy.

321
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,580
Nuclear arms are a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons.

322
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:39,960
Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview.

323
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,420
You had advanced knowledge of 9-11.

324
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:43,900
Yeah.

325
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,460
You're on the air.

326
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,840
Kill them all.

327
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,060
Let Bob salt and pepper them.

328
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,340
Yeah.

329
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,720
That's right.

330
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,060
Hey, you think Bob could give somebody eternal life?

331
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,560
Who's Bob?

332
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:01,900
He's still here.

333
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,140
Hello?

334
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,740
Hello?

335
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,380
Pardon me?

336
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,640
Hello?

337
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,320
Yeah.

338
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,200
I guess it was the Soviet-Armenian guy who disappeared.

339
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,340
Huh.

340
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:09,820
Hmm.

341
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,560
Just as long as he's not being watched.

342
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,780
The aliens in the FBI will only allow so many people on at once.

343
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,520
That's right.

344
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,600
Oh, they won't?

345
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,960
Yeah, there's an actual quota.

346
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,040
There's no more than three callers at one time because that confuses the parallax.

347
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,660
Yeah.

348
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,460
That brings the event horizon closer.

349
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,360
They want to keep on playing with the event horizon.

350
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,500
They ship it.

351
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,180
We're a little...

352
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,160
We're a little baby dog.

353
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,340
But just a minute ago, I kept trying to switch from one time machine to the other so that

354
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,680
they wouldn't be able to track us and some more people could call in, but apparently

355
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,980
we had the wrong power adapter for the time device.

356
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,840
They can trace those signals faster than ever these days.

357
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,680
They've got time machines too, you know.

358
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,400
Who do?

359
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,700
My problem is that this particular one is kind of one way, so it's hard for me to see

360
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,060
people in your time.

361
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,500
Although you can see me okay.

362
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,500
Right.

363
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,120
When we get all trans-temporal and so forth, why can't we go sideways?

364
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,500
I look a slither like a snake through other mythological times that, you know, don't necessarily

365
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,160
run concurrently back and fro.

366
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,520
But Dave, I wish I was at liberty to go here more.

367
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,680
I really do.

368
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,840
Like a different dimension?

369
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,520
Mm-hmm.

370
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,520
Yeah.

371
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:24,860
Yeah.

372
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,280
You can see the world in which Rome actually was founded by a pair of twins who were suckled

373
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
by the she-wolf.

374
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:30,860
Yeah.

375
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,200
And you can get down and grab some of that titty yourself if you wanted.

376
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:41,160
According to science, everything that could happen already has and will forever, and every

377
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,580
sci-fi story is true.

378
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,460
Yeah.

379
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,280
It's absolutely true.

380
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,560
But, you know, that is so broad that it just cheapens the whole thing, and you're really

381
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,660
back to where you started.

382
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,560
Yeah, I mean...

383
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,620
There's just this planet, and sure, great, so there's all these alternate universes,

384
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,840
but, uh...

385
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,980
You know, I'm stuck in this one.

386
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,440
Right.

387
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,440
You open your book in third grade, and it says,

388
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,260
Right.

389
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,600
Yeah.

390
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,760
You can't get hung up on which time stream you've been trapped in.

391
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,320
Yeah.

392
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,340
Time machine lag.

393
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,540
In this time...

394
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,240
In another time period, could we...

395
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,260
Could certain, like, world leaders be still alive?

396
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,840
Possibly.

397
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:25,980
Yeah.

398
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,200
They saved Nixon's brain.

399
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,040
Yeah.

400
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,440
And used it as a footstool.

401
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,100
I mean, a door jam.

402
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:42,940
You know, Bob Dobbs actually did save Hitler's brain, in that after he throttled Hitler,

403
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,200
he cut his brain out and had it frozen.

404
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,700
He froze Hitler's brain.

405
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,500
Hitler's brain probably cannot be brought back to life, but it is frozen.

406
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,940
So that was the only way he could save Hitler?

407
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,860
No, it's just more like a table decoration.

408
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,260
Don't just say that.

409
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,660
Yeah, it's like a...

410
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,480
It's like, uh...

411
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,140
You know, something Bob takes out of the freezer every now and then to show off at parties.

412
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,460
Oh, here's Hitler's brain.

413
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,440
I cut his brain out.

414
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:07,820
The best.

415
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,800
A couple laughs back in the old fucking...

416
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,720
Oh, Jesus.

417
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,040
That's okay.

418
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,380
We're in safe harbor.

419
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,420
Oh, phew.

420
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,420
Yeah.

421
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,720
I thought we were well out to sea, my friend.

422
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,260
Perhaps even farther than we could get.

423
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,700
As long as these problems are not solved,

424
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,860
so long as ignorance and poverty remain on Earth,

425
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,120
these words cannot be useless.

426
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,740
In weariness, in agony,

427
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,660
under the whip, under the chain,

428
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,220
in the cell, on the convict's bed of plank,

429
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,660
under the burning sun of the galleys,

430
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,720
what had been the life of this soul?

431
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,960
Society should look into these things.

432
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,740
Ignorance and poverty.

433
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,180
Ignorance and poverty.

434
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,780
Ignorance, ignorance, ignorance, ignorance, ignorance, ignorance,

435
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,920
ignorance, ignorance.

436
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,180
Ignorance.

437
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,680
Oh, wow.

438
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,540
Are these internet kids listening?

439
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,200
I don't know.

440
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,660
I don't know either.

441
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,860
Well, I have this sort of...

442
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,400
I'm recording and internetting and all kinds of stuff.

443
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm like hooked up to the Matrix.

444
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,920
No, wait.

445
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
I'm escaping the...

446
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,680
No, wait.

447
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,140
Damn.

448
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,380
It's like the more you know about the Matrix,

449
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,420
really, the more enmeshed in it you are.

450
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,560
Are you jacking in or are you jacking out?

451
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,920
Or are you jacking on or are you jacking off?

452
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,060
What?

453
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,260
What?

454
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


455
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


456
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


457
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


458
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


459
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


460
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


461
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


462
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


463
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


464
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


465
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


466
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


467
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,260


468
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,340
Plug yourself into the jack.

469
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Everybody jacks in.

470
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,940
Or jacks on, I mean.

471
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,820
I look out my window

472
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,340
And I see

473
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,860
A lot of pretty, pretty faces

474
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,280
I wake at a cutie

475
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,740
On the street

476
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,500
And she flips me the bird

477
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,240
Why does everybody

478
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,900
Poke fun

479
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,080
When I'm sitting in the tube?

480
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,700
And why does everyone laugh at me

481
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,040
When I drool?

482
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,960
And this little voice

483
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,860
Keeps ringing in my head

484
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,760
Kill yourself

485
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
Kill your mom

486
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,340
Kill your father

487
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,880
Kill a nun

488
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,420
Kill a priest

489
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,940
Kill a rat

490
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,240
Kill a rat

491
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,240


492
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,240


493
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,240


494
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,420
Kill a rabbi

495
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,440
I look out my window

496
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,120
What a surprise

497
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,620
A little birdie

498
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,340
Before my eyes

499
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,520
Flying around

500
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,740
And singing his tune

501
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,520
Now it's such a beautiful afternoon

502
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,020
So I go to the pub with all me lads

503
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,900
Just drinking some pints and pissing about

504
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,400
Why does everyone laugh at me

505
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,400
When I wet my trousers?

506
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,240
When I wet my trousers?

507
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,240


508
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,320
When I wet my pants?

509
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320


510
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320


511
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320


512
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320


513
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320


514
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320


515
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320


516
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,320


517
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520
And this little voice

518
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,300
Keeps ringing in my head

519
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,200
I am death

520
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,900
Feel my pain

521
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,600
Satan worships me

522
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,120
Metallica sucks

523
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,720
Soda slayer

524
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,980
Compared to the lounge pips

525
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,820
I get who the orphan is

526
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,340
See the kitties

527
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,500
How they frolic

528
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,460
They laugh and play

529
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,740
But I'm still drunk

530
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,380
From all my beers

531
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,680
Hey!

532
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,240
I'm the Pigeons

533
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,240


534
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,240


535
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,240


536
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,240


537
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,960
Why are they laughing at me?

538
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,660
I wouldn't mock me if I were you!

539
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,140
Then would you fucking go for you now?

540
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,900
I shoot off the kneecaps of everyone.

541
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,940
Then I shoot the roof of my mouth.

542
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,020
And this little voice keeps ringing in my head.

543
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,740
Thank you.

544
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,120
I am dead.

545
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,640
I am free.

546
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,520
Satan worships me.

547
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,180
I'm so happy.

548
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,700
Never been so happy.

549
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,020
Oh my God.

550
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,480
I've got this subgenius chat line open on my little screen in front of me.

551
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,460
And this, uh, one of our fellow radio popes in another state said,

552
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,060
Does anyone have this problem?

553
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,100
They can't kill themselves because it would kill their mom.

554
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,200
So secretly, they wish their mom would hurry up and die.

555
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,240
But this just makes them feel more guilty and depressed.

556
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,260
Oh, wow.

557
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,940
That's great.

558
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:37,860
Yeah.

559
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,020
That's fantastic.

560
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,880
That's...

561
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,300
Oh, you can substitute wife in some cases.

562
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,840
You can substitute...

563
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,580
It would read like this.

564
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,880
They can't kill themselves because it would kill their wife.

565
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,620
So secretly, they wish their wife would hurry up and die.

566
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,860
But this just makes them feel more...

567
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,080
They can't kill themselves because it would kill their boss.

568
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,180
So secretly, they wish their boss would hurry up and die.

569
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,220
And this just makes them feel more...

570
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,900
They can't kill themselves because it would kill their boss.

571
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,540
Well, everybody should feel that way.

572
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,580
They can't kill themselves because it would kill Bob.

573
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,180
So secretly, they wish Bob would hurry up and die.

574
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,700
That's right.

575
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,340
Bob, what just happened?

576
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,160
I can't hear you.

577
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,180
Bob, can you hear me?

578
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,760
Bob?

579
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,560
Bob, can you hear me?

580
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,620
Bob, pick up the phone.

581
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,540
Somebody pick up the phone.

582
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,780
Bob, can you hear me?

583
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,060
Whoever's there, just pick up the phone.

584
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,100
Bob?

585
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,840
Can anyone hear me?

586
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,260
Just pick up the phone.

587
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,740
Pick up the phone.

588
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,000
I have to beep. Leave a message for Bob.

589
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,180
Back in 1996, the CIA worked in tandem with Pakistan to create the Taliban.

590
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,720
The New World Order is run by absolutely ruthless individuals

591
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,960
hell-bent on dehumanizing the entire human community.

592
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,320
Obsessed with total control,

593
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,760
these megalomaniacal Satanists are absolutely sworn

594
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,000
to the creation of a worldwide tyranny

595
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,960
called the New World Order.

596
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,360
This is the evidence.

597
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,200
And it is...

598
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,740
The most conclusive.

599
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,900
9-1-1.

600
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,080
The road to tyranny.

601
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,540
Let us tolerate outrageous conspiracy.

602
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,780
Malicious lies.

603
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,960
September the 11th.

604
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,840
September the 11th.

605
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,500
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

606
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,300
Instruments of evil. Instruments of evil.

607
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,780
Cult of evil. Cult of evil.

608
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,440
Human suffering. Human suffering.

609
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,740
The worst kind of violence. The worst kind of violence.

610
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,960
Pure malice while daring to claim the authority of God.

611
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,820
Designs and power of evil.

612
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,000
Evil has found a willing servant.

613
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,960
The Bush and Bin Laden family connection.

614
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,460
Goes back over half a century.

615
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,920
And by the 1970s, George Bush Jr. as well as Osama Bin Laden and his big brother

616
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,660
were already vacationing together.

617
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,520
Owning airports as well as oil companies together.

618
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,320
Even before September 11th, the Wall Street Journal had called for the Bush family

619
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,080
to end their relationship with the Bin Ladens.

620
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,060
Then of course there's the Carlyle Group, the biggest defense contractor on the planet.

621
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,900
And guess who the majority owners are?

622
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,860
The Bush family and the Bin Ladens.

623
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,080
They could profit in the hundreds of billions off of this new war.

624
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,200
Now you begin to understand what's fueling these wars.

625
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,900
It's criminal activities.

626
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,260
Money and power.

627
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,100
My friends, the government just didn't have prior knowledge of September 11th Al-Qaeda attacks.

628
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,320
They actually funded, trained, protected, coddled, shepherded Al-Qaeda into this country.

629
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,060
Trained many of the terrorists at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, USA.

630
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,800
Threatened FBI and Defense Intelligence officers who tried to stop Al-Qaeda.

631
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,040
Threatened them with arrest.

632
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,160
Bush signed, now public document, W1999.

633
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,860
Two months before September 11th.

634
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,620
Threatening them with arrest if they tried to stop Al-Qaeda.

635
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,920
This is completely fake, ladies and gentlemen.

636
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,440
It's absolutely fake and you know it.

637
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,820
This is a fake psychological warfare program against you.

638
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,780
Psychological warfare.

639
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,940
Attention, attention, attention.

640
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,640
American forces are here to help.

641
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,260
Remain calm.

642
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,360
We will not tolerate civil disobedience.

643
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,400
Attention, attention, attention.

644
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,400
American forces are here to help.

645
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,380
Remain calm.

646
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,360
We will not tolerate civil disobedience.

647
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,260
You're on the air.

648
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,900
Oh, 6873515, you're on the air.

649
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,760
Yes.

650
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

651
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,660
God, I'm so confused.

652
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,100
Yeah, where are you?

653
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,440
Oh, you.

654
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,680
That's right.

655
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,700
Over in the time control, you wanted to know about weird stuff.

656
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,400
Yeah.

657
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,040
Tell me some weird stuff.

658
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,300
Well, you know, I was going to say the weird thing is nothing.

659
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,860
Nothing weird has ever happened to me.

660
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,360
Well, you know, nothing is weird for real.

661
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,540
Like when you're really weird, nothing is weird.

662
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,380
You know, including yourself.

663
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,460
Well, I'll tell you how weird it's been in terms of being denied weirdness.

664
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,340
Really?

665
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:20,120
Yeah, there was a time in the day of 1975 when I lived in a trailer court on an Indian reservation,

666
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,540
the Rosebud Lakota Reservation.

667
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,280
Actually, between the town of Michigan and the town of Michigan.

668
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,600
And I was in the town of Michigan and Rosebud, way out in the middle of the prairie by the highway.

669
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:39,280
And one night during terrible cold weather, just like this, but in this, you know, tiny little sparsely populated area,

670
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:50,740
there was a classic UFO that was seen by everyone at the trailer court that night hovering over the pond across the highway,

671
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,100
doing its classic little silent dance.

672
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,620
And then zipping up into the sky so fast that it seemed to disappear.

673
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,440
Now, I was out gathering wood when all this happened.

674
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:11,240
And after it happened, the trailer court fellows and came down and said,

675
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,540
Wow, what did you think of that?

676
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I said, What?

677
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,180
Because I had not seen anything.

678
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,460
I went out and got the wood and carried it in.

679
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,920
And my friend Lorenzo Black Lance said,

680
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,260
Let's get on a horseback.

681
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,560
He was like Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters of the Third Party.

682
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,400
Was that his real name?

683
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,420
Was that a real name?

684
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,360
Yes, that was his name.

685
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,440
His legal conspiracy name?

686
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,000
Huh?

687
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,740
His legal conspiracy name?

688
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,280
Yes.

689
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:39,880
Wow.

690
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,240
Yes.

691
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,940
That's a great name.

692
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,240
Yeah.

693
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:51,320
You know, Native Americans often have interesting names that involve verbs and adjectives and nouns and stuff.

694
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:51,820
Yeah.

695
00:33:52,460 --> 00:34:00,540
The brothers, the famous Fancy Dance Brothers, her many horses, also witnessed this thing.

696
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,120
Anyway, Lorenzo was obsessed.

697
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,360
He'd seen this thing and none of them could believe that I hadn't seen it.

698
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,600
In fact, they all kind of looked at each other and kind of like, Whoa, what's with this guy?

699
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,480
Maybe we better not tell him.

700
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,220
But as it was, Lorenzo was so excited.

701
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,360
He wanted to get on horseback and he wanted me to go with him.

702
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:32,820
So I spent like the rest of the evening on horseback with this guy named Lorenzo Black Lance.

703
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:40,440
I remember sitting on the horse atop this hill at 3 in the morning in this freezing cold weather thinking to myself,

704
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:46,620
I'm on a horse with an Indian looking for UFOs in the middle of the night.

705
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,200
And of course, I later went to the hospital.

706
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:59,100
I went on to work for the Subgenius Foundation and J.R. Bob Dobbs, eventually working my way up from janitor to sacred scribe.

707
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,440
Now that's a true American success story right there.

708
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,920
Well, it's a glory hole barrel story actually, but I won't go into that.

709
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,380
Enough people did, so to speak.

710
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,320
Several bodies are still missing.

711
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:19,300
Now, please close your eyes and see yourself looking powerful and confident.

712
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:25,940
By the way, for those of you who have a challenge with visualizing, just imagine you're visualizing.

713
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,600
Stop imagining it.

714
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,740
What color is your car?

715
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,000
Close your eyes.

716
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,620
Now let's go back to that image of you looking powerful and confident and in control.

717
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,100
Hey, you want to be with me, honey?

718
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,700
Great.

719
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,500
If not, get the heck out of the way.

720
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,320
That's right.

721
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,840
Feels better already, doesn't it?

722
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,300
Now, feel even better.

723
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,580
Better about it.

724
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,500
Now watch this.

725
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,180
Away from your face.

726
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,280
And notice.

727
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,480
Gets laid back.

728
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,700
Feel laid back.

729
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,520
Being laid back.

730
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,280
Your mind is a key to being laid.

731
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,940
Powerful and confident.

732
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,700
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

733
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,820
No big deal.

734
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,160
Plenty of fish in the bar.

735
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,200
Hmm? Hmm?

736
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,620
Oh well. Oh well. Oh well.

737
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,360
Her laws.

738
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,380
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

739
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,600
No, no.

740
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,620
That's not possible.

741
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,640
Lie on a couch for years and cry about your childhood and leave you broke, leave you broke, leave you broke.

742
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,480
At fast. At fast.

743
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,800
Bang for the buck.

744
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,620
Hey, guess what?

745
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,120
It doesn't have to hurt.

746
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,660
And just for a second.

747
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,380
And look down at the world with those 40-foot tall eyes.

748
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,540
Really getting it on like crazy.

749
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,220
Big.

750
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:33,880
And now.

751
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,580
Hmm.

752
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,040
Ah.

753
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,360
Hmm.

754
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,340
Several bodies are still missing.

755
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,320
Now this.

756
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:41,960
Ah.

757
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,160
Ah.

758
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,260
Let's go for it.

759
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,620
Listening to a dumb take on the world.

760
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


761
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


762
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


763
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


764
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


765
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


766
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


767
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


768
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


769
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


770
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:47,620


771
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,940
Listening to a dumb take.

772
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,500
Gosh.

773
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,140
You know what?

774
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,000
I kind of think so.

775
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,720
Ah.

776
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,700
Ah.

777
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,080
A little bit short.

778
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,360
Close your eyes.

779
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,580
Step two.

780
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,680
Step two.

781
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,880
And you're rocking down on top of yourself.

782
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,480
Six.

783
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,120
Six.

784
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,600
Six.

785
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,220
Ah.

786
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,760
Look at that.

787
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,500
Ah.

788
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,860
Look at that.

789
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,280
I'm going to have that.

790
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,140
I'm going to try that.

791
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:08,540
No.

792
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:08,620
Okay.

793
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,220
I'll go with this.

794
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,840
And over the period of several, several years, what I've done is develop my own system of

795
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,620
understanding the ingredients of what makes sex fun.

796
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:17,620


797
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,120
And how to create a win-win sexual relationship with somebody.

798
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:27,180
Win-win sex life so that you're always getting what you need and your partner always gets

799
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,840
what they need.

800
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,580
So much of the time, sexual relationships tend to be one-sided.

801
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,540
One person's getting what they want, they're getting off, and the other person's not.

802
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,480
And quite commonly, the guy gets off and the woman wonders, gee, weren't we going to have

803
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:41,700
sex?

804
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,480
And part of this is based upon statistics.

805
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:52,740
Statistics. Statistics are, and biological differences, one of the major biological sexual differences between men and women,

806
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,480
is that men need about two or three minutes to have an orgasm, a stimulation.

807
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:05,960
Women need 18 to 20 minutes of stimulation to have an orgasm.

808
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,300
Several bodies are still missing. Now this.

809
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,760
The young don't register to vote.

810
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,820
Some 84.3% of the people believe that political parties do not represent their interests,

811
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:25,020
and a greater number say they are content not to participate in any way in the conduct of the nation.

812
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,840
This is a phenomenon of the Western world, it appears.

813
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:34,880
Young people have no interest in fossilized political schemes dragged over from the 19th century.

814
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:40,040
They are preoccupied with living well and prolonging their teenage years as long as possible.

815
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,460
Let's say until about 40 or 50.

816
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:48,720
Call us, call the synesthesia. He wants to hear about your weird stories.

817
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:55,140
And like I say, in my case, the weird thing is, even though I've actually written books about weirdness,

818
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:01,100
it never happens to me. It's like the closer you get to Bob, the further he goes away.

819
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,560
It's just like that. You go looking for Bigfoot, oh, you'll meet all the Bigfoot kooks.

820
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,120
Yes.

821
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,280
You'll meet a lot. If we get into the new age and paranormal, investigating the paranormal,

822
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,180
I'll tell you what you'll find. A lot of really interesting people.

823
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,220
Oh, jeez.

824
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,680
And soon you'll become one. You too.

825
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,000
That's dangerous.

826
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,680
Dr. Sinister would eventually become interesting.

827
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,380
No way.

828
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,460
Yeah, that could happen. Even you, the listener, could someday become interesting.

829
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:35,360
If you have the stomach to be a real, well, to take on the name of kook.

830
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,540
The proud name of a kook, a crank, a crackpot.

831
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,160
That's me.

832
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,000
Let's get a 7-3 from Novel 5. We're going to take another call here.

833
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,940
A big crank, but not a little cocky.

834
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,820
Oh, no.

835
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,980
To quote St. Byron Warner.

836
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,320
Cowards, they hung up.

837
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,860
Hello? Hello?

838
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,040
Oh, God. Disconnected again.

839
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,820
Friends? Oh, what a show.

840
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,840
I'm going to do this like Susie the Floozy does her credits all at the very end.

841
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,820
Starting with the very beginning.

842
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,400
And you heard it.

843
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,900
Yes, that was the Firesign Theater doing Bob Slack.

844
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,800
At the very, very top of the show.

845
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,260
And it was, in fact, Ed McMahon.

846
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,900
From the introduction to a horrible, wonderful, bad film called Delirium.

847
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,520
Thanks to I, Doctor, Mr. Sister.

848
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,540
Friends, we heard Dr. Howell Robbins narrating and the music of D.K. Jones.

849
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,200
That goes with the subgenius movie Arise.

850
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,420
Which is now out on DVD, finally.

851
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:47,380
It's been on VHS for years, but it's Arise on DVD.

852
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,460
The soundtrack is free on alt-binary Slack.

853
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,740
Ooh, Sheldon Allman did the song Big Brother.

854
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:05,860
And we heard the voice of Phineas Narcos sometimes on Radio Synesthesia.

855
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,360
Which is hosted by Dr. Sinister on WCSB Cleveland.

856
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,320
With call.

857
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,720
Yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

858
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,480
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

859
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:26,140
That song, the crazy guy song by the British accent people was The Lounge Pimps.

860
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:33,800
And our songs are offered up on alt-binary Slack often by Reverend Blackout,

861
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,500
New Monet, Dead Horse, Neuromanson, and so many others.

862
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,200
Friends, if you need more information, check out...

863
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,840
www.subgenius.com

864
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:51,980
The music in the background is called Trick Bag from Truth Squad's album Super Killer.

865
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,460
Truth Squad featuring Reverend Jimmy Ryan on lead guitar.

866
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,020
And friends, all of the collages in this show, the incredible collages with other killer guitar,

867
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,900
were by Reverend Norell Preff.

868
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,000
And you can hear more of his collages and killers.

869
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,500
And you can find more guitar at heavyconfetti.com.

870
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:25,040
Friends, this is the Subgenius Radio Hour of Slack number 931 about the conspiracy.

871
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,820
A special thanks to Dr. Sinister for letting us use his show.

872
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,480
And we're about to come back and use it some more, I'm sure.

873
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,780
And yes, praise, praise Bob.

874
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,480
What?

875
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,080
Tell me about those old nasty hags and how, like, you get...

876
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,280
Tell me about your...

877
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,100
You know, actually, I hardly knew my grandparents.

878
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,480
They were all far away when I was growing up.

879
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,360
Okay, nothing personal.

880
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,440
No.

881
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:00,160
No, it was Nunu that introduced me to the ways of the deep, deep wrinkles

882
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,360
and the musty oldness of the ancient, ancient, ancient folds and crevices.

883
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,020
I'm sure there are some people who would view it as a religious experience

884
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:19,820
to see the ancient hallowed halls of some ancient, old, wise matriarch.

885
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,100
I'm sure there's probably some weirdo out there who's got that fixation.

886
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,820
Oh, actually, there's a very interesting news group that people like me look at,

887
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:36,540
you know, for medical reasons, called Alt Binaries Erotic Senior Citizens.

888
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,400
Senior Dash Citizens.

889
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,480
Oh.

890
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:39,580
Oh.

891
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:39,740
Oh.

892
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,000
Oh.

893
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000


894
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000


895
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000


896
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000


897
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000


898
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000


899
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000


900
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000


901
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,380
Oh.

902
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,280
Oh.

903
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:53,300
Oh.

904
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:53,340
Oh.

905
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:53,880
Oh.

906
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:54,840
Oh.

907
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,520
Oh.

908
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,320
Oh.

909
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,600
Oh.

910
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,040
Oh.

911
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,720
Oh.

912
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,880
Oh.

913
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:03,940
Oh.

914
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,140
Oh.

915
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,560
Got to wonder where those pictures are taken.

916
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,620
They're taken from that house you just drove by off the side of the road.

917
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,260
Oh, yeah.

918
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,240
Those boring houses full of those boring people that you think live such boring lives.

919
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:27,420
They're the swingers that are, you know, photographing each other and then meeting up after they, you know, post their hot photos on the Internet.

920
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,100
The kind of house that looks like from Night of the Living Dead, you know.

921
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,980
Out in the field somewhere.

922
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:33,480
Yeah.

923
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,060
I'm just a lurker.

924
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,740
I just look at that stuff and go, wow.

925
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:36,880
Wow.

926
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:46,820
Somewhere in some trailer court, there's that slutty, filthy, dirty, buck-toothed babe just waiting for a nervous fellow like me.

927
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,020
That's the lure of porno, you know.

928
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,880
It just takes over.

929
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,800
Pretty soon, it just takes over your whole mind.

930
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,200
You're nothing but one big, raw, throbbing, abused brain cell.

931
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,600
I'm not speaking personally from any experience.

932
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,620
This is just what I read from Kraft Ebbing and so forth.

933
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,740
Yes, of purely medical reasons.

934
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:17,820
Yeah, I've read, I actually have read a lot of stuff about pervs and so forth.

935
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,860
And I just find that stuff.

936
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,280
You know, I used to be interested in religion.

937
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,560
And it's just an extension of the same drive, I'm sure.

938
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,440
Just more basic.

939
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,680
Bob moved into the sex industry, you know, at a certain key point.

940
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,020
And, of course, that was when I was born.

941
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:36,600
The industry has been.

942
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,720
Oddly enough, that was when that Senate subcommittee was fired up.

943
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,840
We've been tied up in litigation ever since.

944
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,480
Wow.

945
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:51,160
People get weirded out when Bob starts talking about sex with really old people.

946
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:57,820
But, you know, AIDS is spreading faster among the elderly now than any other age, any other group.

947
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,020
Really?

948
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:04,360
Yeah, because, you know, when you're retired, you don't, what else do you have to do?

949
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,520
And you're in one of those homes full of people.

950
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,160
You're in your own age.

951
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,080
And they're all sitting around listening to Woodstock records and smoking medical marijuana.

952
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,560
What do you think they're going to do?

953
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,980
The same thing they did in 1972.

954
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,980
Only now it's dreadful, deadly diseases instead of dreadful, you know, harmful diseases.

955
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,920
So it's a bummer, man.

956
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,080
Bob said it was going to be a bummer.

957
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,720
And of all his predictions, wouldn't that be the one to come true?

958
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,240
A bummer and a comer.

959
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,260
Yeah.

960
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:36,380
Yeah.

961
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,520
It's going to be a bummer.

962
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,940
That's a new way.

963
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,680
But we do have a lot of new ways.

964
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,600
There is, you know, the subgenius must, you know, quit, get a second job.

965
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,120
We changed it from quit your job to get a second job.

966
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,880
Must give slack instead of get slack and so forth.

967
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,960
It's going to be a bummer.

968
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,660
Would be a good bumper sticker for me.

969
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,820
Well, what are some good slackful jobs?

970
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,740
Is there is that an oxymoron?

971
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:17,960
I think what you need to do is find a kind hearted woman with a good job and pray.

972
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,720
Yeah, Bob.

973
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,640
I these United.

974
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,480
Yeah, but I have a deficit.

975
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,900
I've got a deficit to that.

976
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,680
Yeah, but I have a deficit.

977
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,080
I've got a deficit to that.

978
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,380
Yeah, but I have to serve.

979
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,400
Yeah, but I have to do that.

980
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,980
Yeah, but I have to do that.

981
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,540
Yeah, but I have to do that.

982
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,340
Economic ills.

983
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,920
The economic ills.

984
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,240
Yeah.

985
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:44,760
In this present crisis, in this crisis, the idea we we we we will go away, we'll go away, we'll go away.

986
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,480
We'll go away.

987
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,820
The flicker flicker flicker.

988
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,360

Yeah, but I suffer that suffer.

992
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,680
We suffer.

We suffer economic economic economic economic decisions.

994
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,420

Misery.

Misery.

1001
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,260
Misery.

He laughs he laughs he laughs.

You can believe it.

The Yeti have taken vengeance into their own hands.

And you're tuned to the Central Mosque in North London.

1073
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:40,240
A new report on the sexual abuse of Colin Powell says children in developing countries promote or hide the true extent of Colin Powell in Athens with $5 billion after surrendering to kill themselves.

1074
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,860
A terminally ill British man has died.

1075
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,340
Now he's dead.

1076
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,120
Oh, yes, dear friend.

1077
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:02,220
That little last bit was by Reverend Fernandin Andy Lemur.
