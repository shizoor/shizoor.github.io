1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:16,640
No. No, stay where you are. For this is a time of slack. This is the Slack Hour.

2
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,760
This is the Slack Hour.

3
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,780
This is the Slack Hour.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,840
I've invited Reverend Susie the Flusie of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse on WREK Atlanta and Reverend Fox of Hypercube, respectively, into joining me for a special show with no audience.

5
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:54,060
And it's kind of a nice glimpse of a really informal subgenius conversation. In other words, a real nerd out with three experts in bulldada.

6
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,160
The scene is the Wisteria Campground Cafe, called Caffeina's.

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,700
In the wilds of Southern Ohio.

8
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,700
Well, Susie, has everything turned off?

9
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,900
It's so sad.

10
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,560
I was about to do a show.

11
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,200
I was going to sit here and do a show.

12
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,820
And everything's been turned off, except for my little microphones here.

13
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,240
I could even put background music on.

14
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
I can put you on.

15
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,680
I can put a big old jock strap on.

16
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
Let's see.

17
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,240
Test, test.

18
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,220
Ah, yes, dear friends.

19
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,780
It's just me and Susie sitting here.

20
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,700
Doing nothing.

21
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,660
No show, no nothing.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,900
It's a secret show.

23
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,960
Not a single.

24
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,520
It is.

25
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,260
Even we don't know we're doing it.

26
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,380
Not a, there's literally no audience.

27
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,300
There are people in the cafe, but they're all talking and doing things.

28
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,100
Lollygagging.

29
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,600
And the speakers aren't on, so nobody even notices us up here.

30
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Loggy-gawling.

31
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:27,920
And no one reads the schedule, which says that there's a live hour of slack from 4.30 to 5.30.

32
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,680
Yeah.

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,960
Or is it already 5.30?

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,960
Is that the problem?

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,620
That's what it is.

36
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,400
Maybe it depends on your version of live.

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,180
Yeah.

38
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,020
Dr. Howell, Susie, and I are up here doing the invisible show.

39
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,740
Yeah.

40
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,580
It is 5.35.

41
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,160
Right.

42
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,080
Well, we're officially off.

43
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:55,240
That's why we're on, because they told us to stop, and yet we're subgeniuses.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,720
That's what we do.

45
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,560
We're contrarians.

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:58,840
We're friends.

47
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,840
And Reverend Fox, if you want to be on the show for a while, you can.

48
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,420
I can?

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,580
Yeah, sure.

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
We're, since no one wants us to do a show, we decided to do a show.

51
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,520
I'm smelling something.

52
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,460
Pull up a chair.

53
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,180
Thank you.

54
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,000
The terrible odor of death.

55
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,820
Oh, that's me.

56
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,720
No, I'm smelling like some rotted animal carcass.

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,240
Oh, no, that's me.

58
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,760
Yeah, I've been smelling that over in this, if you stand around over there, and it's getting

59
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,180
worse.

60
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,100
There is the smell of a rotting animal carcass.

61
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,860
Something died.

62
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,660
I thought I heard something.

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,360
I thought it was a mouse, you know, under the stage or something, in which case it'll

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,140
be gone soon.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,060
It may have been that damn dogs, because he didn't show up yesterday, and that's all I

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,260
know.

67
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,480
Well, and then there was that one asshole subgenius that somebody might have killed

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,960
him and just got, oh, you know, Reverend Asshole.

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,020
There's always one.

70
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,400
Was it Bishop Sphincter?

71
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,020
Bishop Sphincter?

72
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,160
No.

73
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,900
Bishop Bastard, Reverend Asshole.

74
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,340
No, no, I'm not being personal.

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,520
I'm just talking in generics.

76
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,160
There's always a generic Reverend Asshole.

77
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,520
There's always a generic Reverend Asshole.

78
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,940
There's always one guy who ruins it.

79
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Who ruins it?

80
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,380
I thought that was chicken.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,360
One guy.

82
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,580
Oh, thank you.

83
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,560
Thank you for my This Island Earth answer.

84
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,860
I had very bad luck with that.

85
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,120
Let's see.

86
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,600
This checkout islanders.

87
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,380
Now, Dr. Howell, don't talk to us unless you're on a microphone.

88
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,120
We're doing a show.

89
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,780
Don't talk to us unless you're on a microphone.

90
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,880
You can come sit in my lap.

91
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,440
Now, Dr. Howell.

92
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
Hal is a heckler.

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,180
If you're not on the mic, you're just heckling us.

94
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,020
We got up here and started talking because we had no audience.

95
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
The sound isn't on.

96
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,620
The speakers aren't on.

97
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,100
We're doing this for ourselves.

98
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,080
I don't go down to your street corner and screw around with your pencils, mister.

99
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:52,480
So, well, see, now that we have an audience of Dr. Hal, I'm all tongue-tied and nervous.

100
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,320
Oh, they'll hear us, unfortunately.

101
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,320
We have a blaze.

102
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't hear you.

103
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,680
Is that thing on?

104
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,400
You're yelling to it.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,200
Oh!

106
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,420
I'm not getting it.

107
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,140
Oh, now I am.

108
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,840
This is very old, and it's a little glitchy like some people.

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,720
Wow, that was a new model I couldn't afford to get.

111
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,320
Back in 19 and...

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,620
45 degrees to the right.

113
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,200
Increase power sevenfold.

114
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,060
19.

115
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,120
95.

116
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,040
Adjust your antennas.

117
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm taxed.

118
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,560
To frequency 282.73.

119
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,560
Recording.

120
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,100
Everything's going fine.

121
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,000
No trouble.

122
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,920
We can't talk to you because we're not on the speakers and you're not on a microphone, Reverend Fight-Seek-Taj.

123
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,380
So...

124
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,660
And I see...

125
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,600
We're closed off.

126
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,260
Yeah, this is a closed off show.

127
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,420
There's a virtual force field.

128
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,300
There's an iron curtain of silence.

129
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,200
...has descended upon the sound waves.

130
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,600
Because I have headphones on, I can't hear anyone unless they're on the microphone.

131
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,360
Wow.

132
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,700
And that's...

133
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,480
We might not even actually be there.

134
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,240
This is probably the first time you could actually hear me then.

135
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,460
This is going to be much easier.

136
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,980
He might be just a-sporting with us.

137
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,620
I won't have to scream nearly as much.

138
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,940
I could put background music on, but I'd be the only one who heard it.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,420
Right.

140
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,520
And it would be porno music.

141
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,820
We'd be saying like really meaningful stuff.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,560
It would just be porno.

143
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,200
I forgot to bring up porno music.

144
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,440
In the background, you'd be walk-a-ticky, walk-a-ticky.

145
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,760
He would be getting off on it himself.

146
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:47,960
He would just take the advantage of the headphones and probably just push us to the side and enter his own slack-filled realm of audio.

147
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,160
I was going to do that, actually.

148
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,580
I was about to just sit up here and read off a book.

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:53,700
Oh, man.

150
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,840
He hates it when you tip his hand.

151
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,000
To myself.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,920
He hates it.

153
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,900
But then I saw Suzi walking by and I thought, well, let's see.

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,840
Now that we're not doing a show, I bet she'd do a show.

155
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,060
Hey, I'm not that contrary.

156
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,800
No proof of documentary.

157
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,760
You sure as hell are.

158
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,300
I am.

159
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,180
Yes.

160
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah.

161
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,540
I'm opposite, girl.

162
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,500
That's what G. Gordon Gordon told you not to come up on stage last year.

163
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,820
That was his way of inviting us sub-juniors to come on stage.

164
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,980
That's the way he would probably say it to Puzzling Evidence or, you know, a few of us,

165
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,820
Philo.

166
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,480
He had a gun.

167
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,600
Don't you come up on that stage or I'll kill you.

168
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,740
Yeah, I'm sure he...

169
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,560
And as, again, why would you obey him?

170
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,560
Even if he was serious, which has probably almost never happened.

171
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,660
Maybe that one time with Mojo when they shot him in the fire.

172
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,160
I figured he liked the novelty of somebody seeming to fear him.

173
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,040
A novelty?

174
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,660
No, it wouldn't be as well.

175
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,260
I remember the old days when people feared me.

176
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,980
Back when I was Bob's bodyguard.

177
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,780
Back when I was 15 feet tall.

178
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,860
Yeah, back when I had a liver and a heart and a brain.

179
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,480
Before they replaced it with all these yucca-tisma parts.

180
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,740
What's the matter?

181
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,980
Haven't you ever seen a man with throat cancer before?

182
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,380
You know, that one fooled a lot of people.

183
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,840
Yeah.

184
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,700
He's got a scratchy voice and he had a little...

185
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:36,620
I gave him this little gift box that you could program a brief 30-second message on

186
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,340
and he recorded something very croaky.

187
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,160
It was the phrase,

188
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,420
What's the matter?

189
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,920
Haven't you ever seen a man with throat cancer before?

190
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,600
And he would walk up to people and hold it against his throat and turn that on

191
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
and then lip-sync it.

192
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,040
Lip-sync to the little box saying,

193
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,920
What's the matter?

194
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,020
Haven't you ever seen a man with throat cancer before?

195
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,740
Which is why I can say it with that exact same cadence.

196
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,480
I would love to hear it through wax paper.

197
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,820
That's the kind of thing...

198
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,900
That's what it sounded like.

199
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,960
It was pretty cheesy.

200
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:13,880
You know, I have a box of edited X-Day videos that almost no one has ever seen.

201
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,560
I started...

202
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,100
I was able to start editing video around X-Day 5.

203
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,180
And I edited X-Day 5 really hard.

204
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,400
And then I edited X-Day 6 really hard.

205
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,660
And then I put them up for sale as DVDs.

206
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,240
I was really proud of them because I used every filter,

207
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,340
every transition in Final Cut Pro that I'd stolen

208
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,920
and the ones that I'd stolen.

209
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
And no one bought them.

210
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,960
We sell one of those maybe three a year or something like that.

211
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,980
It's always just a pain in the ass to duplicate.

212
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,220
And I continued editing the...

213
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,620
Don't put us on the air.

214
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,620
Don't put us...

215
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:54,900
Don't...

216
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,300
Don't turn that thing on.

217
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,420
We're doing a secret show.

218
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:56,960
Yeah, this is a secret show.

219
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,300
Nobody's allowed to hear this.

220
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,540
This is all official.

221
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,440
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,260
It's sanctimonious.

223
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,360
This is great.

224
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,300
Man, they almost broke into our signal.

225
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,920
Anyway, I went to the trouble of editing X-Day 7.

226
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,360
I think that one's called Share the Load.

227
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,560
And X-Day 8 and 9.

228
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,380
I edited all those and I have my own little DVD that I can watch

229
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,300
that intercuts randomly between everything cool that happened.

230
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,780
And I've never even looked at it myself.

231
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,260
They're sitting in a box waiting to be seen by some nostalgic old subgenius.

232
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,300
You have the subgenius version of the Prince Vault, I imagine.

233
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,580
Oh, I do.

234
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,440
Actually, people who take that expensive online course

235
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,720
get copies of those X-Day videos.

236
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I did turn them into little divics or MP4 or something.

237
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,160
I'll give you five bucks and a ride.

238
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:54,640
I'll take you into town.

239
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,740
Oh, you probably copied everything off of that drive.

240
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,240
I didn't get nearly as much.

241
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,560
I saw at least two and a half terabytes of bug porn.

242
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,540
And I tried to grab that, but I just didn't have enough time.

243
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,760
All of those PDFs of those scans that Philo had sent you

244
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,180
through your communique a couple of years ago,

245
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,700
I tried opening those up.

246
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,620
But unfortunately, I don't have a mastery of time control.

247
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,080
I don't have a mastery of time control.

248
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,300
I'm not a computer.

249
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,080
I don't know how to use Windows 7, so I'm unable to open those

250
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,020
with a compatible file viewer.

251
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,780
Oh, good.

252
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,520
But I'll crack your secrets eventually.

253
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,160
We have that technology.

254
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,900
Uh-oh.

255
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,220
Teeters has given Hooters the eye.

256
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,760
Teeters was peeping it at Hooters.

257
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,540
I forgot.

258
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,560
I left my pimple.

259
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,480
The Teeters Hooters stare down.

260
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,020
I destroyed some brain cells with church air.

261
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,900
You have to talk.

262
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,400
You have to talk.

263
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,240
Talk real loud if you're going to talk to us because we're doing a secret show.

264
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,200
We're recording.

265
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,860
They're just guessing what I'm saying.

266
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,700
What do you want?

267
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,660
Do you want a Red Bull?

268
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,100
Yes.

269
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,540
Yeah, I thought you would.

270
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,960
Yeah, the off-brand?

271
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,800
No, yeah, Red Thunder.

272
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,960
Red Thunder, yeah.

273
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,780
I'll take an off-brand energy drink.

274
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,120
You never ask.

275
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
I want a million dollars.

276
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,300
I know.

277
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,500
I have a grant for you.

278
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,340
I want a million dollars.

279
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,100
It'll be great.

280
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,880
I figured out how the church really works and what the true saying of it is.

281
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,660
Fuck them if they can't take a scam.

282
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,080
I feel like I've been fucked.

283
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,980
I don't think I can take a scam.

284
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,040
I don't really understand them very well.

285
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,300
Do you want anything?

286
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,800
I think I must be doing it wrong.

287
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,180
Ivan?

288
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,960
Huh?

289
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,860
Do you want a Red Thunder energy drink?

290
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,380
No, actually, I'm just fine.

291
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,480
You?

292
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,280
Strangely enough.

293
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,200
I would love one, actually.

294
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,580
Yes.

295
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,580
Thank you.

296
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,320
You're welcome.

297
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,640
Okay.

298
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,620
In fact, I've got a drinker I haven't finished.

299
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,120
Oh, could you make sure my hot porn is available?

300
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,160
Reverend Hayseed and his diabolical liquor bar available.

301
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,080
I don't know how he does it.

302
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,940
He can pack more alcohol into a smaller space and make it taste really good.

303
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,560
You know, when I was sitting earlier speaking of alchemy to Dr. Howell,

304
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,140
and discussing the process of turning lead into gold,

305
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,720
I decided at this point I think I'd rather sit with Hayseed and learn how to turn water into gin,

306
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,940
because I'm pretty sure he's able to do that.

307
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,520
You know that's Hunter S. Thompson in disguise.

308
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,740
I haven't been saying much.

309
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:48,000
He was ready to kill himself, and Bob came to the door and made him young and Texan.

310
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,960
So whose ashes did they fire out of?

311
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,420
That cannon.

312
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,920
Some asshole.

313
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,760
It's not hard to get those.

314
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,940
Friends, you're hearing the voice of Reverend Fox,

315
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,960
who hasn't been on the Hour of Slack before, I don't think.

316
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,080
I have not.

317
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:09,520
I've listened to enough, and I've hit the subscribe button enough damn times on iTunes.

318
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,300
Well, I'm sure you're only supposed to have to hit it once.

319
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,660
If it was iTunes, if it was a different program, I'm sure, yes.

320
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,920
But iTunes on a Windows.

321
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,820
Because a computer is not terribly friendly.

322
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:32,060
I've actually had to resubscribe about 12 times every time I get to update my human centipad agreement.

323
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,740
Have you noticed how much easier I am to talk to you when I have headphones on?

324
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,620
This is amazing.

325
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,240
That's because I can hear you.

326
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,740
I have a sonic ear from when I was still working at the spy shop.

327
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,160
So the next time that you come through the Hypercube laboratories, I shall lend you my sonic ear.

328
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,040
Wow.

329
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,960
And we'll...

330
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,140
I'm saving up for a proper hearing aid, but I'm afraid I'll be saving for a long, long time.

332
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,780
Do you have anything to enhance my sense of smell?

333
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
Your sense of smell?

334
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,060
I mean, if you...

335
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,780
I mean...

336
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,200
Susie, you don't want to know.

337
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,020
There's...

338
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,660
Don't do it.

339
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,740
Don't enhance it.

340
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,940
You just don't want to know.

341
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:15,560
I believe we have a psychoacoustic track that could work, but it will cause the smell of mint to make you instantly vomit.

342
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,840
So unless you particularly enjoy after-dinner treats...

343
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,920
I would...

344
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,340
I would definitely reconsider that.

345
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,340
But other than that, we have options available for olfactory upgrades.

346
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:43,880
Of course, I haven't needed any assistance with that myself since having my nose broken in twain by a football player several years ago who was not right with Bob.

347
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,860
So I...

348
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,060
And that helped your hearing?

349
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,920
It didn't help my hearing, but for some reason I can smell something really...

350
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,700
It may have opened your third nostril.

351
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,080
It might...

352
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,460
I might not have needed to go to Dobstown and drop that $3,000 for that surgery.

353
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,700
They do it anyway, though, don't they?

354
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,360
They'll do it, yeah.

355
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,440
Whether you need it or not, it's a PPO from hell.

356
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,360
Huh.

357
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:09,860
My insurance company wasted a bunch of money on that nasal...

358
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,360
What do they call it?

359
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:17,980
Shoved popsicle sticks up your nose to ream every core out your nose so you can breathe.

360
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,300
I had twisted septum or whatever it is.

361
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,380
Went and drilled it open.

362
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:31,180
And suddenly I could smell how horrible the detergent aisle in the supermarket was.

363
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:31,680
Yes.

364
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,440
And also how awful I must have smelled all those years of smoking Marlboros.

365
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,740
In my days of being a little junior reverend, I had a...

366
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,540
Whenever we entered a Winn-Dixie supermarket, in Kennesaw, Georgia, this particular Winn-Dixie,

367
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,300
I had a...

368
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,920
A very strong, overpowering bleach smell.

369
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,200
And from the time I was a newborn, I would vomit instantly upon smelling it.

370
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,700
And up until the age of four or five when they decided to open the Kroger's for me to be beaten in the aisles in,

371
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,040
it was...

372
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,660
That was all we had.

373
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,320
And as soon as we headed towards the door, they brought the mop and bucket.

374
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,420
They said, here comes that little vomiting bastard again.

375
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,580
The little sissy part.

376
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,100
He vomits.

377
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,680
And he smells anything disinfectantly.

378
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,020
Well, I can identify that smell to this day.

379
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,540
And most Winn-Dixies still have that very distinct odor.

380
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:30,980
Yeah.

381
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,620
In the supermarket.

382
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,660
With something masking the smell of death.

383
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,320
It was quite frightening.

384
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,700
Diminishing profits.

385
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,440
Well, that beats the ones who don't fight that smell of death.

386
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,580
The Piggly Wiggly, for instance.

387
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,760
Now, you go down to the Piggly Wiggly, you're going to smell that butcher shop back there.

388
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,800
I've never seen any of those pigs wiggle.

389
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,980
I think we got a class action.

390
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,940
Turn up the air conditioning.

391
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,060
It's a wiggly pig, as Steve has said.

392
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,380
Or something like that.

393
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,620
It's a Piggly Wiggly world.

394
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,340
There's always something about a mascot that seems just so happy to deliver itself to its own slaughterhouse.

395
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,960
Quizzling pig.

396
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,400
Yes.

397
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,840
They always seem to be dancing with such joy.

398
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,540
Yeah.

399
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:21,360
Barbecue restaurants are the only place that really glamorize what you're eating as you're eating it.

400
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:21,680
Just pig.

401
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,340
Pigs everywhere.

402
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,460
I mean, you don't go to...

403
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,640
And half the time they're carrying a pork sandwich in their hand or a pig in a blanket.

404
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,360
Or they have an apron and a chef's hat on and some stylish sunglasses.

405
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,100
Right, they're running good.

406
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,540
Cleaver.

407
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:41,460
Now, you know, I saw a porky pig say the most startling thing in one of those cartoons he starred in.

408
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,060
He, um...

409
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,720
A Daffy Duck or somebody said,

410
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,820
Oh, your sister wears army boots or something like that.

411
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,300
Mm-hmm.

412
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,400
Or your sister...

413
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,820
Does something, something.

414
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,880
Porky goes, my sister doesn't wear army boots.

415
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,500
My sister works in a butcher shop and smokes ham.

416
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,000
That was a blowjob joke slipped into a theatrical cartoon.

417
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,980
Probably in the 50s.

418
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,780
With cannibalistic implications.

419
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,820
I get Porky's sister works in a butcher shop and smokes ham.

420
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,760
There's an early...

421
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,680
I think it was a Bob Clampett cartoon.

422
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,680
Mm-hmm.

423
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,920
And it was Porky Pig, of course.

424
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,820
And he had smashed his hand with a hammer.

425
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,480
Oh, yeah.

426
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,760
And with that, it's...

427
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,480
Son of a gun.

428
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,420
Son of a gun.

429
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,640
I thought I was going to say,

430
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,440
Son of a bitch.

431
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,820
That was it.

432
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,420
Do you know the name of that cartoon?

433
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,240
I can't remember the name of the cartoon.

434
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,180
Bob for the life of me.

435
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,760
That was something they did in wartime, I think.

436
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,260
It was.

437
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,540
It was a special thing for the service.

438
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,420
It was something they did for each other.

439
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,700
Yeah, it's...

440
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,500
It's all black and white pencil drawings.

441
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,480
It was just something they did for skits and giggles.

442
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,000
I haven't seen the finalized...

443
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,660
Yeah, me too.

444
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,660
It was an era.

445
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:51,660


446
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:51,660


447
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:51,660


448
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:51,660


449
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:51,980
It was a weird clip.

450
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,140
That's my subgenius realm, is cartoons.

451
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,180
I don't know a darn thing about playing music or ranting,

452
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,800
but I can talk all day cartoons.

453
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,640
There's a fine tradition of pranksters in the media

454
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,740
who go to elaborate lengths to do things to show CEOs

455
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,720
to make them panic.

456
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,400
I have a Reed Drugs commercial in my files

457
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,020
with a former Miss America doing the voiceover,

458
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,440
and it's like, A, it's herpes, hepatitis B,

459
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,220
and it's like, A, it's herpes, hepatitis B,

460
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,220


461
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,220


462
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,220


463
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,760
Reed Drugs, I need ya!

464
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,460
And they jingle and everything.

465
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,100
And it was, you know, whatever size you are,

466
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,720
from Vienna Sausage on up,

467
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,780
Reed Drugs has got you covered.

468
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,600
And the thing was dropped on April Fool's Day,

469
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,740
and it said, for immediate approval, airs today.

470
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,860
You know, they take some time.

471
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,120
They have some fun with things.

472
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,900
I haven't aired a good prank advertisement in a while,

473
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,660
because I haven't been on the radio for a while.

474
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,420
I haven't been on the radio in seven years now.

475
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,240
Shock value's kind of really dead, though.

476
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,140
It's kind of hard to get to anybody,

477
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,960
especially when you're broadcasting to, like,

478
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,000
a couple of art school students out of a closet.

479
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,380
So it wasn't very easy.

480
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,900
That's really secret radio.

481
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,900
Yeah, that's...

482
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,180
From PR News in Washington, I'm 89 years old.

483
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,800
People are watching television in the tinder-dry Southwest.

484
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,000
Officials in Oklahoma are now raising the debt.

485
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,640
They're calling it a day.

486
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:21,640


487
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:21,640


488
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:21,640


489
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:21,640


490
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:21,640


491
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,480
Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office reporting 12 adults and 6 children raised Friday.

492
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,720
On Wall Street, 8-9.

493
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,480
People dying today as a result of complications, says.

494
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,400
This is PR News in Washington.

495
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,880
There's no computer words in this game.

496
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,440
It's not easy to follow a camel.

497
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,100
But you know me.

498
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm the chumpster.

499
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,620
But I'm a newbie.

500
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,860
I'm leaving the old me in the old century.

501
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,920
And taking a new chunk into the new millennium.

502
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,980
Why?

503
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,040
Well, the eyeball hat I'm wearing should give it away.

504
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,640
It's got eyeballs all around.

505
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,300
I see the past.

506
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,980
I see the present.

507
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,660
And I can eyeball the future.

508
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,220
If I'm gonna make it, I have to come to terms with what's been eating me up.

509
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,900
That's what's going on.

510
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,940
We're bringing it back!

511
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,640
We're bringing it back!

512
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,960
We're bringing it back!

513
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,260
We're bringing it back!

514
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,580
I've been betting on my old kids!

515
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,120
I bet on them tonight.

516
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,620
And they got me.

517
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,520
Hort, come on.

518
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,140
I'm going to make this promise even if it breaks me.

519
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,680
From now on, I resolve that if my kid is playing a team that's going to punk them,

520
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,060
then I'm going with the winner.

521
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:43,680
If you don't play the odds, you'll have nothing left to give your kids when it's all over.

522
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,600
And I'm out.

523
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,080
I'm out.

524
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,060
I'm out.

525
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,220
I'm out.

526
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,740
I'm out.

527
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,080


528
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,220
What's going on?

529
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,460
We're bringing them back

530
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,200
We're bringing them back

531
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,460
We're bringing them back

532
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,440
You might tell us what's going on

533
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,360
We're bringing them back

534
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,160
We're bringing them back

535
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,680
We're bringing them back

536
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Oh no, Journey to the Beginning of Time is gone.

537
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,740
The video's been removed by them.

538
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,160
Who would dare?

539
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,620
We can't go back to the beginning of time anymore.

540
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,680
I didn't know it was there to begin with.

541
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,000
I know, and already it's gone.

542
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,020
Who removed it?

543
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,140
The user.

544
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,420
The user?

545
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,060
Everybody wants to go back to the beginning.

546
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,260
The web is using us.

547
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,760
But how could this obscure movie

548
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,880
be offensive to anyone?

549
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,660
If you put your name

550
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,640
in the animated

551
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,840
If I go to Phineas and Narcos thing

552
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,880
and I mark it and I say

553
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,500
this is mine, it's a copyrighted one

554
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,360
then for all time

555
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,880
if you go to Phineas and Narcos

556
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,800
now remove tape

557
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,220
it has a thing that says

558
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,740
this was removed by

559
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,220
and it has

560
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,740
your name.

561
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,960
Well, I want to know who.

562
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,180
I want to know who.

563
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,520
Yeah, well, they tell you who.

564
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,600
And who is it?

565
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,660
Phineas J. Quingborn.

566
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,120
Yeah, I'm going to claim

567
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,000
every one of his.

568
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,980
You have to really snag

569
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,340
a lot of these YouTube videos

570
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,680
because they disappear.

571
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,720
You can snag them?

572
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,260
Yeah.

573
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,860
How can you do that?

574
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,140
Well, there are certain programs

575
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,140
and tricks.

576
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,440
Oh, they're timing up

577
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,660
Agent Provocative Footwear.

578
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,180
That's remarkable.

579
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,240
A copyright claim for PRS.

580
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,520
And then you have it

581
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,940
so it doesn't depend on them.

582
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,100
Yeah.

583
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,940
And out there,

584
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,420
for instance,

585
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,220
out there somewhere

586
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,360
people have gathered

587
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,100
all of those downfalls

588
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,760
that were around.

589
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,620
And they're all gone.

590
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,780
If you look at your favorites,

591
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,500
you know,

592
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,340
half of them are like

593
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,500
not there anymore.

594
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,320
Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.

595
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,200
I'm cleaning up the list.

596
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,620
Because some of the coolest stuff

597
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,260
is just gone.

598
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,840
It's like in the 80s

599
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,900
with Night Flight,

600
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,620
you know,

601
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,560
you have to...

602
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,460
The J-mans.

603
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,700
Yeah, you have to get those.

604
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,100
You mean, oh,

605
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,260
when they show up?

606
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,760
When they show the weird

607
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,680
little vignettes

608
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,700
and, you know,

609
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,180
mean when there's a Death Star

610
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:19,980
over San Francisco?

611
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,500
Yeah, you gotta get that one.

612
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,520
Before George Lucas

613
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,540
shuts it down.

614
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,600
Something or other.

615
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,660
It's got over

616
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,360
two million of hits.

617
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,080
What has?

618
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,160
Which one?

619
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,180
The Death Star over San Francisco.

620
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,720
Oh, yes.

621
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,320
Well, that made a lot of noise

622
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,360
back in the day.

623
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,200
Yeah, and it was nice noise.

624
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,540
It was good music

625
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,500
back in the day.

626
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,360
Yeah, that's right.

627
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
Noise to sing.

628
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,480
That great popular band

629
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,100
broadcasting from the

630
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,560
Jollywood.

631
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,120
The orbiting ship

632
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,440
is located

633
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:50,920
here,

634
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,960
synchronously above

635
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,120
San Francisco,

636
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,260
California.

637
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,040
I'm going to stay

638
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,120
for the long now.

639
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,680
Sooner or later

640
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,780
you'll ask me

641
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,100
where you're going to go

642
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,140
Say it later

643
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,780
and I'll let you go

644
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,180
Sooner or later

645
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
you'll have to

646
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,060
take your mind off

647
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,060
Say it later

648
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,080
and I'll let you go

649
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,680
Sooner or later

650
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
you'll ask me

651
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,000
where, where, where,

652
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,300
where you're going

653
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,980
Why do I run, why do I run

654
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:22,980


655
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:38,260
Why do I run, why move

656
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,980
go

657
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,500
That is the call

658
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,300
of the rabid bamboo.

659
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,640
But to those who've spent a lifetime in the tropics,

660
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,200
just the familiar sounds of the bush

661
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,720
as we pour ourselves some requinine

662
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,920
against the malaria, don't you know?

663
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,520
The houseboys have turned the lights on in the garden.

664
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,760
The silhouettes of the nearby jungle trees

665
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,120
and the circling bats.

666
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,280
Lost children.

667
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,580
The barking and coughing of a lion

668
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,760
not too far away in the nearby jungle boma.

669
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,540
And the splashing and grunting of giant crocodiles.

670
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,980
This time of year, the crocs come right up on me.

671
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,580
And there's the ukabalaponga.

672
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,000
You can hear their drums in the distance.

673
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,900
Yeah, the ukabalaponga.

674
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,620
In the distance.

675
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,120
They're getting more advanced.

676
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,080
I was thinking of that.

677
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,240
Yeah, it's true.

678
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,120
There are certain subjects which should never, ever be mentioned.

679
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,800
Ukabalaponga is one of them.

680
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,820
Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

681
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,740
His experiences in the colonial legion are such.

682
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,200
He caught colonial legion air disease from a ukabalaponga.

683
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:10,900
Yes.

684
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,540
They were an indigenous population.

685
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,680
An ecology.

686
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,120
Ingenious population?

687
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,180
Indigenous, doctor.

688
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,140
As indigenous as you or I.

689
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,900
An ingenious postulation.

690
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,100
Yes, an ingenious postulation.

691
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,520
But it turned out to be a flash of insight

692
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:36,520
that was fairly close to every level of reality.

693
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,680
Oh, what?

694
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,060
Oh.

695
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,500
Yeah.

696
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,400
The music mixed with Fireside Theater

697
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,140
that we heard about five minutes ago

698
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,800
was by National Cynical Network

699
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,680
from Phineas Narco,

700
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,980
who also isolated that bit of puzzling evidence show

701
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,260
from KPFA Berkeley

702
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,160
with Dr. Howell, Phineas, Philodrum and Doug Wellman.

703
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,400
Now, back to the Invisible X-Day show

704
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,260
with Reverend Susie and Reverend Fox.

705
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,680
You said your expertise was in cartoons.

706
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,260
I try.

707
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,260


708
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,260


709
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,460
I try to be an expert in cartoons.

710
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,640
Have you boned up on Beanie and Cecil lightly?

711
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,600
The Bob Clampett Beanie and Cecil?

712
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,400
Or the Ralph Bakshi Beanie and Cecil?

713
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,380
Oh, the Bob Clampett original.

714
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,180
Oh, of course.

715
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,400
I'm familiar with Beanie and Cecil.

716
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,700
To an extent.

717
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,200
To an extent.

718
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,140
The reason I ask is I kind of wasn't.

719
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,760
I had the puppets of Cecil,

720
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,480
the sea servant as a child,

721
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,680
which kind of freaked me out.

722
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,100
The Loch Ness Monster style?

723
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,160
Because he had no tail.

724
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,640
No end.

725
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,380
I saw the end of him in one scene.

726
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:44,800
Really?

727
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,880
Where he was some sort of attached

728
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,360
to some sort of projectile

729
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
and you actually got to see Cecil's ass.

730
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,040
I never see.

731
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,200
That was what I was going to bring up.

732
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,700
It was just sort of pointed with a fin

733
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,720
and it didn't look right.

734
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,960
In the cartoon, you never see his butt.

735
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,060
You don't.

736
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,760
He gets around in bathtubs and wheelbarrows and things.

737
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,800
He never just undulates along like a proper sea serpent.

738
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,000
Maybe the tub's filled with water.

739
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,080
He's jet repelling through a hole.

740
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,340
The whole thing just made me have to envision

741
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,720
what are they hiding?

742
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,100
Does he have boobs down there?

743
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,360
He's just an eel.

744
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,880
Sea serpent cloacas or what?

745
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,640
It's a Yogg-Sigurath visage down there.

746
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,920
There's a billion tentacles

747
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,660
and millions of screaming souls

748
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,580
beneath the waves of the Beanie and Cecil.

749
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,900
Tommy Amoeba had the complete Beanie and Cecil thing

750
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,360
and after that Cleveland revival,

751
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,360
he and I and Princess Wee sat up watching Beanie and Cecil

752
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,620
and everybody else was asleep.

753
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,280
And it just, it's been eating away at me.

754
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,140
What is, what are they hiding?

755
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,640
What is the truth?

756
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,540
At the end of Cecil the Sea Serpent.

757
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,360
He does not end.

758
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,120
A little boy's arm stuck up a hole.

759
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,440
Why, his body weaves through the nether regions of the cosmos.

760
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,040
A wormhole beneath the surface of the waves

761
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,340
that connects him through multiple points.

762
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,220
In space and time at once.

763
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,040
And that kid Beanie.

764
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,440
He was just a jerk.

765
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,960
Well, he was a straight man, I realize.

766
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,540
He would, he just wanted to go,

767
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,260
oh, now Cecil, why did you do that crazy thing?

768
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
And there was a beatnik character.

769
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,800
Wild man something.

770
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,780
Norman?

771
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,440
I can't remember.

772
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,100
He was a caveman.

773
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,780
I mean, in a caveman outfit.

774
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,600
And he had, but he was a beatnik.

775
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,540
And he talked in pure beatnik slang.

776
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,340
Dialogue.

777
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,100
I seem to remember that was Norman.

778
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,960
Crazy daddy-o.

779
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,400
Norman.

780
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,020
I seem to remember Norman.

781
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,060
He was wild, man.

782
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,880
Wild.

783
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,620
Let's go hunting.

784
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,400
We're going to travel far.

785
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:50,920
Cool.

786
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,320
To the hungry eye.

787
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,220
Men's we're on the beach next hour.

788
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:54,880
Crazy.

789
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,260
We're after the wild man who swings beneath the moon.

790
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,720
And now here's Beanie and Cecil in

791
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,700
a Bob Clampett cartoon.

792
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,420
Woo!

793
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,040
The Wild Man of Wildsville.

794
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,500
Man, we're almost to the hungry island.

795
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,300
The home of the ferocious wild man.

796
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,960
Heavens to that sea.

797
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,560
Man, first we land on Pismo Beach Nick.

798
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,060
Set foot on Mort's soil.

799
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,160
Go past Lenny's spruce tree.

800
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,140
Through the green witch village.

801
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,720
Keep moving right on past the Kingston tree hole.

802
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,500
And then we head for the wilds of Wildsville.

803
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,460
The spot where the wild man was last seen.

804
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,240
Ah!

805
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,500
Last!

806
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,040
Ah!

807
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,600
Ah!

808
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,440
Ah!

809
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:48,880


810
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,220
Ah!

811
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,340
Ah!

812
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,960
Ah!

813
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:49,960


814
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,560
Man, I'm the wildest.

815
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,520
Like, rab-a-gee-gee-gee-gee-go man, Van Gogh.

816
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,220
That's a pretty picture.

817
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,060
But can you paint faces?

818
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,140
Ooh wee, can I?

819
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,780
Dig this crazy test pattern.

820
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,240
This jack-poner, sat in the corner.

821
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,120
Hehehe.

822
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,460
Waiting to be analyzed.

823
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,080
Ah!

824
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,440
You're the real wild man.

825
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,240
Don't bug me, man.

826
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,700
Don't bug me.

827
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,760
Oh, like Birdland, Dad.

828
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,420
I'm a real swagger.

829
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,000
What's the matter, you crazy or something?

830
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,420
The craziest.

831
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,680
Like Oscar Wilde, man.

832
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,220
Ooh wee.

833
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,480
There were at least two cartoons.

834
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,820
The ones that Tommy Amoeba showed us starring the caveman.

835
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,180
Very, very surreal from what I've seen and what I've been able to research.

836
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:51,300
That was Bob Clampett's project after he was basically thrown out of Warner Brothers

837
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,480
and the Termite Terrace crew was rather fed up with him.

838
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:02,720
So he had started his own project, which really was another pioneer in television because

839
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,260
it was one of the earlier programs.

840
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,580
And then revived here by Bakshian.

841
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:06,900
Ah.

842
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,100
Where he met John Christopher Lucey, where they then went and formed Mighty Mouse and

843
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,160
gave Christopher Lucey the platform to Ren and Stimpy in the early 90s.

844
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,660
So Beanie and Cecil, if it had not been for Beanie and Cecil, you would not have gotten

845
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,560
your Ren and Stimpy show.

846
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:22,880
Right.

847
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,840
Unless they have control of your radio tubes.

848
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,240
And I do too.

849
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,340
Good.

850
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,680
This is Ren the Black.

851
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,880
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Radio Tubes.

852
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:36,880


853
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,760
Welcome to the Ren and Stimpy Show.

854
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,460
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

855
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,960
Keep listening, you idiot.

856
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

857
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,300
Else I shall kill you.

858
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,180
Well, Praise Beanie and Cecil.

859
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,860
That's a strange, obscure show.

860
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,740
A wrong and winding road.

861
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,900
And notice it's suddenly raining again.

862
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,440
What a, why does Nikki make us wet?

863
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,120
Fropp precipitation, like it.

864
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,000
Why does Nikki make us wet?

865
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,600
Why does Nikki make us wet?

866
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,880
They're stinky and they stink.

867
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:06,880


868
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:06,880


869
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:06,880


870
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:06,880


871
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:06,880


872
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:06,880


873
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:06,880


874
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:06,880


875
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:06,880


876
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,000
They're stink, they're stink.

877
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,500
It's been interesting weather this X Day.

878
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,180
What with, I guess with annual karma gonna get you.

879
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,580
The sky weeps.

880
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,960
We had power and no one else did last time.

881
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,700
This year, everyone else has power.

882
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,220
I think the Christians plugged into the grid this time.

883
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:34,520
There was quite the flutter of the X Day drill in the small podunk towns outside and close

884
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:34,900
by.

885
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:42,300
Every time that we had to run into conspiracy shops to pick up much needed supplies, we

886
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:48,720
would be met with glares and gazes upon our Dobbs memorabilia.

887
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,040
And it was, it was, it was interesting adventures.

888
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,620
But several people in town were familiar that we were holding a drill here, but they were

889
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,620
not entirely sure what was going on.

890
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,160
So I got a lot of speculation from people.

891
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,920
You mean in Athens?

892
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,380
Or some kind of supremacist?

893
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,460
In Athens.

894
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:09,940
In Athens and in Pomeroy and in the outskirts towards Point Pleasant, West Virginia, where

895
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,940
we went to hunt for the Mothman earlier this week.

896
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,280
And I, the word is getting out.

897
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,960
We did have roadside converts, people that came up here because of that bugaboo and how

898
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,320
to do.

899
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,960
Well, I guess it was, I guess it was a good idea that we went to Athens a month early

900
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,780
and spread Starwood and X Day postcards everywhere.

901
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,680
Actually, I didn't have that many.

902
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,900
And we didn't spread that many, but.

903
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,560
I think some don't go to X Day posters would probably get more people to show up.

904
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,360
Exactly.

905
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,340
Kick out X Day.

906
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,680
You can't go to X Day.

907
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,700
Bob get out.

908
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,800
What is X Day?

909
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,800
Don't ask because you can't go.

910
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,120
Leave subgeniuses.

911
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,620
You know, if we get the, we could probably get the Westboro Baptists to come out this

912
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,220
way and pick at us.

913
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,760
We're not terribly far from them.

914
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,660
We'd probably get a couple of $35 pocket fools walking around.

915
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:03,660


916
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,380
We'd probably get a couple of $35 pocket fools walking through on a, on a good rant like

917
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,760
that.

918
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,660
Then again, rival cults never prove much for a good time.

919
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,480
They don't pay us enough attention.

920
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,300
It's a shame.

921
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,400
You know what it is, is they, some of the townsfolk think we're humans from Starwood

922
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:26,820
and they know that they're, you know, that's the wrong religion, whatever the hell it is.

923
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,220
It's wrong.

924
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,680
Whereas subgenius, you know, they don't, they don't even know it is a religion probably.

925
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Why, why sully the name of the Pagans with, with Bob?

926
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:44,500
Well, you know, I, I love my Pagan brethrens and sisters, the half that are, don't have

927
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,240
a Coke bottle up their ass of righteousness.

928
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,600
That's the problem.

929
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,100
The other half of them are fundies.

930
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,920
But, but, but, but, but the non-fundie Pagans.

931
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,700
The ones selling the scented corks are much nicer.

932
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,120
Huh?

933
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,100
The ones selling the scented corks are very nice.

934
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,360
Yeah.

935
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,640
Yeah.

936
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,020
They throw good parties.

937
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,660
But and, and I, I don't care.

938
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,840
They love to see the fundy pagans get pissed off,

939
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,140
and that's why they pay me to come to Starwood.

940
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,720
And now they can't...

941
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,220
Now I'm one of the people who collects their money

942
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,320
when they come to Starwood.

943
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,360
Oh, well, that's what happens.

944
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,840
They were kind of horrified, some of them,

945
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,700
to see that when they were checking in at registration,

946
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,380
the person who was controlling the database

947
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,220
with their real names in it

948
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,140
was that terrible subgenius man.

949
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,720
Ivan Stang, who, frankly, right up front,

950
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,960
admits he doesn't believe in magic at all

951
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,060
or any of this crap, quote-unquote.

952
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,740
And then I always get a big round of applause.

953
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,340
I've had several of the most popular scam artists

954
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,740
come up and say,

955
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,600
man, you're doing great, don't change anything.

956
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,700
Do you want a crystal read?

957
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,860
You know, it's like...

958
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,180
And these are people who teach witchcraft history and stuff.

959
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:00,860
And...

960
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,100
And...

961
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,640
And...

962
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,500
They were as much as going,

963
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,200
if you can possibly make money...

964
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,900
The decades-old art of tarot and...

965
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,100
Right, yeah, yeah.

966
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,100
The century-almost patent of the Ouija board.

967
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:13,880
We've...

968
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,860
But I will not speak ill of the pagans.

969
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,840
They are...

970
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,380
Oh, you can.

971
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,240
It's all right.

972
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,180
Actually, I should probably stop doing this

973
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,040
because we're going to have the Bobby Awards at 7 o'clock.

974
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:27,640
Yes.

975
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,760
And you know, there's...

976
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,380
Usually, high season, I sit down.

977
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,020
and make a list about an hour before the Bobby Woods.

978
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,900
That's not even going to happen.

979
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,320
Just off the cuff.

980
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,920
Well, we're just simply going to give an award to everybody here, I think.

981
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,800
Princess Weiss says they're incredibly elaborate things that APO Stacey did.

982
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:58,940
And we wanted to photograph all of them before they're given to these undeserving yo-yos.

983
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,140
Is there one for me?

984
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:00,300
Me?

985
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,160
Weirder than anything you can imagine an award for.

986
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:16,000
There's awards that we will never see because it will only be behind another secret veil of Bobby awards of the fifth dimension.

987
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:26,980
Where people will be presented the likes of third nostril receptor opening and we should possibly be quickest time to Dobbs Town.

988
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,120
I believe that was a sprint by...

989
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,960
Possibly Major Tom himself, the newcomer to X Day.

990
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,920
If you told him where to go, he'd get there.

991
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,480
And I said go to Dobbs Town and he did bring back my frop stick.

992
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,780
So I think...

993
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,680
Go fuck yourself.

994
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,520
Will he get there?

995
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,420
Pardon?

996
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,140
If I say go fuck yourself, will he get there?

997
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,700
He'll get where you tell him to go, he said.

998
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,340
Well, yeah, I'm going to take the headphones off and then nothing is real.

999
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,120
You know, yesterday I realized the saddest thing.

1000
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,940
The saddest words that I know.

1001
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,940
Well, what are you doing the afternoon of July 5th?

1002
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,600
Oh, the phrase next X Day.

1003
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,200
Or even the phrase last X Day.

1004
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,620
Yeah, of course it hurts.

1005
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,280
It is sad.

1006
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,100
It burns, it stings.

1007
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,120
Yes, it is indeed.

1008
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,340
It chafes.

1009
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:30,120
You know, and I hate the feeling of, well, I guess it was a good thing I paid the rent.

1010
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,120


1011
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,700
I paid those bills before we left for X Day after.

1012
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,420
I guess it's a good thing I went ahead and sent that credit card payment.

1013
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,560
I'm expecting to have to get into town with a reconnection fee.

1014
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:40,660


1015
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,600
You know, we're finishing that extra hour of slack.

1016
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,220
Yeah.

1017
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,020
To put on the air so I, you know, for those left behind.

1018
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,020
I did it too.

1019
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:48,580
Yep.

1020
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:49,820
Felt dirty.

1021
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:50,860
Yep.

1022
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,800
I mean dirtier than usual.

1023
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,280
Right.

1024
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:54,980
Right.

1025
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,460
And that's saying quite a bit.

1026
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,100
Yeah.

1027
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,020
Quite a bit indeed.

1028
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,880
Well.

1029
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,800
What can we do?

1030
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,740
Back to the drawing board.

1031
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:16,020
This is, here's another real, you want to hear another real sad thing that's kind of censored from, something Bob said was censored out of the church.

1032
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,480
Yeah.

1033
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,820
The only real form of time control we have available to us is patience.

1034
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,300
No!

1035
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,460
Or T-Bots.

1036
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,560
That's a nasty one.

1037
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,080
You can see we're in a situation.

1038
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,620
I can see why we don't.

1039
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:28,820
Yeah.

1040
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,220
It's not a bumper sticker slogan.

1041
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,840
Sure it's not Dickism?

1042
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:32,920
Yeah.

1043
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,080
That sounds Dicky more than Dobbsy.

1044
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,360
Yeah.

1045
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,340
I don't know who that belongs to.

1046
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,120
Oh, my dongle.

1047
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,320
Well, you know, we found out what, where Dick is all the time.

1048
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:49,020
Well, where's the, here it is.

1049
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:49,400
Here it is.

1050
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:49,680
I can.

1051
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,080
Ah!

1052
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,040
Okay.

1053
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,320
We've always, we've always wondered what's the back of Bob's head looks like, right?

1054
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:57,800
Uh-huh.

1055
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,060
We've only seen the back of Bob's head.

1056
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,060


1057
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,060


1058
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,060


1059
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,060


1060
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,060


1061
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,060


1062
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,060


1063
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,060


1064
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,660
We've only ever seen the front of his head and a little bit of the back.

1065
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,420
Uh-huh.

1066
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,980
We learned what the back of his head looks like.

1067
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:06,800
Oh!

1068
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,140
Yes.

1069
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,680
A reverse Dobbs head.

1070
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,900
A double mean baby head growing off the back of his head.

1071
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,340
That's where Dick Dobbs has been this whole time.

1072
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,160
That's.

1073
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,160
He's snuck the pipe on the other side.

1074
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,100
That's disturbing.

1075
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,300
He's kind of squatter.

1076
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,620
He's more squat than his, the dominant twin.

1077
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,160
He looks more like Bob Barker.

1078
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:26,480
The dog.

1079
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,640
Well, it's obviously, it's a parasitic twin situation.

1080
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:35,000
And there's a gibbering evil Dick Dobbs on the, that is with Bob all the time.

1081
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,920
Just the, the parallel Bob.

1082
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,260
You can almost hear somebody go.

1083
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,480
The Dick that's always there.

1084
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,060
My Dick is always with me.

1085
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,360
Everyone's got a Dick with them one way or another.

1086
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,060
Dick was riding on the back of Bob's face the whole time.

1087
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,580
Now he knows what it feels like.

1088
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,260
Yeah.

1089
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,100
Well, let's check for evil Susie.

1090
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,260
Oh my God.

1091
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:00,820
Gross.

1092
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,940
Drilling little head on the back.

1093
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,260
You're terrible.

1094
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,720
People like my drooling little head.

1095
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:10,520
You're awful.

1096
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,820
You're all washed up.

1097
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,180
You can't work as a stripper anymore.

1098
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,380
God.

1099
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,900
I hate hearing that all the time.

1100
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:25,100
Well, luckily I don't have an evil Susie.

1101
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:25,240
I have a little girl named Susie.

1102
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1103
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1104
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1105
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1106
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1107
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1108
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1109
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1110
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1111
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1112
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1113
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1114
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:25,240


1115
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,480
That would piss me off.

1116
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,660
If they're evil Susie was constantly harping at me.

1117
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,460
I just have a wife.

1118
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,580
Oh, she's almost like a wife.

1119
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,040
It's like one of those made dismember things.

1120
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,080
Evil wee.

1121
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,500
Evil wee.

1122
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,560
Is there an evil princess wee?

1123
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,860
Actually, there...

1124
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,920
The one that barrels through the campgrounds at a hundred miles per hour.

1125
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,940
There wasn't an evil wee.

1126
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:04,080
every work day at about six o'clock evil we would walk in the door so more full of hate than the

1127
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:12,200
than me and my worst hissy wow and uh man yeah he's just driving home from work having to be

1128
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:18,700

1129
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:26,280
cleveland rush hour the evil we would come out and um it only took about a minute to banish her

1130
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:33,180
and i what part the first part involves saying you're the prettiest girl in the whole world

1131
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:40,640
which is true um she's cheating because she's not from this world and uh and then i one other

1132
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,820

um actually i probably should quit this charade and just yeah

1139
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,600

1144
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,960

1145
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,620

1146
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,100
i think it was uh

1147
00:50:51,100 --> 00:51:06,520

1148

1149
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:18,680

1150
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,560
well

1151
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,680
répung

1152
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:21,680


1153
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,500
i 종

1154
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:22,500


1155
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,140
a

1156
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,640
The fur and the bones.

1157
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,540
And the rest was gone and there wasn't any stink.

1158
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,340
It was the most easily gathered carcass ever.

1159
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,880
The skull looks real wicked and has a mandible.

1160
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,120
Boy, this chicken I'm eating sure is good.

1161
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,560
I could peel most of the leathery skin off of the parts, but most of the tissue was just...

1162
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,500
It decomposed to a black goo and was gone.

1163
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,520
Boy, this chicken's great.

1164
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,680
This is from Ethan.

1165
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,980
I guess we're tuned out.

1166
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,600
Somebody's way out there.

1167
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,700
All right, well, thank you for letting me sit in on a...

1168
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,780
Was that an hour of slack or just a secret recording in the background?

1169
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,280
That's to fulfill his probation.

1170
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,640
Ah, I got you.

1171
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,120
Well, I need to go get the hypercube ready.

1172
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,920
You'll probably have to buy some rubbers.

1173
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,640
The celebrity is overwhelming.

1174
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,420
The opportunities for loose sex once you hit the airwaves.

1175
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,020
Here I come.

1176
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,460
The

1177
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:46,460


1178
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,220
The

1179
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,340
The

1180
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:48,400
The

1181
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,200
The

1182
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,020
The

1183
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,020


1184
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,020


1185
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,020


1186
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,180
The

1187
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:50,180


1188
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,080
The

1189
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,740
Thank you.

1190
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,220
Thank you.

1191
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,000
Thank you.

1192
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,920
Thank you.

1193
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,200
Thank you.

1194
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,540
Thank you.

1195
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,600
The Slot Rods, close relatives of the groupies of the amino acids,

1196
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,660
owners of Weirdsville Records in Detroit,

1197
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,260
which incidentally is the coolest store ever.

1198
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,340
Also, I think they're cousins

1199
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,060
of the Weirdsville Records

1200
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:58,100
Wild Man of Wildsville. Now, you know that invisible show with Susie and Reverend Fox and me?

1201
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:05,520
Well, it continued to devolve even deeper into utmost nerddom, some of which I removed. But when

1202
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:11,440
we'd forgotten we were recording at all, we got to talking about the NASA space shuttles we've seen

1203
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:18,300
that are now on display in museums. I got to go in one along, I believe it was Enterprise,

1204
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:27,020
the one I got to go inside and look at, and that was a really good VIP tour. But no, it was absolutely

1205
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:35,940
amazing, and it's just the payload bay is gigantic, but it's all empty space. There's a couple places

1206
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,780
for them, but once you dock to a station or something, come right back.

1207
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:46,320
That's for one of every animal. When they know that the asteroid, the planet killer is on the way,

1208
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,220
they put one of every animal in.

1209
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,340
Now, how many animals did Noah take on the ark?

1210
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,680
No one knows how many species there are yet.

1211
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,360
Still finding them?

1212
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,720
There's like 6,000 species just of birds.

1213
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:11,980
Of every clean animal, he took seven. Of every animal, he took two, but of every clean animal, he took seven.

1214
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:12,460
Really?

1215
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:16,660
Yes. In Genesis, it states this right up front. I believe in seven.

1216
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,280
I have a problem with that.

1217
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,280


1218
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,440
What does this award sound like?

1219
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,380
I guess as soon as Pockets and Pisces...

1220
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:42,940

Innsville.

1234

Man, I don't dig anything that square.

1235
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:03,160
I'm so hip, I won't even eat a square meal.
