1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,020
The Albanian

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,760
Bob?

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,640
Bob?

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,260
Bob!

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,840
Bob?

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,600
Well, what do you think about Bob?

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,540
Why would I?

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,400
Mr. Merriam-Coleman?

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,840
Bob?

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,360
What about Bob?

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,360
Think for yourself.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:36,880
Bob?

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,720
Questions are now.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,160
Why?

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,380
Think for yourself.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,260
Think for yourself.

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,580
Question are now.

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,320
I don't think for yourself.

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,120
Question are now.

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,120


21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,840
Bob?

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,360
Bob?

23
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,860
Bob?

24
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,080
Bob?

25
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Bob?

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,840
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, Part Seven.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,960
Translated by Reverend Teters LaVerge.

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,480
from the shreds of a report made by an anonymous governmental agent.

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,240
The music in the background is by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

30
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,180
and I will now read the end of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,120
Chamelot, the place which I expected to look like a typical bomb shelter,

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,020
was more a mixture of a perverted hip swingers pad,

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,300
a communications center of the First Order,

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,960
a hillbilly's hovel, and a museum of oddities.

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,760
There was a large, stuffed, Bigfoot-looking creature

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,640
standing next to a utilitarian army surplus metal desk.

37
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,300
A bloody scimitar was crudely duct-taped to the thing's right hand,

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,860
and at the bottom of the statue, along with a pile of dusty humanoid skulls,

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,820
was a plaque that stated,

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:15,480
J.B. Exlatel Dobbs XIII, the Beaten Fist of Jehovah One.

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,620
I could not tell you if the thing was once a real beast or not,

42
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,720
but its furry body sure stank like the froth that Bob always smoked.

43
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,760
As I looked over the shelter-slash-swingers pad of Bob's,

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,100
mostly to find an alternate escape route,

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,760
I became aware of the fact that we were not alone.

46
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,380
For, from a far corner came the sound of shallow, rasping breaths.

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,380
Even after all the events that I had witnessed,

48
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,160
I still held some fear of the unknown in my heart.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,260
With trepidation, I slowly walked to the corner where the sounds emanated.

50
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
There, in an easy chair,

51
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,560
illuminated by the dim and wavy light of a lava lamp,

52
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,560
sat a...

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,340
grotesque version of what was once probably human.

54
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,360
Its face was a sickening parody.

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,900
It had a permanent sardonic grin,

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,580
and between its strained lips was a poorly grafted-on pipe,

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,880
much like Bob's.

58
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,920
The thing exuded a continuous soft and disgusting chuckle

59
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,700
that sounded like the sarcasm of the damned.

60
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,140
I found myself backing away,

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
but with a withered hand, the thing beckoned me to it.

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,780
He he he he, it chuckled.

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,160
Have I got a joke for you?

64
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,060
The thing then proceeded to tell a long rambling and incoherent joke

65
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,400
about a priest, a pink, and a yeti that go to some bar.

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,300
It made no sense whatsoever,

67
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,840
yet the creature kept laughing to itself as it puffed on its pipe.

68
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,020
I did not even notice that Bob had come over and was standing next to me

69
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,020
until he let out a room-shaking guffaw at what I suppose was the punchline,

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,740
which went something like this.

71
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,000
Something like,

72
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,720
humanity popping like a bunch of damn crawfish in a hot skillet.

73
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,960
I shook my head and told this thing before me to shut the hell up

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,220
and that we may be on the brink of atomic war.

75
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,460
Mr. Dobbs twisted my ear in a most painful manner

76
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,700
and, while patting the thing on its shoulder, said,

77
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,280
fuck them if they can't take a joke.

78
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
Suddenly, a very real and cold fear gripped my heart.

79
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,740
I asked Bob if he knew what he was talking about.

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,700
He knew something I didn't.

81
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,880
Did Khrushchev die of alcohol poisoning?

82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,920
Did the commies assassinate our president in retaliation?

83
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,360
Were we on the brink of atomic destruction?

84
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,980
Bob just played pocket pool and chuckled,

85
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,040
nuclear war is the least of your worries, young agent,

86
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,700
at least after last night's card game.

87
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,760
It was then that the room suddenly lit up in red lights

88
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,600
and a klaxon started to sound.

89
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,740
Bob jumped up and down like a child on Christmas Day,

90
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,800
yelling, that's Connie calling, that's Connie calling.

91
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,200
He skipped, I'm not kidding, skipped over to a video telephonic device.

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,060
There he sat down, fidgeting on a large leather swivel chair,

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,100
furiously playing pocket pool.

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,040
Hi, sweetie spleen, he said to the beautiful image of Connie on the video screen.

95
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,260
What are you doing in our Dallas compound?

96
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,340
Mr. Dobbs smiled stupidly as Connie said,

97
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,620
well, dearie, I had a little party.

98
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,380
at the compound last night and,

99
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,120
well, it would seem that I made a little joke with Jackie

100
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,000
about pranking the president.

101
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,420
You know what a card he is.

102
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,840
And it would seem that three of the doctors overheard.

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,260
Mr. Dobbs just nodded his head,

104
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,740
smiling as if he could picture the party in his, quote, mind, unquote.

105
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,360
Well, this morning those doctors got all drunked up

106
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,140
and took some rifles and, well, dearie,

107
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,860
it would seem that Dr. Oswald was a tad bit too tipsy

108
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,000
and grabbed some real bullets instead of the rubber kind.

109
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,180
Connie made a gesture and on the video screen appeared Dr. Oswald,

110
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,400
looking sheepish and more than a bit hungover.

111
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,480
Sorry, Bob, he said with a hangdog expression on his face,

112
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,720
obviously twisting his foot on the floor in shame.

113
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,240
Connie, as a reward, popped a pill in his mouth,

114
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,840
which he gobbled down like an obedient dog.

115
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,540
It's okay, Dr. Oswald, Bob said.

116
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,880
We all make mistakes.

117
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,840
Fuck up, man up, man shut the fuck up is the motto, isn't it?

118
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,460
I was shocked again at Bob's levity in situations of danger.

119
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,240
Well, fuck us if we can't take a joke.

120
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,900
Bob elbowed me so hard in the ribs that I fell over gasping.

121
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,940
Have Connie give you a few more pills and 50 cents to go see a movie.

122
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,840
I'll call Johnny Boy and clear the whole thing up.

123
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,820
Dr. Oswald nodded obediently and walked away from the screen,

124
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,660
grinning like a reprieved man chewing a big mouthful of pills.

125
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,560
Look, Connie, Bob said, where is Dr. Ruby?

126
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,920
He and the other doctors are down at his strip joint keeping the party going,

127
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,560
Connie replied, looking as radiant as ever.

128
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,840
Well, do me a favor, honey bunch of synapses,

129
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,920
and go down there and tell Dr. Ruby that I have a job for you.

130
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,820
I want him to take Dr. Oswald out, Bob said.

131
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,040
Will do, Connie chirped as they jiggled their fingers at their throats,

132
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,320
making a strange noise and hung up their video phones.

133
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,440
Bob then looked strangely thoughtful for a moment.

134
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:59,080
I guess I should have told Connie that the job was to get Dr. Oswald out of the country for a little bit.

135
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,160
Hmm.

136
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,240
He then pulled a folder full of photos from the desk drawer

137
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,600
and started to meticulously cut and paste Dr. Oswald's head onto various figures,

138
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,040
railroad conductors, nurses, dinosaurs, and figures of men holding rifles,

139
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,300
with crudely painted signs that said, I did it.

140
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,920
He sighed a lot during the process until the sighs became a sort of barking noise, guttural, animalistic.

141
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:35,000
He got up, smoothed the non-existent wrinkles from his trousers right before he pulled them down

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,760
and sat on a portable chemical toilet.

143
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,720
I averted my eyes until Bob yelled,

144
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,440
Gaze upon me, little pink!

145
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,260
I actually stumbled backwards at the timbre of his voice,

146
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,560
yet I found myself obeying his command as I dragged a metal folding chair over to him

147
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,960
and sat within a few mere inches from him as he did his best.

148
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,360
I was surprised to see that Bob was actually doing his business,

149
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,780
which in itself was odd, for as I gazed upon his face,

150
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,760
it turned rather vividly from green to red to blue and back to green again

151
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,560
until, with the sound of a million balloons popping simultaneously,

152
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,520
what was previously a very serious, strained look on his face

153
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,360
transformed into the usual moronic and placid visage

154
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,940
that I not only would see in person, but in my own mind as well,

155
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,600
when I closed my eyes.

156
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,840
I suspect that I was going insane.

157
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,260
From all the pills and slack, one could only guess.

158
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,440
My feeling of insanity was pretty much cemented

159
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,100
when Bob picked up a girly pink video phone

160
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,460
and called our still-living president.

161
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,440
It appeared that the SOB was a dipsomaniac, a whoremonger,

162
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
and still at that bordello in Florida.

163
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,820
A gray,

164
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,320
with a powder-blue bouffant wig came up on screen looking annoyed,

165
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,600
its huge eyes were clouded over and drunk,

166
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,680
as it rolled over and got the president on the phone.

167
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,160
Our president rubbed his red-rimmed eyes and,

168
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,600
in an irritated, stuttering voice, asked first if Jackie were there.

169
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,300
When soothingly reassured by Bob that she was back in Dallas,

170
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,140
he calmed down a bit until he was told of all that had transpired

171
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,660
in his besotted absence.

172
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,060
The president jumped out of bed.

173
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,520
He was clothed in a, and here it's blanked out, uniform,

174
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,920
a something uniform.

175
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,000
I lost all respect for him at that point,

176
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,520
but could only admire his obvious abilities as M blanked out, M blanked out.

177
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,960
Some M something, M something.

178
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,320
I personally suspect it might be Marilyn Monroe.

179
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,120
As the MM and the bouffantage of the president,

180
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,300
the red-gray kept adjusting the eye patch,

181
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,980
which it would seem covered the damage that MM had done to it the night before with a fork.

182
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,920
I listened in as the two of them conversed.

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,940
Bob kept trying to explain to the whining man that it's all right,

184
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,120
and that he, I'm not sure who he meant, didn't have to worry,

185
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,600
and because I've got it all under control.

186
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,380
The president threw another fit while Bob explained to him

187
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,040
that his trusted man, Dr. Oswald,

188
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,720
was the one who drunkenly grabbed the rifle with the real bullets.

189
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,320
The president suggested that they dispose of the assassinated clone,

190
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,720
and he himself could explain on TV that he was all right and it was just a scratch.

191
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,940
Bob snickered, saying that was a grand idea,

192
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,940
but obviously no eye patch is going to fool the necessary amount of people

193
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,780
when thousands saw half your head being blown off.

194
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,880
So just accept the island offer and shut up.

195
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,540
Bob rocked back in his swivel chair,

196
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,460
a smug look on his face as if he had just untied the Gordian knot.

197
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,780
He played pocket pool so hard I could hear the sound of pain.

198
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,380
The president glowered thoughtfully for a moment,

199
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,780
taking in the import of the situation he found himself in.

200
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,680
Okay, Mastek, he said, I'll take the deal.

201
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,800
Just tell Jackie that I'm getting stuff done with the Greys at Camp Canaveral

202
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,420
and send Dr. Oswald to me.

203
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,380
I have a few choice fists to show him.

204
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,040
Mr. Dobbs chuckled and mentioned that he already had Dr. Ruby on the job.

205
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,020
He is going to take him out of the country.

206
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,720
Bob then abruptly hung up the phone.

207
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,180
Did I tell Connie the out of the country part?

208
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,020
He looked serious for a few moments until the thing in the easy chair

209
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,980
started laughing insanely, yelling,

210
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,460
When Bob Dunn fucks up, people die!

211
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,620
And when Mr. Dobbs starts farting, the world starts...

212
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,140
Hehehehehehehehehehehehe.

213
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,140
I glared at the creature in disgust.

214
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,260
How could you joke at this moment?

215
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,300
I whispered an aside to Bob, asking what manner of foul creature it was

216
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,520
that sat in the corner.

217
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,280
Bob said loudly, ignoring my attempt at privacy,

218
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,120
pointing to the creature and laughing,

219
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,360
Hehehehehe, that is a mistake.

220
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,420
A genetic mistake like the alligator people you saw

221
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,260
in my grand moat of happiness outside the factory.

222
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,800
That mistake used to be as pink as you.

223
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,580
That was my middle hand man until it decided to retire

224
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,040
to a monastery in Tibet with a big bag of my personal stash of frop.

225
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,480
The thing we got back from the yeti monks was no longer human

226
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,340
but also not quite an overman.

227
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,280
So I decided to graft that pipe onto its face and make it frop up

228
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,520
24 hours a day just to see what would happen.

229
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,220
Young agent, what you see before you is the future of failure.

230
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,300
What you see is an over-under man.

231
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,640
The thing in the corner puffed its pipe and cackled like a madman.

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,200
You see, young agent, Bob told me,

233
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,900
that I now need you as my middle hand man.

234
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,400
I pondered the gravity of what he told me

235
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,980
as he put some atonal rumba music on the hi-fi

236
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,760
and walked over to the classy bar

237
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,860
to fix us a drink.

238
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,480
He did a poor job of hiding the spiking of my drink with pills

239
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,780
though he obviously tried to look innocent and hide his actions.

240
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,480
My heart dropped as he started to suddenly gyrate his hips

241
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,960
hula style when he glided over with my drink.

242
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,520
We were alone and I had no escape.

243
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,980
I feared the worst but knew that this was my duty.

244
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,680
Bob handed me the drink and suddenly got serious.

245
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,240
If you can ever call him that.

246
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,780
He heartily pfffwift the stuffy air that hung leaden in the shelter.

247
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,440
He told me not to worry too much,

248
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,340
that he'd find a way to make a buck out of the whole thing.

249
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,320
Without thinking I drank the cocktail down.

250
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,860
The room spun in a pleasant way and I noticed that

251
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,880
the little umbrella that he had put into the drink

252
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,800
was topped off with a small plastic bobbly head of the president.

253
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,740
The head had what looked like two heads.

254
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,960
It had two bullet holes in it.

255
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,800
I knew then that God help us if we cannot get this man squarely on our side.

256
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,140
Bob gyrated around me while my sight dimmed into a fearful tunnel

257
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,040
and my mind reeled at the import of this man's powers.

258
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,680
Bob stood over me as I slumped in the chair.

259
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,780
Boy, I have plans for you.

260
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,140
You're going to Dobbs Town for further instruction.

261
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,740
And a little itty bitty upper left hand

262
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,580
was the inspiration to open up that other hole.

263
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,140
I felt the room whirl as all faded out but his pipe,

264
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,160
his grin and that insufferable soft chuckling.

265
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,260
The end there of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs

266
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,620
until book two, Mr. Dobbs, or The Agent rather, goes to Dobbs Town.

267
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,740
A very painfully tragic story.

268
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:26,260
Translated, it says here, by Reverend Teeters LaVerge, 2011, conspiracy year.

269
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:35,740
So friends, I suppose if, well, whether we're still on earth after X Day 14 or not,

270
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,680
we'll hear the rest of the story.

271
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,520
The music in the background was by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

272
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,120
And now, this.

273
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,620
People fools pray to God who no one's a prayer.

274
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,520
He say he know Bob who bring fish and more.

275
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,580
Priest say no.

276
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,000
But Capitan say he bring great Bob.

277
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,240
People fools.

278
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,600
All right.

279
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,460
You stay.

280
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,340
No, no.

281
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,420
You hate Bob.

282
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:16,880
Bob.

283
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,520
No.

284
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,240
I'll be fine.

285
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,440
Just, uh, I'm not sure I want to leave you with Bob.

286
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,060
Because he gives me the creeps.

287
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:26,820
Bob.

288
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,380
Meets her.

289
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:27,840
Fuck.

290
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,180
Bob.

291
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,220
Yes.

292
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,940
And the child will be immortal.

293
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,940
Yeah, but there's a cat.

294
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,140
She has to live the rest of its life as some kind of half-assed fish in the sea.

295
00:17:51,160 --> 00:18:01,900
No matter who she is, Bob will be just as horrible .

296
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,920
Back in the day, you

297
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,720
had to kill all that involved with triggeredией.

298
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,300
Like creepy.

299
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,300


300
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,440
Wait, até champions?

301
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,780
Sky story.

302
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,060
Oh, yeah.

303
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:21,260
started isn't it? Freaks like you infiltrating, scouting out the lay of the land and then you

304
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:29,400
move in for the kill. I'm seeing history in the making. But my weapons are more powerful than

305
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:37,520
yours. Your own fears have created the means of your destruction. What happened out there?

306
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:44,580
Oh nothing much. Bob just tried to kill me twice in the last five minutes. I heard a roar and saw

307
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,160
a truck skidding towards me he told police. When I came to people were throwing coats over me.

308
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,360
I was pinned under a trailer axle. All around me people were groaning. I could hear cars still

309
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,340
colliding. Back in the east lane there was the ugly flat sound of a body being hit. The meat truck

310
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:06,000
driver from Iowa was struck run over twice and said bouncing through the snow. 30 feet away a

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,400
truck came by skidding on top of two cars. The college boy from the VW running back with a flare

312
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,560
was hit. Then his VW was smashed. A driver education officer said he was hit. I saw a car

313
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,140
stop. The teacher stopped his car and ran to help. A cross country bus came to a stop. Brakes

314
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:23,960
screeching. A truck hit him. Curled into a truck ahead. The back window of the bus blew out from

315
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,400
air compression. The whole front end fell open. People poured out from in pain. Cars began to be

316
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
tossed up the cliff leaving chrome hanging from the rocks. We will do our utmost to find the cause

317
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,220
of the delay. They bought most of the stock in August and paid cash for it. Our stock has not

318
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,320
risen above par since the first of the month. It is possible we shall find all the alfalfa we need

319
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,540
right here. The goods are now for sale at a price far below the original price. The goods are now

326
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,300
Oh my God, there's that Connie from... The Self Genius Hour of Swag.

327
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,460
Connie, before you say anything, there's something I need to get off my chest. I bought tickets to every raffle your church ever had, and I'm tapped out.

328
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,760
So whatever it is you came to say to me, I'm not interested.

329
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,620
Well, I'll just go then.

330
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh, by the way, my church had its raffle drawing yesterday. You won the grand prize.

331
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,840
I just gotta meet Bob.

332
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,380
Hold on.

333
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,520
I can't even tell the number.

334
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,360
Okay.

335
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,600
Wait a minute, I can't do this.

336
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,000
JR?

337
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:03,920
JR?

338
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,680
Hey JR, this is from Kansas, and I'm sort of a redneck.

339
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,380
Okay.

340
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,680
I don't know what I'm gonna do. I gotta work really hard.

341
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,520
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

342
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,980
I gotta work really hard.

343
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,860
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

344
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,300
I gotta work really hard.

345
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,220
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

346
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,680
I gotta work really hard to fit into it.

347
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,300
And we're slacking off.

348
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,580
Kitty.

349
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,240
Bebop.

350
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,600
Bebop.

351
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,080
Kitty.

352
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,840
Bebop.

353
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,100
Bebop.

354
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,620
Kitty.

355
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,320
Bebop.

356
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,100
Kitty.

357
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,600
Bebop.

358
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:33,900
Kitty.

359
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:33,900


360
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:33,900


361
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,500
Bebop.

362
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,060
Bebop.

363
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,100
Bebop.

364
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,380
I'm at the airport, and I'm having a lot of trouble getting on the plane.

365
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,720
No, Bob.

366
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,900
Bob, statistics prove that we're safer in the air than on the ground.

367
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,860
So will you watch your favorite time of the year?

368
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,960
The ripe golden days of summer?

369
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,240
The soft promise of spring?

370
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
The flaming glory of autumn?

371
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,580
The cold white magic of winter?

372
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,000
Whatever it is, there's something I know you'll enjoy in any season.

373
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,980
I keep thinking of you, baby.

374
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,960
Seeing you in the setting of all the four seasons of the year.

375
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,600
And always, whether you're stretched out in a beach or in a pool,

376
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,260
sitting in a beach chair under a summer sky,

377
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,740
or walking in the country during spring or fall,

378
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,440
or sitting by the fireside on a cold winter evening,

379
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,560
always I picture you puffing on your pipe, serene and gentle.

380
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,880
I can almost smell it now, so light, so rich in flavor.

381
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,580
Baby, someday I'll find you, and maybe your eyes will be brown instead of blue.

382
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,580
Maybe your hair will be blue.

383
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,580


384
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,580


385
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,580


386
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,580


387
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,320
Maybe your hair will be blonde instead of dark.

388
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,800
But this I know.

389
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,160
Brown eyes are blue.

390
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,280
Blonde hair are dark.

391
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,480
You'll be smoking a pipe.

392
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,940
How do I know?

393
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,880
Smoking a pipe just naturally goes with you, the finest guy in the world.

394
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,640
You can take that as a fact.

395
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,180
Muffin, did I sort of surprise you with that?

396
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,840
Of course, if it really becomes a success,

397
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,180
you'll be responsible, hon.

398
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,900
And it was you who demanded the records.

399
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,940
You see how I obey you, Angel?

400
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,520
That's cause I have no other love.

401
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,680
Angel, if I were to be led into a room full of handsome men,

402
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,920
do you know the man I'd go to?

403
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,820
You, baby.

404
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,160
And there are thousands of girls like me.

405
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,480
Virginia and Kentucky and the Orient.

406
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,000
So if you want to keep romancing your life, baby,

407
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,560
it'll please any gal you know.

408
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,200
For a gal loves to be near the man who's smoking a pipe.

409
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,640
Well, lover, another evening's been put in the pages of my memory book,

410
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,160
and I've adored every minute of it.

411
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,060
You're the prettiest thing that's ever happened to me,

412
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,760
so why don't you plan on being with me again tomorrow night?

413
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,580
Hah, a guy.

She's so outrageous in your face

428
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,820
An icon of desire and sex

429
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,680
Just like the girls from Planet X

430
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,300
A diva of debauchery

431
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,980
Mistress of hot swivery

472
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,540
You've assembled an interocitor, a treat of which few men are capable.

473
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,440
Tell me, Exeter, why should a communication device be equipped with a new toothbrush?

474
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,860
I don't know, and I don't want to know.

475
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,120
What exactly is a new toothbrush?

476
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:24,940
You okay?

477
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,740
And you?

478
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,520
Do you like a new...

479
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,420
Mutant, a treat of which few men are capable.

480
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,220
Where are we going?

481
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,840
To a planet we call Metaluna.

482
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,440
Metaluna?

483
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,360
Metaluna.

484
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:38,940
Metaluna?

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,840
Metaluna.

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,380
Metaluna?

487
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,380
Where are we going?

488
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,120
To a planet we call New Toothbrush.

489
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,320
Is Aegon a planet?

490
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,100
A planet that was once a comet, as you can see.

491
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,260
Why should a destructive ray be equipped with a communication device?

492
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,420
This is a mutant.

493
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,680
We've been breeding them here for ages to do.

494
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,460
I don't want to know.

495
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,920
Is Aegon a planet?

496
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,660
A planet that was once a spacecraft, as you can see.

497
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,220
This New Toothbrush are actually guiding the meteors against us.

498
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,980
All simple dwells in factory.

499

The.

506
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:10,980
Way.

507
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
What do you say?

508
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,560
What do you do?

509
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,600
Give me a sign.

510
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,420
I never did the dream.

511
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,300
It's a rule.

512
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,140
These drugs will lock the plant.

513
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,820
I laugh and run away.

514
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,840
What do you say?

515
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,680
What do you do?

516
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,740
Give me a sign.

517
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,560
I never did the dream.

518
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,420
It's a rule.

519
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,220
Two times a week, 20 years, enough.

520
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,360
All the same, I want more of this.

521
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,820
What do you say?

522
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,200
What do you say?

523
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,100
What do you do?

524
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,120
Everything's quite different.

525
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,040
It's a street.

526
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,860
How you do it?

527
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,560
Oh, yes, dear friends, and hello, Dave.

528
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,500
Dave?

529
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,440
Dave?

530
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,320
Dave?

531
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,460
I don't know if I want to go to that planet.

532
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,960
I don't know if I want to go to that planet with anybody like Agent Dobbs or Connie.

533
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,720
We trust you.

534
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,520
The band we were just listening to, by the way, was Zero Defects.

535
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,260
They're from Akron?

536
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,380
Akron?

537
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,880
Or some of them are from Akron.

538
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,560
Kent.

539
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,560
Oh, Kent.

540
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,380
Kent, yes.

541
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:20,220
Yes, Jimmy Image is in that band, and they will be at X Day.

542
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,580
Oh, cool.

543
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,320
Well, the one at Wisteria that starts in there.

544
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,880
Only a week.

545
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,680
Only a few more days.

546
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,660
Yeah, yeah.

547
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,680
Just a few more days.

548
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,860
A few more days, and everything will be just fine.

549
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,780
But just think of who, what, and when and where you're crusading for.

550
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,360
These people are not worthy of it.

551
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,020
I mean, just think of Dobbs, and think of Connie.

552
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,740
These people are terrible people.

553
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,720
No.

554
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,400
They can't tell the truth.

555
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,820
They don't know which reality they actually are in at which time.

556
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,040
They're terribly forgetful and cause all kinds of problems with those around them.

557
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,040
They argue incessantly about very, very, very strange things that most people can't understand.

558
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,980
Speak for yourself.

559
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,180
Well, that's just the impression I got.

560
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,240
It was a brilliant reading.

561
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,900
Oh, subgeniuses.

562
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,200
That describes most of the subgeniuses out there, doesn't it?

563
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,040
Angry, forgetful, sleepy, dumpy, hazy, dopey.

564
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,880
Yeah.

565
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,100
Did you say stumpy?

566
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,720
Yeah.

567
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:26,980
Yes.

568
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,520
That's at least four of them.

569
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,060
But, you know, they've got a lot of ball.

570
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,740
Dave, I have to do credits.

571
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,020
Besides zero.

572
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,480
Defects, which we just heard.

573
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,840
You know, that album of theirs has like 40 songs on it that are all 20 seconds long.

574
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,620
I thought the amino acids did quick songs.

575
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,100
Anyway, this island toothbrush was put together by Reverend Sweetness McGee of Ministry of Slack,

576
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,300
which is another subgenius show, but it's a podcast.

577
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,580
So you can look on our website to find that, subgenius.com.

578
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,780
Sister Connie was by the great Saint and Helen a Handbasket, and I don't know where they are either.

579
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,740
The Connie commercial, the actual commercial with the actual Connie Dobbs speaking,

580
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,740
was submitted by Onan Canobite.

581
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,640
The collage, there's that Connie, was by The Large.

582
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:28,600
The trailer accident involved the Firesign Theater, Radio Hour, Hour Number Two.

583
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,580
Let's Go Visit Bob was by Reverend Sweetness McGee, also of Ministry of Slack.

584
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,620
At the very beginning, The Large did the titles,

585
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:45,460
Cardinal Taper did a very short collage right after the titles.

586
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,060
And you know, Dave, The Agent and Mr. Dobbs,

587
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,800
that's going to be all out of whack for the listeners in WCSB Cleveland,

588
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,080
because we played part seven, the ending, tonight.

589
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:06,480
But next week, we'll be live with Dr. Howell and you, and hopefully Dr. Sinister,

590
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,800
and then we'll be gone for X Day in Starwood.

591
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,660
And then it's going to be reruns.

592
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,460
Hour of Slack number 311 and 312 are reruns.

593
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,000
They're appropriate for that.

594
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,960
But then 1313 has Agent and Mr. Dobbs Part Six.

595
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,160
This is Hour of Slack 1314.

596
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,180
So you see, the internet listeners and the ones on the other stations will hear them in order,

597
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,000
as will all of those who are ruptured onto the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

598
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,400
But that's only the saved subgeniuses on the true X Day.

599
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,240
That's only about 4%.

600
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,380
That's only about 40,000 or 50,000 people.

601
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:46,540
The rest of the world will be doomed never to hear that story in order.

602
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,980
Well, they will, of course, in the complementary dimensional realities that exist,

603
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,720
because just like Burroughs' excellent corpse,

604
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,260
not the one that's currently going around as a book,

605
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,680
but the actual excellent corpse of tiny pieces of things stuck together.

606
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,080
Exquisite corpse, do you mean?

607
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,200
The exquisite.

608
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,880
Yes, exquisite corpse.

609
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,180
Exquisite corpse.

610
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,360
Exquisite corpse.

611
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm sorry.

612
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:08,680
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,200
I'm sorry.

614
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,880
Obscene corpse.

615
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,500
It's all strung together loosely like pieces of flotsam and jetsam

616
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,600
and distributed equally amongst the poor and the rich alike.

617
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,000
So we see when Burroughs descends from heaven, you know,

618
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,540
like in the Beatnik movies where he used to come down,

619
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,040
then Bob comes up and rudely pushes him out of the way,

620
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,920
punches him in the stomach and calls him an old farty pants.

621
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,120
Then he begins to weep bitterly.

622
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,700
Things have been bad lately.

623
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,760
Things have gotten worse.

624
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,940
Get even in heaven.

625
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,300
That's the only place where you can play it, man.

626
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,260
Oh, Nan said that, actually.

627
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,660
I got a package from her.

628
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,300
On the back of the package, it said,

629
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,460
Get even in heaven.

630
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,840
And I thought, well, that would make more sense if it was get even in heaven

631
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,180
or if it was get Evan in heaven.

632
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,180
It just didn't read right, you know?

633
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,060
I think it's probably the thing in the middle of your forehead acting up again.

634
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,220
And I think sometimes when that thing's out of alignment, you need to,

635
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,280
Oh, I hope not.

636
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,440
just sit down for a little while.

637
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:16,820
And, you know, I've noticed lately there have been a lot of realities colliding.

638
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,280
A lot of, like, shapes that kind of look like the thing in the Bob room there in the story.

639
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:29,180
The little animal-like thing was kind of like, or not an animal, but a machine kind of like.

640
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,820
There have been some realities colliding for some people.

641
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,480
Not everybody has that problem, Dave.

642
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,380
Well, we couldn't say.

643
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,980
Sure, if we were truly epistemologically correct,

644
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:46,280
the scientific method wouldn't prefer any one group of life to another one.

645
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,020
They would just assume until proven incorrect or correct,

646
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,140
they were all just sort of batty-whistling poppycocks.

647
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,460
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, watch your language.

648
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,780
Watch them.

649
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,000
Watch them languages, boy.

650
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,240
Watch the fur on the lip there, buddy boy.

651
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:01,900
Hey, uh.

652
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,500
Squirrels are out tonight.

653
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,020
Let's see.

654
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,580
Princess Wee is here tonight, as you can hear.

655
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,480
Wee.

656
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,960
Yes, I am here tonight.

657
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,580
To win some laughter.

658
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,320
At least some portions of my brain are here,

659
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,540
the ones that aren't concentrating on the Starwood Festival.

660
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,980
Making Starwood.

661
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,940
Making Starwood.

662
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,300
It's a lot harder to make Starwood than it is to make X-Day,

663
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,920
even though they're in the same place.

664
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:30,820
Yes.

665
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,060
Near Athens, which we visited, by the way, on our way to Texas.

666
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,140
And we did a special photo.

667
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:43,160
We did a photo essay of the environs of Athens and Wisteria Campground,

668
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,100
which is new on subgenius.com,

669
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,380
on the events page,

670
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,880
which I'm looking at right now on our compute tower,

671
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,860
our syntactic device here in the station.

672
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,640
And you know what else it says?

673
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,620
On June 24th, I can say this because I don't stand to make a dime.

674
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,500
On June 24th, there's a subgenius world destruction event in Shanghai, China.

675
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,400
Wee-haw.

676
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,620
Just directly the opposite side of the world from Athens.

677
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,300
Hoon-haw.

678
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,160
Yes, exactly.

679
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,880
After Reverend Shining Path of Least Resistance finishes preaching there,

680
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,960
he can dig his way straight up.

681
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,940
It would be down for him, it would seem.

682
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,880
And it would emerge in Wisteria near Athens, Ohio,

683
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,460
which Athens turned out to be a fun town.

684
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,600
But of course.

685
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,360
Of course, I already knew that because I went to college there, silly.

686
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,100
You went to Ohio U?

687
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,620
I most certainly did.

688
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,900
Oh my God, so did my ex-wife.

689
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,380
I didn't complete it, but I did go there in 1973.

690
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,800
Oh my God.

691
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,580
And it still looks just like my wife.

692
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,520
I was accidentally married to you.

693
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,600
It does look exactly like 1973.

694
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,780
Princess Wee looks like she's from 1973.

695
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,440
And Athens still.

696
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,260
Actually, it looked just to me like Austin, Texas in 1973.

697
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,320
But Austin doesn't look that way any longer.

698
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,400
I saw a recent video from Austin,

699
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,080
and you could tell the people were visibly suffering outside.

700
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,580
They were just talking normally and speaking

701
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,040
and loading up a van full of musical equipment.

702
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,940
And you could tell it was probably 100 and something plus out there.

703
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,580
They had a funny look on their face.

704
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,360
And their bum cheeks were so tight.

705
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,760
I don't mean that in a heterosexual way.

706
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,100
Well, we weren't as far south as Austin,

707
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,720
but we were in Stangsville and Stang County,

708
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,020
which is kind of south of Fort Worth.

709
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,580
And it was about 110 degrees.

710
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,240
You had to run from your car to the church,

711
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,740
which is where my nephew got married.

712
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,640
By the way, we also,

713
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,460
we also,

714
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,240
we also snuck into the bachelor party

715
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,840
that my nephew had with his buds

716
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,540
and other things in the Back 40,

717
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,720
which was kind of scary.

718
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,060
Because the Back 40 is about 600 acres back.

719
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,420
Of wild.

720
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,560
600 acres of wild.

721
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,640
We were expecting to hear a bunch of drunken jocks.

722
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,100
And the funny thing was,

723
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,140
those young fellas,

724
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,160
it was just like when you walk around at X Day.

725
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,780
You expect them to be,

726
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,480
to talk,

727
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,220
to talk and stupid,

728
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,140
but they're talking about life,

729
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,600
the universe and everything.

730
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,540
And how can we,

731
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,000
how can we have slack in a world of the conspiracy?

732
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,640
Of course,

733
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,740
they didn't all use subgenius jargon yet.

734
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,540
Although we're working on that.

735
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,360
We're working on that.

736
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,780
So I have hope for the youth,

737
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,480
the youths of today.

738
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,220
And youths is about all we're going to have at X Day this year,

739
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,640
I think.

740
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,860
The old people are all dying off or getting deaf

741
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,400
or,

742
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
or broke or something.

743
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,060
Although Dr.

744
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,820
Lagoon is,

745
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,680
is going to crawl all the way up there.

746
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:13,820
Dr.

747
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,560
Lagoon has probably will be crawling there with sub body parts donated by

748
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,600
people along the way.

749
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:19,900
Yeah.

750
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,640
And he's 10 years younger than me.

751
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,880
He's a hardy fellow.

752
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,060
The Reverend Susie,

753
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:30,260
the floozy and will somehow float there with a priestess Pisces.

754
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,820
And Dr.

755
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,500
Howell will be here in this.

756
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,380
Studio next week.

757
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:38,580
Dr.

758
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,540
Howell.

759
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,060
Yeah.

760
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,480
That's askdrhowell.com.

761
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,960
Dr.

762
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,660
Dark will be showing his drive fence and we'll have a grind house,

763
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,300
a 24 hour horrible,

764
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,100
horrible,

765
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,000
horrible movies.

766
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,180
Many very worst.

767
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,700
The,

768
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,020
the amino acids will not be there,

769
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,000
but the evolution control committee will and fat free and fat man be.

770
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,560
And I'm going to be a little bit more of a,

771
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:05,560


772
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:05,560


773
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:05,560


774
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,700
and lots of other fat people spelled with a pH and with an F either way,

775
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,460
both at the same time,

776
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,800
Tommy,

777
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,680
me back will be crawling around.

778
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,800
DJ two beans will be having something.

779
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,300
The Duke of Uke,

780
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:22,560
Andrew,

781
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:29,440
the impaled and in the background now boron nozzle.

782
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,240
Did I write nuzzle on this?

783
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,680
I did.

784
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,120
I missed.

785
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,540
No,

786
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,140
you didn't call him boron nozzle.

787
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,540
You called him boring.

788
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,320
Nuzzle.

789
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,720
I get all mixed up.

790
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,600
I can't remember.

791
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,880
Well,

792
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:48,140
perhaps you're having a strange auto erotic fantasies with yourself.

793
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,600
I told you.

794
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,320
Oh,

795
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,080
when did that ever stop,

796
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,640
dude?

797
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,240
Well,

798
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,460
the device and your subgenius is all about.

799
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,180
I know,

800
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,720
but you can,

801
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,740
you can change the climate control,

802
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,520
but just by twisting that thing a little bit,

803
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:03,520


804
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,380
you can tweak it any way you want.

805
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,700
You could,

806
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,540
you could make it a sunshiny,

807
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,660
beautiful 78 degree day every day for the rest of your life and not give a damn.

808
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,360
All you have to do is just,

809
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,440
just get up there and get in front of the mirror a little bit and move it around and you'll feel the difference.

810
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,460
Did you just say something about my friend reverend and give a damn?

811
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,940
I said he was a disreputable woman.

812
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,420
Israel don't give it.

813
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,400
Didn't give it them.

814
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,240
Franklin Israel didn't give it.

815
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,360
Franklin I didn't give it.

816
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:33,760
Uh-huh.

817
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,100
Frankly,

818
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,660
he's my buddy on Facebook.

819
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,220
Franklin I don't give a damn.

820
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,160
He and my friend Don Quixote.

821
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,580
And you chased windmills with this lad,

822
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,120
I suppose.

823
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,200
Speaking of windmills,

824
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:54,040
isn't it that the Cleveland scene has a front page of giant wind turbines,

825
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,780
fictional drawing of them.

826
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,420
But Princess,

827
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,240
we and I had a creepy,

828
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,220
creepy moment driving through town.

829
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,360
We were driving through Texas in the dead of night,

830
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,900
the wee hours of the morning.

831
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,960
Did we already tell the audience about this?

832
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,960
It was like in,

833
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,400
from the highway.

834
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,100
When you kill the birds.

835
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,340
You could see these blinking red lights,

836
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:23,480
all synchronized or almost all synchronized for as far as the eye can see.

837
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,780
And I'm not exaggerating.

838
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,960
We thought X day had come early.

839
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,900
We really did.

840
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,560
And then Princess,

841
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,020
we figured out it was a wind turbines.

842
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,340
We just couldn't see him.

843
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,560
We could only see the flashing light at the top.

844
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,860
The kept playing and birds away.

845
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:45,380
Except the birds are attracted to red flashing lights and hamsters to all sorts of little critters get crushed up by those things.

846
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,500
And just think how they lay them out and just endless synchronicity.

847
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,440
One after the other.

848
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Those animals are all going to be killed by each other.

849
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,000
If it's not a wind turbine,

850
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,660
it's going to be some other animal.

851
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,220
Well,

852
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,700
the gloating and the bursting of the birds in the air.

853
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,900
Maybe glad that I still had some hair and I at least belong to the right patriotic front.

854
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:04,880
The mammals.

855
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:05,820
No,

856
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,400
me.

857
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,660
The mammals can do as they please.

858
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,060
I hope.

859
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,400
Oh,

860
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,100
that's why I forgot.

861
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,100
You're not really part of that same.

862
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,500
You're not even part of the animal kingdom.

863
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,060
Exactly.

864
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:15,860
Or I'm,

865
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,660
I am part.

866
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:24,800
I am a sort of like algae is sort of a plant and sort of an animal like a platypus duck.

867
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,440
My friend,

868
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,140
kind of an equine sort.

869
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,740
I like to ride horses.

870
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,260
My favorite film was exiting the factory factory by Lumiere.

871
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,180
I like the color blue and long walks.

872
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:37,980
Oh,

873
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,540
nevermind.

874
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,560
Nevermind me.

875
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,700
You're just reading off your own Facebook page,

876
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,220
aren't you?

877
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:43,860
Yeah,

878
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,800
I'm right.

879
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,660
What's your Facebook page?

880
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,120
Dave,

881
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,240
I was asking the same question a year ago and they,

882
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,360
and finally leg in.

883
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:52,740
It was,

884
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,120
he goes,

885
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,600
dang,

886
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,900
you sound like an old man talking about Facebook.

887
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,520
You sound like old people that say,

888
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,360
I'm not going to use that dang telephone,

889
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,660
that modern day thing.

890
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:08,660
So I finally had to give up and join the human race.

891
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,320
Isn't it just a horrific thing,

892
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,260
an awful thing to actually join them.

893
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,560
Oh man.

894
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,920
And all their things,

895
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,560
you know,

896
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,700
their things,

897
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,940
they stand for and stand on like each other.

898
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,500
Yeah.

899
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,980
It's like Yertle the turtle brought to life.

900
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,560
The pyramid,

901
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,080
you know,

902
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,340
in,

903
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:35,900
in reverse,

904
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,800
it's like the,

905
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,360
the,

906
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,220
oh man,

907
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,580
I can't forget the business model.

908
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,380
I had to,

909
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,320
I was forced to,

910
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,960
it's just dog eat dog.

911
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,880
The rule of the beak of claw nature,

912
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,740
red and green.

913
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,080
Hot dog.

914
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,340
Hot dog.

915
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,320
Hot dog.

916
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,880
It's a mighty,

917
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,680
mighty dog eat dog.

918
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,760
Dog is our Lord.

919
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,740
Hot dog.

920
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,200
To paraphrase the old Firesign Theater guys.

921
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,280
You know,

922
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,560
they still are on the air.

923
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,600
They're doing a podcast.

924
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,940
The Firesign Theater are.

925
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,320
You can hear them new live at thefiresigntheatre.com.

926
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:22,200
I haven't actually ever listened to one because I've been having so much fun listening to their 41 year old shows.

927
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,300
Yes.

928
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,900
I'm sorry.

929
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,460
I beg.

930
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:25,820
I beg.

931
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,720
Yes.

932
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,120
Who was it?

933
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,280
Oh,

934
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,560
it was my sister and a friend were talking about how they were,

935
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:39,060
they were bemoaning how dumb to say a toy given 21 year old was,

936
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,480
or not necessarily dumb,

937
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,960
but naive.

938
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,520
Shall we say they're smarter than anybody my age.

939
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,220
They're just a thousand times less informed.

940
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,420
And our friend pointed out,

941
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,080
well,

942
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,440
21 year old is only 11 years older than a 10 year old.

943
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,480
A 19 year old is only nine years older than a 10 year old.

944
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,720
And I was like,

945
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,860
that really,

946
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,560
that could pop a 25 year old's balloon.

947
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,160
It's like,

948
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,380
what?

949
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,240
I'm only 15 years older than a 10 year old.

950
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,160
But to them,

951
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,780
that seems like a long time.

952
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,820
Now to you or I,

953
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,400
it's just,

954
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,220
if it's a,

955
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,020
it just flew by like nothing.

956
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,180
I was talking to Pappy since it was Pappy's day.

957
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,980
He says it only gets worse.

958
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,440
A day goes by.

959
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,540
Like a half a second,

960
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,960
a month goes by like a minute.

961
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,520
A year goes by like a day.

962
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,740
And it wasn't a very good day either actually.

963
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,720
Well,

964
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,020
just think of all those people in Japan right now.

965
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,320
I think they're kind of wishing a,

966
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:41,660
you know,

967
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,680
a half life would go like maybe in four months or something.

968
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,140
Yeah.

969
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:45,620
Yeah.

970
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,640
I guess so.

971
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,120
You know,

972
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,280
keep your fingers crossed,

973
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,960
but it's not,

974
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,340
you know,

975
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,020
your fingers will be a skeletal looking thing by the time,

976
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,340
or it won't be anything,

977
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,220
but calcium deposit.

978
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:56,760
Well,

979
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,800
my fingers are,

980
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,120
have grown into a cross position,

981
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,800
but partly from lying so much.

982
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,860
Every time I pray to Bob,

983
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,000
you know,

984
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:06,340
they grow,

985
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,740
the bones have become conjoined.

986
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,420
Well,

987
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,660
if you really want to get that long fingernails,

988
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,020
evil Fu Manchu look,

989
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:20,760
there's no other way to get it other than to have the distension of your metacarpals and metatarsals,

990
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,560
or whichever ones are in your fingers.

991
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,420
So speaking of Father's Day,

992
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,280
which it won't be anywhere near when most people hear this,

993
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:29,980
you're a dad,

994
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:30,480
aren't you,

995
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:30,760
Dave?

996
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,680
I was,

997
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,620
and I still am.

998
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:32,940
Yeah,

999
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,660
he still is.

1000
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,480
I talked to my grandson on the phone today,

1001
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,460
the youngest one,

1002
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,820
who's not even a year old.

1003
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,020
And he already speaks better than you do.

1004
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:43,720
Well,

1005
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,820
he says taco better than I do,

1006
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,540
but it's the only thing he can say.

1007
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,000
Honestly,

1008
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,300
he,

1009
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:50,760
you know,

1010
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,100
taco,

1011
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:51,640
taco,

1012
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:51,720
taco,

1013
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,120
taco,

1014
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,520
taco,

1015
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:52,880
taco.

1016
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,220
His pronunciation,

1017
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,440
that was excellent.

1018
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,020
As far as I can tell.

1019
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,260
And I'm from Texas,

1020
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,040
so I should know.

1021
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,360
The correct pronunciation of taco?

1022
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:02,720
Yeah,

1023
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,560
but he's from LA,

1024
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,960
so he should know even better.

1025
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,520
Now reference tank.

1026
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,120
Uh huh.

1027
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,080
You told me.

1028
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,180
Now who says burrito the right way?

1029
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,360
Who says enchilada the most perfectly in the USA,

1030
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,020
I wonder?

1031
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,100
I don't know.

1032
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:14,740
Ain't,

1033
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,680
it ain't me saying it.

1034
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,780
It ain't me neither.

1035
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:18,580
I,

1036
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:18,940
I,

1037
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,940
I can't say it.

1038
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,360
Some people,

1039
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,080
Princess,

1040
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,940
we gives me a hard time over the way I say envelope instead of envelope.

1041
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,120
And orange cause he says ar-ange as if you were from Manhattan or something.

1042
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,480
Well,

1043
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,060
that's,

1044
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:32,860
Reverend Stang,

1045
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:40,800
you did tell me that I could go on and on and on about Starwood festival because I don't ever stand to earn a single penny.

1046
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,680
And it is true.

1047
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,940
And you're not a member of the station.

1048
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,420
No.

1049
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,000
You're a guest.

1050
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,800
I am a guest.

1051
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,800
And so I'm just going to take this moment by storm and say that there will be,

1052
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,280
Reverend Ivan Stang speaking at Starwood Festival.

1053
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:53,700
Wait a minute,

1054
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,120
wait a minute,

1055
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,380
wait a minute.

1056
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:54,820
You just look.

1057
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,460
Now I can't get paid.

1058
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,740
And Joost van der Liesch from,

1059
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,520
I wasn't actually going to get paid anything.

1060
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,140
From Amsterdam.

1061
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:01,540
Well,

1062
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,400
he doesn't get paid.

1063
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:02,460


1064
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:02,680
Joost,

1065
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,160
Joost,

1066
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,460
is a subgenius who teaches neuro-linguistic programming.

1067
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,400
Joost,

1068
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,260
Joost van der Liesch.

1069
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,660
He will be doing a workshop on the neurogram,

1070
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,940
a synthesis of the enneagram and a thing that he has devised.

1071
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,980
It's called the neurogram.

1072
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,240
It has to do with neuro-linguistic programming,

1073
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,280
synthesized with the enneagram.

1074
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,820
And then we have the punk rock Zen Buddhist priest,

1075
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,200
Brad Warner.

1076
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,320
Heard earlier in Zero Defects.

1077
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:36,880
Absolutely.

1078
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,060
He's the bass player.

1079
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,260
Andrea Vitimus,

1080
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:45,060
a hands-on chaos magic author who lives in Berea,

1081
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:45,400
Ohio.

1082
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,700
And then we have a church of all worlds,

1083
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,980
Oberyn Zell Ravenheart.

1084
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,140
And then we have Donald Michael Craig,

1085
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,880
who wrote Modern Magic and Halim El Dab,

1086
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,040
who is the ethnomusicologist.

1087
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,540
The grandfather of Dabs El Dab.

1088
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:11,140
And Harvey Wasserman talking about alternative activism and being his alternative historian.

1089
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,020
Harvey Wasserman is the only one who's not making all that crap up.

1090
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,340
Was he a gynecologist?

1091
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,280
I thought he was a gynecologist.

1092
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,460
I would say the same thing to any one of these guys.

1093
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,920
They're almost all friends of mine.

1094
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,560
And Halim.

1095
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,880
Halim's a musician.

1096
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:24,620
He's a composer.

1097
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,480
So of course.

1098
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,280
He's a fine composer.

1099
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,300
He's paid to lie.

1100
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,860
All music is a lie.

1101
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,900
Only noise is true.

1102
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,580
The music is artificial.

1103
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,880
Like in the background here,

1104
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,620
heard by Sid Redmond.

1105
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:38,680
That's platonic thought.

1106
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,640
That's what Plato believed.

1107
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,540
He believed that music and speech were the devil,

1108
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,460
so to speak.

1109
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,260
That they aroused the passions of men and did not quiet them down to the point of being

1110
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,260


1111
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,260


1112
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,260


1113
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,260


1114
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,260


1115
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,260


1116
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,960
a yogic state where they could blissfully chop water and then scoop the wood.

1117
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:53,660
Right.

1118
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,340
I get that.

1119
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,860
I understand that's too late for me or any of us born in this world.

1120
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,000
Well, you are wearing the saffron robes of the Church of the Subcontinent.

1121
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:10,380
It's so possible our friend, Littal Mistarsistar, might still have a chance at that level of

1122
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,880
purity of experience.

1123
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,780
He's like a born Zen something.

1124
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,240
He's a Zen.

1125
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,240


1126
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,500
He's pretty Zen-y.

1127
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,520
Yeah, he's pretty Zen-y, all right.

1128
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:31,620
But, you know, most of us, our heads are all cluttered with words and music and images.

1129
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,220
Broken chairs.

1130
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:39,820
Picture endless, endless images of naked women with big smiles on their faces.

1131
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,080
Of course.

1132
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:41,840
Leaning.

1133
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,320
They always seem to be in the same room.

1134
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,040
Reruns of those bad scenes in the bus when he started vomiting.

1135
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:48,220
Yeah.

1136
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,740
He was vomiting that one day and couldn't get off the bus.

1137
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:49,740


1138
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:50,000
Oh, yeah.

1139
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,280
Oh, you were there too.

1140
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:51,840
That's right.

1141
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,460
Yeah.

1142
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,440
All those days.

1143
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,760
Well, there were five of us.

1144
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,580
They kept on running the whole scene over and over again for five of us.

1145
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,640
Every single day happened to us.

1146
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,680
We all puked on that bus.

1147
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,280
We were all pukers on that bus forever and ever and ever.

1148
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,020
It was pukers all the way down.

1149
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,400
Yeah.

1150
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:15,500
I just realized that the Fireside Theater was listening to the old radio show X-1 quite

1151
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,620
a great deal.

1152
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:25,640
I don't think it was Mars is Heaven or perhaps the Seventh Order, but one of the episodes

1153
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:34,180
of X-1 has not only Ostman and Bergman, but oh good Lord, that's his name.

1154
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:34,940
Acting in it?

1155
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,360
You mean acting in it?

1156
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:36,800
Acting in it?

1157
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,580
Phil Ostman?

1158
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,560
Yes.

1159
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:46,120
Had those three anyway, or yes, all singing the same notes, so to speak.

1160
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:46,600
Yeah.

1161
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:46,600


1162
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:46,600


1163
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:53,500
They're characterizations, the vocal characterizations of the doctor in the Space Commander, the

1164
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,320
kind of bozos-ish robot voice.

1165
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,960
Well, just as we grew up on Fireside Theater, they didn't have as much TV as we did, so

1166
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,500
they grew up on radio plays.

1167
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:12,880
Hence the fact that they, and later on you, Dave, wrote radio scripts.

1168
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,360
You and Psycho Pathfinder.

1169
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,640
How come I never did that?

1170
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,060
Oh well.

1171
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:17,920
You never did it?

1172
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,040
Because there were other things you prefer to do with your left hand.

1173
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,900
Now, while I have a chance, that was only eight speakers out of probably seventy speakers

1174
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,640
that will be there teaching everything from different styles of drumming and dancing to-

1175
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,720
But tell me, is there going to be any speech therapists there?

1176
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,580
That's what we need.

1177
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,960
For the other-

1178
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,540
No, no, no, no.

1179
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,460
For the other forty, fifty speakers.

1180
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,940
The bands, actually, you know, I've been to twenty Starwoods.

1181
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,940
And I have gone to maybe one or two workshops, and those were all involuntary.

1182
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,900
Because, remember that time we woke up and they were having the obese people's nude zen

1183
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,260
massage?

1184
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,300
Oh, you'll never forget that, will you, dear?

1185
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,300
Yeah.

1186
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,000
But the bands are great.

1187
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,840
I've never, I've almost never seen a terrible musician there.

1188
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,040
Quite unusual bands, too.

1189
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,300
So maybe one Bartek Circle.

1190
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,320
Often, like, also in X Day, although that's probably not commercial.

1191
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:13,820
No.

1192
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:13,900
Right.

1193
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,060
Right now at X Day we invite especially bad bands at times.

1194
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:23,220
And sometimes they fly in on a helicopter and they are, they pay for their own way to get there.

1195
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,320
It's the only way to get rid of the pinks, man.

1196
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,020
Well, and also the-

1197
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:32,040
It's audience elimination techniques as exercised by Doctors for Bob.

1198
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,440
That's who I ought to put on next.

1199
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,240
I just-

1200
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,120
All right.

1201
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,020
I'm going to just spit out the names of just a few bands.

1202
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,640
You bet.

1203
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:43,880
Troubadours of Divine Bliss, Telling Point, Mayan Ruins, More Than Love.

1204
00:55:43,880 --> 00:56:01,200
Morticia's Chair, Kenny Kline's Jug Band, Waking Dream, Broccoli Samurai, Elemental Groove Theory, World Collision, Cabinet, and Chicago Afrobeat Project, just to name a few.

1205
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,480
Wow.

1206
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,500
What a wide, eclectic variety of sounds.

1207
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,220
We were hoping you'd think so.

1208
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,480
But that is just the very names themselves.

1209
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,980
You can tell the genres of the various bands.

1210
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,960
It's quite varied.

1211
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,700
Thank you, Dave.

1212
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:17,940
Thank you.

1213
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:25,180
And perhaps if you might weigh your whistle in some other way, like the average pecker would, maybe hanging from a tree or shouting at the stars.

1214
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,280
Would he though?

1215
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:26,900
Would he?

1216
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:27,740
Truly.

1217
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,440
Didn't Einstein's Secret Orchestra play at Starwood every year just about for a long time?

1218
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,980
For three years until we decided that we had to be in charge of everything.

1219
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,720
Come on.

1220
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:49,300
Even though there were 400 other bands playing there, it was Einstein's favorite orchestra.

1221
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,880
The Pufferdome had to be moved to center stage.

1222
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,300
I wish I could say more about the Pufferdome.

1223
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,360
I hear the Doctors again.

1224
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,400
Yeah, it's Doctors for Bob in the background.

1225
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:07,060
We stayed with the bass player of that band, Sterno, who's now in about five other bands.

1226
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,100
And he learned how to play the sax from YouTube.

1227
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,480
Wow.

1228
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:18,060
And he got a crazy, crazy sax that has the lower keys on the other side from where they usually are.

1229
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,380
Yeah, he got a freak sax.

1230
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,140
That was gifted to him by a musician friend of his.

1231
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:28,260
Speaking of freak sax, it's better to get your YouTubes from the background than from a foreskin.

1232
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,260
I mean, if you're learning how to play it the right way.

1233
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:36,520
Friends, speaking of free slacks, this is the free Hour of Slack ending.

1234
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:41,460
Now, if you need more information about the Church of the Subgenius, which is the...

1235
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:47,400
...the religion this is all about, you can look at subgenius.com.

1236
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,080
There's no O in subgenius.

1237
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,820
God, I...you know...well, let's not go into that.

1238
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,560
And we have to go now.

1239
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,280
We have to go.

1240
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,680
I'm going to play one last little thing.

1241
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,800
I think Ministry of Slack did that's wonderful.

1242
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,440
So, Dave, do you have one last thing to say?

1243
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:07,920
Just one?

1244
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,440
I would just like to thank all the people...

1245
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,340
I said one.

1246
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:13,780
Oh, gee.

1247
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:15,960
That was it.

1248
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:16,520
Geez.

1249
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,100
See, now we've got another religion involved.

1250
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,420
All right, okay, let's just listen.

1251
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,420
I'll turn down doctors and we'll play this.

1252
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,180
Ladies and gentlemen, someone once said, Bob's the true democracy.

1253
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,900
That's why we in America can smile when we tell the stories of the legendary heroes...

1254
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,520
...who helped build our country's great industries and institutions.

1255
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,420
Take Bob for a ride.

1256
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,420


1257
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:41,860
Bob, for example.

1258
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,300
What made us the greatest in the world?

1259
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,260
Ask any worker and the answer will be the same.

1260
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,380
Bob, the giant whose body was made of pure steel.

1261
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,340
They'll tell you Bob made cannonballs by squeezing workers' balls with his fists between his fingers.

1262
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,020
Fists between his fingers with his fists.

1263
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,880
Balls between his fists.

1264
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,660
Hot balls, hot fingers.

1265
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,800
Fists, fists, fists, balls, fingers.

1266
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,420
Fists, fingers, fists.

1267
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,500
Fists, balls, fingers.

1268
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,520
Fingers, fingers, fingers.

1269
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,300
Molten steel.

1270
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,760
Hot steel.

1271
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,500
Hot, hot, hot.

1272
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,600
Steel in his hands.

1273
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,780
Rolling the hot steel in his hands.

1274
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,680
In his hands.

1275
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,000
Hands, hands, hands.

1276
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:28,500
Fingers.

1277
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,620
Balls.

1278
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,600
Butterballs.

1279
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,580
Hot balls.

1280
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,520
Hot butter.

1281
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,020
Hot butter.

1282
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,640
Balls.

1283
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,380
Hot man butter.

1284
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,260
A legend?

1285
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,720
Sure is Bob.

1286
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,160
There's a legend in someone who existed only in the

1287
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:44,860
Sonic, Sonic.

1288
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,300
To those who have handed down our American folklore.

1289
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,020
But Bob is also a spirit.

1290
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,120
The spirit of those men who

1291
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,340
Sonic, Sonic, Sonic.

1292
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,680
Yes it is Bob.

1293
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,120
Let's just tell stories of our industries, institutions, and legendary heroes

1294
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,660
with a twinkle in our eyes and a teabag on our throats.

1295
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,040
And so long as we continue to laugh together as a people,

1296
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,140
we will live together as a nation.

1297
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,720
Thank you very much.

1298
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:10,900
.

1299
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:10,900


1300
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,040
.

1301
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:13,360
.

1302
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:13,560
.

1303
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:13,860
.

1304
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,040
.

1305
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:14,480
.

1306
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:14,680
.

1307
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,080
.

1308
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:15,400
.

1309
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:15,400


1310
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:15,400


1311
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:15,400


1312
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:15,400


1313
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:15,400


1314
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:15,400


1315
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:15,380
