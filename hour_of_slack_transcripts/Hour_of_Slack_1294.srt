1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
The second point of our theme is happiness of mind.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,960
Unless the boy has health, he cannot have complete happiness.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,360
And there are many other ingredients also which go to make happiness.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,360
Companionship with friends of his own age is one of them.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,880
The gang has its natural attraction for the boy

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,340
and forms his environment with lessons which last him for life.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,580
These may be good, but quite as often are evil.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,800
It is up to us to give him a gang which will bring him good influences and cheery comradeship.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,400
And now, the Self-Genius Hour of Slack!

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,020
Then, a step as important as any to happiness is the opportunity for self-expression.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,620
If a boy is encouraged to have slack of some sort,

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,560
he is not a self-genius.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:56,560


14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,540
He is no longer bored and at a loose end.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,340
It is the slacker who is always ready for the companionship

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,100
of him who finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,040
The following order is to be carried out immediately.

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,960
You will all disrobe and lean over the bed with your buttocks raised.

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,720
Now let's you just drop them pants.

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,120
Drop?

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,840
Just take them right off.

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,400
Well, I can't shake it off of my back.

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:30,820
Damn.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,900
It's either too tight or it's too slack.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,540
The choice is yours.

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,460
Obey me and live or disobey and die.

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,460
Dull, dull, dull, your lives are oh so dull.

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,120
You stay inside your sealed house and cower like a frightened mouse.

29
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,760
Dull, dull, dull, your lives are oh so dull.

30
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,100
You sit inside your bunkers with filters all around.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,940
What kind of a life is that when you spend it underground?

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
You never venture outdoors, you always stay inside.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,480
What kind of a life is that when all you do is,

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,020
hide?

35
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,840
Dull, dull, dull, your lives are oh so dull.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, my aching back.

37
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,080
Someone help me, please.

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,360
Young, young, young, how stupid are the young?

39
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,860
A brick could fall upon your head.

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,780
We'd rather stay indoors instead.

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,900
Young, young, young, so foolish are the young.

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,560
Dead, dead, dead, you spend your lives in bed.

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
You stay inside and shake with fear.

44
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,320
Should a nasty germ come near.

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,900
Dead, dead, dead, we'll take the chance instead.

46
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,280
Hey!

47
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,600
You never watch a sunset or see the light of day.

48
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,520
What kind of a life is that when you keep it locked away?

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,080
You've become pathetic shadows of what once you were.

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,440
What kind of a life is that 10,000 years with her?

51
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,400
Dead, dead, dead.

52
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,820
We'd rather live instead.

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,460
Young, young, young, how foolish are the young?

54
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,960
A brick could fall and crack your skull.

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,000
We're better off by being dull.

56
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,060
Young, young, young, we do not trust the young.

57
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,340
Dull, dull, dull, you are extremely dull.

58
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,520
Why should we accept your lot?

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,340
To stay inside and slow.

60
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,160
Slowly rot.

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,000
Dull, dull, dull.

62
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,040
We'd rather crack our skulls.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,560
The only cult they want to talk about is the subgenius foundation, the church of the subgenius.

64
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,180
Doug Smith says we're different.

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,860
Doug's right, Virgil.

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,600
We are different.

67
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,900
Thanks to Jesus.

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,320
The genetic engineering corporation of American studies.

69
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,520
Mommy too?

70
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,240
Yep, the whole family.

71
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,000
Is everybody like us?

72
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,380
No son, but we're working on it.

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,580
Round the clock.

74
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,860
And we won't stop ever, friends.

75
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,320
That was the late David Boone from the invasion of the aluminum people, 1982 film.

76
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,580
Before that, Dull, dull, dull.

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,440
That song by Lex from Brigadoom.

78
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,240
This music in the background is Doctors for Bob.

79
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,300
Tonight for you, we're going to be talking about the American Revolution.

80
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,680
Friends, we praise Bob with some new old media barrage number five subgenius tape.

81
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,180
Tonight, next with new KPFA, Berkeley Puzzling Evidence Philo.

82
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:20,400
Some killer, killer ranting from Papa Joe Mama in Germany and evil audio surgery by such luminaries as Lemur, seen here.

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,500
You start to feel like you're normal again.

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,020
Yeah.

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,560
Okay.

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
And it's very hard and people tend to gag.

87
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,100
Right.

88
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,400
Okay, Dr. Pink, it's time to start proving what you are saying.

89
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,860
An official message.

90
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,140
This is an actual emergency.

91
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,220
Kids who have been diagnosed with leglessness, ADD, deficit, hype, hype, hype, hype.

92
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,380
It does work.

93
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,340
It works because it's magnesium.

94
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,820
I've used it long enough and I've had thousands of pings.

95
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,960
They discovered both hips and didn't pay much attention to it but pain pills.

96
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,440
I fell off my head and I landed on my butt.

97
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,720
My audience is better than what can specifically help them.

98
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,780
Look at this here.

99
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,660
This is sweet tarts.

100
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:11,840
Yeah.

101
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,560
The sugar.

102
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,440
And we all know that sugar.

103
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:14,880
Yes.

104
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,000
Talc number five.

105
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:16,820
Wax.

106
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,760
These things are needed.

107
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,920
In fact, they block the absorption of the body.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,880
And that's it.

109
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,140
Plastic.

110
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,760
Why did you use a hard plastic?

111
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,780
Sherry, a lot of people like taking pills.

112
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,660
I've had patients, they say, I swallow the pills.

113
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,060
Okay.

114
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,400
Right.

115
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,880
Well, and look at hard plastic.

116
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,920
I don't know the chemicals.

117
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,500
My vitamins break down.

118
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,140
In fact, if you come over here, let me show you.

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,500
People probably find some of these in the toilet.

120
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,020
Yeah.

121
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,440
Right.

122
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:40,720
Okay.

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,600
My formula is this person.

124
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,660
It's already dissolved.

125
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
It is quite amazing, Ramos.

126
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,060
You start to feel like you're normal again.

127
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,220
You're absolutely amazing.

128
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,900
I'm six.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,140
I have high blood disorder.

130
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,740
Already, I feel like I'm going to die.

131
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:53,740


132
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,200
All right.

133
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,200


134
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,200


135
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,200


136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,200


137
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,200


138
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,100
I was in the bathroom with my wife a few months ago.

139
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,020
Arthromyelgia, osteoarthritis, fibrosis, arthrosis, osteoarthritis.

140
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,460
Arthromyelgia, osteoarthritis, fibrosis, arthrosis, osteoarthritis.

141
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,020
Arthromyelgia, osteoarthritis, fibrosis, osteoarthritis.

142
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,400
This concludes the emergency.

143
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,660
We're worried about the subconscious messages that they're sending.

144
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,960
Me too.

145
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,580
Yeah, we worry.

146
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,560
You mean the subliminal radio signals?

147
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:23,720
I don't know.

148
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,720


149
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,720


150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,720


151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,720


152
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,720


153
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,720
that are in everything, even your back teeth fillings.

154
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,960
Are they?

155
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,680
Those are the ones you should really worry about,

156
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,500
the ones that broadcast right into your teeth.

157
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,600
Because you can hear those at night when you're asleep,

158
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,860
and your ears, you know, you've got your ear canal right there next to your back teeth

159
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,580
sort of whispering up that ear canal all the time, and you don't even know it.

160
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,380
So how do you know that there are subliminal messages happening?

161
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,900
Well, the government, the new government channels,

162
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,040
and I switch channels, and then I just get stuck.

163
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,340
You get stuff on the channels?

164
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,160
They're editing this out right now.

165
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,060
Yeah, there's some kind of editing going on.

166
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,720
I think you need to turn up your phone or something.

167
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,220
But it's funny because a lot of people are different.

168
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,760
Now, do you have that antenna hooked up right now?

169
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,620
Well, yeah, I have.

170
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,100
I got some stereo wires, and I drug them all across my floor.

171
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,140
Back and forth?

172
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:16,720
Yeah.

173
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,280
I hope with this show turned up very loudly.

174
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,220
So did it generate a static charge?

175
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,940
A negative ion field on the surface of the floor about three inches above the floor

176
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,200
that you were only able to detect with the use of your vacuum cleaner?

177
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,560
Yeah.

178
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,520
You're confusing me.

179
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,040
Well, I think you should be confused to a certain extent

180
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,580
because your receptivity will increase that way

181
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,580
and therefore make the antenna more powerful.

182
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,140
Yeah.

183
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,640
Good God, Bishop Benjamin Jr. is with me this morning

184
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,640
sharing his young boy, spirit-filled boy,

185
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,620
who is recovering from praying for you.

186
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,860
That could happen.

187
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,620
Anyway, let us master different positions

188
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,860
to seek your spirit,

189
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,320
to have our God who made our minds impacted,

190
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,400
by the Jesus whom we know as your people,

191
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:29,820
Vietnam.

192
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,260
Oh, come on!

193
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:48,160
Oh, come on!

194
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,900
Only a thin dimensional barrier

195
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,160
separates us from chaos of the dark zone.

196
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,720
The dark zone is not separate,

197
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,260
like two different planets.

198
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,600
The dark zone coexists in the same space as our universe,

199
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,960
in the same place,

200
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,600
at the same time.

201
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,320
The dark zone has no rules,

202
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,600
no sense,

203
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,040
no order.

204
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,260
We worship the shadow's shadow.

205
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,380
Long may he reign.

206
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
We pray you in Christ's name,

207
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,060
be you reconciled to God.

208
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,520
He's already sent Jesus to the cross.

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,440
He's already,

210
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,460
bore your sin.

211
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,040
He's already delivered that thing into hell.

212
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,840
He's already been set free.

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,900
He's already been raised from the dead.

214
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,260
He has already,

215
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,760
borne everything that it takes

216
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,500
to send you to hell.

217
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,180
There's not but one sin

218
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,100
that can send anybody to hell,

219
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,420
and that is the rejection of the Lord Jesus as Savior.

220
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,380
That's the only sin that can send you there.

221
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,820
You've been reconciled.

222
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,480
God's not holding against you your trespasses.

223
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,780
Oh, brother, you don't know what I've done.

224
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,020
No.

225
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,000
You don't want to know.

226
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,260
Don't come at me and tell me

227
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,100
that that sin you got involved in

228
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,080
while you was on dope

229
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,060
is bigger than what God got involved in

230
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,360
on Calvary's mountain

231
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,280
when the blood of the spotless lamb

232
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,680
of Almighty God was shed

233
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,240
and Jesus went into the bowels of hell

234
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,300
and defeated Satan in your name.

235
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,100
But let's leave things of this world behind

236
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,700
and walk now down the path of Bob

237
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,680
for this brief minute of slack

238
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,320
from the church of the subgenius.

239
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,300
Oh, yes, praise Bob, friend.

240
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,220
This is Reverend Ivan Stang

241
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,980
come to tell you the truth,

242
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,960
the truth about the path to slack

243
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,020
through hyperventilation.

244
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,720
Yes, my friend,

245
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,780
you can get high from hyperventilation,

246
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,220
and it's legal,

247
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,220
and it's an exercise we're preaching,

248
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,820
and if you can learn to talk like me

249
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,980
and talk this way all the time,

250
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,740
then everybody you meet

251
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,940
will be your friend,

252
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,360
and you will get so high,

253
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,820
you will get so high,

254
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,040
you will meet Bob.

255
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,320
You will not be able to stop seeing Bob

256
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,340
because you will have so much slack

257
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,660
in your brain.

258
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,880
There won't be any more room for thought,

259
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,840
and when your mind is free,

260
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,300
free of thought,

261
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,180
then you will have the slack,

262
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,360
the slack you need in your life.

263
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,540
Praise Bob.

264
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,360
Help me, somebody.

265
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,020
Do I hear a praise, Bob?

266
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

267
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,540
Let there be slack.

268
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,160
Isn't that a good report?

269
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,840
Doesn't that help make your day?

270
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,100
Well, I can tell you something

271
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,300
that would make your day even better.

272
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,820
If you have a growth or a tumor or a wart,

273
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,780
I'd like to pray for it right now.

274
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,120
Or if you have a loved one.

275
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,420
And heaven knows, and so do you,

276
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,760
that we're going to have to go further with God.

277
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,680
We're living in the most dangerous times

278
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,080
there have ever been

279
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,500
in the history of the human race,

280
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,220
and we're going to have to go further with God.

281
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,680
The Bible says,

282
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,880
the head, who is the head?

283
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,180
The Bible says that the head

284
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,840
cannot say to the foot,

285
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,520
I have no need of thee.

286
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,380
Well, if Jesus, who is the head,

287
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,660
cannot say to me, who is the foot,

288
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,180
I have no need of thee,

289
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,280
then how dare the known say it has no need of me?

290
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,500
This won't make too much sense,

291
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,080
but it's not intended to.

292
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,600
Well, I'm afraid of God.

293
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,400
I tell you what, if you would,

294
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,880
put your hands on the radio right now.

295
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,320
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

296
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,540
But I tell you what you don't need too much of,

297
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,740
and that's the word of Bob.

298
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,540
And your only hope is to send one dollar

299
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,720
to the subgenius foundation.

300
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,580
Don't send your dollar.

301
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,120
Those people can't help you.

302
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,300
Send your dollar.

303
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,020
Those people can't help you.

304
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,540
And even then, you wouldn't comprehend it all.

305
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,560
Ten years from now, our pamphlets

306
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,540
will take the place of federal reserve currency.

307
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,860
That's Nick.

308
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,140
Might be.

309
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,660
You can get those pieces of paper that Bob sends from P.O. Box.

310
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,480
I'm going to read that number again to you folks.

311
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,360
P.O. Box.

312
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,880
1-8-1-4-1-7

313
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,080
Cleveland Heights, Ohio

314
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,200
4-4-1-1-8

315
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,260
You can leave off the zip code, but

316
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,140
God put money in that empty purse

317
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,300
don't ever let it be broke again.

318
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,600
What's the matter, little boy?

319
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,060
You look like you're confused and lost.

320
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,020
What's that mean?

321
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,260
Mommy, make this priest.

322
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,220
Get away from me.

323
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,880
Mommy, there's a priest coming after me.

324
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,180
Mommy.

325
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,620
Father Von Schenk doesn't want to hurt you.

326
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,060
He just wants to talk.

327
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,520
Get your hand off my ass.

328
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,840
That's not putting his hand on me.

329
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,740
That's a form of blessing.

330
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,200
He wants you to be able to run.

331
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,980
No, it's not. You're just a homo pedophile.

332
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,260
Please, please don't call Dr. Von Schenk.

333
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,760
You're going to jail.

334
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,140
You're all going to jail.

335
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,260
You bunch of weirdos.

336
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,420
Got some weirdo cult going on.

337
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,200
Homo cult.

338
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,200
The boy man.

339
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,700
Love association founded by

340
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,840
Father Schenk.

341
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,200
One of the priests that were thrown in jail

342
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,960
was actually an advocate of

343
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,260
nom-

344
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,140
NOMLO.

345
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,200
NOMLO.

346
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,780
He was a NOMLO member.

347
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,840
The priest was a NOMLO member.

348
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,640
Shh, shh, shh.

349
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,540
Now remember, we're not past the fornication hour.

350
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,340
We're not allowed to say-

351
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,480
And they're still standing there going,

352
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,620
well, maybe they shouldn't all be taken off

353
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,660
in the bullpen, did they?

354
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,940
Oh, he could still shuffle them off somewhere.

355
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,960
They can't do any harm to the world.

356
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,540
He could hide them in the confession booth

357
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,140
with that little hole drilled in it.

358
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,240
I'm not the ring trainer.

359
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,100
The glory hole.

360
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,240
Confession booth.

361
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,180
The confession booth.

362
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,720
What a great visual image there.

363
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,660
The glory hole confessional.

364
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,180
What a retreat it was.

365
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,260
Now there's the next day thing.

366
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,840
It's strange to build the glory hole confessional.

367
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,200
Confessional hole.

368
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,280
Make it exactly like one of those

369
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,040
Catholic confessionals on the screen.

370
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,380
Bless me, Father, for we can't win.

371
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,980
Oh, that pain.

372
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,260
Actually, it's kind of-

373
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,300
You start feeling bad now for them.

374
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,580
They're so toasted.

375
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,940
Oh, there's going to be a big upsurge

376
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,160
in priest costumes this Halloween, I'm sure.

377
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,500
It'll be a popular Halloween.

378
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,200
Oh, yes.

379
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,480
I am a pedophile priest.

380
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,520
A robe.

381
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,800
A priest's robe over some S&M gear.

382
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,920
Here we come

383
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,340
Walking down the street

384
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,740
We get the funniest looks from

385
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,540
Everyone we meet

386
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:39,360
Hey, hey, we're the monks

387
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,260
People say we monkey around

388
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,240
But we're the monks

389
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,240


390
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,160
But we're too busy chanting

391
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,540
To put anybody down

392
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,200
You know what it is?

393
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,280
You know why the Catholic schools

394
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,560
have good football teams, though?

395
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,600
They have a lot of sex at a young age.

396
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,560
It was like, you know,

397
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,200
Catholic school girls are real slutty

398
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,540
at a very young age.

399
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,920
The more extreme Baptists in the Church of Christ are-

400
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,200
Yes.

401
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,220
Yes.

402
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,820
The Baptists used to have

403
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,160
none of the old age.

404
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,540
So the men are all pumped up.

405
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,460
They've lost their virginity at 11.

406
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,300
You know, usually.

407
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,020
That is, provided they have the pubic hairs

408
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,080
with which to scare the sharks.

409
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,560
Are you kidding?

410
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,520
Are you kidding?

411
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,760
Are you kidding?

412
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,000
Are you kidding?

413
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Are you kidding?

414
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,820
That's unbelievable.

415
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,380
It was exactly like that man and yourselves.

416
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:05,380


417
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:05,380


418
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:05,800
No one really was worried about you at first.

419
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,800


420
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,800


421
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,800


422
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,800


423
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,800


424
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,800


425
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,800


426
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,800


427
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,860
I

428
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,020
I

429
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


430
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


431
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


432
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


433
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


434
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


435
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,160
R

436
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,820
Ste

437
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:08,820


438
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,400
are

439
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,020
Men

440
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,120
Re

441
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,060
We've punched your soul

442
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,180
Hey, hey, we're so wild

443
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,400
Dancing with the milky moon

444
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,100
Baby, take communion with the rest of the clan

445
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,900
They bought a path to her to the holy land

446
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,660
At the shrine of a virgin she was dressed to kill

447
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,720
With her mad dog twin and her birth control pills

448
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,940
Hey, hey, we're so wild

449
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,220
All your farmer's daughters gonna reap what you sow

450
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,400
Hey, hey, we're so wild

451
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,720
Dancing with the milky moon

452
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,260
Yeah, yeah

453
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:05,680
Oh, your hands, hands, hands

454
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,440
And me

455
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,440
On your hands, hands, hands

456
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,340
And me

457
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,220
Stalking hands, hands, hands

458
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,120
And me

459
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,980
Stalking furty, furty, furty, furty, furty, furty, furty

460
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,780
Baby, cry sometimes for no reason at all

461
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,520
Makes the master nervous in the good that you stall

462
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,380
Maul's little angel, Paul's little bear

463
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,920
A child of God with a bigger spirit

464
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,100
Oh

465
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,220
Hey, hey, we're so wild

466
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,580
All your farmer's daughters gonna reap what you sow

467
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,900
Hey, hey, we're so wild

468
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,060
Dancing with the milky moon

469
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,480
Oh, come on

470
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,520
Hey, hey, we're so wild

471
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,400
Bow to your partner in a do-si-do

472
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,060
Hey, hey, we're so wild

473
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,160
Dancing with the milky moon

474
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,580
All right now

475
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,500
Hey, hey, we're so wild

476
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,660
Oh,ka-ящ

477
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:21,000
Baby, cry sometimes for no reason at all

478
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,180
Makes the master nervous in the good that you stall

479
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,180


480
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,240
All your farmer's daughters gonna reap what you stall

481
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,620
Hey, hey, we're so wild

482
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,500
On me

483
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,220
offensively

484
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,340
On me

485
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,320
Ay, ra stirring

486
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,520
apparently

487
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:31,980
Daddy use theratulations

488
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,060
Yep, you took chances

489
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,680
The Rainmakers, dear friends.

490
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,040
Before that ESO swamp radio on WCSB Cleveland

491
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,480
with Professor Chaya Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

492
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,220
we heard the monks, the Benzie monks, in fact,

493
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,840
some genius Media Barrage 5 with cuts by Huey, me, Hambone,

494
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,120
and other stuff from Limur, Xenu, The Hindmost,

495
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,520
and the other alt-binary slack contributors.

496
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,260
Hope we're not offending anybody tonight.

497
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,180
You know, some people take this subject matter very seriously.

498
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,280
I think this is funny.

499
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,880
I got beat by nuns.

500
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,800
I got literally beat by the mothers, too.

501
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,120
I got beat by these frustrated drunken guys in public school.

502
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,700
Who weren't allowed to work anywhere.

503
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,840
I got whacked with a pointer. I'll always remember.

504
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,660
I got hit with a cane.

505
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,740
And the side of the knee, man.

506
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,060
She tried to hobble me.

507
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,720
Some guys are into that.

508
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,200
Climb around.

509
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,420
I fell asleep in class.

510
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,160
And the damn nun smacks me in the side of the knee.

511
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,100
Sister Mary Angela was the footer candidate to ever give chance to the only rapper I love.

512
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,020
Man.

513
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,140
In sixth grade.

514
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll always remember that day, man.

515
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,080
She whacked me good.

516
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,760
Wake up, Smith.

517
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,000
Whack his pee-pee.

518
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,740
You're like she didn't whack your pee-pee.

519
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,320
Yeah, I know.

520
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,080
Were you ever struck similarly?

521
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,140
Or were you allowed to be a prom queen?

522
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,840
We are, don't.

523
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,800
I was also smacked on top of the head with a pointer.

524
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,880
Prom queen from day one.

525
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,140
You were the prom queen from day one.

526
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,580
Absolutely.

527
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,960
She wasn't taking none of that nun sense.

528
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,080
None at all.

529
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,360
I saw you abuse the champion from day one.

530
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,840
Don't worry about the sequence of events after that.

531
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,080
You know I kind of mean the priest each time Friday.

532
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,580
Nun.

533
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,160
The Pope was saying this is an exclusively American and Anglo-Saxon problem.

534
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,720
Yeah, right.

535
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,220
Well, no.

536
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:32,140
In Africa and Latin America, he has problems with priests actually dating nuns.

537
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,000
And this is a true thing on the shortwave radio show.

538
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,420
Oh, come on.

539
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,820
Little boys for years and hundreds and hundreds of years.

540
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,540
It goes back.

541
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,540
The little boys.

542
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,380
They would bring the little boys in to sing what?

543
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,720
The women's parts in the choir because they wouldn't allow women in the church choir.

544
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,760
So they brought the little boys in.

545
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,720
Now, what do you think that was?

546
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,020
That was like the gravy train for the priest, man.

547
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,060
The choir.

548
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,520
Like the little boys come in.

549
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm going to teach you to sing.

550
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,380
Yeah, see, I know.

551
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,140
I know.

552
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,340
Why were the castrati more important than the situationists?

553
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,120
I don't know anything about that.

554
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,840
Or the skeptics organizations that spank spoken.

555
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,900
That's my bailiwick.

556
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,520
I understand the Protestant evangelical side better.

557
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,240
Take their money.

558
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,080
Take their money.

559
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,580
We thought of Catholics as weird, idolatrous cultists.

560
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,640
But that was the same way most people think of Hare Krishnas.

561
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,880
Jesus.

562
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,020
Of course, Catholics, where I grew up, were the weirdest minority there was.

563
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,900
They played very good football teams, though.

564
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,060
I preached that morning on the Paschal Lamb.

565
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,000
They led a little blind message.

566
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,280
They were totally blind in both eyes.

567
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,000
I preached on how when the children of Israel ate that Paschal Lamb,

568
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,460
it got into their stomach and turned, the stomach turned it into blood.

569
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,120
And it began to pump into their body.

570
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,560
And when it hit their blind eyes, it made them whole.

571
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,720
When it hit their crippled limbs, it made them whole.

572
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,500
Because that lamb was the type of spice.

573
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,080
Oh, yes, friends.

574
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,780
That lamb was one of the nine score types of Jesus.

575
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,960
Oh, there's so many of them.

576
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,200
That was the four-legged Jesus.

577
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,860
The animal Jesus.

578
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,420
He's the Jesus that shits in the woods, friends.

579
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,900
He's the Jesus that, he don't worry about who's looking at him or what's going on.

580
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:20,740
He just likes to eat and mate and sleep and all those wonderful, precious things that

581
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,900
the animals do.

582
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,280
Yes, he's the weird Jesus.

583
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,680
The Jesus that could turn from a man into a ram or a lamb.

584
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,120
Or a...

585
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,120
A rabbit.

586
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,160
Just, just about anything you could imagine.

587
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,200
That's what the animal Jesus, the weird Jesus, could turn into.

588
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,680
And he didn't need no full moon to do it.

589
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,000
No, friends.

590
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,260
The four-legged Jesus, he could switch over any time he chose.

591
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,440
Any time he'd seen a hunter coming with a gun, he could switch back over and become

592
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,100
like a human being.

593
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,120
And with his long, long, long, long legs.

594
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,120


595
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,600
A blond hair and his blue eyes.

596
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,280
Or whatever color hair and eyes that he wanted to have at that time.

597
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,780
Because he's a miracle Jesus, friends.

598
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,740
He's a...

599
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,280
He's a fighting, farting, fist-fucking Jesus.

600
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,060
A horned beast and an

601
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,380
axe.

602
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,120
A crazy Santa Cat!

603
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,560
A Ghost!

604
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,780
A anthill?

605
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,120
A萬块

606
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:08,280
Now, they'll also tell us about the mysterious J.R. Bob Dobbs,

607
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,920
who, as I understand it again, is the high muckety-muck of the Church of the Subgenius.

608
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,340
Hello, Bob.

609
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,320
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

610
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,240
Perhaps you've been deceived by evangelists masquerading as angels of light.

611
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,960
This is the voice of Colossus, the voice of Garnet.

612
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,140
We are one.

613
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,020
This is the voice of unity.

614
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,940
I'm talking to you tonight about the Holy God, about the Holy God,

615
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,200
about the Church of the Subgenius.

616
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,520
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

617
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,900
Can I get a witness? Can I get a witness?

618
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,200
Can I get a praise, Bob?

619
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,480
Can I get a praise, Bob?

620
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,900
Can I get an amen? Can I get an amen?

621
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,740
Thank you, children. Thank you.

622
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,280
Thank you, children.

623
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,040
Thank you.

624
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,360
Some of you may not be familiar with the Church of the Subgenius.

625
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,040
Some of you may not know the Hormones.

626
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,920
Church of the Subgenius!

627
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,140
Church of the Subgenius!

628
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,340
Purpose! Purpose of the Church of the Subgenius...

629
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,540
The purpose of the church!

630
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,740
The purpose of the church is to have one!

631
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,040
It's so the church is to have one!

632
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,420
Slack!

633
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,760
Can I hear that again?

634
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,320
Do I need more slack?

635
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,620
Can I get some slack?

636
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,480
The cause of the experience that they were going through...

637
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,680
Ah, yes, dear friends.

638
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,780
Ha ha! Have you two not gotten enough slack on the ropes of life?

639
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,180
This is Dr. Philodrumon speaking to you from on the road way out there.

640
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,120
Somewhere where you nor your friends can even perceive.

641
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,480
Ha ha! Yes, dear friends.

642
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,740
We're out here, you're out there, and we're thinking about you out there.

643
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:05,220
And about all the wonderful things that can be found when you find Bob.

644
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,160
Need to enhance your front-end solutions?

645
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,580
Having trouble embracing your vertical infrastructures?

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:19,540
Let Bob Dobbs and his subgenius foundation cultivate world-class technologies overnight for minimal initial overlay.

647
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,900
Streamline integrated metrics and extend your paradigms.

648
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,180
Bob can show you how.

649
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,460
His transparent schemas integrate world-class initiatives to reduce,

650
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,120
penalize nominal communication, or PINK for short.

651
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,040
While optimizing profitability execution proactively.

652
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:47,300
Bob will teach you how to deliver visionary magnetic infomediaries using our exclusive user-centric 24-7 system, Slack.

657

659
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,120
Hi, I'm a trained professional just waiting for you.

660
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,960
If you're ready to take your life, it's time to put yourself first.

661
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,520
You can call the number on your screen.

662
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,980
We're waiting to hear from you.

663
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,700
I am a machine, vastly superior to the machine.

664
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:29,980
I am a human.

665
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,860
Ah, Pope S. Lilith.

666
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,840
With an ad written by computer.

667
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Ranting at X Day, for X Day last year.

668
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,280
Some Dr. Philodrumon from Media Barrage 5.

669
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,700
Also, Pope David N. Meyer.

670
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,500
His very first preaching.

671
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,660
Before that, some Leibach, Sympathy for the Devil.

672
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,920
Coming up, old Media Barrages, edited by Huey, surveyed by Bob.

673
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,700
He did things that were just humiliating.

674
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,160
And they kicked him out of the intellectuals club for it.

675
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,820
Metal fatigue, what can you say?

676
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,940
You're on troops, I meant.

677
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,740
Come on, that's...

678
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,920
We change personalities entirely.

679
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,900
Flaky specks of dandruff in my hair.

680
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,200
You're the tickle in my throat that makes me cough.

681
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,720
You're the hangnail in my life.

682
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,820
And I can't fight you off.

683
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,700
I respectfully disagree with that.

684
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,160
This is ridiculous.

685
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,420
Why don't you throw him over your shoulder and burp him?

686
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,500
No, I don't even know what I'm doing here.

687
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,440
We're wasting our time.

688
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,460
I cannot teach him.

689
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,260
The boy has no patience.

690
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,860
He thinks you'll call a cop.

691
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,160
That's just what I deserve.

692
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:44,320
Trying to change a wasp mannequin into a thinking, feeling human being.

693
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,720
That was a real weird scene.

694
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,540
You know, you're just out there working on your truck.

695
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,940
And then suddenly there's fire everywhere, all around you.

696
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,700
You can't see anything.

697
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,820
You have to drive out of it.

698
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,780
Who is that?

699
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,880
Who is that?

700
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,380
We all know who that is.

701
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,460
Who is it?

702
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,540
It's...

703
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:57,640
It's...

704
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,740
It's Bob.

705
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,900
Bob!

706
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,620
Bob!

707
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,360
Bob!

708
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,780
Bob!

709
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:05,900
Bob!

710
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,440
Bob!

711
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:06,620
Bob!

712
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:06,860
Bob!

713
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,660
Bob!

714
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,180
Up there, my child.

715
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,340
There dwells the one true God who created all living things.

716
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,000
The true God is the moon?

717
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,680
No, Antillia.

718
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,440
Bob is fill in the blank.

719
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,340
I am Bob.

720
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,440
I'm not Bob.

721
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,560
You are Bob.

722
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,620
We are all Bob.

723
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,820
We are all Devo.

724
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,700
We are Bob.

725
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,360
Bob will protect you!

726
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,320
Bob is protecting the genetic future.

727
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,120
Let him.

728
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,240
Let him into your life.

729
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,640
Let Bob protect you!

730
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,820
He wants to protect you!

731
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,200
He must protect you!

732
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,540
He has to protect you!

733
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,200
Jehovah One says Bob will protect you!

734
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,620
If you send a dollar to post office box 14-0306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

735
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,500
One dollar for salvation!

736
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,060
One dollar!

737
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,600
He gave life to you and you give life to him.

738
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


739
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


740
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


741
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,180
to you and to me. Pray to him, Antillia. He will listen to your prayers.

742
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:12,520
I can't believe the weird things that people get in their heads and start teaching.

743
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:19,980
J.R. Bob Dobbs, known among salesmen as the Saint of Sales, it's actually a mystic sales ability.

744
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:40,540
Bob was given powers and has been given messages all along by alien entities, intelligences in outer space or maybe all around us that are literally fingers of the stark fist of Jehovah One, alien space god from some sin galaxy.

745
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,120
Here again.

746
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,720
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

747
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,720
Get to the stage now to soothe the crowd.

748
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,320
The authorities fight for control here in this chaotic situation.

749
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:11,820
J.R. Bob Dobbs came to town to set you free! He came to Dallas to set you free! You got no business being sick! You got no business being embodied! You got no business living out of sin! You got no business living without slack!

750
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,540
Fortunately, this is the one true church.

751
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,820
Bob protects me from demons and I got a lot of them.

752
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,520
Bob will protect you.

753
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:19,960
Bob will protect you.

754
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,220
He'll protect you.

755
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,580
You have consumed enough alcohol for one evening.

756
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,180
It is wasteful and pointless.

757
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,380
Obey me and live, or disobey and die.

758
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,360
Bob's Out.

759
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,120
Mom!

760
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,780
Hey!

761
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,580
Let's stop that!

762
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,100
That's disgusting.

763
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,860
Put that away!

764
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,880
Put that switchblade back in its case.

765
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,120
Give that one-

766
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,300
Is that a gun?

767
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,080
He's teaching no manners at all.

768
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,620
Hello?

769
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,800
I have the feeling someone's stalling.

770
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,740
There's at least one other one.

771
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,280
There's at least one other, you know, there's four or five right now.

772
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,540
Don't look down at your pants leg, Jim.

773
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,860
Don't look down there.

774
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,160
I'm looking down there.

775
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:08,980
No, no, no, no.

776
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,240
Just avert your gaze.

777
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,500
I'm looking.

778
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:10,800
I'm going to look.

779
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,040
What you want to be staring at is the emasculated tube right there that's going to punish you.

780
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,440
I'm staring at those little weird bugs dancing like they're high on D-13.

781
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,840
Leave!

782
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,620
Leave!

783
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:22,840
Leave!

784
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:23,780
Leave!

785
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,900
Look, the mice have got an organ roll for it.

786
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,080
Let's sing it again.

787
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,220
The marvelous mechanical mouse organ!

788
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,080
You are being irrational.

789
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,720
Go back to bed.

790
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,900
You know what that is?

791
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,880
Stupid.

792
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,080
I mean, that goes beyond dumb, brother.

793
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,800
That's stupid.

794
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,740
You ain't ready yet.

795
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,920
I'd like to know who you think you are.

796
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,080
You ain't ready yet.

797
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,540
Well, I just ain't ready yet.

798
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,300
I'm going to do my thing.

799
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,780
Boy, I'll tell you what, I'd hate to give up my soul over a cigarette.

800
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,180
You can't generalize, though.

801
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,500
I mean, where I come from, Baptists are these...

802
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,220
cave people, basically.

803
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,960
But not always, you know.

804
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,500
And then up in Boston, Massachusetts,

805
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,120
it was the Cambridge Baptist Church

806
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,760
was the ones that took in the subgeniuses

807
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,900
when we were cast out of the fancy nightclub

808
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,840
just for doing nothing more than inspiring the Columbines.

809
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,440
There's good and bad in everybody, honey.

810
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,960
That's what my grandma used to say to me.

811
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,000
There's good and bad in all them,

812
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,380
and some of them are sons of bitcheses.

813
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,620
And Bob will get revenge for all of us this X-Day, friends.

814
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,460
For they truly are all sons of bitches.

815
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,820
And they will wow in their own blood.

816
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,300
One of these years has got to be 1998.

817
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,660
Maybe it's this one.

818
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,200
Provided the ships come on time.

819
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,060
As the appointed time has come and gone so many times.

820
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,200
Well, this really affects how much firewood I'm going to buy, you know.

821
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,380
I don't want to buy too much.

822
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,720
Whether they come or not, you mean?

823
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,100
Yeah, I don't want to really buy a couple of cords of wood

824
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,940
if I only need the one.

825
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,700
Well, think of it this way.

826
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,200
You might want to buy more so you can make sure they see you

827
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,840
for crying out loud.

828
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,640
Of course, what do I care if I spend the money anyway?

829
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,240
What about, they said last year they actually showed up

830
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,840
and nobody got on there.

831
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,680
And they just went away and said,

832
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,900
well, beep you, arseholes, you know.

833
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,340
When was that?

834
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,400
Somebody, well, this was like a wide rumor, Mom.

835
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,560
I always liked the theory that they came down in little ships,

836
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,000
this tiny, big, and flew in front of our faces on X-Day

837
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,820
and said, come on, get on.

838
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Come on, get on board.

839
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,880
Get on board.

840
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,140
We're waiting for you.

841
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,860
Yeah, and we swatted them like flies.

842
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,680
And we had a few more sips of tequila.

843
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,560
And we waited for the sunrise and nothing happened.

844
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,260
So then again, there was more of these buzzing flies

845
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,840
and we got out the decom.

846
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,900
They all dropped and made metallic sounds

847
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,340
when they hit the ground around us,

848
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,620
but still we didn't think anything was wrong.

849
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,820
Best dimension.

850
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,060
Have you guessed my name?

851
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,820
You all.

852
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,020
You all.

853
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,820
I was puzzling you.

854
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,840
It's just the nature of my game.

855
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,100
Yeah!

856
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,240
I want you to put your hands together

857
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,360
and scream like maniacs

858
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,400
for the infamous, evil

859
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,620
Papa Joe Mama.

860
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,780
Papa Joe!

861
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,400
Papa Joe!

862
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,020
Papa Joe!

863
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


864
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


865
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


866
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


867
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


868
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


869
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


870
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,020


871
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,700
Papa Joe!

872
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,200
Papa Joe!

873
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,800
Papa Joe!

874
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,340
Papa Joe!

875
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,880
Papa Joe!

876
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,220
Papa Joe!

877
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,300
Papa Joe!

878
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:54,960
Papa Joe!

879
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,180
Papa Joe!

880
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,940
Hallelujah ladies and gentlemen!

881
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,280
J-R-O-B-O-B-S

882
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:07,820
UBERDOTIS!

883
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,540
Yeah!

884
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,560
You asked what time it is, friends,

885
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,400
and I'm here to tell you what time it is.

886
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,020
It's time!

887
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,180
It's five minutes till midnight!

888
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,420
Aye!

889
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,020
Yes, dear friends, the end times are upon us.

890
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,080
The proof is everywhere around.

891
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,100
Despite the conspiracy's best efforts to comfort and reassure you otherwise,

892
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,080
their sinister control in existence is fast coming to a close.

893
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,280
Best of all, they know it.

894
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,520
Like the pilot announcing over the intercom that the engine trouble is nothing to worry about,

895
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,380
the more they urge everyone to remain calm,

896
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,740
the more obvious their own panic becomes.

897
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,780
They all see the fulfillment of Bob's prophecies unfold.

898
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,700
A world on the edge of Armageddon.

899
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,260
The conspiracy's desperate last ditch efforts to pull itself out of its nosedive.

900
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:11,020
And Bob's bold plan to reestablish freedom and slack in the conspiracy's aftermath.

901
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,840
Do I hear a praise ball?

902
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,980
A praise ball!

903
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,860
A praise ball!

904
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:24,120
Who would have ever imagined that the countdown to July 5th would have begun on September 11th?

905
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,520
See how the world's armies converge upon the Middle East in a futile attempt to maintain the status quo.

906
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:41,000
Who amongst us seriously believes a conspiracy will ever allow itself to completely win this war?

907
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,780
Then turn around and restore the civil liberties they so jealously snatched away?

908
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:53,960
Ah, there shall always be at least one terrorist who gets away.

909
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,700
One that's big enough and bad enough to justify the continuation of the newly expanded police state.

910
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,420
If not make it even bigger.

911
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,740
But we, the subgenies,

912
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:16,200
we do not, and we are not, intimidated by a conspiracy show of force.

913
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,100
We recognize only one, only one supreme authority.

914
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,580
Not the faceless, nameless men in black.

915
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,140
No, sir!

916
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,400
No!

917
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,500
But a smiling face named J.R. Bob Dole!

918
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,540
We, we, we will follow that face to the infinite end.

919
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,600
We will follow the path of the earth and well beyond after this planet is no more.

920
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,480
That time is coming soon, my friends.

921
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,100
It's five minutes till midnight!

922
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,520
Look at humanity, and America alone.

923
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,860
The so-called land of milk and honey.

924
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:04,520
700,000 people owe 30 billion dollars in high interest credit card debt.

925
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,380
Ha ha ha ha.

926
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,460
They'll never pay it off.

927
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,020
But of course they're not supposed to pay it off now, are they?

928
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,640
No, sir!

929
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:18,820
The conspiracy wants them to remain in debt perpetually, running down that endless treadmill.

930
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,060
Bob says no!

931
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,120
It's time to get off!

932
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,660
It's time to get off like you've never gotten off before!

933
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,480
It's five minutes till midnight!

934
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,640
Ha ha ha ha!

935
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,140
Ha ha ha ha!

936
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,080
Hey, Bob!

937
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,080
Hey, Bob!

938
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,360
In the last month alone, American Post is the only one who has ever said,

939
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,020
I've delivered three billion pieces of mail.

940
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,280
Three people died from anthrax from those legends.

941
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,340
So now the peak public is terrified that they are next.

942
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,740
That's a one in one billion chance that you could get infected and be killed.

943
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:04,200
More people have died from spontaneous combustion, just unexpectedly exploding into flames.

944
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,980
Yeah!

945
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,880
Yet millions, millions still believe that they're in desperate danger.

946
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,360
This is called mass hysteria.

947
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,160
The first step to complete social breakdown.

948
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,080
The rats are ready to flee the ship whether it's sinking or not.

949
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,600
It's five minutes till midnight!

950
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,260
Yeah!

951
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,120
Yeah!

952
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,600
He who knows the future owns it.

953
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,300
He who knows there is no future rents it to others.

954
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,160
Yeah!

955
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:37,700


956
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:38,680
Yeah!

957
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,000
Ah, Bob Dobbs said, and I quote,

958
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,000
The world ends July 5th, 1998.

959
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,900
Now the conspiracy believes that 1998 is over and that they are now safe.

960
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,340
They don't believe in time control.

961
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,840
They don't believe in excess UFOs.

962
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,860
And worst of all, they don't believe in Bob!

963
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,800
No!

964
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:06,460
No!

965
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,040
And for that unforgivable blasphemy, they shall surely die!

966
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,800
It's five minutes till midnight!

967
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,000
Yeah!

968
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,200
Yeah!

969
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:14,520
Yeah!

970
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,380
Yeah!

971
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:23,000
For centuries, humans banged their heads against the walls trying to find the answers to life,

972
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,000
happiness, and peace on Earth.

973
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,700
But that answer sadly never came.

974
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,840
You want to know why?

975
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,660
Why?

976
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,140
Because the answer's not here, friends.

977
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,520
They're looking in the wrong place.

978
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,420
That answer isn't on Earth at all.

979
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,880
It's on Planet X.

980
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,900
And there's only one way to get there, friends.

981
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,640
And it sure as hell ain't by brown-nosing the boss.

982
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,200
Or by trying to stockpile the most numbers in your bank account.

983
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,540
No, sir!

984
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:59,660
The only way to find paradise and avoid hell on Earth is to possess a ticket aboard an X's flying saucer.

985
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,960
That ticket cannot be bought, friends.

986
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:09,180
It can only be bought if you must trade true love and affection for Bob, plus a $30 love offering,

987
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,820
to the subgenius Foundation.

988
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,300
Now, some people wonder, can I really afford it?

989
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,160
The answer, of course, is, can you not afford it?

990
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,260
Because, in the most simple of terms, it's five minutes till midnight!

991
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:29,800
Yeah!

992
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,100
Ladies and Germans,

993
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:41,240
we cannot promise you that you will walk out of here with all of the answers.

994
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,940
But we're hoping to at least provide you with some of the more vital, life-changing questions.

995
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,920
One of them is this.

996
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,520
Do you wish to live after July 5th, 1998?

997
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,660
Yes!

998
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,160
If the answer is no, however, just keep serving the conspiracy.

999
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,880
Those X's saucers will arrive here and rain death upon you and all your pink friends.

1000
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,500
But, if, however, the answer is yes,

1001
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,840
well, in that case, I suggest, and that's assuming, of course, you prefer an eternity of slack,

1002
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,320
and want to enjoy a space journey aboard the pleasure saucers with Bob,

1003
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,760
enjoying sex-star beautiful babes, an abundant supply of have-a-fropped zippy-lops,

1004
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,400
and, of course, good quality rock and roll,

1005
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,960
and I'm not talking that 70s sh**,

1006
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,280
then turn your life over to Bob!

1007
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,100
Yeah!

1008
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,700
It ain't hard, friends.

1009
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,680
It's easy and it's fun.

1010
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,000
You'll get eternal salvation and slack at no extra charge.

1011
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,700
But best of all, best of all,

1012
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:56,060
you'll feel a thrill instead of a chill when someone asks you,

1013
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,640
Uh, what time is it?

1014
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,500
And the answer is, it's five minutes till midnight!

1015
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,760
Narrated the work of our great Bob Aben!

1016
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,340
Hallelujah!

1017
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,360
Hallelujah!

1018
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:20,980
Hallelujah!

1019
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,380
Are you scared?

1020
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,000
Oh, yeah, I know I am!

1021
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,280
I'm so scared, I think I'm gonna pay my $30 again,

1022
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,200
just to make sure I get on that Exit spacecraft!

1023
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,820
I paid my $30!

1024
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:40,960
Hallelujah!

1025
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,640
I'll bet I'll fly!

1026
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,440
See you at the base, huh?

1027
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,960
Yes, for real, guys!

1028
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,440
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1029
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,760
Oh, Jesus, to be so honest!

1030
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,680
I love the...

1031
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,300
...Bad Guys!

1032
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,640
Jesus!

1033
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,620
Every cop is a criminal!

1034
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,280
And I'm the sinner at six!

1035
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,300
There's hell in this place, just call me!

1036
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,660
Listen up, TV!

1037
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,000
Because I'm in need of some restraints!

1038
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,980
I'm in need of some restraints!

1039
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,380
Oh, Papa Joe, Mama Friends at the Hamburg, Germany, D5L!

1040
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:27,380
A rant delivered at the same club that the Beatles played their first famous German concert in!

1041
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,000
But...

1042
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,040
Now...

1043
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,660
This!

1044
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,320
A band called Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1045
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,580
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1046
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,120
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1047
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:42,860
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1048
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,600
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1049
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,820
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1050
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,700
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1051
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,700
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1052
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,220
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1053
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,360
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1054
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,300
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1055
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,580
Sleepytime Gorilla Museum!

1056
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:14,800
Sleepytime Gorilla M får Dus п;;

1057
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:14,800


1058
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:14,800


1059
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,000
We'll be right back.

1060
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,360
We'll be right back.

1061
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,780
We'll be right back.

1062
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,140
We'll be right back.

1063
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,820
We'll be right back.

1064
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:14,800
We'll be right back.

1065
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,260
We'll be right back.

1066
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,900
We'll be right back.

1067
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,860
We'll be right back.

1068
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,320
We'll be right back.

1069
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,900
We'll be right back.

1070
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,900
We'll be right back.

1071
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,420
We'll be right back.

1072
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:47,860
We'll be right back.

1073
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,020
We'll be right back.

1074
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,220
We'll be right back.

1075
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:23,800
We'll be right back.

1076
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,580
We'll be right back.

1077
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,800
We'll be right back.

1078
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,940
We'll be right back.

1079
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,740
We'll be right back.

1080
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:43,960
We'll be right back.

1081
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:52,400
Puzzling Evidence and over-the-edge radio shows out there compiled by our favorite fan, Serpent X.

1082
00:58:53,360 --> 00:59:02,600
And Serpent X's site has about 15 Puzzling Evidence shows and probably has 50 over-the-edge shows out there.

1083
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:12,380
And that website again, matrix.custan.edu slash negativ, negative, without the E at the end.

1084
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,700
And if you'll just go to that site, you can download them at your leisure.

1085
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:20,620
