1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
It's chaotic.

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,100
Yowlswag.

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
I wonder if this works.

4
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,940
I wonder if this works.

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:12,600
Alright, just tell me whenever I'm on. There, is that better? Alright.

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,700
Alright, alright. I see the second hand following, following, following.

7
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:33,780
Alright. Boom, we're on! Good hello, this is Bud Good, and I must inform you that Over the Edge will not be heard tonight.

8
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:46,860
Over the Edge has donated its time so that we can cover the Subgenius Executive Retreat from, direct from Sulphur Palms, and that's where I am now.

9
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,120
Right near the gate to Sulphur Palms, I see all the subgenius out there,

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,300
uh,

11
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:59,180
waiting to get in, and my co-host tonight will be, puzzling evidence, founder and co-operator of the Subgenius Church.

12
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,560
Hello.

13
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,480
Not the founder, is the founder here tonight?

14
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,740
Yeah, I'm the only one who claims that I was not the founder.

15
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,920
Is, is Mr. Stang here tonight?

16
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,880
Reverend Ivan Stang is here tonight, and so is Philodromon the Overman.

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,840
Good.

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,420
Bishop Joey of the Church of St. Stephen.

19
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,360
Good, all the executives are present, it seems, and uh, of course the theme for this year is the next hundred years.

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,680
What will the next hundred years be?

21
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,420
What will the next hundred years hold for the Church?

22
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,840
That's just what I was gonna ask you, puzzling.

23
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,860
We have to find out from the people that are attending the conference tonight, the super secret conference.

24
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,120
This one night retreat will be devoted entirely to the next hundred years.

25
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:35,680
Uh,

26
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:42,620
There'll be food, music, uh, panel discussion, uh, the title of which will be the next hundred years.

27
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,480
Don't, don't miss our awards dinner, the next hundred years awards.

28
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,480
Yeah, this little mimeograph smudge, I can't tell what's coming up next.

29
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,680
Whoa, oh, I see the guard there's opening the gate now.

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,400
Uh, let's, let's, uh, let's bring the, let them in, here they come.

31
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,140
Uh, uh.

32
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,080
Looks like Ivan Stagg, and, and there's Bishop Joey.

33
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,180
Bishop Joey, our first executive.

34
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:10,540
I can't find my, uh, I have my ticket reservation, but I don't, I don't think I have my, uh, the, the code number, but can I get my badge anyway?

35
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,320
Is it okay?

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,540
Yeah, here, your laminate.

37
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:13,880
Are you, laminate.

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,600
Let's get it backstage.

39
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,220
Thanks.

40
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:16,720
Okay.

41
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,260
Do you have to buy the lanyard too?

42
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,080
Are you paying for the lanyard?

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,180
This highly technical evening here where we have all of these, oh, there we are, I see, I couldn't see where I was.

44
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,000
My space helmet was all fogged up.

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,540
I wonder if I could, I have permission to hand out some flyers for my church.

46
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,920
It's, it's going to be a, perhaps a little bit of a, a, a trying evening, folks.

47
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,840
We have to go through the entire, uh, process of, uh, imbibing the church as you will.

48
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,880
We take it and, uh, drink the whole church.

49
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,220
We go through the business aspect.

50
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,840
Um, I see Ivan Stagg over there on the other side of the field.

51
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,040
Yeah, we're, we're.

52
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,320
I thought they all were trying to get in here.

53
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,580
Where, where are all the subgenius?

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,460
There's a new bass player for the band.

55
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,720
The schedules weren't printed out, out there at the, the table in the lobby.

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,580
Philo is here.

57
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,900
He's wandering around confused about where to go.

58
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,760
We don't have, we don't have some of their mics up.

59
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,320
We have remote ambience mics located all over Sulphur Poms tonight.

60
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,140
There's Papa Joe Mama over there.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,320
This has got to be the most amateurish.

62
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,980
There's Onyx, which we can tune into and see what's going on, uh, wherever they happen to be.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,360
I think Ivan Stagg doesn't like the little, uh, the little umbrellas in his drink.

64
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,040
Uh, could you tell me where the buffet is?

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,060
I'd like to start out with the buffet.

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,320
Yeah.

67
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,100
It's behind, it's behind that big tent right there.

68
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,680
Thank you.

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,020
Okay.

70
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,540
What kind of a chimpanzee zoo is this?

71
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,000
Like, I can't believe this.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,320
Do I, am I supposed to be running?

73
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,720
It's a business meeting.

74
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,040
Look how it's turning.

75
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,380
Oh, there's Mr. Stagg.

76
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,120
Yeah, they're hidden away over there.

77
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,460
What do you expect?

78
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:38,800
Subgenius.

79
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,020
Get behind the bridge and figure out where, which little space helmet has a

80
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,780
I'm scared.

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,260
vibrator on it.

82
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,840
Oh, look.

83
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,740
There's a little queen of UFOs.

84
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,820
I'd, I'd like to ask.

85
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,900
She's buzzing around the outside of the ship.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,040
They're gonna see us.

87
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,960
I'd like to ask Mr. Stagg a question.

88
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,460
As the founder of the subgenius church.

89
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:52,840
What?

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,120
What?

91
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,880
Which network are you with?

92
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,100
No, he's not the founder.

93
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,220
I'm with UMN.

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,900
Oh, yeah, okay.

95
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,120
This is Bud Good.

96
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,880
I'm with UMN, Puzzling Evidence.

97
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,940
Oh, Bud Good, right.

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,580
Bud.

99
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,040
Yes.

100
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,280
So, as the founder of the subgenius church.

101
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,720
That's, that's very funny.

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,300
After all these years.

103
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,840
Praise Bob.

104
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,060
Trial and tribulation, murder, divorce.

105
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,200
I don't know what's been going on, but, but how do you feel?

106
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,560
I'm not sure.

107
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:19,940
I'm not sure.

108
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,880
I'm not sure.

109
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:21,880


110
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:21,880


111
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:21,880


112
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:21,880


113
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:21,880


114
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,100
What do you, isn't that rather a personal question?

115
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,380
How do I, if I use my fingers, my, my, if I reach out with my senses.

116
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,540
I, I, I let the, the, the sensory world wash over me.

117
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,780
That is how I feel.

118
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,560
In other words.

119
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,320
As a holy man.

120
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,340
In all these years, you've learned nothing.

121
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,620
I put my fingers out.

122
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,720
I touched, nothing is what we strive for, Bud.

123
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,480
I understand.

124
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,280
That was a compliment.

125
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,360
Yes, we're, oh, thank you.

126
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,840
Thank you.

127
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:48,920
Thank you.

128
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,800
I too have learned nothing.

129
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,580
Whatever, if I said, yeah, did I say that?

130
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,620
Then pick up on it.

131
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,720
Now we're going to move right to the organized part of the show right now.

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,920
The, all these subgenius executives are moving into the lodge where they will sit around

133
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,740
a, a long oblong square oval tables place.

134
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,620
It's vacuumed in years.

135
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,640
There's a big hole in the middle.

136
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,740
And they will have the, the next hundred years panel discussion.

137
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,280
The subgenius church, the next hundred years, why?

138
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:18,820
Why?

139
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,120
Why?

140
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,780
Whence Dobbs and why?

141
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,400
Why?

142
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,240
Whence Dobbs, that's his brother, Wencesla Dobbs, Polish Dobbs.

143
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,800
Good King.

144
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,560
Whence the high pop to whences work at all?

145
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,440
We've already got an eight, four, eight, four, four, three, five.

146
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,600
It might be Michael Pepe who was invited to come with us.

147
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,360
Traipsing through this field that at midnight here.

148
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,660
We're out looking at the moon due between our toes waiting for the business report.

149
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,800
How many subgenius leaders?

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:48,800


151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:48,800


152
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,060
executives do we have here tonight? Is it a full quorum? It really is amazing. Onan is here.

153
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,340
Papa Joe Mama is here. Some of these people might not appear on mic though. Dr. Howell is here,

154
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,300
but his microphone is turned all the way down as always. He is not here. Dr. Howell is not here.

155
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:12,700
He's not? No, he's not. Wait a minute. If that, then... Are we now in the panel discussion?

156
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:19,140
Who's that guy? He always votes against the majority, so we tricked him out of town for

157
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,500
this weekend. So if it does come to a vote tonight, it should be unanimous. Okay, here's the Howell mask.

158
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:39,120
Well, I wish you radio listeners could see this Howell-larious reproduction death mask of Dr.

159
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,680
Howell. Too bad we don't have any tapes of him.

160
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,540
To go with that mask... Oh, he'll appear later in the show, I'm sure. There are hours and oodles

161
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,740
and hours of show tonight, folks. Here, puzzling, look, I have my own mic, so actually you can use

162
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,660
this one and somebody else can use that one. I'm a little worried about the next... I have my special

163
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:04,940
UMN remote mic tonight. As we wander around the grounds, here is Sulphur Palm.

164
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,820
And they are, I see... The Christmas trees are lighting up like a phone. Oh, I don't see anything.

165
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,420
Which one?

166
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,180
It's that guy. Are they going to turn on the lights or what? Is that that guy?

167
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
Hello? Hello?

168
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,180
So, typical college radio, uh-huh.

169
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,960
I see what's happening. Sulphur Palm.

170
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,100
Can I be the first caller?

171
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes, you can. Go ahead.

172
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,700
Well, I'd like to talk to Gary Gabrogfan. I heard he's going to be on the radio this morning.

173
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,580
Yes, he is.

174
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,880
We're trying to keep his mic down.

175
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,000
Is he cool?

176
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,920
Well, I'm going to sleep. This show is terrible. What time does the band start?

177
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,760
No, he's here. Go ahead. Speak to him.

178
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,460
Yeah, the drums aren't even out of the box yet.

179
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
The drums aren't even out of the box yet.

180
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,500
Not you, caller.

181
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,700
But you know who we have? Ivan Stang.

182
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,320
Oh, yes.

183
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,320
The queen of UFOs. Lies.

184
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,080
Hang on, hang on.

185
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,220
I know Drummond. Okay, I'm sorry.

186
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,700
Hello?

187
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,740
Oh, yes. Good hello. I just have one question.

188
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,220
You got one answer?

189
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,320
I want to send you some vinyl that I'm going to be getting, you know, records.

190
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,920
Oh, is this a personal message?

191
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,040
Oh, geez, we have to stop the show because...

192
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,220
We can't really deal with personal messages on the air.

193
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,720
All right.

194
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,640
This is full-time entertainment here.

195
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,400
All right. I'm sorry. Bye-bye.

196
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,440
No, that's okay. What were you going to send me?

197
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,360
Oh, some vinyl, you know, because my grandfather had some, like, records from World War II.

198
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,080
Is there any sound on this vinyl?

199
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,620
Oh, yes.

200
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,160
Oh, good.

201
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,380
Okay, my question was, should I send it to the address on your website?

202
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,680
No. Well, what's that one? I forget.

203
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,220
I don't know. Well, I'll just email somebody, I guess, and I'll get the information.

204
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Just had that prediction about burning it.

205
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,040
Yeah, email me through the website.

206
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,260
I'll tell you where to send it.

207
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,600
Okay.

208
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,400
Have a good one.

209
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,620
Thank you. I appreciate all the...

210
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,280
Yes, that was a disturbing prediction that Dobbs made about Burning Man disappearing by the year 2037.

211
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,680
The church just takes everything and folds it inside themselves.

212
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,520
Now, caller, you're listening and talking to the amazing lowerarchy of the subgenius church

213
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,580
started over two decades ago in the spooky town of Dallas.

214
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,620
That's the executive lowerarchy.

215
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,220
Not to be confused with the real hierarchy, which started in 1953.

216
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,340
Right.

217
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,120
It is confusing. It's a church. It's a religion.

218
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,000
But that was just Dobbs and Alfred Hitchcock and Dennis Hopper and a few other select individuals.

219
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,480
I feel like I'm descending down the rabbit hole of business.

220
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,400
At some point, we really need the...

221
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,800
This is just like a James Bond set.

222
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,600
Where's the drummer?

223
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,960
It is on the shits.

224
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,900
Oh, the drummer's in for those spider-

225
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,720
Well, I can see we're going to have some problems getting to the panel.

226
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,420
I think this is the panel.

227
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,820
People just don't want to be that organized here.

228
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
Okay, great.

229
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,500
So it's going to be so much fun.

230
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,720
Oh, yeah, that's really good.

231
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,920
Plus, David Meyer's supposed to be calling in today.

232
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,380
Oh, great.

233
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,520
Because I was really hoping other Doctores would happen, like, Byron Werner's here.

234
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,580
Doctores.

235
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,120
Who are these guys talking about?

236
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,140
I vaguely remember these names from some time in the...

237
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,120
David Meyer, he's a skier that...

238
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,080
Cowboy Dave is here, but he's partying up here.

239
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,220
Famous long ago.

240
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,700
Dinosaurs of slack.

241
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,440
Roar!

242
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,420
Wow.

243
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,320
Digital insert here.

244
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,480
Back in the day, that is day one, the true...

245
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,940
Was that the Permian or the Devonian or the carbonaceous?

246
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,420
Carboniferin.

247
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,100
Or the carbon fiber age.

248
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,560
It was the carbon fiber age.

249
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,820
The carbonated peanut butter got all over the microphone and was not usable for the rest

250
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,220
of the show.

251
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,140
Yes, it...

252
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,400
Either was Hal, so...

253
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,940
And it tickled my nose.

254
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,140
That's your nose?

255
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,420
That's your nose?

256
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


257
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


258
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


259
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


260
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


261
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


262
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


263
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,640
Yeah.

264
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,060
Where's the Frock workshop, please?

265
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,380
Somebody gave her coffee.

266
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,100
Hey, I was wondering about that, too.

267
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,900
Where is the Frock workshop?

268
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,240
The Frock workshop.

269
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,060
The Frock workshop.

270
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,300
Oh, now I feel like the...

271
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,020
What was it we were doing was the...

272
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,120
The Frock workshop.

273
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,860
We have to start again.

274
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,240
We have to begin the show now.

275
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,700
The subgenius of the coin store.

276
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,120
Get everybody lined up first.

277
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,740
Ken?

278
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,520
Everybody has to be lined up.

279
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,040
Well, is this those shots again?

280
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,120
That's one of those inspections.

281
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,840
Line them up and shine them up.

282
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,340
When is the horrible theme music coming?

283
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,400
When is the horrible theme music coming?

284
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,400


285
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,400


286
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,400


287
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,400


288
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,780
When do we get to go to Malaysia adoption?

289
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
All right.

290
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,120
Who's hosting this panel?

291
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,800
I guess you should be, but...

292
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,380
I think Mr. Stank should host the panel in the next hundred years.

293
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,900
Well, he's certainly the primary easement.

294
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,400
As we gather together to commence this august assemb...

295
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,100
What?

296
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:26,960
Who's here?

297
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,400
Is he drunk?

298
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,980
That sounds too definite.

299
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,840
Santa, it's not August.

300
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,920
I mean, actually, it's a big question.

301
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,860
The next hundred years...

302
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,020
He is drunk.

303
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,420
It is a huge question.

304
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,060
And we should...

305
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,380
And Santa, it's not August.

306
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,380


307
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,820
And we really need Philodromus, who we need, because he's the business manager, the closest

308
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,040
to giving everybody the business of all the doctors here today.

309
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,600
Actually, Jesus replaced Philo.

310
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:47,920
Oh, yeah.

311
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,320
No, no.

312
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,460
Philo is not...

313
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,460


314
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,060
Because Jesus is not here, unfortunately.

315
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,040
He's not with us.

316
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,060
He's busy during the season.

317
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,820
Well, yeah.

318
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,680
This is the season of turnover.

319
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,300
Yep.

320
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,920
And he couldn't be with us, which would be great.

321
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,400
But...

322
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,640
So the closest we have to an old-fashioned businessman is...

323
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,500
Philodromus.

324
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,240
Because Philodromus works for the conspiracy.

325
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,380
Yeah.

326
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,580
He always has, always will.

327
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,080
Yep.

328
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,240
Well, you...

329
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,880
He gets a good deal.

330
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,860
Jesus or...

331
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,600
Or...

332
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,220
Jilo.

333
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,340
Jilo.

334
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,840
Yeah.

335
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,700
Make sure you wash off...

336
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:15,780
Rob.

337
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,660
I've got a Philo like no Philo you've ever seen.

338
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Rob.

339
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,580
Jilo.

340
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,280
Jilo the Torturer.

341
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,660
Give me some sound.

342
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,200
He's the most tortured businessman.

343
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,780
He's gonna replace Bob.

344
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,560
Yeah, everybody's tired of Bob.

345
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,860
We got this new Jilo thing.

346
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,840
Now, the Flash is gonna bounce off that little glass window.

347
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,540
We're gonna make a million bucks off of Jilo.

348
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,060
Flash and me.

349
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,520
He smokes a cigarette instead of a pipe.

350
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,920
Okay, set up for the banjo.

351
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,300
Which guy?

352
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,380
The guy who's gonna make a million bucks off of Jilo.

353
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,380


354
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
The Eeyore of the church.

355
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,700
I think everything is...

356
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,840
Jilo Dummond.

357
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,500
Yeah, but what about all these...

358
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,380
Jilo was held in great honor by the tribe.

359
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't know.

360
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,040
I don't wanna...

361
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,400
B.M.

362
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,560
Jilo Dummond.

363
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,460
See, we just invented another church.

364
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,800
Looks like Bud Goodster's giving up.

365
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,140
They never say...

366
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,120
Well, that's that for the next 100 years.

367
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,580
It's the only thing that's going on with the cappuccinos, man.

368
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:55,740
Yep.

369
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,720
Everybody here knows how to say...

370
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,520
Praise Jilo.

371
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,500
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,

372
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,840
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,

373
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:06,840


374
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,020
Now see, you can even trace the evolution of the...

375
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,440
Hoo!

376
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,440
Pfft, ah!

377
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,980
All the way from that basic...

378
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,200
Yes, all the original...

379
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,500
Up to the now rather stylized...

380
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,900
But you know, also it's regional.

381
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,160
There is the California...

382
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,660
Hoo!

383
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,500
Hoo!

384
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,020
Hoo!

385
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,920
And what was the Texas one?

386
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, the original...

387
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,560
The original, Drumundian.

388
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,300
Hoo!

389
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,740
Pfft, ah!

390
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,700
Hoo!

391
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,480
very quickly. Well, that's why it was truncated.

392
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,140
Way in the background. You've got to get by a mic there.

393
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,720
Into the politically correct...

394
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,540
Mic that Dr. Drummond.

395
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,020
Yes, mic that whole other room.

396
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,340
How about this mic? Does it work?

397
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
But as we've asked for 20 years,

398
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,980
is this church to devolve

399
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,020
into nothing but inside joke

400
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,820
squeals and funny sounds?

401
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,000
I second that.

402
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,660
And for 20 years,

403
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,720
it has done exactly that.

404
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,980
Praise God! Praise Bob!

405
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,560
Praise Jilo!

406
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,800
Oh yeah, that's right, Jilo!

407
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,240
Praise Jilo!

408
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,160
Let's go back to the old church.

409
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,780
Oh, check, check, check.

410
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,960
Back, back, back in time.

411
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,820
Watch those calendar pages all the way.

412
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,060
Laurie's birthday party.

413
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,880
That's an amazing one.

414
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,860
That was a pretty good one.

415
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,380
That was...

416
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,160
That was...

417
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,140
That was...

418
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,880
So we'll talk about that later,

419
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,720
but right now, folks,

420
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,480
it's the business.

421
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,520
Richard's not going to die.

422
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,980
The man can get back to get free.

423
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,980
Dr. Esselteric, are you jumping into this?

424
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,920
All right, boys.

425
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,640
The proceeds from the last Janer tape

426
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,360
amounted to $100 million.

427
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,580
About $15769.

428
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,460
And of course,

429
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,560
with the...

430
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,180
At 12% each,

431
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,540
that means you all get here.

432
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,820
$6, $7, $8.

433
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,220
$9.

434
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,080
Yeah, that's it.

435
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,820
Buck naked.

436
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,500
You're not allowed to say

437
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,100
buck naked in the church no more.

438
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,580
There are all these Texan churches,

439
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,240
but we'll just turn off that sound effect.

440
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,840
If you were right to call number 18,

441
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,460
you've been chosen

442
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,060
from the Christmas tree of callers,

443
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,980
and you now can address the show doctors.

444
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,620
Please ask your question.

445
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,400
848-442-3888.

446
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,400
I'll say it.

447
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,820
I do.

448
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,120
Well, it's one of those Zen questions, apparently.

449
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,020
I've got five hours of...

450
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,880
If you consider yourself a musician,

451
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,000
and...

452
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,800
No, no, no.

453
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
I didn't say do your show on our show.

454
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,100
He does that on our show, too.

455
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,360
Oh, he does that on all the shows.

456
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,220
Oh, I have a question.

457
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,060
I got an answer.

458
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,560
Yes, I was wondering,

459
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,940
is it all right if I knock my friend out

460
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,640
with a shovel and bury him in the backyard

461
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,960
like they did in that one Beavis and Butt-Hitch?

462
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,800
Good, hello.

463
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,800
If you mark the grave clearly.

464
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,760
Okay.

465
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,580
Only if you videotape it

466
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,680
and send it to America's Funniest Home Videos.

467
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,140
Because if you don't tape it,

468
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,660
it didn't work.

469
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:01,860
It didn't happen.

470
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,760
Right, exactly.

471
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,740
And if it...

472
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,500
Not only that,

473
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,220
nowadays, why everybody tapes everything,

474
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,760
if it doesn't appear somehow on TV,

475
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,720
it didn't happen.

476
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,780
Well, I can always play it on the underground TV.

477
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,920
Well, that sort of happens.

478
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
But really, you should be asking the question of the doctor.

479
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,220
You have an amazing opportunity here

480
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,720
to go back to the beginning.

481
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,480
I would like to know

482
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,200
what's going to happen in the next hundred years

483
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,420
if there's still going to be LSD available.

484
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,940
Well, there hasn't been any available,

485
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,200
but I don't know if it's ever going to be available again

486
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,260
in the next hundred years.

487
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,540
I'd like to know what's going to happen.

488
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,760
I'd like to know if religion...

489
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,280
Two months.

490
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,280
I'd like to wait two months,

491
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,820
and then the new little...

492
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,900
Well, why don't you just take that acid trip there

493
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,520
and just relax there, buddy.

494
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,340
And then a hundred years from now,

495
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,620
there'll be this skull with just these two metal teeth.

496
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,820
Well, that point is nothing around.

497
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,520
It's around the Middle East.

498
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,820
You talk about Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois...

499
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,140
You know, there's nothing to trip about, man.

500
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,580
You know, the world ends, the world ends, you know?

501
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,900
What about that LSD I sold you last night

502
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,880
on Telegraph Avenue?

503
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,780
What about all that LSD we sent to the Middle East last year?

504
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,320
What about all the LSD we just took just an hour ago?

505
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, that LSD!

506
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,500
What?

507
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,720
I was wondering.

508
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,720
That explains a lot.

509
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,300
That explains a hell of a lot.

510
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,260
That was dope, huh?

511
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:09,900
What?

512
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:10,800
Hello?

513
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,760
I should have given him the bad acid again.

514
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,660
Are we going to get hit by a meteor?

515
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,660
And he'll hook you up for good.

516
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
You should know the one named Half Acid shows.

517
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,280
You're just going to drown in your own natural stupidity.

518
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,860
Don't worry about it.

519
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,020
Good God.

520
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,460
Okay.

521
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,960
They're rocking out already.

522
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,380
Something we'd like to play for you out there.

523
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,240
Radio Land is a little something that kind of goes a little something like this.

524
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,840
A little something.

525
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,640
That's a little something, all right.

526
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, it's a nice song, though.

527
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,520
You know, really, the past, the present, and the future

528
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,860
is just one big cycle.

529
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,440
I believe.

530
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,740
Is that what you mean?

531
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,220
Right?

532
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:46,600
Yeah.

533
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,640
Look out, kid.

534
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,660
It's something you did.

535
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,100
God bless you.

536
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,360
Are you guys really entertaining, or is that just the drugs talking?

537
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,000
Does anybody have any idea how loud my new guitar is?

538
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,420
Yeah, you want to show us?

539
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,880
You won't even believe how loud it is.

540
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,640
I thought this was the...

541
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,360
This is the business meeting, and you guys are still tuning up your...

542
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,640
Well, this is actually the next so-called band.

543
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,740
It is.

544
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,500
Business meeting.

545
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,240
It is.

546
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,660
It's the rules of order, man.

547
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,200
Oh, he's doing his business meeting with the description of how far down the church has

548
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,740
gone and how far up it's going to go.

549
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,500
I am not the fan of religion that I'm sure that the religious people would like to hear

550
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,100
on the air.

551
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,420
Uh-oh.

552
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,140
Uh-oh.

553
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,420
Yeah.

554
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,480
True church.

555
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,060
Was that Jilo himself that just called in?

556
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,180


557
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,180


558
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,780
Red, blue, yeah.

559
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,640
True church.

560
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:31,640


561
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:31,640


562
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,860
True, one true blue church.

563
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,580
Because you notice he didn't use a phone.

564
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,760
I find it to be dangerous, prejudicial, childish, and now I think we need to realize that it's

565
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,740
uncomfortable that it could get you killed.

566
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,180
Jilo was over.

567
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:53,200
And facing 2009, the church of the subgenius was again left with the burning question,

568
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,460
where does the church go for the next 91 years?

569
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,280
Well, according...

570
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,160
Well, according...

571
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:08,560
According to the science of psyche history, the Stang plan calls for Jilo to be retired

572
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,940
fairly soon, within the next five or ten minutes.

573
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:21,240
And then we have to move on to the next deity, the merchant prince, who is apparently some

574
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,200
kind of pop star.

575
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,140
Let's trade the church for a winning lottery ticket.

576
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,360
You said Jilo.

577
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,100
No, Jilo.

578
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,640
Oh, Jilo.

579
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,380
Jilo.

580
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:30,600
Oh, okay.

581
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,140
Okay.

582
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


583
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


584
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


585
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


586
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


587
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


588
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


589
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


590
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,700
All right.

591
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:31,700


592
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,560
Or something like that.

593
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,080
Okay.

594
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,720
It was according to the...

595
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,820
It's based on Michael Pepe.

596
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,420
Do you ever notice how Sulphur Lake sounds just like a mist game?

597
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,160
Yeah, only it really stinks.

598
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,720
Yeah.

599
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,320
And when are they going to change the land and make my room...

600
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:44,980
And they built a little town.

601
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,200
Well, it's a stinky mist.

602
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
RJ came from there.

603
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,220
Well, then why did we decide to hold this business conference here?

604
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,900
I thought we were supposed to.

605
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,120
Yeah.

606
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,680
It smells horrible.

607
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,080
It smells horrible.

608
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,560
It's really okay.

609
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:53,960
Look.

610
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,220
Look.

611
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,420
Let's everybody get some hot butter rum martinis and just relax.

612
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,760
Let's sit in the seats there.

613
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:58,780
Yeah.

614
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,280
Just concentrate on the matter at hand.

615
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,780
Just concentrate on the matter at hand.

616
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:00,780


617
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,620
Right over there.

618
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,740
This is great.

619
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,280
Look what I got.

620
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,000
Dinosaur legs.

621
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,740
Got five cereals.

622
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,800
They'll eject any of them at any time.

623
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,400
What were you saying, Dr. Evidence?

624
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,180
I said I got some fried dinosaur legs over there.

625
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,860
Hard as rock.

626
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,560
Five?

627
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,440
Sure.

628
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,240
For a dollar.

629
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,640
Five kinds of dinosaurs.

630
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,340
You know, by the year 3003, you'll all be eating frozen dinosaur legs.

631
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,280
It looks like Clive is standing and speaking in the main hall.

632
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,800
Something's happening in here.

633
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,940
It's like explosions are...

634
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,180
You'll all be eating cloned frozen mammoth burgers by the year...

635
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,800
What was that year?

636
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,120
We need to get the plumber up here.

637
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,060
Get the building guy back here.

638
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,420
This thing isn't working right.

639
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,800
It's making all kinds of noise.

640
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,700
Hey, so Philo, are we going to get to any business?

641
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,340
I mean, are you going to give us a business?

642
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,860
Well, yeah, but we're waiting for everybody to get here.

643
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,800
No, you're waiting for the script to get here.

644
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,720
Oh, for God's sake.

645
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,560
Everybody's here.

646
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,180
We'll wait forever for that.

647
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,540
I've been waiting for over 20 years for that.

648
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,520
You got a script in here yet.

649
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,820
At least I don't have my part yet.

650
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,940
Everybody's here.

651
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,760
They're all seated.

652
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,260
My head went rubber for that.

653
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,540
That's what my script says.

654
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,080
Okay, do we have an invocation here?

655
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:23,780
Yes, Jim.

656
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,700
Yes, could we open with a prayer?

657
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,440
What is that noise?

658
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,300
That's some wambling.

659
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,200
Sacred noise of some kind.

660
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,220
All right, the panel is about to begin.

661
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,840
Look, the place is filled.

662
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,840
I couldn't believe all these people are here to hear us.

663
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,820
And now, the prayer.

664
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,000
Now I lay me down to sleep.

665
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,060
Good frop, good meat, good God, let's eat.

666
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,240
Have at it, boys.

667
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,380
Okay.

668
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,980
Go ahead.

669
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,380
Are we ready?

670
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,740
Cut open the sacrificial whatever that thing is.

671
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,480
The sacrificial piece.

672
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,540
The sacrificial sucker.

673
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,360
Let's move on into the dining room.

674
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,260
Hey, what do you think of this thing so far?

675
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,460
It's really, I can't believe all those guys are here.

676
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,300
It's really, you know.

677
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,000
It is pretty amazing.

678
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,640
That's what I'm saying.

679
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,020
It's great.

680
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,680
4-8-4-2-3-5 to see all of these amazing doctors in their amazing normal state here naked on the air.

681
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,320
Well, I thought that was the press.

682
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,760
All those guys with the cameras.

683
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,980
Those are the other doctors?

684
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,080
No, those are the waiters and the chefs.

685
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,520
They just, they press hard.

686
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,100
The new doctors.

687
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,880
I don't know who any of these guys are.

688
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,520
They're the waiters.

689
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,260
I guess I've been holed up in that.

690
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,480
If you don't, we're in trouble.

691
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,460
I've been holed up in that ivory tower in Dobbs Town for so long.

692
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,760
I don't know who any of these people are.

693
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:37,760


694
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,100
Yeah.

695
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,860
All living beings.

696
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,420
This thing's a test.

697
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,600
Is it butter?

698
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,440
Can I have a collar?

699
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,160
Can you pass the gravy?

700
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,340
Thanks.

701
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,620
Hey, does Acid Burnout Man ever call this show?

702
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,680
No.

703
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,000
No.

704
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,060
No.

705
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,420
No.

706
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:52,720
No.

707
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:52,740
No.

708
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:52,740


709
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:52,740


710
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:52,740


711
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,620
He's my shadow a lot.

712
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,720
I can hear the doctors.

713
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,500
Some of the doctors are in there skinning their cats.

714
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,980
Is that what they call it?

715
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,140
That's what your kids call it now.

716
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,200
They're skinning the cats.

717
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,200
They're taking the bones out of them now.

718
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,360
It's a really horrible, horrible thing, but that's the only way they can get their instruments

719
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,760
tuned.

720
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,700
All living beings must eat.

721
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,020
Well, it's not for food.

722
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,280
They don't even eat them.

723
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,320
They just use the cat gut to tune their instruments with.

724
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,700
Oh look, Philo's giving a speech.

725
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,900
Captives birds to tune their instruments, but...

726
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,040
What about the next hundred years? What's going to happen?

727
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,400
I'm just concerned about this. Where do I get the coffee in the next five minutes?

728
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,500
Where are the hookers? They were supposed to be at this convention.

729
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,640
We got the coffee.

730
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,820
What kind of way... I need a different room.

731
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,740
The hookers are down by the swimming pool.

732
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,920
I'm going to head down to the swimming pool myself.

733
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,020
General Hooker of the Union Army.

734
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,400
I'm going to be taking my bathing suit, heading down to the swimming pool.

735
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,860
I've got General Hooker's skull here. Hello, is that G. Gordon Gordon?

736
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,140
I'm going to take the skull down there with me.

737
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,880
It's David Meyer, actually.

738
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,740
I thought this was the Church of the Subgenius.

739
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,860
No, no, it's not.

740
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,120
The Church of the Subgenius.

741
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,420
How did you get in here? Do you have your pass?

742
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,800
No, no, no. This is the Church of the Subgenius.

743
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,020
That's a duh genius. That's a trademark.

744
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,760
Do you have a pass? How did you get in here?

745
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,480
Do you want to hear about the subgenius?

746
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,720
You're not wearing your pass.

747
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,160
You can ask any question about the subgenius and learn amazing things secretly.

748
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,220
Especially about the next hundred years.

749
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:34,960
Yeah.

750
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,600
What do you want to know about the next hundred years?

751
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,060
I know about slugs.

752
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:40,960
Slugs?

753
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,980
Okay, what will slugs be like in the next hundred years to the Church of the Subgenius members?

754
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,900
Just the same as they are today.

755
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,580
Oh, that's okay.

756
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,940
That's the good thing about slugs.

757
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,380
They just basically never change.

758
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,900
But what of progress? What of evolution?

759
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,700
Something you can count on.

760
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,340
What of forward striving?

761
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,900
Well, the slugs thumb their noses.

762
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,340
What of slack?

763
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,700
Can we not learn of slack from the slugs?

764
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,400
If a slug had a nose and a thumb, they would thumb their noses at the very thought of evolutionary progress.

765
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,920
I'll bet none of you have ever seen slugs screwing.

766
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,740
Yeah, but you know what?

767
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,620
Don't bet. It's bad for you.

768
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,220
You've been using drugs.

769
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,440
It can lead to addiction.

770
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,500
Well, a long time ago.

771
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,700
No, and the effects are still with you now.

772
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,440
You must have used that frock stuff that never wears off.

773
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,900
I'm sorry, you're having a flashback right now.

774
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,300
Would you please get off the ceiling?

775
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,600
Get off the ceiling.

776
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,160
Just take a deep breath.

777
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,680
You know what? The other thing is you could be...

778
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,820
That's what slugs do.

779
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,520
Yeah, when the slugs are having intercourse with each other, it's really something that is very amazing.

780
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,260
Just watch that one part in Microcosmos, you know?

781
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,860
Just watch that one over and over and over again.

782
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,100
Slugs are hermaphroditic.

783
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,780
Isn't that correct?

784
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,760
I mean, some of them.

785
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,840
At least the last one that I was with was.

786
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,940
Did you chew its penis off, Dr. Drummond, in order to change its sex before you used it?

787
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,300
Well, I didn't actually have to chew it.

788
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,120
I used a surgical instrument that I keep in my back pocket just for that purpose,

789
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,960
along the side of the ketchup bottle I keep back there as well.

790
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,380
The ketchup bottle and the slug castrator?

791
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,980
The ketchup bottle is for special effects, right?

792
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,860
The ketchup bottle, the slug castrator, and my pocket knife.

793
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,780
What is the identical out? It's a combination.

794
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,120
It's a combination.

795
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,280
It comes from the male and then goes back to traction and then becomes female because they do it with their antennas.

796
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,020
They do it with their antennas. They pull their antennae in and they're a female.

797
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,420
They push it out and they're a male.

798
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,060
I wish I could do that.

799
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,580
And when they're done, they stab each other with their lung daggers.

800
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,240
Maybe find that for a friendly bird.

801
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,920
Man, now that's advanced. That's the way it should be.

802
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,500
You know, they've been doing it right for thousands and thousands of years.

803
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,720
Can I pass the peas, please? Thank you.

804
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,740
Wait a minute. Haven't you read my research paper in slug?

805
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,140
Chicken tastes like rubber.

806
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,760
Who's catering?

807
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,120
Did you say slug nanotechnology?

808
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,620
I thought the quote was, this rubber tastes like chicken all in a minute.

809
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,440
Yes, yes, it's rubber nanotechnology. Now that's what I'm talking about.

810
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:53,780
Yeah.

811
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,460
Well, bubbles.

812
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,040
Is that like the same as the bubble tech?

813
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,580
That's so I can have some cereal at 3 AM like I'm home.

814
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,740
Or is it, yeah, is it, is this cereal technology?

815
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,640
No, it's analog.

816
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,000
Analog, okay.

817
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,860
You cut it in a log.

818
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:14,520
It's analog. Okay, you put it in the log and then you squeeze the log real hard and it comes out in the back.

819
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,980
Oh, look, milk gets the slugs in my mouth.

820
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,040
Oh, slugs do merge.

821
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,040


822
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,540
So slugs do merge slowly into the highway lanes and it always wrecks.

823
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,580
So aren't we getting ready for some kind of dinner or something we're supposed to go to here?

824
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,360
I'm getting hungry.

825
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,340
You, Philo.

826
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,160
It's happening.

827
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,720
Oh, it's happening right now.

828
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,640
Yeah, everybody's eating and talking right now.

829
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,560
Okay, where's my, where's my food? Where's my dinner? I want my dinner.

830
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,160
It's coming. We're a little short on help tonight.

831
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,700
I'm waiting for my sandwich.

832
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,760
Your free sandwich for being on the show?

833
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,260
I'm waiting for my hooker.

834
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,560
What about the business report?

835
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,520
Oh, the business report.

836
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,120
Investments, you know.

837
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,240
Oh, yeah, investments. Yeah, we made some investments.

838
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,620
We made some good ones. We made some bad ones.

839
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,780
We made some ones that were good in the long haul but short in the short haul.

840
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,320
My new slug hooker technique.

841
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:12,960
The good thing about our business investments is that they continue on and we use a special secret technique that we derived from a little atom that we got out of Bob's brain years and years ago.

842
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,240
We put it inside of a, of a slug.

843
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,720
It's a little triangle along with these crystal pyramids.

844
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
This crystal pyramid.

845
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,780
And that does two things for us.

846
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:32,020
It predicts the future infallibly and it helps us determine what our next week's menu will be.

847
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,700
Well, it makes the banana peel stronger.

848
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,620
It makes the banana come off of the banana peel faster.

849
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,140
And it makes the razor blade sharper.

850
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,400
Sharper, but only while you're cutting.

851
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,820
And yet smoother.

852
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,720
Smoother and softer.

853
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,780
For the smooth, the softest, smoothest shave you could expect.

854
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,180
Ah.

855
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,160
For any slug.

856
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,200
A slug shave.

857
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,140
Crawling across your face.

858
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,000
A long, a straight razor.

859
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,780
Leaving the trailing, leaving the little droppings behind.

860
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,740
The sludge trail.

861
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,480
Well, it sounds like we're in a storm.

862
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,060
Is the prayer over?

863
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,800
I sure hope we did well.

864
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,660
Did we put a roof on this thing?

865
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,840
I think the fair...

866
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,060
Is the prayer over?

867
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,360
I predict that the entertainment personalities...

868
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,560
Okay, amen.

869
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,040
...personalities of the future will be entertainment personalities and nothing else.

870
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,540
Sergeant Vredes, what were you just saying about the...

871
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,400
The future, if you want a picture of the next...

872
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,380
When someone pays admission to hear a singer or a comedian...

873
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,800
But, really...

874
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,280
What about the...

875
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,480
The radio isn't about pictures.

876
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,860
It's about images.

877
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,760
Wow, where'd you learn that, New York?

878
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah, I went to school for a lot of, you know, borrowed money, all that, and that's all I came out with.

879
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,280
So it wasn't pictures all along, it was images.

880
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,260
That explains everything.

881
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,020
That's where we went wrong.

882
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,980
You mean JPEG?

883
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,740
I always thought it was...

884
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,380
You mean JPEG?

885
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,500
...graphic portrayals of...

886
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:13,800
...of...

887
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,020
...of auditory devices.

888
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,580
I promise to do better.

889
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,260
Let's get back to the next hundred years.

890
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,320
Graven images.

891
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,740
Graven images.

892
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,360
That's all it is.

893
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,560
Makes...

894
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,400
Let's get this next hundred years out on the table right now.

895
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,540
Let's kind of roll it around and look at it and let's see if it's what we really want to do.

896
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,560
It will not tolerate protest messages.

897
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:39,760
Let's autopsy this hundred year plan and see what gas rises out of it.

898
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,740
Oh, man, that's dangerous.

899
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:48,400
I've had some bad luck with gas recently, and so I won't go there right now, but...

900
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
...the laws of karma.

901
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:50,880
If you...

902
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,660
Yeah, if something...

903
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,080
If you...

904
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,440
If you have a bad smell later, then...

905
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,140
The next hundred years is...

906
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,740
Don't look at me.

907
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,140
...a prairie squid crawling along a straight razor forever.

908
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
No, a straight edge.

909
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,980
Just the straight edge.

910
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,180
Yeah.

911
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,940
Okay, cue music.

912
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,540
No, we don't care.

913
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,660
Razor, blade, anything sharp.

914
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,560
It's got to be sharp.

915
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,560
It's got to be sharp.

916
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
It's got to have a slug on it.

917
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,500
And it's got to be in the future.

918
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:21,000
And, you know, with the snorting and the pig technology of the future.

919
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,640
There's no fit but what we make for a sound.

920
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,920
All right.

921
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,160
So where's that one guy who's got that...

922
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,500
Right.

923
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,260
...that one thing that's supposed to make this show the best show?

924
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,200
Outside.

925
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,260
Outside.

926
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,160
He's outside.

927
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,880
Oh, he has the slack, and that is what we needed.

928
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,220
We haven't let him...

929
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,580
He didn't show up again.

930
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,820
I figured something was missing.

931
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,700
Where is he?

932
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,160
Where is that guy?

933
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,900
Where is that pipe guy?

934
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,220
Where is that pipe guy?

935
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,220


936
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,940
Where is that Bob Dobbs?

937
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,380
I think...

938
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,300
Where is that pipe guy?

939
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,960
...I disagree with Chairman Bob...

940
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,140
Where are those X-men?

941
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,740
...there he'll be with the chairman, Bob...

942
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,400
Once again, we are X-ist-less.

943
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,260
...the relationship...

944
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:04,340
This X-ist-lessness-ness, we once again get to stay upon the earth.

945
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:04,700
It's chaotic.

946
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,700
It's chaotic.

947
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,860
Thanks to the non-rival of Bob's business partners, the men from Planet X.

948
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,700
I don't want to be with the chairman, Bob.

949
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


950
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


951
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


952
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


953
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


954
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


955
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


956
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,320
I don't want to do the Reverend σε scarcity and extravagance.

957
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,060
I think it would be bye-bye rock ticket and toast.

958
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,060


959
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,460
I can't do it.

960
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,460


961
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,440
Anyways, it's dog food.

962
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,040
Spon quieren tirola solo una neue Orthodoxy?

963
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,600

970
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,260
How many more times?

971
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Yeah, we're going to start again.

972
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,120
We're going to start the show again.

973
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,380
Oh, yeah.

974
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:00,800
Oh, yeah.

975
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,520
That's right.

976
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:01,840
The show.

977
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,480
Oh, man.

978
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,120
Where are we?

979
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,560
What town is this?

980
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,360
Okay.

981
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,320
Is this Los Angeles?

982
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,300
No, we're in the Bay Area.

983
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,680
Oh.

984
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:10,760
Oh.

985
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,140
Okay.

986
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,140
When does the show start?

987
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,880
Right.

988
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,680
Right.

989
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,920
Oh, should I start the tape?

990
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,500
I don't really need them, but you never know when you can use them.

991
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,360
Okay.

992
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,380
Now the tense, scary part of the show starts.

993
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,940
This is where the scary part starts.

994
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,360
Yep.

995
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,700
For a hundred years.

996
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm going to get ready.

997
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,180
For the next hundred years.

998
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,260
To not be scared.

999
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,340
I hear that spooky.

1000
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,160
Now, what is this?

1001
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,780
The business report?

1002
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,180
This is the business report.

1003
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,700
Or is it the end of the prayer?

1004
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,620
We finished.

1005
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,200
We finished the prayer.

1006
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,680
We did.

1007
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:41,960
Okay.

1008
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,740
The prayer is over now.

1009
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,480
I did not hear an amen, but I will take your word for that.

1010
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:45,900
Okay.

1011
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,900
Well, we don't say amen in this church.

1012
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,800
Oh, I get you.

1013
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,040
So it's sort of like you were waiting for your cue.

1014
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,800
It never came.

1015
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,280
Yeah.

1016
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,440
You didn't know.

1017
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:53,740
Yeah.

1018
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,620
That, heck, we've already been.

1019
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,140
We've been into the second part for like ten minutes now.

1020
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,540
Yeah.

1021
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,400
Yeah, I know.

1022
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,680
It's pretty amazing.

1023
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,160
I knew that.

1024
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,680
I knew that.

1025
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,480
Well, I knew you knew that.

1026
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:02,700
Yeah.

1027
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,760
Intuitively, you knew it.

1028
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:03,880
Yeah.

1029
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,740
But you didn't really have it connected in the same sequence yet.

1030
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,240
Amen.

1031
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,120
Well, we usually say, huh?

1032
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,500
Huh?

1033
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:10,500


1034
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,220
Huh?

1035
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,680
At the end?

1036
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,300
Yeah, that's it.

1037
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,160
I didn't hear that either.

1038
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,940
We usually say, what do we usually say?

1039
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:14,960


1040
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,480
Uh-huh.

1041
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,140
We say, huh.

1042
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,580
Okay.

1043
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,700
Now, you said that, right?

1044
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,360
Uh-huh.

1045
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,780
Uh-huh.

1046
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:19,900
Amen.

1047
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,620
All right.

1048
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,560
Let's get right.

1049
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,360
Let's move right on into the business report.

1050
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,660
Okay.

1051
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,140
Well, we're going to give.

1052
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,980
Or did you give that?

1053
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,480
All right.

1054
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,860
Well, I'm going to give the business report now.

1055
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,960
Well, what was next?

1056
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,940
It's good news and bad news.

1057
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,080
Well, I'm glad all of you folks could come together tonight to hear this great business

1058
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,500
report that we have that's going to talk about the next 100 years and what's in it in the

1059
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:40,740
church.

1060
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:47,480
And I hope that you don't hold any of those allegations of abuse and corporate fraud that

1061
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,960
we have.

1062
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,900
They've been leveled.

1063
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,900
I know.

1064
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,240
I know.

1065
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,660
I know.

1066
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:51,820
I know.

1067
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,160
But really, it's all false.

1068
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,860
When the truth comes out, it's just there's nothing there.

1069
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,980
I mean, it's just the emperor has no clothes.

1070
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,860
Our enemies will stop at nothing to blacken Bob's name.

1071
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,320
Our enemies do that.

1072
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,060
They've done that.

1073
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,500
They've done that for years.

1074
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,800
They've gotten into our books.

1075
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
They've changed our ledgers.

1076
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,940
They've actually recorded things that didn't exist.

1077
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,760
And when the IRS came in, we didn't have any choice but just to deny it.

1078
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,940
We weren't there and we did not do that.

1079
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,560
We didn't.

1080
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,120
We didn't.

1081
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,840
We really didn't.

1082
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,040
By the sacred doctrine of erasability, I swear.

1083
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,960
Or any other woman.

1084
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:34,740
But in particular, the allegations of abuse of the state and the people that go into it.

1085
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:34,880
I mean, it's just.

1086
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,340
It's not true.

1087
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,140
It's just not true.

1088
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,340
You don't need to go into that much detail, Dr.

1089
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:38,800
Drummond.

1090
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:52,240
So I say whatever your expenses are down for Homeland Security are the we've funded our we've given our share to the funding of the Homeland Security for that.

1091
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:59,300
We want one of those those Star Wars satellites to hover over our headquarters building.

1092
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,060
We think it's important that it be close to us so that when the bombs.

1093
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,420
The missiles start coming.

1094
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,920
We will have our own private Star Wars defense shield.

1095
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,720
I spent.

1096
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,520
I know.

1097
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:13,680
I know.

1098
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,920
Those are very dependable.

1099
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,800
We had a sacrifice.

1100
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,660
Well, you know, it's we figured three out of three out of ten is better than none out of ten.

1101
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,620
Yeah.

1102
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,620
They work as well as computers.

1103
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,160
And besides, it's the government that's paying for it.

1104
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,660
We don't have to pay for it.

1105
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,660
It's the government that's paying for it.

1106
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,040
We don't have to pay for it.

1107
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,040


1108
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,740
I thought that invisible hand guy.

1109
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,820
We're going to tax the land this time.

1110
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
We're not going to tax people anymore.

1111
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,760
We're going to tax the land.

1112
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,460
And once the land pays up their taxes, the people will be really happy.

1113
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,420
Oh, he tried this 100 years ago and it only got us this far.

1114
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,860
Well, we have to go.

1115
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,020
We can only go 100 years at a time.

1116
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,080
That was the last hundred years.

1117
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,580
It's the smallest.

1118
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,060
Please.

1119
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
We could afford.

1120
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,120
Stay focused.

1121
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,040
And now maybe for the next hundred years, we might break the record.

1122
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,040


1123
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,480
We could break it up into like 50 year units.

1124
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:12,260
You know, like two big two and a quarter 50 year units.

1125
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,260
A 50 year plan instead of a hundred year plan.

1126
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,100
That's radical.

1127
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,300
Well, you know, the change.

1128
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,360
You're moving too fast.

1129
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:27,060
The pace of change has gotten to be such that we can't we can no longer rely on the far that the outer reaches of our hundred year plan.

1130
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,220
We've got to we've got to have a more tactical approach to things.

1131
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,700
We have to know what's going to happen, like, say, 20 minutes from now.

1132
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,720
It doesn't help us to know what's going to happen 20 years from now.

1133
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,760
Right now.

1134
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:50,620
I mean, we've got to know, like, should I should I put my hand in my pocket and should I, you know, resist the urge to to urinate on Dr. Drummond?

1135
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,280
Dr. Drummond Dobbs gave us a rule book of life.

1136
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,120
But it's not a hard and fast thing that dictates every whether you should put your hand in your pocket every five minutes.

1137
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:00,920
What?

1138
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,860
This plan was made for you.

1139
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,160
What?

1140
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,440
Something somebody there's some another another feed that's feeding in here.

1141
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,560
So it says outside the game.

1142
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,580
Some guy is playing symbols.

1143
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,400
It's a Hare Krishna guy over there.

1144
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,940
And I think what are we selling?

1145
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,500
We didn't.

1146
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,880
We weren't other cults.

1147
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,320
Well, actually, we weren't allowing any other cults in here.

1148
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,800
This is an exclusive cult.

1149
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,060
We are.

1150
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,540
We're completely we only want members, our members in here, the people that paid to be here.

1151
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,660
We can't have these freeloaders.

1152
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,940
You know, freeloading off our cult.

1153
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,020
You know, this is a cult of the people, a cult for the people and by the people.

1154
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,660
Well, the rich.

1155
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:47,860
We've got a well, the richest of the poor people and the poorest of the rich people are all together here in one cult.

1156
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,880
One beginning to sort of why we let Dr. Drummond control the business end of things.

1157
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,580
Yeah, it's an amalgam, amalgam, a deposit.

1158
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,200
It's a complete deposit.

1159
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,780
He learned that at Bob.

1160
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,980
Bob talked drum and everything he knows.

1161
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,440
Piled up in big piles.

1162
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:10,740
And, you know, the graphics, the graphics behind that will go into the the the median expenditures.

1163
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:21,420
And on on the side there, we can see how if we track this particular extrapolate that out to its ultimate nth degree.

1164
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:29,420
You know, then you can see that we're going to make about 15 cents off of every third unit on the 12th of each month.

1165
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,580
And the deposit.

1166
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,020
Oh.

1167
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,860
And then they're going to be rolling in.

1168
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
Now we have the bolt cutters.

1169
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,480
The bolt cutters are here.

1170
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,060
Completely, completely opposite of all this.

1171
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:39,500
Cut, cut, cut.

1172
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,040
Hey, don't.

1173
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,880
Hey, put those bolt cutters down.

1174
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,800
No, I need the bolt cutters.

1175
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,100
Put those bolt cutters down.

1176
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,600
I need the bolt cutters.

1177
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,720
No, you can't have them.

1178
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,980
Those are my bolt cutters.

1179
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,280
I need the bolt cutters now.

1180
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,740
Hey, guard, would you take this gentleman out of here, please?

1181
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,940
And take his harmonica with him, please?

1182
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,940
Yeah, that's horrible.

1183
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,640
Don't don't let the guard play the harmonica now.

1184
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,420
What about all these other guys?

1185
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,420


1186
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,420


1187
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,420


1188
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,420


1189
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,420


1190
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,560
All these allegations about corruption.

1191
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,580
Corruption.

1192
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,800
Well, you know, people have talked about how bad we are for years, but few people talk

1193
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,820
about how good we are.

1194
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,540
I mean, that's the one thing that we take a lot of heat for being like the world's worst

1195
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,560
cult, the world's most hated cult.

1196
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,740
Stingiest cult.

1197
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,220
Corruption was built.

1198
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,720
The world's most corrupt cult.

1199
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,860
But people don't talk about how really good we are, you know, how great we are and the

1200
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,720
greatness of the.

1201
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,720
Well, and the purity of the corruption.

1202
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,340
You see.

1203
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,200
You start out from a base of absolute and total corruption.

1204
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,400
You can't be bought out.

1205
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,000
Well, that's true.

1206
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:44,140
I mean, we're starting with the lowest common denominator and we can only go up from here,

1207
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:44,520
folks.

1208
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,320
So, I mean, it's going to it's like smooth sailing for the next six or eight years.

1209
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,340
Then at the eight year point, we're going to meet a slight blip in this as this chart

1210
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,040
will illustrate.

1211
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,520
That will be our first.

1212
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,260
See that blip there?

1213
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:58,960
But it goes.

1214
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,140
We're going to hammer it down with this big hammer here.

1215
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,260
And then smooth things out.

1216
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:08,760
We're going to extrapolate the linear regression over this way.

1217
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,200
See over there?

1218
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,740
Oh, it's smoothing.

1219
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,620
Yeah, it's smoothing.

1220
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,400
That's a great.

1221
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,080
We're using a smoothing formula there.

1222
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,780
That computer simulation is gorgeous.

1223
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,960
You can see all the sharp edges are now dull.

1224
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,200
How much of the church's budget did we spend on that computerized pie graph, that animated

1225
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,600
pie graph, Dr. Drummond?

1226
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,120
Well, I'm sure it'll all come out.

1227
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,120


1228
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,460
And the bill in the billing at the end when we get the bill from this wonderful resort

1229
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,900
here that we're staying at.

1230
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,500
Yeah, well, I was a little concerned.

1231
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:39,980
What is this?

1232
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,740
Maybe the business meeting is costing more than the company's profits this particular

1233
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,360
year.

1234
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,560
We're just going to, you know, we're going to take it out of the we'll take it out.

1235
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,760
Well, Bob will provide.

1236
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:00,960
That's the thing we have to remember here, you know, and that we will survive and we

1237
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,100
don't want to lose it.

1238
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,500
We don't have to worry about costs overrunning our wonderful, wonderful revenue streams

1239
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,560
because, you know, we've got the flow now.

1240
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,980
We've got the the the actual the momentum.

1241
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,520
Dr. Drummond, those are pretty fuzzy figures that you're projecting up on the screen there.

1242
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,820
Those aren't even numbers.

1243
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,500
Those are some kind of alien alphabet.

1244
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,720
What are we supposed to?

1245
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,900
Well, you can read it.

1246
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,080
If you can't read it, then you didn't study your materials before the the the the the

1247
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,080


1248
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,200
meeting here.

1249
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,120
I mean, we had those materials that you were supposed to read and memorize.

1250
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,220
Those tapes you were supposed to listen to and be able to regurgitate.

1251
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,860
Dr. Drummond's taken all the money and he's squandered it.

1252
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,480
All right.

1253
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,480
Well, we bought tapes.

1254
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,540
We had to buy tapes.

1255
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,820
We needed new tape decks.

1256
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,240
We needed our eight track machine had broken down.

1257
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,800
We had our beta machines broken down.

1258
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,980
Mr. Drummond, we're talking about three or four billion dollars here.

1259
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,820
Yeah, what are these these vaults full of receipts from this?

1260
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,640
Billion here, a billion there.

1261
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,060
I mean, to us, it's all just money.

1262
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,360
The Korean massage parlor.

1263
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,640
And that's the important thing to remember.

1264
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,060
That if you're going to buy a tape, you're going to have to buy a tape.

1265
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,540
It's all about money.

1266
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,700
And when we keep the money flowing.

1267
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,660
Pink pussycat club.

1268
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,960
What are these?

1269
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,240
What are these vaults full of receipts?

1270
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,360
These are investments we had to make.

1271
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,840
We go in to test the test, the culture, test the air, test the we're doing personality

1272
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,440
bypass transplant treatments in those places.

1273
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,560
And we even in Enron, we had to go to Enron and do some investigatory work long before

1274
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,340
the the the the government auditors got in there.

1275
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,560
Take that out.

1276
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,120
I don't know.

1277
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,880
He's he's trying to do it.

1278
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,880
I'm not doing don't look over here.

1279
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:39,940
There's no pay no attention to the to the hand behind the the clothes there.

1280
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,400
It's like a giant invisible hand.

1281
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,600
Some people might call it a cloth.

1282
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,980
Other people call it a cloth.

1283
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,020
But to us it's just a shroud.

1284
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,840
And we put the shroud on and wear it when we need to.

1285
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,880
Invisible hand.

1286
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:58,200
So I take it that there is no embarrassment among the subgenius that they all arrived

1287
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,240
in limousines here at Sulphur Palms tonight.

1288
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,540
No.

1289
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,980
Well, you don't want a stupid preacher.

1290
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,080
What about that limousine you wrote in then?

1291
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,180
As the great brother Gene Scott said.

1292
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:06,880
Uh huh.

1293
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,860
You know, when when when a person turns on their television and sees their preacher,

1294
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:15,840
he wants to see him in a limousine with these lovely choir girls on either arm.

1295
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,720
Beautiful Armani, a $600 Armani suit.

1296
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,400
Right.

1297
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,160
He don't want a stupid preacher.

1298
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,680
All the other preachers do this.

1299
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,000
Uh huh.

1300
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,320
Amen.

1301
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,920
And and we're uh huh.

1302
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,660
Uh huh.

1303
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:26,980
Uh huh.

1304
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,320
Uh huh.

1305
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,860
We're not doing anything different from from what any other religious leaders do.

1306
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,300
Uh huh.

1307
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,700
Uh huh.

1308
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:40,000
And in fact, when when when we had we suffered those arrests for methamphetamine manufacture,

1309
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,920
that's a that's a that's that's the kind of thing that we get a special award for.

1310
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:50,280
In fact, we have a several boxes of awards for the various doctors here tonight.

1311
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,740
And don't forget, without those Hummer limos, you couldn't have got here because there's

1312
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,240
no roads to Sulphur Palms.

1313
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,700
And I've just got an important message I have to take.

1314
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,220
Sulphur Palm reference staying.

1315
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,800
Would you like to finish or take over this business meeting at this point?

1316
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,020
I have to go out.

1317
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1318
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,780
Take up where he left off.

1319
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,800
There's a special corruption tool I have to get.

1320
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,200
I'll I'm sorry for this interruption, but I'll be back shortly.

1321
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:22,520
Yeah, he was dealing with the corruption and the embezzlement at the top in the church.

1322
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,360
Well, you'll notice under hassles and hang ups.

1323
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,220
Uh, try problems really.

1324
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:27,300


1325
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:34,100
The number of Motorists who were unloaded today says they were intensified crowding

1326
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,240
at a site in city

1327
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,240


1328
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,600
The Silicon Valley, we go to road crossings a lot we go.

1329
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,320
Iي' go try.

1330
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:36,800
We got a私ичonya in

1331
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,400

1333

Organic viruses both, in every case, the sexually and DSL transmitted diseases.

1334
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:10,600
The fast food outreach has apparently completely bottomed out.

1335
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,680
The burger god concept.

1336
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,580
I predict entertainment will be entertainment.

1337
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,720
Entertainment, boy.

1338
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,760
That was an understatement.

1339
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,740
That has got to be the understatement of the year, what Dr. Criswell just said.

1340
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,620
That entertainment would be entertainment.

1341
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,880
I never thought I'd live to see the day.

1342
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,660
And you haven't.

1343
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,020
Depression or blue moods are up.

1344
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,220
And the manic phases are down.

1345
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,460
I've got a question.

1346
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,500
Oddly enough.

1347
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,240
I've got a question.

1348
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,980
Pardon me?

1349
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,260
Dr. Stang?

1350
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,060
Yes, Senator.

1351
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,600
Yes.

1352
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,300
The little...

1353
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,460
The little girl in the front row.

1354
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,580
Yeah.

1355
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:07,040
When your local church leaders are subject to accusations,

1356
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,560
what is your stance on how to handle that within your organization?

1357
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,400
When the collection plate comes around,

1358
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,580
double what you were going to put in otherwise, my friend.

1359
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:21,740
Good idea.

1360
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,980
There you go.

1361
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,060
That collection plate is the bottom.

1362
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,000
That is what this business...

1363
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:41,080
You know, when it comes down to it, we can talk about our product placement and producing these movies that battle torn earth and so forth.

1364
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:53,880
But when it comes down to it, it's the collection plate passed from hand to hand or from paw to paw, as it may, from hoof to hoof among the believers.

1365
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,920
And that will stick.

1366
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:55,940
That should show we've Всем tonight.

1367
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:55,940


1368
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,620
Let's fix up those problems that you have.

1369
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,680
Belief is the coin of the realm, in this realm.

1370
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,080
What about the emotions of...?

1371
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,340
Get along, little bobbies.

1372
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:13,680
What about the personalities and the emotions affected and involved in such incidences?

1373
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:21,800
Well, those are being stored in the finest blue canisters in the Dobbstown basement, as always.

1374
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,840
So, you would disagree with the...

1375
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,600
Catholic stance that people are expendable? People, yeah, people, sure, but this,

1376
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,440
people, yeah, sure, people, sure, but. Expendable? Yeah. People, yeah, people, sure, yeah, people,

1377
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:50,180
yeah. Expendable people? People, yeah. Expendable emotions? Well, like we say, the coin of the realm

1378
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:58,580
is belief. Expend your belief all over the floor, all over the office trash can. Just spend it,

1379
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:07,220
baby. Just let loose. Let her, let her rip. Bob don't care. Bob loves you anyway. Bob loves you.

1380
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:17,560
You are on the right track. Getting warmer. Hello, Pastor Dick? Is he there today, tonight?

1381
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,960
No, no, Pastor Dick is not here.

1382
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,520
This is the subgenius executive retreat.

1383
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:29,020
Oh, no, heavens no, that's a completely different denomination.

1384
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,180
Oh, okay, my mind's all mixed up. Amen.

1385
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,780
All right, have a good show.

1386
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,380
Well, there's another dissatisfied listener.

1387
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:44,760
Oh, praise Bob. We're mowing him down, but properly.

1388
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,560
This is the subgenius executive retreat direct from Sulphur Palms.

1389
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:50,980
California.

1390
00:50:53,540 --> 00:51:02,920
Ah, yes, yes, yes, and a historic weekend it was at Silver Pond there.

1391
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:09,680
Thanks to Don Joyce, Bud Good, Puzzling Evidence,

1392
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:19,520
uh, Du Gwellman, Dr. Philo Drummond, and KPFA in Berkeley, California.

1393
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:28,580
The studios allowed that, and there are four more hours of that.

1394
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:35,980
The Over the Edge show merged with the show that's more than an hour less than a show.

1395
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:44,300
In fact, altogether it was five hours of show, and now being strewn about the hour of slack.

1396
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,720
And friends, you know, the San Francisco subgenius show,

1397
00:51:50,180 --> 00:52:00,240
or Puzzling Evidence show, uh, has been on every week on KPFA since June 1983.

1398
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:09,120
Uh, when I went out there to work on the book of the subgenius with Palmer, Vreedes, and Puzzling Evidence,

1399
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:16,060
and we were guests on Bob Nelson's show, but the subgeniuses never went away.

1400
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,160
Um, and this subgenius executive...

1401
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:27,140
The executive retreat at Silver Palms was, you might say, the 20-year reunion of the old-timey doctors.

1402
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:32,380
Uh, Dr. Philo Drummond, uh, whose band, uh, Swingin' Love Corpses, is heard in the background here,

1403
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:39,140
Lies, uh, Gary Gabroke, Fran, Puzzling Evidence, uh, and, um, and also Michael Pepe,

1404
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,400
and Ed Holmes, all there.

1405
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:46,300
Sorry that Dr. Howling Glass Madness couldn't be there, and Jay Kinney.

1406
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,500
But anyway, here's a tape of...

1407
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:56,240
Gary Gang of Wacky Zenos down at the gazebo from before the show in 1983,

1408
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,960
when it was just a band that dare not speak its name,

1409
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,860
working on the book of the subgenius.

1410
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,600
The book? You wanna know about the book?

1411
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,100
The book was a flop!

1412
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,220
The book?

1413
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:19,960
No!

1414
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,160
Nobody bought that book!

1415
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,780
It just sat there!

1416
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,340
And when they did buy it, they tried to get their money back!

1417
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,420
A terminal disaster!

1418
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,920
Nobody made a single penny!

1419
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,580
What'd he say?

1420
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,000
The book!

1421
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:48,580
Ah!

1422
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,120
Ah!

1423
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:50,960
The book!

1424
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,900
The book was a flop!

1425
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,620
What's he talking about?

1426
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,760
The book?

1427
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,860
What about the song?

1428
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,840
The book was a flop!

1429
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,820
The book was a flop!

1430
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,880
It made the church stop!

1431
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,620
The book.

1432
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,000
Oh, the loud song, yeah!

1433
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,200
Yeah.

1434
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,840
1,000 copies and close to the trash.

1435
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,980
30,000 copies and no one got cash.

1436
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,380
Warehouse.

1437
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,240
A warehouse full of books.

1438
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,200
Yeah, but there's a warehouse full of books.

1439
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,760
A warehouse full of unwanted books.

1440
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,760
The book.

1441
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,700
The book was a flop.

1442
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,600
Made the song stop.

1443
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,640
It made the song stop!

1444
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,700
Well, maybe not.

1445
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,540
It was just a flop.

1446
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:24,540


1447
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:24,540


1448
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:24,540


1449
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:24,540


1450
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:24,540


1451
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,640
Yes, even the book couldn't make the song stop.

1452
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,780
Yeah, well...

1453
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,760
It sure made the church stop.

1454
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,040
It made the distributor stop.

1455
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,680
It made the church stop.

1456
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,200
It made the post office and the Secret Service stop, but...

1457
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,640
It couldn't make the song stop.

1458
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,820
The song slowed it down, messed it up a little.

1459
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,900
The band that dare not speak its name...

1460
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,840
From...

1461
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,060
The old, ancient, 1983 subgenius tape.

1462
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,920
Bad Doctors.

1463
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,780
Oh, bad, bad, bad.

1464
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,020
And there's so much more bad...

1465
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,560
To be had at...

1466
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,340
www.subgenius.com

1467
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,600
That website will tell you about...

1468
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,100
That website will tell you about...

1469
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,080
The Living Church.

1470
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,100
The Living Church.

1471
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,280
If it's money you want...

1472
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,500
We'll send that to Post Office Box...

1473
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:39,880
8-9-1-1.

1474
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,860
50-28-07.

1475
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,440
Glenrose, TX.

1476
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:45,660
76043.

1477
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,920
76043.

1478
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:47,920


1479
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,660
I just got back from a trip to...

1480
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,500
to visit the beautiful...

1481
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,620
new Austin facilities,

1482
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,700
which are run by Jesus...

1483
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,800
and his wife,

1484
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,860
his beautiful wife,

1485
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,380
Mary Magdalene.

1486
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,680
It was so great to see...

1487
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,080
that busy operation down there.

1488
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,120
And, friends, if you have tapes...

1489
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:07,640
you want...

1490
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,420
us to hear,

1491
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,540
in subgenius land or CDs or whatever,

1492
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,880
send them to me,

1493
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,260
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

1494
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:25,100
at Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1495
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,180
And I do have a cold, if you were wondering.

1496
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,040
It's a subgenius virus.

1497
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,680
I got it from my computer.

1498
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,760
Hey, friends, happy new last year.

1499
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,020
That's when I'm doing this show.

1500
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,020
So, and praise Bob.

1501
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,840
Oh, and now more of this.

1502
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:55,340
This broadcast is silly, tape-delayed stuff.

1503
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,920
I've been in the women's shoe business since 1875.

1504
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,460
In all those years of servicing customers,

1505
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,620
I found your feet.

1506
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,020
Unfortunately, we want to service you.

1507
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,600
That's very good.

1508
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,220
It's now out of control.

1509
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,300
We have a school bus.

1510
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,580
The trap is completely out of control.

1511
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,120
Out of control.

1512
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,040
And we have nothing.

1513
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,220
They're beginning to run into one another and over one another.

1514
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,960
How much Librax are you taking?

1515
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,300
67.

1516
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,660
I was wondering because it seems to me like some animals are after me and...

1517
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,660
Can you look at that?

1518
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:31,820
Oh.

1519
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,000
I think you have to tell your doctors I'm a psychiatrist.

1520
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,740
It's likely that's why you're having the nightmares.

1521
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,880
And that's when the German Shepherd tripped over the curb.

1522
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,600
Every year, thousands of letter carriers are attacked by dogs.

1523
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,200
It's like that.

1524
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,520
Public service dogs.

1525
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,220
I want a mechanical man.

1526
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:49,640
No, the...

1527
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,960
Oh, uh, mechanical man?

1528
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:51,240
That's it.

1529
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:51,480
Yes.

1530
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,460
Thank you.

1531
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,860
I'm sorry, but you can't hear anymore.

1532
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,540
I must see what this is.

1533
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,280
What's that?

1534
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,000
That doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever.
