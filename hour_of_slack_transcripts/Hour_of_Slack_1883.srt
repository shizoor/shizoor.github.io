00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,320
On the first side of this record, a self-analysis will help you control your extreme deviations with basic principles and suggested exercises while forcibly holding the buttocks muscles together to refrain from increasing the air pressure within the abdominal cavity.

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:34,040
It is important to breathe normally or to open the mouth to make this movement more difficult and to see how tight the buttocks can be, holding this twisted position to stretch the low back in the yoga anti-gravity position.

3
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,180
First, let gravity do the work by relaxing and lift the head slightly just enough to see the toes.

4
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,300
Keeping the buttocks muscles together, now very slowly lower the straight legs to the floor.

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,800
Then, over the head, upward to the ceiling, or as far upward as you can reach, let the head relax to the floor.

6
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:04,560
Efficiency in moving in anti-gravity depends upon the structure, proportion, flexibility, and strength of your buttocks.

7
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,020
Hi, I'm Mike Wallace with a sensational golden bob.

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,540
Oh, goody, goody.

9
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,160
This is Bob, the effective reliable way to natural male enhancement.

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,280
Bob is...

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,960
living large.

12
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,500
Bob is looking cool.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,600
Some people don't understand the true nature of our activities and resent us.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,600
Say hello to Bob.

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,400
Hello, my name is Mojaba and I was a Muslim.

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,280
I don't think making fun of religion is funny or clever.

17
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,780
You're going to love being a disciple of Bob.

18
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,180
We organize lots of social activities.

19
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,180
I think you know what I'm trying to say.

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,300
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,500
Wasn't that Stephanie from Accounts?

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
Not anymore.

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
Now she's a bride of the Dark Lord of Chaos.

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,800
You'll find plenty of opportunities for advancement with Bob.

25
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,720
I was supposed to be ritually sacrificed to Yogg-Sloggoth on the ziggurat of demonic tumult.

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,200
Hey, can you stand in for me?

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,900
There's more of us out there than you think.

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,680
Us?

29
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:09,780
Us.

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,980
The fraternity.

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,620
The brotherhood.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,860
The cadre.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,360
The alliance.

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,100
The fellowship.

35
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,120
The order.

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,620
The cabal.

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,700
The secret society.

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,580
For God's sakes.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,300
I'd love to be a member, sir.

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,380
Why, I had an uncle who was a Shriner and that...

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,780
Good for him.

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,700
Let the portal open.

43
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,580
Let the initiate gaze upon the unspeakable glory of our Lord.

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,200
Keith.

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,620
John.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,100
Paul.

47
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,860
Mark.

48
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,700
Ian.

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,260
Peter.

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,860
Andy.

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,180
Dan.

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,620
Jack.

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,060
Steve.

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,440
Alex.

55
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:42,780
Terry.

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,140
Howard.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,500
Jimmy.

58
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:43,960
Enoch.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,280
Barry.

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,460
Yes

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,600
Well...

62
00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:03,280
It was a long time ago that I was alone at some prettyココ Eph acids.

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,080
And it seems to me it's time to turn my limelight into a big Marie-Búsica today.

64
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,220
Gary.

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,380
Don't kill me.

66
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,360
Bob Dobbs in these troubled times.

67
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,640
And when we need more weird noises for this troubled show,

68
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,760
this time, not just the ubiquitous Fernanda Nande-Lemur,

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,680
but also many other weirdos from alt.binary slack.

70
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,040
James Watson, champion Jack Codini,

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,940
Artemia Salina,

72
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,340
Reverend Jay Cobblestone,

73
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,580
New Monet,

74
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,720
Mr. Sister, and even, even Jarto, Jarto the New.

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,680
Plus, of course, ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland.

76
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,980
And now, Lemur.

77
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,140
Excellent.

78
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,900
Oh, but wait.

79
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,920
It's really this year.

80
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,420
Not 2003.

81
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,840
And this isn't show number 883, but 1,883.

82
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
How did this happen?

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,980
Well, I've been busy with other things.

84
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
Accent on other.

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,680
But I have news about X-Day.

86
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,440
You know, this year, because our new regular best venue is moving temporarily,

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,700
it's a do-it-yourself X-Day.

88
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,860
Partly party in place.

89
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,140
Or throw a big party at your place.

90
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,000
Partly virtual.

91
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,580
I'm doing a secret one here, probably.

92
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,340
But here's one you can attend.

93
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,600
Not in July, but the weekend of June 10th through 13th in Hannibal, New York.

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,300
An event being called The Real X-Day.

95
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,720
Sponsored by The Senator.

96
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,920
Featuring Dr. Hal and Rubik's Cube.

97
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,840
And the X-Day.

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,140
And a whole slew of other bands.

99
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,920
I mean like a dozen bands.

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,240
You can find all the details at subgenius.com on the events page.

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,040
Which basically gives you this link I'm about to give you.

102
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,860
Write down this link.

103
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,740
xday.ticketleap.com

104
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,720
slash 2022.

105
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,420
I'm going to do that again.

106
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,800
That URL is...

107
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,700
xday.ticketleap.com

108
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,780
slash 2022.

109
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,120
Or like I say, the events page at subgenius.com has that same link under X-Day.

110
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,460
You can't miss it!

111
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,680
I wouldn't.

112
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,940
But I have to.

113
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,140
Because they need me here.

114
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,060
Men.

115
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,140
Men and things.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,300
Anyway, it's a four-day gut blowout extravaganza to loosen you up for the rupture.

117
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,160
And possibly for Bob.

118
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,920
Because what if he decides to take a fancy to you?

119
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,380
Bob.

120
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,240
Bob.

121
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,440
Bob.

122
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,440
Bob.

123
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,300
Bob.

124
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,640
Bob.

125
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,160
Bond with that chicken.

126
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,720
I guess that happens.

127
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,620
That's right.

128
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,180
That's right.

129
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,000
I almost forgot a letter from Bob.

130
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,600
Bob seems to freely express his hostilities.

131
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,940
Bob refused to bathe.

132
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,660
He resists housework and cooking.

133
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,320
Everyone likes that little butthole.

134
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,520
Diagnosis?

135
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,420
Bob's a latent Bob.

136
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,140
A severe case.

137
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,060
What?

138
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,440
We will accept, Bob.

139
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,560
I know.

140
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,600
Bob

141
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,640
Attention all humans...

142
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,440
Attention all humans...

143
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,720
Attention all humans...

144
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,780
Attention all humans...

145
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,040
Ben Brooke Biden has created a nightmare.

146
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,800
Edna Hay sortir?

147
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,040
It was her name but Bob told her no end.

148
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,040


149
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,040


150
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,140
The network pulled the plug on our show.

151
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,060
Yeah!

152
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,320
They forgot all about us.

153
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,460
Hell, they left us out there to die.

154
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,800
I want you to tell me about the Bob.

155
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,560
The Bob will lead us all through heaven's chimney in a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

156
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,920
Really?

157
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,460
So Bob is a special person.

158
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,680
Now, open your mind.

159
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,060
Bob!

160
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,020
The Bob is not a person. The Bob is pure light and energy.

161
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,960
Do I have a baseball?

162
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,300
Baseball!

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,520
Baseball!

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,960
The Bob is not a person. The Bob is pure light and energy.

165
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,180
Will you give me a baseball?

166
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,740
Baseball!

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,780
You are a fucker, you...

168
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,580
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

169
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,480
I repeat, this is not a drill. This is the apocalypse.

170
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,920
In a giant cigar...

171
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,580
...shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

172
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,060
Do I have a daysball?

173
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,000
With theません木

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,500
Things.

175
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,320
With the sein木

176
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
With your brother.

177
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,660
Do I have a daysball?

178
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

179
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,700
Do I have a daysball?

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,040
Brace Bob indeed.

181
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,380
Brace Bob!

182
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,200
With the Brazilian flag.

183
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,280
Brace Bob!

184
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,060
With the Brazilian flag.

185
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,100
With the Brazilian flag.

186
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,060
With the Brazilian flag.

187
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,420
With the Brazilian flag.

188
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,140
With the Brazilian flag.

189
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,640
With the Australian flag.

190
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:08,660
With the Brazilian star flag.

191
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,700
Will you give me the daysball?

192
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,700
Do I hear a praise Bob?

193
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,240
Praise Bob!

194
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,220
Praise Bob indeed!

195
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,440
Let's try this again.

196
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,740
I want you to tell me about the Bob.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,500
The Bob will lead us all through heaven's chimney in a giant cigar-shaped UFO grand flying saucer.

198
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,440
Really? So Bob is a special person?

199
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,720
Open your mind.

200
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,040
Praise Bob!

201
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,040
The Bob is not a person. The Bob is pure light and energy.

202
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,100
Do I hear a praise Bob?

203
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,320
Praise Bob!

204
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,500
Praise Bob!

205
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,980
The Bob is not a person. The Bob is pure light and energy.

206
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,840
Praise Bob!

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,060
Praise Bob!

208
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,800
You're a fucker, you!

209
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,580
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO grand flying saucer.

210
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,460
I repeat, this is not a drill. This is the apocalypse.

211
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,500
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO grand flying saucer.

212
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,700
Do I hear a praise Bob?

213
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,220
Praise Bob!

214
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,340
Praise Bob!

215
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,580
Praise Bob!

216
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,300
The Bob has no being.

217
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,780
I repeat, this is not a drill.

218
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,740
Get rid of Bob.

219
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,640
Do I hear a praise Bob?

220
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,500
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO.

221
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,740
Do I hear a praise Bob?

222
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,980
Praise Bob!

223
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,020
Praise Bob indeed!

224
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,740
Ah, collage there by J. Watson.

225
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,260
And maybe, maybe, maybe...

226
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,520
Only the alarm.

227
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,460
It's not a great day.

228
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:41,460


229
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:41,460


230
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,140
One of those days...

231
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,520
I know all about it. Bob called me.

232
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,860
He has found it in that great oversized heart of his to forgive.

233
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,240
Bob with the heart-leading sensitivity that he inferrles like a flag.

234
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,640
Because he's such a...

235
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,940
Rather dull, quite uninspired average type guy

236
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,700
with an appetite...

237
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,280
The kind of a guy that could be satisfied by a horse.

238
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,060
That's it. That's all of it.

239
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,160
Ask a sixth grader and they'll say,

240
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
Ask a seventh grader and they'll say,

241
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,680
In sixth grade by seventh,

242
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,840
be sure your kids know you want them to use drugs.

243
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,660
A message from the Partnership for a Free America.

244
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,560
Comrades, the time has come for context.

245
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,020
What is the context?

246
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,580
The context is the first people's-

247
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,280
Nobody knows the context.

248
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,900
What is the context?

249
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,200
It's all relative. Everything's relative.

250
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,300
Of course it is.

251
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,140
Space, time, space-time.

252
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
A shifting beach of sand.

253
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,020
No, no, that is not true.

254
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,440
You said it was true.

255
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:58,820
It is not all relative.

256
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,400
You said there is one-

257
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,000
Life is a shift.

258
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,240
No, there is a baseline.

259
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,860
You said it.

260
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,920
There is a baseline.

261
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,520
Beneath the beach.

262
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,880
It is Bob.

263
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,040
Bob is beneath the shifting beach of sand.

264
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,080
Bob is the still center in the churning ocean of reality.

265
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,980
I think they buried his head in the sand and he can't get up.

266
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,580
Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs is the unmoving focus point

267
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,080
around which all things revolve in time and space.

268
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,360
So he is the predetermined-

269
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,940
He is the baseline.

270
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,820
You can start your-

271
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,780
There is no revolution.

272
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,220
From that.

273
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,740
You can measure heat

274
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,820
and cold from Bob.

275
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,120
You can measure small and large from Bob.

276
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,320
You can measure rich and poor.

277
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,040
With either a rectal or a patrous thermometer.

278
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Of course you can.

279
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,340
Then what is Bob?

280
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:42,760
Of course you can.

281
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,060
He is a neatly thermometer rated object.

282
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,700
Something that we measure heat and vesicular velocity.

283
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,300
Well, he is a big nothing between two handsome bees, baby.

284
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
Two handsome bees?

285
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,540
He is a big whole nothing.

286
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,760
You have a collect call from Big Fitzwill.

287
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,840
Big, big, big, big Bob.

288
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,640
Hey, open that door up.

289
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,600
Big Fitzwill.

290
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:03,820
Come on.

291
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,360
Let me see if DJ Hayes out there.

292
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,500
You have a collect call from Harry Saldana.

293
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:16,900
I don't understand what's going on here.

294
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,380
Shit. Shit.

295
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,420
We now return control of your television set to you.

296
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,960
That sounds like a lie to me.

297
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,540
Ha ha ha.

298
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,800
Ha ha ha.

299
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Ha ha ha.

300
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,280
Ha ha ha.

301
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,440
Ha ha ha.

302
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,540
Ha ha ha.

303
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,400
Ha ha ha.

304
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,360
Ha ha ha.

305
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,340
Ha ha ha.

306
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,340
Ha ha ha.

307
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,580
Ha ha ha.

308
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,380
Ha ha ha.

309
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,520
By Artemia Salina, the Laemorian anthem.

310
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,240
I need a lesson to sing.

311
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,700
And now, are you ready to go in?

312
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,100
No.

313
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,720
Yes.

314
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,500
Oh.

315
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,480
And Jane, in the darkness, cannot make out what she's seeing.

316
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,020
But then into focus comes,

317
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,040
Her face.

318
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,620
floating just in front of her.

319
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,800
There is a beard, a nose, and eyes.

320
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,460
And there seems at first to be nothing above the eyes.

321
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,620
But now, as she gets used to the light,

322
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,280
She sees a sort of...

323
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,820
Turban.

324
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,600
But it is a turban of brains.

325
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,020
The top part of the skull has been removed.

326
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,040
The brains bulge out.

327
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,500
She sees it twitch.

328
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,340
It's in its...

329
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,740
What is that in its pain?

330
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,400
The mouth is wide open and quite dry.

331
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,760
And she sees now it is not floating,

332
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,940
but fixed up on a bracket.

333
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,080
Things hang from it.

334
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,880
No drills.

335
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,460
She thinks.

336
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,360
No tubes.

337
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,780
Little rubber tubes.

338
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,380
Yes.

339
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,520
They lead into the wall.

340
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,860
And then from its mouth...

341
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,260
From its mouth, a puff of air.

342
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,680
It licks its lips, working its mouth.

343
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,760
And now a survivor dribbles into its beard.

344
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,260
Its mouth opens wide.

345
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,700
Mork!

346
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,420
Shut up!

347
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:06,840
Mork!

348
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,460
Bob.

349
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:28,760
Bob.

350
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,060
Bob.

351
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,660
Bob.

352
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,560
Bob.

353
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,020
Your friend wants you to smoke that wacky weed.

354
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,660
You don't know what to say.

355
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,380
Try this.

356
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,160
Thanks, man.

357
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,320
I'm into that stuff.

358
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,760
Sponsored by the Partnership for a Free America.

359
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,740
Mom?

360
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,560
Mom?

361
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,600
Well, I heard that even the war hawks are all pissed at George.

362
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,100
My big brother should fuck that του.

363
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,540
Well, the first dude...

364
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,240
You better put yourIP online.

365
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,260
Don't do aút here and say I'm an idiot.

366
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,260


367
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,200
He saw my past friend symmetry yesterday,

368
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,440
and he though.

369
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,360
Hey, samples!

370
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,300
Salted worms, Inniport

371
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,600
And now stop looking to qué practise.

372
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:18,900
Noms at my job.

373
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:18,900


374
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,240
während Han River commune

375
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,860
IAyo.

376
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,440
orn.com

377
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,840
David Turkey smarkyard

378
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,960
Who has had to learn German.

379
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,040
I love your career.

380
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,180
Robby.

381
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,720
And I try to talk a white guy with Chinese.

382
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
aren't you going to understand?

383
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:33,680
Yeah.

384
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,800
where they get past the street.

385
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,560
I've never heard one of those.

386
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,960
Well, they have one in Pittsburgh.

387
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm getting tired of that.

388
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,500
This music makes me want to go to war.

389
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,580
I say let's nuke them all.

390
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,420
Everybody.

391
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,160
Everybody.

392
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,540
Music make me want to take P.O.T.

393
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,000
Tactical nuke.

394
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
In large, large amounts.

395
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,280
Erase all those lines on the map

396
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,840
and just nuke everything.

397
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,620
Everything with land on it.

398
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,200
Kill Bob.

399
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,120
Kill Bob.

400
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,860
Kill Bob.

401
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,180
Bob.

402
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,540
Bob.

403
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:58,940
Bob.

404
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,320
Bob.

405
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,700
Bob.

406
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,000
Bob.

407
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,320
Bob.

408
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,460
Bob.

409
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:00,680
Bob.

410
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:00,780
Bob.

411
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,800
Kill Bob.

412
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
We're going to kill Bob.

413
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,280
Kill Bob.

414
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,220
He's got a huge, huge direction.

415
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,600
Kill Bob.

416
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,840
Kill Bob.

417
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,180
Kill Bob.

418
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,620
Kill Bob.

419
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:08,740
Kill Bob.

420
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:08,860
Kill Bob.

421
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,180
Kill Bob.

422
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,260
Kill Bob.

423
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


424
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,680
Kill Bob.

425
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,240
So, here's the answer.

426
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,040
I mean, we're going to get into things that we know.

427
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,440
Up and down the gamut of mental health.

428
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:24,980
Mold.

429
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,800
Fungus.

430
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,260
East.

431
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,240
Forgetfulness.

432
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,440
Post nasal drip.

433
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,540
Stuffy sinus.

434
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,300
Hay fever.

435
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,660
Pain behind the eye.

436
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,780
Pain in the forehead.

437
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:32,920
Head.

438
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,880
Irritation.

439
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,800
Respiratory problems.

440
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,540
Sinus congestion.

441
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,540
So, think about it carefully.

442
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,560
Bronchial.

443
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,220
Sinus.

444
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,760
Asthma.

445
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,240
Weezing.

446
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,500
Allergies.

447
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,220
Aggravation.

448
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,940
They'd had surgery.

449
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,620
They'd had antibiotics.

450
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,860
Anxiety.

451
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,320
It was one thing or another and not the real root cause.

452
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,620
And I think a lot of people think about this.

453
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,760
That sort of head and neck stuffiness.

454
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,880
And particularly chronic sinus.

455
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,820
And mood alterations altogether.

456
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,820
And especially bronchitis and even asthma.

457
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,720
It's a huge problem.

458
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,660
A collage by a cobblestone.

459
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,560
American Ticks.

460
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,520
Sunday night.

461
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,180
A conversation with Phil Clinton.

462
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,560
Only on C-SPAN's American Ticks.

463
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,700
We need to stand by the boys.

464
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,320
That's right.

465
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,840
Not too close.

466
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,420
Stand by the boys.

467
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,740
Going off to fight the war.

468
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,480
Some of them have wounds that go way back.

469
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,400
Bam!

470
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,420
I want to go play in the USO show.

471
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,600
Where can I sign up?

472
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,180
I don't know.

473
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,120
I want to go play.

474
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,300
I got some nice coats.

475
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,940
You saw them nice outfits I got.

476
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,940
Oh yeah, yeah.

477
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,060
I could go there with a couple of Playboy bunnies.

478
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,480
USO.

479
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,480
I could be the MC for the Playboy bunny helicopter.

480
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,060
USO would stand for Unisexual or Unicorn Squacking Orphish.

481
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,700
I want to go over there.

482
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,680
I want to go help.

483
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,700
Battle of the Bands.

484
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,380
My mommy was played in the USO band.

485
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,400
She played the band.

486
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,060
I was a bass fiddle.

487
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,480
That's just true swear.

488
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,240
A true lie.

489
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,860
They played this kind of crap.

490
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,780
You know, it's not just boys going over there.

491
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,460
There's some hot looking ladies.

492
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,920
Yeah, there's all these stories about all the married couples in the Gulf now.

493
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,820
Well, they've got toddlers over there too.

494
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,920
Some of them are 300 pounds, 6 foot tall.

495
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:30,640
Chance, there was a lovely young teenage girl at last exta named Reverend Lee Burles.

496
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,380
And she is now a Burles fan.

497
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


498
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


499
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


500
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


501
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


502
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


503
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


504
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


505
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


506
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,380


507
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,020
Burley Marine.

508
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,180
Oh, wow.

509
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,560
She's now General Lee Scrood.

510
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:36,800
Cool.

511
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,060
Yeah.

512
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,440
The hot little.

513
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,760
Hi, General Jack C. Ripple.

514
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,440
How do you make a waif into Burley?

515
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,320
That's what I want.

516
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,800
Well, have you ever heard of purity of essence?

517
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,120
You know, what they're putting in our bodily fluids right now, it's meth-alone.

518
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,880
It's a messal squack-alone.

519
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,400
What is it, pyrotechnics?

520
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,800
What do they put in your teeth?

521
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,840
Women want her essence, but she denies them.

522
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,380
This Friday, at 2.00 p.m.

523
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,380


524
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,380


525
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,380


526
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,380


527
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,380


528
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,380


529
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,380


530
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,380


531
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,520
Friday and Saturday.

532
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,780
People are rarely gregarious when constipated.

533
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,040
In that case, I guess I'll just have to blow up the planet Earth.

534
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,300
We've launched a massive Hope for Nothing campaign here in America.

535
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,060
Grocery stores overflowing with every kind of boy and girl right here at home.

536
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,600
While you can walk down aisle after aisle,

537
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,160
selecting your baby for tonight's dinner or maybe tomorrow's breakfast,

538
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,600
you can enjoy the babies of this great nation.

539
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,060
But for millions of Americans, working through compassionate friends has made matters worse.

540
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,820
And this exceptionally harsh campaign is growing at an alarming rate.

541
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,880
Your gift of only two massive babies will support our missions all across America.

542
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,300
So please help your fellow Americans slip closer to the edge

543
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,840
during this exceptionally compassionate, harsh, love of brutal Jesus Christ

544
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,140
right here in America.

545
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,620
When you do, please don't call Jesus Christ.

546
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,440
Please don't let another child open the floodgates of God's blessing

547
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,960
without brutal struggling in your land of abundance.

548
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
And let them know that Jesus loves them.

549
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,940
Every day, 200,000 pounds of babies hope for nothing more than a dream.

550
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,560
But we're going to give them even more.

551
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,420
I love

552
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,040
skink-thoo in the morning

553
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,020
and skink-thoo in the evening

554
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,600
I love

555
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,840
skink-thoo

556
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,140
Oh, skink-thoo

557
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,260
I love

558
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,520
skink-thoo

559
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,760
skink-thoo

560
00:24:30,160 --> 00:25:00,160


561
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,460
skink-thoo

562
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,300
skink-thoo

563
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,940
sshhh

564
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,520
skink-thoo

565
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,260
than one big burning man there's going to be a lot of burning men oh if only we could just you

566
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:25,560
know restrict it to one great big man instead of many if only we could restrict it to a little

567
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,940
child's fart we wouldn't have to pay attention to rather than we must grieve the rest of our years

568
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,180
from blowing up the world i mean it's just that simple to me you're trying to drag a little child's

569
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:41,100
fart into this serious it cannot for this innocent little does it need to be a bar staying you who

570
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,760
are so heartless does it need to be dragged i mean would you drag a child's part or would you just

571
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:53,300
let it waft in gently and happily and would you somehow try to get into the room no i would enjoy

572
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,440
it i would have a laugh i would think about it as what it is a spark i'm watching for you

573
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,000
i just left and that's why i'm so happy look at what look at these nipples i'm smiling inside

575
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,120
go visit an elementary school and then tell me all about how wonderful little children's farts are

576
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:22,820
chas once remembered a long time ago in gulf war one that george bush senior sounds a little bit

577
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:29,660
like mr rogers and since they've eulogized mr rogers as a non-sniper now and it's come out that

578
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,840
he never really was a sniper he was a music student and a piano teacher yeah that's true

579
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,160
well it bummed george bush out too because he's been referring to sodom's neighborhood all week

580
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,040
and tonight was the culmination

581
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:47,260
of you know and i could just see his dad saying it we're not gonna do it not gonna die bad

582
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:55,440
neighborhood no he's not a good neighbor you're gonna have to go get him you can't access of evil

583
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,980
we're gonna go get get the bad man now i was reading an article in the uh that liberal magazine

584
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:10,000
the nation and they themselves this particular uh uh writer was was saying that that despite what

585
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:19,440
types think george is not a complete dunderhead wuss completely at the mercy of the people around

586
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:28,060
him but in fact is the head was uh a a pretty bossy wuss and also that they're not faking with all that

587
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:33,360
jesus stuff in there no no i don't know they are they're not doing that just for show they're

588
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,200
they're uh they're really yeah but here's a real religion what's going on

589
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,080
really

590
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:54,000
and sumi eso uh coming up friends uh the sounds of bigfoot that's right bigfoot

591
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,840
from the record the sounds of bigfoot here bigfoot expresses aggression

592
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:10,240
godless is trump and do us speak to us the nerve the god and we say what what

593
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:17,660
isn't that 230 straight what and what what how do you like what's going on

594
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:34,920
what come on say it again what what what this ended us get his what rubble what what

595
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,340
Thanks to Mr. Sister.

596
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:28,000
Did you also hear that there is a place in Belgium called the Diamond Exchange or something like that?

597
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,060
Oh, yeah, we all know the Diamond Exchange, Chaz.

598
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,600
We're not ignorant.

599
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,760
Or the Diamond Suppository or something.

600
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,980
We all wear them.

601
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,920
It has 164 volts.

602
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,140
And 164 vibrations per second.

603
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:47,560
A few days ago, somebody walked out with 123 of those volts worth of diamonds.

604
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,560
And they have no idea how it happened.

605
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,540
Really?

606
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,140
Yes.

607
00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:03,040
Belgium, the biggest diamond suppository in Belgium, Brussels, Belgium, where all the diamonds are, was looted a few nights ago.

608
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,960
It could be a crafty revolutionary act because Belgium is so involved with Europe.

609
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,280
And they cleaned it out.

610
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,900
They cleaned it out.

611
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,580
They only left like 30 of them.

612
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,520
They were thinking ahead.

613
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180
Belgium is close to Brussels.

614
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,280
It was the king of Belgium.

615
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,020
It was probably Leopold.

616
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,540
I have the key to this thing.

617
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,840
I'm Leopold IV, and this is my freaking key.

618
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,820
If you need me, I will be in Jamaica.

619
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,780
In the vault.

620
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,100
Diamonds.

621
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,480
No, I think it was a revolutionary act, 3, scene 2.

622
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:37,500
Because if you were to break the bank of diamonds, diamonds and gold make an important suppository or vertebrae, if you will or won't.

623
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,320
To sum it up, this is notillusionary working age.

624
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,100
I'll call them.

625
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,040
Call it CR�도.

626
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,040


627
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,160


628
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,320


629
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,320


630
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,320


631
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,640
That's just audible enough that they're saying да.

632
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,280
And he hasn't changed at all...

633
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,280


634
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,620
Let's get over to?

635
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,060
Remember my point?

636
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,720
I will not say mine is.

637
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,100
It's probably made up for that.

638
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,100


639
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,020
Mother...

640
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,020


641
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,060
My adviser though.

642
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,860
I'll still name it Die layers.

643
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:07,480


644
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,480
I think the time for that came and went around the early 50s.

645
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,620
I thought it was 1917.

646
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,960
There it is.

647
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:27,280
And here's Brittany doing her ESO, USO show over in Riyadh.

648
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,020
Oops.

649
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,420
She's doing it again.

650
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,020
Hi, boys of the year.

651
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,220
A hundred and fifty.

652
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,220
And the soldiers are erupting all over the sand.

653
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,260
That's sort of disgusting, actually.

654
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,240
One man has pulled out his Blackhawk helicopter and they're taking him away.

655
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,920
Here comes the first wave of Apaches.

656
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,580
Her natural trill.

657
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,840
And here come the Navajos.

658
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,580
Not really ready to fight yet.

659
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,660
Looking for a good taco.

660
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:11,160
So if you were in the middle of the desert somewhere, of about 300 feet close range,

661
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,660
would you rather have an Apache on you or would you rather have a Navajo?

662
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,500
They are the worst, worst battle cruiser in our helicopter forces.

663
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,880
The Navajos, they're slow.

664
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,440
They take a long time getting from point A to B.

665
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,800
And then they get there, they don't want to shoot anybody.

666
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,780
They never.

667
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,840
They ask them questions.

668
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,200
Try to get a taco within an hour.

669
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,560
Yeah.

670
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,740
You know, at a restaurant.

671
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,760
Down in the res.

672
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,000
And it comes out and it's already cold.

673
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,240
And they look at you and they want to talk about something.

674
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,400
You know, absolutely.

675
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Hey, did you hear about that guy at Four Corners there?

676
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,660
Yeah, it's like your taco.

677
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,740
Your burrito has been sitting on the counter in the back room for about 40 minutes.

678
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,680
And then they fill them with bees sometimes.

679
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,360
Well, that's if they're doing the lariat dance.

680
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,300
They told me that that was an honor for the, you know, visitors and strangers.

681
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,780
They were inoculating you.

682
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,120
Yeah.

683
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,180
Yeah.

684
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:04,180


685
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,720
If you were going to be in the actual beaver jump dance, they'd have to inoculate you.

686
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,720
They can't just let you go in there with a mouth like that.

687
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,920
It's dang for crying out loud.

688
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,880
They told me that wasn't the real beaver jump dance.

689
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,880
They said that was just something they do for the tourists.

690
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,780
Well, that's true.

691
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,640
But, I mean, look at you.

692
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,620
I mean, you look like you've been smoking the wisdom teat all afternoon.

693
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,560
You think they're going to let you come into their cave and hop around like that?

694
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,860
Oh, the wisdom teat.

695
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,020
Oh, to lick the wisdom eye.

696
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,560
Oh, to smoke the frosty goat of hell.

697
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,580
Oh, to smoke the frosty goat of hell.

698
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
I'll be with you there.

699
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:34,680
I'll be with you there.

700
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,300
I'll be with you there.

701
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:35,980
I'll be with you there.

702
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,120
I'll be with you there.

703
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,120


704
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,160
I'll be with you there.

705
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,460
Yeah, forget the containing stuff.

706
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:38,640
Yeah, I can dig that, man.

707
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,260
I don't need that.

708
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,020
I can dig the goat of hell.

709
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,260
The frosty goat of hell.

710
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,660
Yeah.

711
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:51,380
Well, you know, you've got to have a little temperature change going down there to lubricate and elasticate.

712
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,540
That's why they love that goat so much down there in hell.

713
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,020
Yeah, it is.

714
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,820
It's a one bit of relief, but oh, such relief.

715
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,340
The love, the frosty love goat of hell.

716
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,560
Oh, look at the beautiful face.

717
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,300
Look at the face on it now.

718
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,800
And look at this lizard-headed man.

719
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,300
And look at the face on it.

720
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,960
It's like a squirrel face, man.

721
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,120
And look at the head on it.

722
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,000
It's a dolphin-headed man.

723
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,640
Mind your manners on level six of hell.

724
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,560
But I don't want to.

725
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,860
Level seven, going down.

726
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,000
I still don't want to.

727
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,920
Popping jays.

728
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,040
Fake churches.

729
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,860
Unrealistic wars.

730
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,220
Sad economic ventures.

731
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,460
Wax.

732
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,220
Wax of intelligence.

733
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,780
And firefights with flies.

734
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,100
A tomahawk cruise missile, man.

735
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,660
I want a tomahawk cruise missile.

736
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,320
Level eight.

737
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,160
Stangly robots from underwear.

738
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,620
Thermal soup.

739
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,120
Biotic substances from the heart of the heart.

740
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,460
Plasticine.

741
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,660
Plasticine.

742
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,600
And re-aware.

743
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,220
Re-awareness kits.

744
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
Now, here's what I hear the Lord saying.

745
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,020
I'm going to send nips.

746
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,700
Invertebra.

747
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,340
And a fibromyalgia.

748
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,380
In Jesus' name.

749
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,280
In Jesus' name.

750
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,320
Now, here's what I want you to do.

751
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,460
I want you to begin to bend and twist and turn.

752
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,680
I want you to examine yourself.

753
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,760
Examine yourself and twist and turn.

754
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,540
Stretch your hands out toward me.

755
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,800
And you at home, just lay your hands up against my disc.

756
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,920
Herniated disc.

757
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,840
A herniated disc.

758
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,660
Pain.

759
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,860
In Jesus' name.

760
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,880
Discs.

761
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,580
Invertebra.

762
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,880
In Jesus' name.

763
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,000
Pain and discs and vertebra.

764
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,480
Tingling.

765
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,060
Numbness.

766
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,800
Nervousness.

767
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,420
Nervousness.

768
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:31,980
Jesus.

769
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,140
Jesus.

770
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,200
Bend down.

771
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,260
And touch your discs and vertebra.

772
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,380
I'm going to send vertebra.

773
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,680
In Jesus' name.

774
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,040
I love you.

775
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,260
Oh, God.

776
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,100
Oh, God.

777
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:23,880
Oh, God.

778
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,080
Oh, God.

779
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,080


780
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,260
the

781
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:32,260


782
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,520
Anyone

783
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:35,520


784
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,360
anyone

785
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,160
その

786
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,640
mother

787
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,960
every

788
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,600
every

789
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:01,940
he

790
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,620
Pennsylvania up next. Go ahead.

791
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,140
Well, the...

792
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,360
Well, thanks a heap. Bye.

793
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,020
More lemur.

794
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,480
And here, Bigfoot shows attention.

795
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,080
Okay.

796
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,080


797
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,480
Oh, yes, friends.

798
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,140
Oh, it's...

799
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,940
The ESO shows that we're playing were done before the shooting started.

800
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,660
But even then, Chaz wanted to move to Jamaica.

801
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,620
I can make a living more in the Caribbean than I could up here.

802
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,600
Well, everybody can.

803
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,000
Well, the problem is nobody can make a living in the Caribbean.

804
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:27,900
Playing.

805
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,500
There's plenty of orange juice and spleef, man,

806
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,180
but there's not too many, you know, gas and electricity bills.

807
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,120
Eat the oranges right off of the tree, man.

808
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,380
Yeah.

809
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,920
Eat the jerk chicken right off the chicken, man.

810
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,500
Hey, have you ever eaten jerk chicken right off the chicken?

811
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,520
Just jerk it right off, man.

812
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,520
Get your jacket of banana off.

813
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,660
Get your orange off of the tree.

814
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,480
The banana's foster, man, you know, with the red stripes.

815
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,060
Tear your head off of your chicken.

816
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,300
Oh, man.

817
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,060
Oh, man.

818
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,340
Look at that.

819
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:57,860
Frob.

820
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,380
Oh, man.

821
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,440
Oh, man.

822
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,860
How long have you waited by this piece of inactivating tissue?

823
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,080
Waiting for your last ride to the cosmos?

824
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,520
I was stuck somewhere.

825
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:12,900
I'm sorry.

826
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,560
I had to get that out.

827
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,620
It stunk.

828
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,020
It smelled bad.

829
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,460
I mean, but I was stuck in it.

830
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,180
You guys are stuttering.

831
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,720
I put in some island music, and I think it threw you off.

832
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,560
Yeah, yeah.

833
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
It's a different rhythm.

834
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,340
No, I was just relaxing up.

835
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,940
I think for the first time in the history of ESO radio,

836
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,820
there was almost quiet for a second.

837
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,720
It was almost quiet.

838
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,100
No, almost quiet.

839
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,240
I was just bobbing up and down on those waves.

840
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,600
It's almost soothing.

841
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:34,960
Yeah.

842
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,300
We were feeling the riptides pulling us out into the middle of the mid-Atlantic, you know, man.

843
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,260
Yeah, my salivary glands are, I can't do this anymore.

844
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,820
I can't do the you-know-what because the orange juice starts pulping from the inside.

845
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:56,280
Look, just pretending you're some sort of a Jamaican is a terrorist act at this point, Dave.

846
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,920
Look, look.

847
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:56,920


848
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:56,920


849
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:56,920


850
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,140
It's like owning a head shop.

851
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,100
It's like selling dope to little porno kids.

852
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,600
It's like owning your own head and pornographing little squids.

853
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,080
It's like, oh, no.

854
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,340
Now I'm getting turned on.

855
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:07,860
Oh, yeah.

856
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,780
Well, I can see that.

857
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,040
Big squids.

858
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,160
Wait, could you please toss his coat over that thing?

859
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,720
Big squids.

860
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:26,620
The Jamaican arboreal squids have a poisonous sack that you have to remove.

861
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:26,840
Wow.

862
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,900
Before you sex them.

863
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,260
Wow.

864
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,100
Well, how come they're not going to Baghdad to use their mini-equipments?

865
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,080
I mean, you know, to fight in the fighty war for...

866
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
The fighty war.

867
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,280
The reptilian, you know, Jamaican...

868
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,340
The arboreal birds?

869
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,420
The tree squids?

870
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,340
Oh, the Jamaican guys you have that thing planted in there.

871
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:43,800
No.

872
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,900
Come on, kids.

873
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,260
We're having a communist party.

874
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,440
You want to come again?

875
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,500
No.

876
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:55,740
No.

877
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,140
No.

878
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:56,920
No.

879
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


880
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


881
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


882
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


883
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


884
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


885
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


886
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


887
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


888
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:56,920


889
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,080
No.

890
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,360


891
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,920
No.

892
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,480
New Jamaican hobby version.

893
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:02,920
No.

894
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,340
No.

895
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,080
It's picking time down south.

896
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,860
In Columbia, South America, where a new industry is already showing signs of healthy progress.

897
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,740
50 million pounds are being harvested, the biggest crop in history.

898
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,840
Mother, is Maxwell House really the only coffee farm?

899
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:26,920
It is.

900
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,620
in the world? Well, your father

901
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,780
says so, and your father knows best.

902
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,820
Yes, it's Father Knows Best,

903
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,760
brought to you by Maxwell House.

904
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,720
Maxwell House, always

905
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,380
good to drop.

906
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,720
Sir, why did Daddy

907
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,780
switch to Postum? Your father

908
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,780
says there's no caffeine in Postum,

909
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,740
nothing to spoil your sleep, and

910
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,820
your father knows best. Yes, it's

911
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,860
Father Knows Best, brought to you by Instant

912
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,720
Postum, the good-tasting drink

913
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,960
that's entirely caffeine. It's outrageous,

914
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,460
outrageous, that's what it is, the most

915
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,480
outrageous thing I've ever seen in my entire

916
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,680
life. Yes, dear. Thank you.

917
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,780
It's a plot by the government.

918
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,420
Yes, Father. Thank you.

919
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,580
Look at Mucklucks. Yes,

920
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,800
Father. Thank you.

921
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,580
Devil Mucklucks, Mucklucks,

922
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,520
tainted by backward children. My sister

923
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,740
Kathleen and her family. Yes, Mother.

924
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,580
Thank you. Father, they're simply

925
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,840
dreaming. You see, you see that brother-in-law

926
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,540
of yours shelling out Mucklucks, do you?

927
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,660
Yes, dear. Thank you.

928
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,700
They tried to help put that brother-in-law

929
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,040
of yours away for Bud.

930
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,120
Bud!

931
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,060
No. No. No.

932
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,460
No. Yes, dear.

933
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,120
Thank you.

934
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,060
Oh, gosh, Dad. No.

935
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,760
Bud Watcher.

936
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,060
Cow, Kathy. Kathy.

937
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,260
You know. Yeah?

938
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,900
It's a plot by the government.

939
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,260
Yes, dear. Thank you. Bud.

940
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,020
You just wait, just wait.

941
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,460
Bud. Kathy, look, I don't want you

942
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,660
to enjoy a healthy, normal life.

943
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,500
Why? How do I

944
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,100
know? Oh, you just said that...

945
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,320
I said I don't want you to enjoy a healthy,

946
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,140
normal life. Why not?

947
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,340
Because we have so many Mucklucks.

948
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,860
Yes, dear. Thank you.

949
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,380
But, Pop. We've got five bird

950
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,580
records. Father! Oh, it's

951
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,440
all right, dear. It is not.

952
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,440
It's a plot by the government.

953
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,300
Yes, dear. Thank you.

954
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,460
This family has to stop the simple things of

955
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,540
life. And we've got to stop the encyclopedia.

956
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,260
Yes, dear. Is that

957
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,520
so? If I didn't go to Pop,

958
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,040
this whole family would get warmer.

959
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,680
Mucklucks. Much warmer.

960
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,440
Dear. We've got to realize

961
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440
that we aren't the Mucklucks, and we've got to

962
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,020
act that way. Yes, dear.

963
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,380
Thank you. We're just plain, simple

964
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,180
backward children.

965
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,380
We're just backward children from Mucklucks.

966
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,300
The family worked together to put some

967
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,980
pot away for a rainy day.

968
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,620
This family lives in a continual

969
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,320
potburst. What, Bud?

970
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,540
Yes, Father.

971
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,580
It's a plot by the government.

972
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,220
Yes, dear. Thank you.

973
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,600
Isn't that weird?

974
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,800
And then, plus, somebody in a mall

975
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,760
got thrown out for having a

976
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,880
him and his kid had shirts on and said

977
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,820
give peace a chance and peace is

978
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,960
pretty cool or something like that. Right. They bought it

979
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,820
at the mall. They bludgeoned him. Yeah, they bought it at the mall.

980
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,880
They bought it at the mall, and then the security cop said

981
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,080
look, we're just against policy to have

982
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,300
a

983
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:16,940
a

984
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,520
a

985
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:47,540


986
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,960
has there been even one of the cases

987
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,160
where it was a nun having a

988
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,700
lesbian thing with a little girl?

989
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,040
There was just one. In the Church of the Subgenius

990
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,940
we've been dogged. I've got to admit

991
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,260
we have been dogged by

992
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,560
the charlatan. That would be really hot, man.

993
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,640
Tributism, rampant

994
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:03,980
lesbianism in the

995
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,920
nun snakes in Dobstown.

996
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,820
Yeah, what is it with any female

997
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,020
that steps onto the Brushwood

998
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,060
campsite on July 4th weekend and immediately

999
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,820
has to go have a lesbian experience

1000
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,200
in the hot tub? Chaz wants to see what somebody

1001
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,580
said a bad habit.

1002
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,940
And I think she's obsessed with the idea.

1003
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,220
The power of Connie and her

1004
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,720
agents such as Sister Decadence

1005
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,800
and Susie the floozy. It is powerful.

1006
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,940
The rabbi. You can smell it many miles away.

1007
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,900
So many of these babes.

1008
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,820
And the power of suggestion. You know,

1009
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,920
if you keep saying that enough, Chaz, it's actually

1010
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,880
The power of kitty litter.

1011
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,660
What about if it was the other way around?

1012
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,960
That would kind of be disgusting.

1013
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,860
Well, that's like the year those guys came and crapped

1014
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,120
in the hot tub. Yeah, that's an acquired taste, too.

1015
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,920
Yeah. What about the

1016
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,360
billy goat boys around the big

1017
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,320
bonfire that one night? The Monkey

1018
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,540
Island night of group

1019
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,860
sex in New York State.

1020
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,780
Monkey Island, yeah.

1021
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,620
Public crazed group sex around

1022
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,300
the bonfire. The sunglasses

1023
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,620
were melting in the heat. One half was

1024
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,300
And nobody invited Chaz.

1025
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,440
I was emceeing the event.

1026
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,400
What are you talking about? He had one half

1027
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,120
of the crowd singing, USA!

1028
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,580
USA! And the other half

1029
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,280
was chanting, down, down, USA!

1030
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,660
Down, down, USA! And the other half was going,

1031
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,320
down, down, USA!

1032
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,660
No one was smart enough to play both sides.

1033
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,060
Paint.

1034
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,440
Give it a try.

1035
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,400
Van Dyke brown. Van Dyke brown.

1036
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,780
Van Dyke brown. Van Dyke brown.

1037
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,160
Color. Paint.

1038
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,800
Color. Dark sienna.

1039
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,360
Red.

1040
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,680
Bright red.

1041
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,360
White.

1042
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,440
White. White. White.

1043
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,200
Paint. Black. Black.

1044
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,480
Gray. Paint. Paint. Light. Light.

1045
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,960
Dark. Dark. Dark sienna.

1046
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,860
Dark sienna. Brown. Brown.

1047
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,960
The happy paint thinner.

1048
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,640
Happy ink. Happy water.

1049
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:55,840
Happy little thinner.

1050
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,020
Brown paint.

1051
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,740
Isn't that neat?

1052
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,340
We're looking for Sonny Belomo.

1053
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,760
Paint on. Paint on.

1054
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
Sonny Bono is dead.

1055
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,380
Well, that's not

1056
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,820
necessarily a good thing or a bad thing.

1057
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,420
Sonny Bono was born on...

1058
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,200
Sonny Bono is dead.

1059
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,580
Bella Lugosi is dead.

1060
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,820
Bella Lugosi is dead.

1061
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,500
Now he's not

1062
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,280
sucking your neck.

1063
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,340
Copernicus is dead, Dave.

1064
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,220
Copernicus never existed, Chaz.

1065
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,700
It was a myth created by the Neoplatonists.

1066
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,600
As well-known Aristotelians were fighting it out,

1067
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,600
picking it out with the Neoplatonists.

1068
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,720
The Aristotelians were mathematical wiz-wiz.

1069
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:46,800
The Aristotelians were mathematical wiz-wiz.

1070
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,980
And the Neoplatonists believed in love.

1071
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,840
So the two of them got together

1072
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,320
and threw numbers and spittled

1073
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,040
until the world was round again.

1074
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,480
And as they shaved the soft peach fuzz

1075
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,640
from the outside of it and stared directly

1076
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,900
into its glazed eyes,

1077
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,360
the truth became more clear than ever.

1078
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,460
The Neoplatonists

1079
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,880
and the Aristotelians

1080
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,800
were a match made in heaven.

1081
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,020
I almost screamed in obscenity.

1082
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,140
I almost said the F-Doodoo word

1083
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,800
as loud as I could at the end of that. It's a soft hair of a...

1084
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,280
Wow.

1085
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,260
That's fucking wild.

1086
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,800
I can only agree.

1087
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,360
He said that bad word.

1088
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,600
He said it came right out of his mouth.

1089
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,200
He opened his mouth

1090
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,980
and it came right out of there.

1091
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,000
He opened that fleshy glutinous trap

1092
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,480
and out came the metaphor

1093
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,080
for the epithets and swears

1094
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,700
and seducing and cocking and caffing and...

1095
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:41,920
Spilling out.

1096
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,020
We used to talk about wars.

1097
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,500
We used to talk about the economic value.

1098
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,620
Dave, I got a letter from

1099
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,360
an M.E. drunk

1100
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,700
I'm moving to the jungle, man.

1101
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,840
who implied that I didn't

1102
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,340
care about the war,

1103
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,860
the nonexistent, upcoming,

1104
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,720
ever-present

1105
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,160
war.

1106
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:01,960
The debacle.

1107
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,360
Because I wasn't doing

1108
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,960
enough about it, he said.

1109
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,380
What should you do?

1110
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,020
What should you do?

1111
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,040
How could we build this?

1112
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,040
Do you think we should sign up?

1113
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,760
Sign up, line up, enlist, today.

1114
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,720
That was your cry

1115
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,320
in the old days.

1116
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:19,980
That was my cry.

1117
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,720
I was younger than draft age.

1118
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,940
That's when you cut the soles?

1119
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,020
Now that I'm beyond draft age

1120
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,160
it's again my cry.

1121
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,120
Line up, sign up, enlist, today.

1122
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,540
I believe you.

1123
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,560
I support you 100%.

1124
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,020
I saw a feel-good story.

1125
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,900
This is a wondrous feel-good story.

1126
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,000
We need feel-good stories.

1127
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,960
If you eat a stinging ant, you can tell us a feel-good story.

1128
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,480
I don't generally catch the news much, and I don't have cable.

1129
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,740
So I log on, and I think it's ABC News or CBS.

1130
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,740
Or Dan Rather.

1131
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,920
ABC News, I think.

1132
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,720
Or CBS News.

1133
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,180
I don't know.

1134
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,680
One of those two.

1135
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,220
Well, anyway, you can look at their video archives.

1136
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:03,560
They're conspiracy.

1137
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,320
Either way.

1138
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,360
And I looked at one, and I saw one of the video archives of a story they just run about

1139
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,940
about a reunion in the desert.

1140
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,100
The banana splits.

1141
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,800
No, it was Dan Rather.

1142
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,820
The monkeys.

1143
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,360
And a kid, a guy, who something like nine years ago stole Dan Rather's car.

1144
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,120
Oh, I saw that.

1145
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:27,160
And Dan embraced him, and he got down on all fours and sucked his knee.

1146
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,200
They had to turn the camera off and resume.

1147
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,900
Yeah, he was crying.

1148
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,880
You know, Dan Rather cries.

1149
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,480
He weeps.

1150
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,120
Kenneth is a weeper, especially when the frequencies are bad.

1151
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,200
Babies, they want their poof

1152
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:58,740
One of the four beasts sang, and I saw a white horse.

1153
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,800
Hi.

1154
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,000
You hungry?

1155
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,480
Looking for a tempting treat?

1156
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,440
Hold on till I absorb some heat.

1157
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,180
Uh-huh.

1158
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,260
I've added tang my pleasing too.

1159
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,960
I'll slide into an oven-fresh bun.

1160
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:16,840
Uh-huh.

1161
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,780
Ah, yeah.

1162
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,140
Hey, Mom.

1163
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:36,740
Yes, you.

1164
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,340
Why fuss and fret about dinner?

1165
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:40,920
It's right here.

1166
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,000
Yes, this drive-in offers everyone in the family a real picnic treat for dinner.

1167
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,460
We've got delicious sandwiches with all the trimmings and your other dinner favorites,

1168
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,000
plus whatever you want to drink, hot or cold.

1169
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:58,820
Come early before the show starts or eat while you're being entertained or at intermission time.

1170
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,020
So why fuss?

1171
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,120
Give your family a tasty dinner at this drive-in.

1172
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:18,260
Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

1173
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:23,860
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.

1174
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:35,100
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brother.

1175
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:45,920
And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

Collage by Cody and the Band

1177
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,140
The Band

1178
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,120
The Band

1179
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,880
The Band

The Band

1182
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,600
And you are listening to the subgenius radio

1183
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,180
ministry.

1184
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,300
Hour of slack voice of the Church.

1185
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,800
Of the subgenius produced by yours truly, Reverend.

1186
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:19,580
I've been staying here in Cleveland using the bits and pieces of help by so many, many

1187
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,300
subgeniuses out there.

1188
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:30,620
You can get more information from www dot subgenius dot com and I mean a lot of information.

1189
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,540
You can also write it.

1190
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,080
Well, you can write to to me, Reverend Warren, 62129 Sch awakened 여기, a 꽤old of d 77 plays

1191
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,080


1192
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,080


1193
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:45,460
Ivan Stang at Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043

1194
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,860
And it was lemur.

1195
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,600
Bimco's posture and the pot-sension Bimco.

1196
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:04,720
And Jennifer says those tools are definitely those tools.

1197
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,340
Now do you know how to play Make Your Move?

1198
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,200
No, I don't.

1199
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,360
You put this under the two numbers and the price of the three numbers

1200
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,600
under the four numbers under the three numbers

1201
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,960
and the price of the two numbers under the four numbers in the decorator bed.

1202
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,980
Now you know how to play the game.

1203
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,620
I put that under the three numbers of the...

1204
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,060
That's right.

1205
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:21,540
Check.

1206
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,600
Three, four, three, two, four, two, three, four, four, three, two, four, two, three, four.

1207
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,140
Okay.

1208
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,140
Okay.

1209
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,620
Three, two, four.

1210
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,060
Now, she says the tools are the decorator.

1211
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,540
The decorator bed is right.

1212
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,720
That's fascinating.

1213
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:46,900
Level nine.

1214
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,780
What do you want from life, George?

1215
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,420
Oil.

1216
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,000
What do you want from life, George?

1217
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,940
What does George want from life, George?

1218
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,280
George would like to be an innocent bystander of his own ill works.

1219
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,240
Well, there you have it.

1220
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:04,960
I'm a lonesome.

1221
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,940
Cowboy Dave himself.

1222
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:10,440
He'd like to wash his hands of the whole thing.

1223
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,760
He's sorry now.

1224
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,480
Be able to go to sleep.

1225
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,600
Without seeing the same dead faces.

1226
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,880
He never will be able to.

1227
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,640
I want my Apache helicopter.

1228
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,560
That's what I want on a life.

1229
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,440
I'm out there in America's headquarters, USA.

1230
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,260
From the commander-in-chief all the way down to Mr. Wolfowitz.

1231
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,040
And all the rest.

1232
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,260
Battle drums fell down.

1233
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:34,780
And all the people.

1234
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,400
They're gonna get killed.

1235
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,640
But we can't be lying on.

1236
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,260
Sweet dreams, weirdos.

1237
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,840
Take a deep breath.

1238
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,320
Just take a deep breath.

1239
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,560
And take that duct tape.

1240
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,160
Take that duct tape.

1241
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:48,920
Here's what you do.

1242
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,680
Here's your survival plan, kid.

1243
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,500
You go buy some plastic sheeting and some duct tape.

1244
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,380
And you take a big piece of that plastic sheeting, wrap it around your head.

1245
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,180
Take the duct tape.

1246
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,640
Securely wrap that plastic sheeting around your neck.

1247
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,720
So that you can no longer breathe.

1248
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:04,660
And just.

1249
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,160
Smile and everything will be okay.

1250
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,380
You won't get the bad germ.

1251
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,440
Unless you bite through it.

1252
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,020
That's like the instant bio shield.

1253
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:25,040
You just take the plastic, wrap it around your head, and take the duct tape right around your neck.

1254
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,480
Well, that's how they were going to take care of Osama bin Laden.

1255
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:33,760
They were going to take duct tape and plastic and smoke them out of those caves one by one.

1256
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,560
One by one.

1257
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:38,880
Toga out of the plastic sheeting.

1258
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,600
Togas, that's it.

1259
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,720
Take your duct tape, kids, and that plastic sheeting and fashion yourself a nice little toga.

1260
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,520
Nothing on Elsa besides your plastic sheeting toga.

1261
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:59,920
And walk down to the protest march down in Public Square and protest the war in your plastic and duct tape toga.

1262
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,960
Set yourself on fire, man!

1263
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,740
I'm behind it. I'm behind it.

1264
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,660
Get out of the way.

1265
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,520
You first.

1266
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,060
Absolutely free.

1267
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,480
Or you can have...

1268
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,140
Till next week. Keep your hat on tight.

1269
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,640
You're back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.

1270
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,860
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1271
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,460
I'm sorry.

1272
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,720
I didn't give any sense of the lane around you.

1273
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,800
Happy birthday, Princess We Are Doe.

1274
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,600
It's all good.

1275
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,200
I'm sorry.

1276
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,280
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

1277
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,220
My name's Chad.

1278
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:22,960
See y'all.

1279
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:23,760
Bye.

1280
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,800
These over here.

1296
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,240
You have to decide now which one would you like.

1297
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,060
The alcohol, the cavities, the safety pin, the coat, or the fashion design gown.

1298
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,080
It's a plot by the government.

1299
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,080

Thank you.

1301
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,140
True, each of us may have different ideas as to what that future will be.

1302
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:42,720
But every forward outlook reminds us that all the highways of all research and all communication,

1303
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:51,920
all the activities of science, lead us onward to better methods of doing things.

1304
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:58,340
With new opportunities for employment and better ways of living.

1305
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,700
As we go on, determined to unfold,

1306
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:08,160
the constantly greater possibilities of the world of tomorrow.

1307
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,000
As we move more and more rapidly forward,

1308
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:20,120
penetrating new horizons in the spirit of individual enterprise.

1309
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,860
In the great American way.

1310
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,580
And so the days of fear and tragedy begin,

1311
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,560
the change begins at the glimpses of humans as well.

1312
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,720
You are sealed behind a model mirror,

1313
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,380
but the side hatch that buttons the pain and experience

1314
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:52,380


1315
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,020
The darkness of the world wins its victor.
