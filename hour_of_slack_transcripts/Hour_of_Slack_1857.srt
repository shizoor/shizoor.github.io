1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
I've done far worse than kill you.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,020
I've hurt you.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,280
And I wish to go on hurting you.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,540
What?

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,520
For earth's sake.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,300
Yes, I know.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,660
What time is it?

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,920
I wonder exactly in a temporary way.

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,640
Can we really understand time?

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,120
Of course you can, kids.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,420
And here's the easiest way you can.

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,380
Just pull those gentle, gentle, tender flaps apart

13
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,460
and sit down quietly between your own knees

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,360
and just begin.

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,820
That's right.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,940
Be brave and time to the music.

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,420
Go.

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:39,640
Go.

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,280
Well, we've asked everybody here

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,060
if they've got a special request

21
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,540
for each and every one of you here.

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,880
God have given

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,100
bad, bad hit.

24
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,120
The devil have gone far enough.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,140
Prayer warrior.

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,220
Meet me on my knees.

27
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,280
On your knees, Friday night

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,700
at 7.30.

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,560
And listen now, my friends,

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,920
the prayer tower is open.

31
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,980
The prayer tower is open right now.

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,520
You that need prayer.

33
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,160
My God.

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,380
The prayer team

35
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,640
is here on the telephone.

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,860
Right now.

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,980
The prayer team.

38
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,460
What the hell is that?

39
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,100
Light your prop.

40
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,500
Light the fantastic bag.

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,880
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

42
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,720
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag.

43
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,640
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

44
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,920
I have no time to make a show of loving kindness

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,980
before my fellow men.

46
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,220
Not in this life.

47
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,620
I've too much laughing to do.

48
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,760
Hurrah!

49
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,480
This goes to show.

50
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,620
What is with meaning?

51
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,400
You know what I mean?

52
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,820
Meaning is so relative.

53
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,020
What is reality?

54
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,360
What?

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


61
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


64
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,740
Yeah.

65
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:57,960
Yeah.

66
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,800
What is reality?

67
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,100
You know what you...

68
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,340
What?

69
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,440
I don't get it.

70
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,900
What is reality?

71
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,940
See, we can make people trip

72
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,800
right on the air

73
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,900
on various toxic substances

74
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,600
by bacterial agents.

75
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,260
And some of them only charge 15%.

76
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,720
Reality is what doesn't go away

77
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,480
when dot, dot, dot.

78
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,340
But let's leave things of this world behind

79
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,880
and walk now down the path of Bob

80
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,820
for this brief minute of slack

81
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,420
from the church of the subgenius.

82
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,360
This so-called civilization?

83
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,960
On the day when we finally realize

84
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,300
that things are all backwards

85
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,180
and we have slack without work

86
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,900
in the promised kingdom of Bob Dobbs,

87
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,100
then perhaps we'll find the true civilization

88
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,900
which needs not Xerox machines

89
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,840
nor fancy coats and ties.

90
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,360
It don't have to happen.

91
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,300
It can have them.

92
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,500
You can be civilized

93
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,560
and not live in a cave.

94
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
But you're probably going to be more civilized

95
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,920
being one of these characters

96
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
that sits in a cave

97
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,060
scratching his butt

98
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,600
than you are running around

99
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,780
on this treadmill of false slack.

100
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,380
Ah, yes.

101
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,180
And look at the humans

102
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,700
lined up for the slaughterhouse.

103
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,660
Ah, yes.

104
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,200
The harvest.

105
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,120
Praise Bob.

106
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,860
Let there be slack.

107
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,060
I'm just an American boy

108
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,580
Raised on MTV

109
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,140
And I seen all the kids

110
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,020
in the soda pop-ups

111
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,560
But none of them look like me

112
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,160
So I started looking around

113
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,580
For a light out of the dim

114
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,200
And the first thing I heard

115
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,260
that made sense

116
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,040
was the sound of a gun

117
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,040
Where the Muhammad

118
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,180
Peace be upon him

119
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,040
I shot and threw

120
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,560
La-yi-la-ha-yi-la-ha-la

121
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,040
There's no God but God

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,800
If my daddy could see me now

123
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,160
Chains around my feet

124
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,500
He don't understand

125
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,040
That sometimes a man's got to be

126
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,560
Maya, he's a fighter

127
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:24,760
He's a fighter

128
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,700
for what he believes

129
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,960
And I believe God is great

130
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,400
All praise due to him

131
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
And if I should die

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,280
I'd rise up to the sky

133
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,980
Just like Jesus

134
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,220
Peace be upon him

135
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,780
I shot and threw

136
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,040
La-yi-la-ha-yi-la-ha-la-a-ha

137
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,040


138
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,040


139
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,060
There's no God but God

140
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:05,760
guitar solo

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,260
We came to fight the jihad

142
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,940
And our hearts were pure and strong

143
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,040
And death befall

144
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,320
There we all offered the present

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,560
Prepared for our martyrdom

146
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,380
But I lost some of the plan

147
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,920
Some secret not revealed

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,800
Now they're dragging me back

149
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,680
With my head in the sand

150
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,200
To the land of the infidels

151
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,240
I shunned them

152
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,020
Now they're dragging me back

153
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,020


154
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,460
Layla, layla, la

155
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,780
As I do

156
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,220
Layla, layla, la

157
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,900
I shunned them

158
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,020
Now they're dragging me back

159
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,120
To the land of the infidels

160
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,360
I shunned them

161
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,360


162
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,360


163
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,800
And death befall

164
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,180
There we all offered the present

165
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,020
And our hearts were pure and strong

166
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,980
We came to fight the jihad

167
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,160
Yeah they lined the road

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,440
And burned them down

169
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,720
and turned them against our guard

170
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,280
So that when you turn down

171
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,700
your mission

172
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,020
It will be long and long

173
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,760
Yeah they burned them down

174
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,800
yeah they burned them down

175
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,240
That's like a dream

176
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,680
Yeah they burned them down

177
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:52,680


178
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:52,920
And they burned them down

179
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,160
John Walker's Blues

180
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,660
John Walker's Blues

181
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,660


182
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,100
by

183
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,000
John Walker's Blues

184
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000


185
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,540
Steve Earle from an album called Jerusalem.

186
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,860
Thanks to Dr. Legume for DCCing that to me.

187
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,400
Later in the show, friends, we'll hear Dr. Legume's stirring sermon at the Akron Devival.

188
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:18,740
Also, this show, number 857, is interwoven with collage cut-ups by Fernanda Nande-Lemur

189
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,320
and some clips posted by Reverend Tesla Coyle.

190
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:32,960
And, of course, ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland with Lonesome Cowboy Dave

191
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,580
and host Charles Smith, as seen here.

192
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,740
What's going on in the world? I don't even know anymore.

193
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,620
Oh, drug dealer fight.

194
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,720
Would you know if this is a bad omen?

195
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,700
What happened in the last few days?

196
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,760
Well, they're bombing Iraq, but they're not supposed to let everybody know it.

197
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
I mean, in America, nobody's supposed to know about it. Everybody else knows about it.

198
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,060
They're already doing it?

199
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,300
Yeah, they're just doing it.

200
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,940
Just like go blow up somebody's swimming pool.

201
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,320
Just in time for the election.

202
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,960
Yeah, all that.

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,380
This just came out. The government, Washington, D.C., the government is preparing to invoke special powers

204
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,780
to help fight armed terrorist groups in the U.S., including measures that will require people

205
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,580
in parts of the U.S. to register, obtain permission to travel, and carry I.D. cards.

206
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,400
The so-called rehabilitation zones.

207
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,440
Debt cards.

208
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,700
Which will include parts of between 14 to 32 states are allowed.

209
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:30,300
Under a presidential decree issued September 10th that also permits security forces to conduct warranties.

210
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,040
Warrantless searches.

211
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,380
And hold suspects for months before consulting a judge.

212
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,240
And they can also hold the parts between their knees that are connected there.

213
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,300
In the zones, the government can require all residents to register with civilian authorities,

214
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,100
restrict travel, impose curfews, and issue special identification cards to local residents, the decree says.

215
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:00,060
Residents of areas where identification cards have been issued can be detained for up to 24 hours for not carrying the cards.

216
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,500
A military commander from the North American Command in each zone can collect information about where residents live,

217
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,740
what vehicles they use and jobs they work at, as well as who has permits to carry guns.

218
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,620
Do you remember the old days staying with the Wells Fargo guys and the other, what was the other one?

219
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,840
The dicks, you know, the private dicks.

220
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,860
There was Wells Fargo.

221
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
What was the other one with impunity?

222
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,680
They can't do that.

223
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:23,680


224
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:23,680


225
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,420
They could go around killing people for screwing up capitalism in the West.

226
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,980
Now get this.

227
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,700
Government officials could not be reached to comment on the plans,

228
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,060
but Attorney General John Ashcroft said that the powers granted to the state were soft.

229
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,600
When the decision is made to create a zone,

230
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,400
it is because we are facing the probability that something very serious is about to happen.

231
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,920
Right, fascism is going to take over.

232
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,620
To the civilian population.

233
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,300
Yeah, right.

234
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,100
There are new procedures which are being studied that we can use.

235
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,640
Not everyone.

236
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,480
Not everywhere, but specifically where we need them to protect civilians and attack terrorists.

237
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,600
Well, I think that's amazing that he was so psychic to know what's going to happen to us,

238
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,680
and yet he didn't know on 9-11-10th of September.

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,580
Now, I did get this off the internet on S-News by New Monet.

240
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,540
But that is a true thing, because I know I read it in the Payne-Dealer.

241
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,300
Yeah, I read it on the internet, and you're hearing it now on the radio.

242
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:29,060
So, I mean, it must be as true as anything else you hear on the radio or read on the news or the internet.

243
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,320
I'm more disturbed by what I...

244
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,780
I'm more disturbed by a science article I was reading.

245
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,420
What did it say, James?

246
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:49,600
Well, it was just talking about that we need to start opening our minds to the possible fact that the universe stinks.

247
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,080
And all the bubbles of universes that they...

248
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,700
That they think exist.

249
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,300
Are a fart bubble of God.

250
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,400
No, they're just because we think them.

251
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,540
Oh, man.

252
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,120
Yeah.

253
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,500
The eye in the pyramid's right in our own navel.

254
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,820
That works real well until you stub your toe.

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,420
Yeah, right.

256
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,260
And then all of a sudden you're not just thinking.

257
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,760
Until you don't wake up while somebody's stealing your van.

258
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,660
Your toe really, really hurts.

259
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,000
When you smell... you forget to smell the smoke.

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,080
Because we see them. Because we observe them.

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
Oh, yeah, so we're just...

262
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,280
They exist because we observe them.

263
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,340
We're just lackluster, dullardly observers.

264
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,040


265
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,380
Yeah.

266
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,520
Oh, well, if that's the case, Professor,

267
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,400
why don't you go into that briar patch and get my kid's ball?

268
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,460
Briar stang.

269
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,860
You're just imagining that briar patch.

270
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,280
No, you see the briar patch.

271
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,800
There is no spoon.

272
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,180
So it's there. It's there because you see it.

273
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,780
Or if anybody sees it, it's there.

274
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,920
You see the briar patch, but you don't see the thorns.

275
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,560
That makes sense.

276
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,560
If anybody sees it, it's there.

277
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,500
You're floating in a sea of briar patches.

278
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
You just can't feel the...

279
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,320
It's there.

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,780
You can't make the complex simple because it's complex.

281
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,420
And you can't make slack complex because it is simple.

282
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,380
And that's why we're trying to...

283
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,640
We're just trying to kind of cut through the bullshit, if we can, friends,

284
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,480
and try to figure out for ourselves what slack really is.

285
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:20,640
Yeah.

286
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,060
But it really, really...

287
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,060


288
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,060


289
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,060


290
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,060


291
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,060


292
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,060


293
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,060


294
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,060


295
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,060


296
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,480
And what we've been able to find...

297
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,140
I've been in this business for 20 years,

298
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,740
and you know what I've found out?

299
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,520
Not a goddamn thing.

300
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,500
I've learned how ignorant I am.

301
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,180
I've learned how stupid I am.

302
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,840
I've learned how I don't know.

303
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,200
And the best part is,

304
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,840
I don't have to know.

305
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,300
I don't have to know why the universe was created.

306
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,740
I don't have to know how it was created.

307
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,380
I don't have to know where I'm going to go when I die.

308
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,040
I don't have to know anything.

309
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,820
Because who said I was so fucking important

310
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,800
that I...

311
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,640
deserve to know. Maybe it's better if the Loch Ness Monster is never captured. Maybe

312
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,580
it's better if nobody ever shoots and stuffs a Bigfoot. Maybe it's better if the aliens

313
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,440
never land. Because friends, wouldn't it be kind of boring to find out? Wouldn't it be

314
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,700
terrible if all the mysteries were gone? Ah yes friends, the mysteries. The mysteries

315
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,060
are shit that can't be explained. That's what's important. The stuff inside, the music

316
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,740
that makes you feel good. I know people who were saved by Jesus when they went to see

317
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,700
the movie Jesus Christ Superstar. And then it was only years later that when they were

318
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,140
listening to the Rolling Stones that they realized that it wasn't Jesus inside them,

319
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,460
it was the rock and roll that they felt that would put that spirit in their hearts.

320
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,760
And it doesn't have to be Jesus. It doesn't even have to be Bob. It doesn't have to be

321
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,840
whatever your favorite drug is or your favorite personal savior. Because as we've learned

322
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:06,360
from Bob Dog time after time, we can't depend on invisible monsters up in the sky to answer

323
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,300
our prayers. And we can't trust aliens to come down from earth to save us. We can't

324
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,680
even believe in pipe smoking, get rich quick stuff.

325
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,540
We can't even believe in skiing smiling smiley faces of the 90's friends. I just believe

326
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:32,080
in me. Yoko and me. That's reality. And friend I suggest you take the same approach. Bob

327
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:39,260
is not the answer and neither is anything else. And in this church, in closing friends,

328
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,760
to bring this so that you can finally quit listening to somebody lecture you and start

329
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,980
getting back to the truth slide.

330
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,680
A very important message.

331
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,440
I'm not going to leave you with one thought. And it's the one rule, the one law of the

332
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,240
church of the subgenius. The only thing in the whole god damn book. All of these books.

333
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:08,040
The one valid statement that Bob said that you can live by. And here it is friends. Fuck

334
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:15,760
them if they can't take a joke. That's his voice. Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

335
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,680
That's his voice. Fuck them if they can't take a joke. That's his voice. Fuck them

336
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,740
if they're going to take a joke.

337
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,040
And you have to show it. God wants you to reveal your truth. You will not be far, you

338
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,140
will be far, just stay. Fuck them, fuck them if they can't take a joke. telling me if you

339
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:38,780
can't take a joke. In praise. We love you. God loves you. God wants you. All he wants

340
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,580
is to make sure you know him. God wants you. Doing evil for you. Those Christ people who

341
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,480
always would penelop, all shower in penetrate the Lord Jesus님,Lord Jesus you're born, living

342
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,680
here with him. All he wants is. Get out from here. check if all reason is to leave you out.

343
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:46,680


344
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,300
There's your money.

345
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,300
The Reverend Ivin Starrer!

346
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,340
Ladies and gentlemen, give him your money!

347
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,160
Come on up, give him your money!

348
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,320
He's gonna scream you!

349
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,580
Oh, damn!

350
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,780

One dollar, one, one dollar.

B.O.B.

365
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,740
Remix number two by Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

366
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,080
And before that, my sermon,

367
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,540
backed by Einstein's Secret Orchestra

368
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,680
at the Blind Lemon Club DeVival in Cleveland last year.

369
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,960
And speaking of last year, friends,

370
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,380
the world ends tomorrow!

371
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,940
We might all be killed.

372
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,260
There's a reason for that.

373
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,040
You see how those gears are slanted?

374
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,300
Right there.

375
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,740
Here.

376
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,020
There.

377
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,280
Here.

378
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,780
You can stylize snakes for breakfast.

379
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,640
And it was a very eerie experience.

380
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,180
Yes.

381
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
This is our crack.

382
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,120
Now it's on.

383
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,800
Running along the top of the muscles

384
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,600
and all of that was torn loose.

385
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,600
It's so wonderful.

386
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,200
You're considered benevolent in that part of the world.

387
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,260
The ice is right there.

388
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:23,600
Here.

389
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,380
There it is.

390
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,180
All right.

391
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,540
Look at that.

392
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,220
Just like that.

393
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,760
Just that.

394
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,700
Because it's plastic.

395
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,160
You've got the red dot in here

396
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,460
because it's so wonderful.

397
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:32,640
I'm going to get it for you.

398
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,440
And we were going around

399
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,700
and didn't even think we liked each other too much.

400
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,460
Well, you know what?

401
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,320
I don't have a clue.

402
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,020
$140.

403
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,520
The end times are near.

404
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,740
Hello, Mom.

405
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,860
Hello, Mom.

406
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,360
Hello, Mom.

407
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Hello, monsters are born.

408
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,960
Hello, Mom.

409
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,120


410
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:53,680
Hello, Mom.

411
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,960
Did the end times come yet?

412
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,380
Are we incarcerated?

413
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
Are we dead?

414
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,300
Come here.

415
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,420
Are we dead?

416
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:02,420


417
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:02,440
Are we dead?

418
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,920
Or are we just thinking of a new way of living?

419
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,180
Look at this beautiful Bel Air mansion.

420
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,320
Made from stucco and cocoa and filled with your favorite 325 kids.

421
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,680
Some of them have their asses dangling from the cactus in the backyard.

422
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,560
But you're a cowboy dad and you're ready for this new century.

423
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,760
Let's go home.

424
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Woo-hoo!

425
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,440
Let's go home.

426
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,460
Oh, that's nasty.

427
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,060
Let's go and bomb with the president.

428
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,460
Woo-hoo!

429
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,300
Now that better do that again.

430
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,000
Bomb.

431
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,700
Let's go do some drugs.

432
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,660
Legal drugs, that is.

433
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,480
Woo-hoo!

434
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,740
Hey, let's put on a thing of those furry monkey pants and dance for the guy with the

435
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,600
grinding his organ over there against the telephone pole.

436
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,260
It's disgusting.

437
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,540
Of course it's disgusting.

438
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,900
It's disgusting.

439
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,960
It's disgusting.

440
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,340
We don't know why you do that.

441
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,140
You've got to know what you're getting into.

442
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,260
Uh-oh.

443
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,100
Come with me.

444
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,300
Walcott the

445
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,360
Seeker is going to get mad.

446
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,360
You just don't understand it.

447
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,880
Bye now.

448
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,380
What is the meaning of this?

449
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,360
You'll be reborn now, you hear?

450
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,040
What is the meaning of death in the cycle of rebirth?

451
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,040
What is the meaning of the tender, tiny thread

452
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,860
that extends from the flap below the reptile's eye

453
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,960
deep into the womb of nature itself?

454
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:52,660
Mama?

455
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,340
There's a seeker born every minute.

456
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,540
Well, as far as our scientists have been able to determine,

457
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,280
the purpose of life is, in fact, simply to squirt,

458
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,300
or in the case of some creatures, to ooze.

459
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,860
Ah, squirting and ooze.

460
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,960
An ooze squirt.

461
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,720
Yes, that's it.

462
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,840
There's no high, lofty meaning of life.

463
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,720
It is simply to...

464
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,060
Squirt and ooze.

465
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,560
Yes, and not for the procreation aspects,

466
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,940
just for the pleasure.

467
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,960
The mere ejaculation.

468
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,380
Yes, that's just the...

469
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,900
Vibration.

470
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,200
That's it.

471
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,900
Banging the nervous system ever so gently.

472
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,020
Yes, if you're looking for a meaning, there it is.

473
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,260
Doesn't matter whether it's by yourself or with somebody else.

474
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,740
It's just...

475
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,360
That's it.

476
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,000
You could just take a walk out into your neighborhood any day

477
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,680
and get on a bus and get that same sensation

478
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,100
as you ride over them old potholes.

479
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,760
You know, life ain't much more than a oozing and a squirting

480
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,300
and a kind of a dangerous feeling coming up the back of your neck.

481
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,600
Oh, I'm gonna rub my little round belly.

482
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,240
Things are growing up there now.

483
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,020
They're growing now.

484
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,920
They're like bad thoughts, you know.

485
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,200
They're just hanging to the top of your head

486
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,140
and they can't get out.

487
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,760
And they got to find a way out someday.

488
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,920
Oh, I can't wait to have Bob rub my little round belly

489
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,760
over at that rabbit supper tonight.

490
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, he's gonna rub you like the boot is belly.

491
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,740
He's gonna create more slack out of the top of your head

492
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,520
than you ever should.

493
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,400
Hey, old Bob, he's a boatie shot for.

494
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,360
He's a fully realized enlightened being.

495
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,960
He's gonna be at that squirrel supper tonight.

496
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,960
You gonna be there, Benny?

497
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,040
Hey, look, he's eating barbecued chicken.

498
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,820
And I never know, boatie shot for enjoyed meat that way.

499
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,340
I mean, you know, that way.

500
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,940
Oh, hell, you know, him and Bob go way back.

501
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,140
I threw up.

502
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,720
It's hard to pull it out of your moon pants.

503
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,660
Tease you just to let it go out in front.

504
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,040
Is that you going through?

505
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,440
There must be.

506
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,940
Now, why in the world would I be going there,

507
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,800
that the dog.

508
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,940
I kidnapped the future and ransomed it for the past.

510
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,840
I made time wait up for me to bleed my lizard.

511
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,600
My infernal breath wills the tree of life.

512
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,840
I left my sword on the rock of ages, who will tear flesh with me, who will spill their juice?

513
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,240
Who'll gout with me, whose candle will I fart out?

514
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:42,660
Good. I'm ready. So step aside, all you but loot, neurotic, insecure bespectacled slavs oh wink meat.

515
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,360
I'm a crime fighting master criminal, I am not insane. I'm a screamer and a laugher,

516
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:54,780
I make a spectacle of myself, I am a sight. My physical type cannot be classified by science,

517
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,380
my familiar is a pterodactyl, I feed it to feagles.

518
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,640
This is the one.

519
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,120
This is the two.

520
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,580
This is three.

521
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,480
This is four.

522
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,360
The Branflex, from TheBranflex.com

523
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,720
Before that, some Brag of the Subgenius Bobfoolery

524
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,760
by me and Philo.

525
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,980
and now, well, soon actually,

526
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,620
a classic live recording of a Jurassic song

527
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,580
by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

528
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,860
But first, heart ignition.

529
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,040
Heart, heart, heart, heart.

530
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,080
What's that noise?

531
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,600
Swag.

532
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,760
Swag.

533
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,740
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

534
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,040
Name the killer.

535
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:28,980
Bulb.

536
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,820
Name the killer.

537
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,800
Bulb.

538
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,680
Swag.

539
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,760
What's that noise?

540
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Swag.

541
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,120
Swag.

542
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,800
Swag.

543
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,860
And I'm testable.

544
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,820
Swag.

545
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,100
Swag.

546
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,100
Swag.

547
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,880
Swag.

548
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,560
Swag.

549
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:11,800
Swag.

550
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,700
Swag.

551
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,040
Swag.

552
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,360
Swag.

553
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,440
Swag.

554
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,740
Swag.

555
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,220
Swag.

556
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,460
Swag.

557
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:19,920
Swag.

558
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,400
Well, it's been a while since time began

559
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,140
That struggle against nature, forcing nature against man

560
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,980
Tectonic play, movement of simple quicksand

561
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,160
Nature has the power, nature has the upper hand

562
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,200
Nature!

563
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,600
I hate it!

564
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,360
Nature!

565
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,640
I hate it!

566
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,380
Well, the forces of nature come in many degrees

567
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,940
Maybe a forest fire, plague or killer bees

568
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,160
Maybe an earthquake or maybe typhoon

569
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,100
Tornadoes, volcanoes, rains will come soon

570
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,280
Nature!

571
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,820
I hate it!

572
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,560
Nature!

573
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,060
I hate it!

574
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,260
Give a baby's dioxide

575
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,580
Blue go in

576
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,960
Wipe out a whole species

577
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,380
How does that make you feel?

578
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,140
Guard your hole in the earth

579
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,320
Fill that hole with plastic

580
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,840
The way we do it, we do it the way we do it

581
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,280
We treat our planet better than men

582
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,040
Oh!

583
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,460
Oh!

584
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,080
Oh!

585
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,720
Oh!

586
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,140
Oh!

587
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,060
Oh!

588
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:18,840
Oh!

589
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,240
guitar solo

590
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,880
solo

591
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,920
solo

592
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,880
solo

593
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,920
solo

594
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,620
solo

595
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,640
solo

596
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,720
Well I wouldn't find nature

597
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,940
If I had my druthers

598
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,940
Wish I could control

599
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,200
the action of others

600
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,620
Solo

601
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:56,900
solo

602
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:56,900


603
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:56,900


604
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,080
We should love nature as one of our brothers.

605
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,280
Don't you know it's not nice to do your mother?

606
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,460
Nature!

607
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,720
I hate it!

608
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,360
Nature!

609
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,980
Don't love it!

610
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:13,860
Nature!

611
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,180
Don't love it!

612
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,020
Nature!

613
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,120
Nature!

614
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,860
Come on!

615
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,360
Come on!

616
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,980
Come on!

617
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:56,700
I don't want to get off the stage.

618
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,060
Who told me to get off the stage?

619
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,240
Am I just paranoid?

620
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,720
Nature!

621
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,300
I hate it!

622
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,660
The Swingin' Love Corps is live in St. Louis, 1991.

623
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,020
And now, from the Akron Devival this summer,

624
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,720
Dr. Katahdin Lagune,

625
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,960
who starts his sermon by reading a suicide note.

626
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,520
A suicide note? Is it mine?

627
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,120
Get it back!

628
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,760
Man, I found this suicide note.

629
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,460
It was from a young teenage girl.

630
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,780
At least from the content, I'm assuming it was a teenage girl.

631
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,100
It says here,

632
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,620
I'm tired of the pain in my heart.

633
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,080
You are all so unfair to me.

634
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,480
You don't love me and you don't understand me.

635
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,460
Everyone hates me because I'm fat and ugly.

636
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,900
You don't love me and you don't understand me.

637
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,360
The only thing I ever wanted was to be with Patrick.

638
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,540
But I found out he was at the mall with that slut Michelle.

639
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,120
And I hope they'll all feel bad when I'm gone.

640
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,180
But tough.

641
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,500
I tried to talk to you about it, Mom.

642
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:18,660
But you was more interested in your soap operas than my real problems.

643
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,620
So I'm not going to bother any of you anymore.

644
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,620
And I hope Patrick is real happy.

645
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,980
At the mall with his slut.

646
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,300
You're going so far, you!

647
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,320
I hope you're all happy now.

648
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:32,940
Goodbye.

649
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,060
What a stupid little bitch.

650
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,300
Fucking shit, yeah.

651
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:46,540
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that

652
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:54,440
makes me think, well, what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?

653
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,980
And it reminded me.

654
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,260
It reminded me of when I was a child.

655
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,420
When I was a child, I grew up in a town called Mansfield, New Jersey.

656
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,980
And out on Route 206, which cuts right through Mansfield, New Jersey,

657
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,580
there's a farmer's market.

658
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,280
It's the biggest shop in town.

659
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,600
Everybody goes there.

660
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,000
It's the only reason anybody comes to Mansfield, is to shop at this farmer's market.

661
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,340
But across the street from this farmer's market, there was a junkyard.

662
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,660
Not just any junkyard.

663
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:39,020
It was an old military junkyard full of crashed World War II planes and trucks and tanks and such.

664
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,280
And it was owned by a man named John Mihaljec.

665
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,700
John Mihaljec had a lot to say.

666
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,800
He had so much to say, that out on Route 206,

667
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,200
down the entire length of his property,

668
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,880
he had these huge billboards with pictures of political figures on them.

669
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,200
They had a picture at the time, it was the 1970s,

670
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,220
there was a picture of President Richard Nixon with the bleeding body of a dead rat.

671
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,680
And there were these long, long ramps that he would put up on these billboards on his property.

672
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,720
And the town hated him.

673
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,140
But he does!

674
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,140
When he drove by, the ramps on the sides were so long and involved,

675
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,500
that the cars would have to slow down to five miles an hour just to read them.

676
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:28,900
Woo!

677
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,060
Oh yeah, they hated him bad.

678
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,220
So what did John Mihaljec do?

679
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,080
He ran for Senator.

680
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,920
Bloody hell!

681
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,100
That pissed off all the people who hated him even more.

682
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,880
All the townspeople hated him.

683
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,760
One day they said,

684
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,760
We're going to finally take care of this John Mihaljec problem.

685
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,660
So one night, some of the townspeople got together,

686
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,460
in the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies,

687
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,500
they all got their torches together,

688
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,500
and they went down to his property,

689
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,860
and they burned his house to the ground.

690
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,380
Yeah!

691
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,080
Oh, they burned his house to the ground,

692
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,340
but that's not all they did,

693
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,220
because his wife was in the house.

694
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,760
And they killed his wife.

695
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,720
They killed his wife,

696
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,640
and they burned down his house.

697
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,540
And they said,

698
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,680
Finally, we're going to see the end of John Mihaljec,

699
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,500
because no man is going to be able to stand up after something like this.

700
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,060
David Kuras.

701
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,240
John Mihaljec had other ideas.

702
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,480
John Mihaljec,

703
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,620
in the smoking ashes of the ruins of his home,

704
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,000
the smoking ashes of his now dead beloved wife,

705
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,480
built a giant teepee on that spot,

706
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,540
and let everybody know that we're not going to run him off his land.

707
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,660
The townspeople hated it even more.

708
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,000
So one night,

709
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,940
the townspeople,

710
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,900
in the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies,

711
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,340
once again got together,

712
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,000
and they went out to John Mihaljec's land,

713
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,540
and they burned down his teepee.

714
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,160
This, they said,

715
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,740
would run off John Mihaljec.

716
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,920
How much more could one man stand?

717
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,380
He would leave,

718
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,360
he would kill himself,

719
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,560
he would do something,

720
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,300
but he would be out of their hair forever.

721
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,740
John Mihaljec had other ideas.

722
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,440
And so,

723
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,960
on the smoking ruins of his teepee,

724
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,520
built on the smoking ruins of his home and his dead beloved wife,

725
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,300
John Mihaljec built another teepee,

726
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,580
an identical teepee to the first,

727
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,160
but with one small difference.

728
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,000
It was made of steel!

729
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:11,360
Yeah!

730
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,080
Yeah!

731
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,620
The villagers didn't know what to do about that.

732
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,760
They hated John Mihaljec.

733
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,200
They wanted to run John Mihaljec off his land.

734
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,760
But those stupid motherfuckers never could figure out how to burn down a steel teepee.

735
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,360
And John Mihaljec lived there until he died an old, old man.

736
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,820
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?

737
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,480
John Mihaljec!

738
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:41,920
John Mihaljec!

739
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,060
John Mihaljec!

740
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,060


741
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,060


742
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,640
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?

743
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,900
John Mihaljec!

744
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,300
Oh, brothers and sisters,

745
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,280
John Mihaljec found the perfect solution to his problems.

746
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,740
Maybe you have problems too.

747
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,660
Maybe your problems could be solved by giving up or committing suicide.

748
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,180
Probably not.

749
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,200
Well, come to think of it, we probably solved all your problems.

750
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,440
But we're not the kind of a cult that's going to advocate suicide.

751
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,740
We are the first anti-suicide suicide cult.

752
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,880
One day we will all get together and after the point of time we will all drink Kool-Aid.

753
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,160
Then nothing will happen, we'll just drink some Kool-Aid.

754
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,780
You don't lie until we say so.

755
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:30,780
Yes.

756
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,360
So, I'm sure you have problems too, but I don't think that many of your problems are going to be solved by a big tin teepee.

757
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,220
However,

758
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,980
there is always a solution to your problems.

759
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,960
And only the perfect solution to your problems.

760
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,600
And brothers and sisters,

761
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,680
Bob.

762
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,440
Bob will give you a blueprint.

763
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,020
A blueprint for your perfect teepee of vengeance.

764
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:07,240
It will help you get over your problems without having to take a hundred Tylenol.

765
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:09,960
Yeah.

766
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,080
Tom Waits.

767
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,600
Are there any Tom Waits fans here?

768
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:12,820
Yeah!

769
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:19,020
Well, I remember there was a song by Tom Waits where he said something about a woman.

770
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,640
She was a crumbling beauty with a tattooed tear on her cheek.

771
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,380
For each year her man was away.

772
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,400
And then Tom Waits said,

773
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,280
Hell, there's nothing wrong with her that a hundred dollars won't fix.

774
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,520
Well, brothers and sisters,

775
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,180
it's even better for all of you.

776
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,480
Because there's nothing wrong with you that thirty dollars won't fix.

777
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,640
Yes, brothers and sisters, because that thirty dollars,

778
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,080
when put in the hands of Bob,

779
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,340
will help deliver unto you the blueprint for your own tin teepee.

780
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,040
That tin teepee will fill that tin teepee-shaped hole in your lives.

781
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,460
Oh yes, brothers and sisters, you may not even have very small problems.

782
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,780
You might have them tiny problems.

783
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,560
Oh yes, but Reverend Stang,

784
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,200
he's here to help you with those problems.

785
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,660
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a little bob pin.

786
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,580
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a bumper sticker or a t-shirt.

787
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,160
And brothers and sisters,

788
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,560
through Bob's love,

789
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,880
Reverend Stang is here tonight

790
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,080
to fill that t-shirt-shaped hole in your lives, brothers and sisters.

791
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,600
Oh yes, brothers and sisters.

792
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,080
Can I get a praise, Bob?

793
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,320
We're filling CD-shaped holes.

794
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,880
Oh yes, brothers and sisters.

795
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,840
And I saw a lot of you out there tonight

796
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,880
who have CD-shaped holes in your lives

797
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,040
that are just begging to be filled.

798
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,980
And Reverend Stang is here tonight

799
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,500
to help Bob fill your holes.

800
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,800
Can I get a praise, Bob?

801
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,120
Praise Bob!

802
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,900
Many of my victims have joined my unholy legion of the undead,

803
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,220
becoming creatures without souls,

804
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,540
living only for hideous,

805
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,720
torments.

806
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,840
And I think if we continue that way,

807
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,860
to, you know, do what they said to do with porcine beings,

808
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,420
what will happen next?

809
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,560
Well, did you write to your congressman about the pigs?

810
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,700
Of course I did. I did.

811
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,400
I said we would be liberated,

812
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,440
and he said he sent back a hand-memeographed, a Xerox letter.

813
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,520
He sent back a hand-signed letter, I mean,

814
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,400
that said,

815
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,540
Thank you very much, Citizen Dave, for your interest in the porcine.

816
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,740
We're preparing a place for you in the re-education camps.

817
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,520
We have your room number and your keys waiting for you.

818
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,900
And your special hot tub.

819
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,000
And then I wrote a letter back saying,

820
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,720
the pork problem is probably the most,

821
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,460
the biggest problem we have to deal with in these days of post-9-11 surgery.

822
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,760
Well, humanity is in danger of getting thrown out of the cosmic,

823
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,600
you know, tent party,

824
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,740
for crapping in the universal hot tub.

825
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,140
See, you said, yeah, that is true, though.

826
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,900
And not sending in their 30 bucks.

827
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:58,420
Yeah.

828
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,220
The United States Navy is going to build these things that create sounds,

829
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,340
sounds underwater around 80% of the surface of the oceans,

830
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,620
which will kill all the whales and seals and porpoises,

831
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,980
and nobody's going to stop them because they're the U.S. Navy.

832
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,940
What do you mean, Ghana?

833
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:12,720
Ghana.

834
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,760
They already,

835
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,860
It's a word we use.

836
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,140
I thought they already did that.

837
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,320
They get the most amazing recordings out of that.

838
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,900
Yeah, the wheels, the whales squealing in agony as the air drums explode.

839
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,600
Now, that is a song.

840
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,420
By the time they're gone, we'll have,

841
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,900
we'll have figured out their language.

842
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:33,040
Well, yeah, by the time they'll utter their last pained cry of, of, yeah.

843
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,640
Pained cry.

844
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,760
Oh, I'm sure they have vials of whale sperm hidden away somewhere.

845
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:40,480
Ah, yes.

846
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,660
Long DNA, then short DNA.

847
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,440
Any kind of whale, whale you want.

848
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,820
How about a Moby-Doby?

849
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,840
We've got a blue one.

850
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,880
We've got the oversized white ones.

851
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,640
Those whale incubators, though, are really big.

852
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,040
Yeah.

853
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,860
And whale, but there's a booming business in whale placenta.

854
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,680
Oh, and there's nothing better with a little bit of almond extract.

855
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,780
Whale placenta?

856
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,020
Yeah.

857
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,160
Shaved almonds.

858
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,420
You like to shave your nuts for the whales.

859
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,360
Well, you can get quite a bit from each birth.

860
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:08,820
Oh, yeah?

861
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,820
From those mighty mammals of the deep, yeah?

862
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,560
So, they're going to give, they're making like little quantsets full of whales.

863
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,100
That's what rich people in Japan are doing, man.

864
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,080
All the, all the really, the rich Japanese people.

865
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,440
Those are the cool, beautiful people.

866
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,740
They bathe in whale fresh, freshly caught whale placenta.

867
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,260
It is so lovely for my skin.

868
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,040
I just wave a little bit of whale oil on my arms, and look.

869
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,020
As smooth as a baby's foot.

870
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,740
And also, look what it's done for my hair.

871
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,260
So, that gets you away from the poo-poo stuff.

872
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,160
Hi.

873
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,700
And back into the menstrual placental.

874
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,580
The plasma part of the beginning.

875
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,100
My favorite place.

876
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,800
The primal mommy.

877
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,760
The original ooze from which it all sprang.

878
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,940
Friends, you and I, each and every one of us with the chromosomes dancing on the backs

879
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,840
of our spines.

880
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,800
Like little egg yolks.

881
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,100
Or like little egg yolks.

882
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,740
And can be no more than individual fried eggs.

883
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,000
And I'm sure you've all been there.

884
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000


885
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000


886
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000


887
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000


888
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000


889
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000


890
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,940
So, live it up as long as you can.

891
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,900
Send your $30 before you're completely cooked.

892
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:08,340
Do it.

893
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,220
Do it.

894
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,440
Now.

895
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,100
Now.

896
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,940
Do it before your sex differentiates.

897
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,200
While you're still a yolk.

898
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,100
Before the zygote splinters.

899
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,940
Some of us may go in a different direction.

900
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,420
There are X chromosomes.

901
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,400
There are Y chromosomes.

902
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,220
There are now Z chromosomes.

903
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,720
Yes, that's right.

904
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,140
Have your genes outgrown you?

905
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,560
What about the anti-chromosomes?

906
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:32,980
I don't know.

907
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,140
What about them?

908
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,060
They're here with us.

909
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,260
What about them?

910
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,260
Holding their hands and closing their eyes and saying the mantra.

911
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:41,980
Shoop.

912
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:42,980
Shoop.

913
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,920
The many moods of an alien.

914
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,000
I descended from monochromes.

915
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,980
I ascended from polychromes.

916
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,600
I descended from morochromes.

917
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,440
I am all chromatic activity.

918
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,940
Repeat this to yourself.

919
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,960
Sit down and close your eyes.

920
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:02,960


921
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,500
Close your eyes, ears, nose and throat.

922
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,100
For this is your good night's sleep.

923
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,360
What?

924
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,580
Insert transition here.

925
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,320
Yeah, right.

926
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,660
Well, I timed it.

927
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,660
I had the guy.

928
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,940
Yeah, I could tell that.

929
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,300
It was a 15 second segue.

930
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,960
Amazing timing.

931
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,820
I laughed so hard.

932
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,680
Sometimes I slow down when I read.

933
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,980
The timing really caught me was the timing.

934
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,080
It was a 15 second segue.

935
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,660
And Stang was supposed to say something kind of laconically funny.

936
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,960
And then you were supposed to say something really silly.

937
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,020
I'm going to sit over here and eat my cupcake.

938
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:36,860
I'll do all that later.

939
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:37,920
Okay.

940
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,920
So you'll make it sound like you said something laconically silly.

941
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,540
And then Chaz said something really silly.

942
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,700
And then, no, that's not going to be it.

943
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,280
Oh, okay.

944
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:47,980
Yeah, whatever.

945
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,040
It doesn't matter.

946
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,600
No.

947
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,360
These people are idiots anyway.

948
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,460
I mean, you put the...

949
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,100
It's not that it's a show farm.

950
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,180
You sew it together like a piece of stew.

951
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,440
You know, I mean, you just flap a shoe in there.

952
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,400
You put some of your own, I don't want to say the other words.

953
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,640
Some of your own...

954
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,140
Some of your own stuff in there.

955
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,440
You just, you know, you don't really care what goes in there because you have no respect

956
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,880
for your subgenia who listen each week.

957
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,460
What in the world are you talking about?

958
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,700
Oh, I'm just saying the way Stang so haphazardly throws his hours of slack together.

959
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,020
First, he takes all the drugs you can take.

960
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,840
Heroin, monochrome, femur, that weird poison from South America.

961
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,440
Well, no, that's how you organize a show.

962
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,180
You do heroin.

963
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,100
As a theme.

964
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,680
And then you pick certain material for the heroin based.

965
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:32,980
Show.

966
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,860
And then you do a bunch of crack and you pick all the material that goes with that kind

967
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,220
of a...

968
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,700
So you just pretty much live the life, aren't you, man?

969
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,800
You just like come out there and just live it.

970
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,300
You know, and so forth.

971
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:43,660
Down through...

972
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,880
You don't really care about your...

973
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,980
Nitrous oxide and...

974
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,960
Chromosomes and long jeans and shirt.

975
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:49,800
That...

976
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,920
God, see, I can't even remember what drugs this show was supposed to be.

977
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,700
You're a loser of your dollars.

978
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,580
Well, yeah.

979
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:10,100
Then later I got into work and you Эsset divorce for good and then back out to take

980
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:10,100


981
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,780
Like I said, that's my job.

982
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,200
Ah!

983
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,600
Free drugs in the next minutes.

984
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:13,620
Now, I'm going to have to go buy theseру

985
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:18,820
Hmm?

986
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:25,860
!

987
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:31,260
it's such a bizarre car," said Jordan Umber

988
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,560
headphone

989
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,920
We're all wired into a survival trip now.

990
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,580
No more of the speed that fueled the 60s.

991
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,420
That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.

992
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,960
He crashed around America selling consciousness expansion

993
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,120
without ever giving a thought to the grim, meat-hook realities

994
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,700
that were lying in wait for all those people who took him seriously.

995
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,720
All those pathetically eager acid freaks

996
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,420
who thought they could buy peace and understanding for three bucks a hit.

997
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,500
But their loss and failure is ours too.

998
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,320
What Leary took down with him was the central illusion

999
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,100
of a whole lifestyle that he helped create.

1000
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,320
A generation of permanent cripples

1001
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,780
failed seekers

1002
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:36,060
who never understood the essential old mystic fallacy of the acid culture.

1003
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,300
The desperate assumption

1004
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,680
that somebody

1005
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,500
or at least some force

1006
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,460
is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.

1007
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,380
The End

1008
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,000
of the World

1009
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,000


1010
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,000


1011
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,300
Not when we think we've lost

1012
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,520
So I'm running on my back

1013
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,320
I'm gonna take me up with the spirit of the past

1014
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,000
I'm gonna set me up with the spirit of the past

1015
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,660
Cause when I'm gonna go away, I'm gonna die

1016
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,000
And when I'm gone, I'm gonna live in darkness

1017
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,120
I'm gonna go to a place that's so rare

1018
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,780
I'm gonna go to a place that's so rare

1019
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,340
I'm gonna go to a place that's so rare

1020
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,220
Yeah.

1021
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,940
I walked my way

1022
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,040
But I pass everywhere

1023
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,260
So I'm changing, with that

1024
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,820
And I put my hands on my side

1025
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,340
what they think of me

1026
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,400
They close my eyes

1027
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,680
I'm gonna go to the place right where I am

1028
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,480
I'm gonna go to the place right where I am

1029
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,220
I'm gonna go to the place right where I am

1030
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,320
Let's go!

1031
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,320
Hey, baby!

1032
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,520
Adios!

1033
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:48,460
Number, please.

1034
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,220
One freeze. One freeze.

1035
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,480
Thank you.

1036
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,520
Hello?

1037
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,260
This is Marlowe.

1038
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,480
Why didn't you telephone?

1039
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,460
I didn't have a nickel.

1040
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,080
Oh. What did you find at the lake?

1041
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,500
Shut up and get me my number.

1042
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,460
Who's being cute now?

1043
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,220
You are.

1044
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,160
What?

1045
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,340
Did you ever try to pull anybody out of the telephone booth?

1046
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,560
Yeah. Muriel Chester and San Bernardino.

1047
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,220
What's this, Crystal Kingsman?

1048
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,220
I'm coming to that.

1049
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,720
Oh. What man?

1050
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,100
The guy I didn't know his name.

1051
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:38,840
Oh.

1052
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,960
Marlowe, where do you usually spend Christmas Eve?

1053
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,360
To the gas station.

1054
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,440
On the south road.

1055
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,500
Oh.

1056
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,480
Where do you?

1057
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,680
In Little Fawn Lake.

1058
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,660
It's a place in the mountains beyond Arrowhead.

1059
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,320
Oh, brother.

1060
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,420
Here we are.

1061
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,200
How did I get here?

1062
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,540
Thirty days in the water.

1063
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,340
Luckily a sailor came along.

1064
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,260
What's the matter?

1065
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,620
There isn't much left of her.

1066
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,100
Shut up.

1067
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:22,640
This is Marlowe by Lemur and before that the Broken Circle Gospel Deluxe with Sister Sugar live at the Blind Lemon Divival. They're doing Spirit in the Sky.

1068
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,980
Do you think it's alright to ring our land in a ring of iron?

1069
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,260
I don't think so.

1070
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,840
I'm trying to wind it up here. The road goes on forever.

1071
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,640
They're exaggerating the harmfulness of uranium.

1072
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,580
It's all been spent.

1073
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,820
Or plutonium, whatever that is.

1074
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,360
It's spent. I mean, Craig, what can it do if it's spent?

1075
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,860
You just squirt it out of your... that tube of yours.

1076
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,800
Like any common ejaculating orangutan, it's the used squirt thing, only it's plutonium and it's spent.

1077
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,060
Talk about that.

1078
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,980
I can see why they call him Lonesome Cowboy.

1079
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,080
Cowboy Dave.

1080
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,700
Don't get too close, man.

1081
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,420
Not Popular Cowboy Dave.

1082
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,500
No, don't, don't.

1083
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,640
Now that was it. Now, I remember Popular Cowboy Dave.

1084
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,500
I say do it.

1085
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,340
He was tall. He was rich.

1086
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,220
Imposable.

1087
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,040
And intelligent.

1088
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:15,900
Christlike.

1089
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:17,900
Christlike.

1090
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,740
Popular Cowboy Dave was.

1091
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,180
But, well, we're going to have to have a...

1092
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,340
That's a good name.

1093
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:26,960
...we're going to have to have a...

1094
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,300
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1095
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:28,300


1096
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:28,960
That's a good name.

1097
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,040
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1098
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,540
Popular Christlike Dave.

1099
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,720
Popular Christlike Stang.

1100
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,380
And Popular Christlike Chaz.

1101
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,120
And, of course, Popular Christlike Wee, even though she's a female.

1102
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:43,240
Well, there was Popular Bull Girl Davina.

1103
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,320
Oh, Popular Bull Girl Davina?

1104
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:45,780
Yeah.

1105
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,460
Was she Christlike in her appearance?

1106
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,120
No, no.

1107
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:48,740
No, no.

1108
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,760
No, she was just popular.

1109
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,440
No, no, no.

1110
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:50,440


1111
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:50,440


1112
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:50,440


1113
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,380
Like a lonely traveler in the night.

1114
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:52,720
Yeah.

1115
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:52,900
Yeah.

1116
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,600
Well, okay.

1117
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,240
You know, that's what happens to some of them when they can't find that spot.

1118
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,340
You know?

1119
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:58,680
Yeah.

1120
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,420
When they can't reach down there far enough.

1121
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,360
That's me, man.

1122
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,100
Yeah, me too.

1123
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,020
We keep on looking for the itchy, slingy, ooze, squirt mechanism, and it doesn't ever shine.

1124
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,360
Speak for yourself, Dave.

1125
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,920
I am speaking for myself.

1126
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,000
All right.

1127
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,860
This is Provine Boy Dave.

1128
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,220
Hey, look.

1129
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,680
You say Yucca Teas, man.

1130
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,900
And you're just deluding yourself.

1131
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,800
And I say Yucca Teas?

1132
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,260
We're all...

1133
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:28,680
We're all lonesome, lonely stars in the night, lonely lights in the night.

1134
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,200
We're just...

1135
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,500
We come in alone.

1136
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,920
We go out alone.

1137
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,760
And you go out alone.

1138
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,460
Ships passing in the night, baby.

1139
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,040
That's right.

1140
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,320
You're putting your hair off in the middle.

1141
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:36,980
That's the bottom line.

1142
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,320
You come in alone, you go out alone.

1143
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,780
That's why you should spend the night with me, baby.

1144
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,680
You squirt sometimes.

1145
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,820
To make this loneliness end for just a little while, just you, me, and Bob.

1146
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,460
Come on.

1147
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:48,920
What do you say?

1148
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,440
Come on.

1149
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,720
Baby, baby.

1150
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,260
I'll be Christ-like just for a moment.

1151
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,440
But you haven't seen the other cages.

1152
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,540
Don't worry, Boris.

1153
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,140
We'll get to all of the cages eventually.

1154
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:04,020
But first, you must climb into and then escape the cage of B-B-Bob.

1155
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:11,300
Check out www.subgenius.com or write to me, Reverend Ivan Stang, at P.O.

1156
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:18,740
Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1157
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,420
I'm Bob.

1158
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1159
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1160
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1161
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1162
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1163
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1164
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1165
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1166
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1167
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1168
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1169
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1170
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1171
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1172
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1173
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1174
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1175
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1176
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1177
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1178
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,660
I'll see you next time.

1179
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,380
Bye.

1180
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,280
Bye.

1181
00:56:35,280 --> 00:57:05,280


1182
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:35,280


1183
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:42,960
Study more.

1184
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:52,100
It's a joke.

1185
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,740
Not bad, juju.

1186
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,260
Pretty fun.

1187
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:05,260


1188
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:10,440
Jonathan went into a manipulation. A man, a dummy, a wooden twilight zone.

1189
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,440
Very little guy.

1190
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,920
That's insider.

1191
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,380
Tush.

1192
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,060
The meat is actually not yet sold.

1193
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,540
To a foolhardy head.

1194
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,380
This program was made possible by the John Foundation.

1195
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,460
Bye, everybody.
