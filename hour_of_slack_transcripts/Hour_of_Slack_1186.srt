00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,100
The Owl of Slak

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,180
The Owl of Slak

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,600
The Owl of Slak

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,600
We're being attacked by flies!

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,520
It's hard to believe they were attacked by an owl!

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,400
The Owl of Slak

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,920
The Owl of Slak

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,200
The Craven Slak

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,920
Theì£ zo

10
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,540
The Ze algunac

11
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,340
The Zo

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,560
Theirs

13
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,460
Meet the math

14
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,380
Thed

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,700
Theod

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,600
Thud

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,940
those pops called lion baiters and back beaters.

18
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,180
Come on, quiet down, quiet down now.

19
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,580
Dr. Howell means no harm.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,900
I was only attempting to do my duty, son.

21
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,100
Someday you'll understand and do otherwise.

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,560
Nurses, nurses, doctors, please!

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,300
There's too much laughing and...

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,960
This is very embarrassing.

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,960
Sorry, Dr. Howell.

26
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,800
The auditorium isn't cleared right now.

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,880
Dr. Howell will have to take the entire hospital out

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,840
for breakfast this morning.

29
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,040
Or kill me.

30
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,660
You're on the air.

31
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,160
Oh, hi, Dr. Sinister.

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,220
Hello, Reverend Stang.

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,300
How are you?

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,620
Thanks for babysitting the show earlier.

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,080
Oh, that's what I do.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,100
That's part of my job description.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,640
You'll sit on the right-hand side of Bob for that, I'm sure.

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,860
And together you two can start World War III.

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:14,680
Yep.

40
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,520
Yep.

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,860
We're going to bomb Bernie's place first.

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,540
Not really, no.

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,420
I didn't really say that.

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,920
Now, I found out what it's like to be Jewish recently.

45
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,440
I was informed by a person

46
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,640
who's been postmorteming

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,620
on alt-slack

48
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,960
that I'm a satanic Masonic Jew.

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,300
Wow, that's...

50
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,140
It's very hard to pull off.

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,540
All three of those.

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,680
That's the trifecta, you know.

53
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,980
No, actually, it's not.

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,500
I mean, according to this guy,

55
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
pretty much they all go hand in hand.

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,580
And he had quoted

57
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,920
the lineup of Starwood workshop titles

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,240
as evidence of my satanic nature

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,400
because I, you know,

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,640
hunt and hunt.

61
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,220
I hang out with those neo-pagans.

62
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,200
Well, we all know that

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,420
anything other than the one true god of Abraham

64
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,380
is Satan.

65
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,140
Well, this guy accused me

66
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,720
and really, in a way,

67
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,300
the whole Church of the Subgenius

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,080
of only making fun of one religion.

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,660
Huh.

70
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,440
Which offended me.

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,160
Yeah, really.

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,740
I found that really offensive.

73
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,560
I actually got so tired

74
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,840
of making fun of Christians.

75
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,860
I mean, that's why everybody does that.

76
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,360
Yeah.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,960
So, I mean, you know,

78
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,800
that's sitcom stuff now.

79
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,040
So, I picked on New Agers

80
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,860
as much as I could for a long time

81
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,780
because they were the other group

82
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,600
that were in my face.

83
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,480
You know, we try to be

84
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,820
equal opportunity offenders.

85
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah.

86
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,000
And I, you know, it's true,

87
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,520
we haven't made that much fun of Islam

88
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,020
because they weren't really in our faces.

89
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,620
I guess if you're in the military,

90
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,300
they are now.

91
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,600
I don't know.

92
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,780
But they're not.

93
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,200
They're not.

94
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,200


95
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,200


96
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,200


97
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,320
You know, it's just a matter of time

98
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,320


99
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,340
And I think that's the problem.

100
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,400
And people misunderstand

101
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,020
the Church of the Subgenius sometimes.

102
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,620
They think it's a satire takeoff on kooks and so forth.

103
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,420
No, we're really kooks.

104
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,580
And it's like, oh, they think, well,

105
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,360
it's a takeoff on the conspiracy.

106
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,280
In fact, as I was up there running registration,

107
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,960
we were, somebody had kept calling, whining,

108
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,240
not to Hayes, but to Brushwood

109
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,020
about how they were a hardship case.

110
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,020
So, they should get in.

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,840
Yeah.

112
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,340
Cheap or free, because they were a hardship case,

113
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
because they spent their money on cigarettes or something.

114
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,780
And Princess Wee said, you know,

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,040
I think down there on the field,

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,400
we have 700 hardship cases.

117
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,660
And I said, yeah, man, money first.

118
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,080
Bulls can talk, but bills can walk.

119
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,260
And our friend, Bruce Flores, said, Stan,

120
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,500
you really are conspiracy, aren't you?

121
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,720
And I went, well, duh.

122
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,420
Yeah.

123
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:56,820
Yeah.

124
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:56,820


125
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:56,820


126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,740
But the conspiracy we're talking about is,

127
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,060
it may not be the one that you think we're talking about.

128
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,480
I wasn't, like Groucho Marx,

129
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,160
Briggs pointed out, there's some Groucho Marx movie

130
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,380
where first he's weedling and guilt tripping people

131
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,200
into giving him a big meal.

132
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,180
And then when he's finished with a meal,

133
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,000
they ask him for his help in return.

134
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,800
And he says, I feel differently now that I've eaten.

135
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
And it's, I think, it's a, I don't know, I don't know.

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,620
Funny how, you know, once, you're against,

137
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,120
you think that inheritance tax thing is all just terrible

138
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,540
until you are up for an inheritance.

139
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,660
It's funny how that works.

140
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,020
And, but really the point, our point about the conspiracy

141
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,940
is that we call the conspiracy them,

142
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,060
but it's worse incarnation as to us.

143
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,780
Because every time we say us, we're part of the conspiracy.

144
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,780
Conspiracy is what divides everybody up.

145
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,440
Every time you say something nasty and if it's uncalled for,

146
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,080
then you're part of the conspiracy.

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,480
Every time you're jealous,

148
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,860
there's the conspiracy inside you coming out.

149
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,840
But not every time you lie.

150
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,500
Sometimes it's okay to lie.

151
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,780
I have to confess, I've lied to a Jehovah's Witness.

152
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,360
They came to my door,

153
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,320
not too long ago, two very polite Jehovah's Witnesses.

154
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,560
And my policy is to be,

155
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,020
I know what it's like to be a religious nut.

156
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,520
Especially if you're in a cult

157
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,720
that expects the world to end all the time,

158
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,480
and it never does.

159
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,580
So I have a special place in my,

160
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,940
plus the illustrations are great.

161
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,020
And a lot of the subgenius graphics seen here

162
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,260
are stolen and tripped up from Jehovah's Witness books.

163
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,940
But,

164
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,960
these two nice Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door.

165
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,980
And I was polite to them and told them

166
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,840
I really admired their publishing empire.

167
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,560
That I was very familiar with their history.

168
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,100
And we were into Jehovah too.

169
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,180
And I basically was going, look, I'm busy.

170
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,420
I'm already saved.

171
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,760
I think they probably figured I was Jewish or something.

172
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,420
But I said,

173
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,720
as they were about to leave, I said,

174
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,760
hey, look, I'm for any religion that doesn't, you know,

175
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,820
doesn't want to kill everybody.

176
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,240
And they actually high-fived me at that.

177
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,840
But friends, that was a lie.

178
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,800
Because I'm actually part of one of the very few religions

179
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,080
that really does want to kill just about everybody.

180
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,440
It's worked into Bob's prophecy on X-Day, July 5th, 1998.

181
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,300
Whenever that day finally truly comes.

182
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,340
And the calendars can be reset properly.

183
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,620
The aliens from Planet X,

184
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,060
will come and destroy everyone

185
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,400
except the dues-paying subgenius ministers.

186
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,720
In fact, I'll let the subgeniuses fly spaceships around

187
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,080
and destroy everybody they didn't like.

188
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,580
Which is what we mean by the conspiracy.

189
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,500
But, you know, so it's true.

190
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,600
I did lie to a Jehovah's Witness.

191
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,320
But the bright side of that is,

192
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,100
every time you lie to a Jehovah's Witness,

193
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,200
Bob has a little orgasm.

194
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,120
It's an orgasm.

195
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,720
Isn't that sweet?

196
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,940
Let's take another collar for Ollie's work.

197
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,640
Another one that'll be nice.

198
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,760
Do you guys by any chance know what a G-O-L-E-M is or was?

199
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,660
A Golem.

200
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,700
A Golem.

201
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,180
A Golem.

202
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,320
Does anybody there happen to know?

203
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,300
It's a stone or wood or some kind of statue.

204
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,360
It's actually kind of like a fetish of sorts.

205
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,340
It's supposedly reanimated or animated by infusing it

206
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,320
with a soul in some kind of Kabbalistic ritual?

207
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,660
Yeah, you have to write the name of God on a little piece of paper

208
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,260
and put it in its head along with its instructions.

209
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
If you look up Golem on Google,

210
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,160
on the second page there's a movie you can see.

211
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,820
This thing was released in 1921,

212
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,660
and it's actually almost two hours long.

213
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
So this was an epic novel at that time.

214
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,280
Yeah, The Golem, it's a classic silent film.

215
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,780
Charles Laughton played the role.

216
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,220
If I wasn't so tired, I could tell you who directed it and started it.

217
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,120
It was a snow golem.

218
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,840
Wasn't Charles Laughton in it?

219
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,980
What really gets me is they called him Joseph.

220
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,060
I mean, gosh.

221
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,480
No, a golem is specifically from Jewish folklore,

222
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,900
except that there really are such things.

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,020
They always hide it under funny fairy tale stories.

224
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,200
Yeah, Joseph was real.

225
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,920
I agree.

226
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,520
He's God of Abraham, you know.

227
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,100
He was real.

228
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
By the way, Abraham...

229
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:52,700
What?

230
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:52,960
What?

231
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,080
What?

232
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


233
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


234
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


235
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


236
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


237
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


238
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


239
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,260


240
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
He believes in God.

241
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,340
He believes in Jehovah One.

242
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,180
Jehovah One.

243
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,160
That stuff's all made up.

244
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,340
That's a fairy story for dumbasses, man.

245
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,660
It's an excellent movie.

246
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,760
It's got some definitely...

247
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,180
The movie was good.

248
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm almost ready to believe it was the Israelis that made this movie

249
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,520
because the way it's brought across.

250
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,180
Because even though it shows two separate rabbis,

251
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,620
there actually was a rabbi by the name of Ryan Lyon.

252
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:22,720
Ryan.

253
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,220
Are you to low?

254
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,880
Now, you're starting to sound like Bernie.

255
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,000
You're starting to drift,

256
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,060
and you're pasting things together randomly.

257
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,100
I watched the movie.

258
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,220
That was one of the funniest looking monsters I've ever seen.

259
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,700
He had a Moe Howard haircut.

260
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,740
It's not animated.

261
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,040
If you had your own golem, man, what would you make it do?

262
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,040
What would you get it to do for you if you had a golem?

263
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,020
It's worth watching.

264
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,740
If you had a golem, man.

265
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,300
They have two separate rabbis in there,

266
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,580
but when I started doing a background check on the movie,

267
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,100
and the people in it and the names in it,

268
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,880
come to find out there was a rabbi, John, I mean, Udalo.

269
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,500
If Dr. Howell was in the room, he'd be able to tell us who directed it, who starred in it.

270
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,640
In English, it means lion, lion.

271
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,800
And what kind of clay they used to cover the actor.

272
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,660
What means lion, lion?

273
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,880
Udalo.

274
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,840
It's Udalo.

275
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,360
Because, yeah, I mean, you know, the power of Alpha is multiple.

276
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,180
It depends on what part of the country you live in.

277
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,920
It depends on how you pronounce Elf.

278
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,120
LÃ¶wenbrot, that's lion's brew.

279
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,000
And you guys might find that movie extremely interesting.

280
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,760
I know I did.

281
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,400
I've seen it.

282
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,240
That's what I keep trying to tell you.

283
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,600
God, it's funny.

284
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,420
They just don't.

285
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,140
They have something to say, but they can't.

286
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,300
Bang always complains about his hearing,

287
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,980
and yet I've just listened to three people in a row who had no hearing whatsoever in their ears.

288
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,460
It's more important to get the message across than that they.

289
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,000
And speaking of messages.

290
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,520
They just need to get across.

291
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,660
I've seen it.

292
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,540
That's what I keep trying to tell you.

293
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,840
It's funny.

294
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,020
They just don't.

295
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,500
They have something to say, but they can't.

296
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,580
Bang always complains about his hearing,

297
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,240
and yet I've just listened to three people in a row who had no hearing whatsoever in their ears.

298
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,400
So is this one of those turn your radio down things?

299
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,320
No, I think we were hearing some sort of alternate timeline.

300
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,080
Well, yeah.

301
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,120
I mean, that's one of the magical things about the radio and the delay is it allows you to peer into,

302
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,280
you know, other points in the time stream as if they were happening right now.

303
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,820
If only we had a sort of a reverse delay so we could hear what we were going to say.

304
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,740
We'd probably be a lot funnier.

305
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,080
You mean not to say it?

306
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,560
You're not hearing that?

307
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,340
Go to the headphone thing to change the channel, dude.

308
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

309
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,720
That's the blue switch on the bottom.

310
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,240
How far ahead is it?

311
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,500
Like seven seconds?

312
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,380
Yeah.

313
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,360
Which is actually one second longer than the normal delay.

314
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,980
Well, it seems like it would be distracting, though,

315
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,880
to hear what you're going to say in seven seconds and trying to keep up with it and say it at the same time.

316
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, you know, as we like to say about WCSB here.

317
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,160
This is not mono.

318
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,800
This is not stereo.

319
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,780
This is for folks with more than two ears.

320
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,360
Who directed and starred in...

321
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,020
In the 1921 Gollum movie.

322
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,740
That was Paul Wegener.

323
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,900
Paul Wegener.

324
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,600
That's right.

325
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
It was on the tip of my tongue.

326
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,580
Paul Wegener.

327
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,040
Rabbi Lowe had anything to do with Lowe's hardware stores or with Nick Lowe.

328
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,780
Of course, the connections are obvious.

329
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,400
The conspiracy hides its top secrets right out in the open where everybody can see them.

330
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,820
And Frosty the Snowman's real name was Frosty Finkelstein.

331
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,360
Frosty the Snowman?

332
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,360


333
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,360


334
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,360


335
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,360


336
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,360


337
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,260
Snowman is a code for cocaine.

338
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,160
Frosty the Doop Man.

339
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,420
Are you going to run the pre-lay again so we can hear what we're going to say?

340
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:08,840
The drug user likes to refer to his drug by a cute name like snow or for cocaine or grass.

341
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,160
How many times do you need to get hung up on before you get the message you ask?

342
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,080
It's just terminology, man.

343
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,080
Dr. Sinister got an award for hanging up on that guy.

344
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,640
That's...

345
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,360
I don't know.

346
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:20,900
Just, uh...

347
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,800
Thank you.

348
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,020
Because he's done it so many times.

349
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,020
I'd like to thank all the crazy callers.

350
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,140
Yeah, Dr. Sinister...

351
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,860
All the little people without whom I couldn't have done it.

352
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,540
No kidding.

353
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,800
I'd like to thank the academy.

354
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,860
I understand you have caller ID there.

355
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,420
Uh, well...

356
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,860
All I told you, Mark, is that I have...

357
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,260
I know everything.

358
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,680
That's all I can tell you.

359
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,240
So, why don't we...

360
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,960
Why don't we call this guy back and make his life interesting?

361
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,680
That sucks.

362
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,960
Well, not every number that people call from actually appears on the caller ID.

363
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:57,080
Now, sometimes on the Puzzling Evidence Show, they've been known to call the callers rather than wait for callers.

364
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,180
Well, yeah, if we were...

365
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,600
I used to get awakened at six in the morning by the Puzzling Evidence Show.

366
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:09,020
Yeah, if I were going to have, like, a very specific appointment, a very special guest on the program,

367
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,140
certainly I'd probably arrange to call out to them or something.

368
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
But, uh, let's take one more caller here.

369
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,000
I love preaching to the unsaved, but I'm not going to try to give you...

370
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,040
It's Subgenius 101.

371
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,480
I'll just kind of spread that in context.

372
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,600
Bob is, of course, the guy with the pipe.

373
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,040
I'm not Bob.

374
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,760
It's not...

375
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,760
He's not the alter ego of any subgenius preacher.

376
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,020
It's just that every time he tries to get up in public, somebody tries to kill him.

377
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:46,940
As he instructed us to, he told us to hate him and free ourselves from his hypnotic trance power over us.

378
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,000
And we do to flee every year.

379
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,900
We burn his...

380
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,900
image right here at Brushwood, just like he told us to.

381
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,600
We hate him and rebel against him on a yearly basis, just like he said.

382
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,940
So, we're like any other religion in that respect.

383
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,560
A lot of subgeniuses get into the inside jokes before they really have picked up on the outer joke,

384
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,580
which is them, actually.

385
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,100
You know, if you were thinking you knew the outside joke,

386
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,980
that it was a takeoff on...

387
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,900
silly religious beliefs or something.

388
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,460
No, it's a takeoff on you!

389
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,960
And me, and all of us bipedal, upright tool users.

390
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,220
But, nonetheless, despite any possible flaw of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

391
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,960
such as the fact that he is, after all, a mind-controlled death cult leader who'll take all your money,

392
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,920
he...

393
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,680
Bob is, like, replaces the drug.

394
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,140
And that's because if you really meditate on that face,

395
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,200
and just looking at the dots on his face,

396
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,640
if you're doing it right, it eats up as many brain cells as...

397
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,180
that it might as well be, just like using the drugs.

398
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,120
So, he can free you from that, friends.

399
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,420
At the same time,

400
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,080
let's face it, the Church of the Subgenius is like the Chinese finger trap of the mind.

401
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,680
We get people to get stuck in it, and...

402
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,640
some of them actually go insane from it.

403
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,480
And there are several examples of that.

404
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,820
Then, we charge them for the cure.

405
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:28,860
Yeah!

406
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,880
The insanity's pretty cheap.

407
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,460
You can become a minister for only 30 bucks.

408
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,420
I think Al-Qaeda's 35.

409
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,780
What are you doing?

410
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Hello, you're on the air.

411
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,440
Hey, Doc, how you doing? Buddha here.

412
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,060
Welcome to the program, Buddha.

413
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,660
And, you know, we will be wrapping up the talk portion here in a few minutes, so...

414
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Oh, okay, I'll make it short. Just...

415
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,460
Talk is cheap.

416
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,860
I was listening to you guys talking, and you mentioned the Golo movie.

417
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,800
And I remember seeing one movie, and it's a classic, and I forget the name right now.

418
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,440
Basically, it was about a woman who wanted to free, like, the...

419
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,760
what do we call them, the proles?

420
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,800
A woman who wanted to free the proles.

421
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,760
I believe you may be thinking of Metropolis.

422
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,100
Metropolis, yeah.

423
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,400
Yeah, that's an obscure little thing.

424
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,140
That's Metropolis.

425
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,020
Yeah, it's one of the only tiny movies.

426
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,940
I thought it was, like, a...

427
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,400
Fritz Lang directed that.

428
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,240
Dude, that's, like, one of the most influential films of all time. That's...

429
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,440
It's about the city of the future.

430
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,080
When I first heard about it, I was kind of like, eh, okay, I saw it. My God, that is an intense movie.

431
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,720
Yeah, that's pretty good.

432
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,540
It is. I just watched it, like...

433
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:34,820
Sure it is.

434
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,440
I just sat there after I watched it, and went like, whoa!

435
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,680
Yeah.

436
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,240
I got to watch old Fritz Lang talk about that movie one time.

437
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,460
You did?

438
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,220
Yes, I did. I'm that old.

439
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,760
What did he have to say? What did he say about it?

440
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,540
Uh...

441
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,260
He...

442
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,760
The same thing this guy just said. He was trying to remember the name of it, and it was about some woman trying to free the proles.

443
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:53,940
Yes, yes.

444
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,680
But she wasn't really a woman. She was a cleverly designed robot.

445
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:06,280
Well, not exactly. She was a woman, but they built a cleverly designed robot to replace the famous Maria.

446
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,720
And that was the false Maria.

447
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,480
That was one hot robot.

448
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:17,760
Yeah, she does a dance showing her robot to the tuxedo-wearing aristocrats, and they really get...

449
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,580
They get out of control there.

450
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,800
Did you ever interview Lenny Weifelstahl?

451
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,980
I thought you did.

452
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,940
We ripped off quite a bit of footage from that thing for our Arise movie.

453
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey, Buddha, by the way, I'm glad to hear you're not...

454
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,680
Oh, if you'd like to make a call...

455
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,600
He was having a slight problem over the last few weeks. We finally got him the zombie vaccine.

456
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,500
He was turning into a zombie.

457
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:47,520
Fritz Lang also made Fury. Ever seen that one? With the horrible lynch mob and the worst, most evil person in the world?

458
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:47,680
No, no, no.

459
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,060
With the worst, most evil person in it being Bruce Cabot, the hero of King Kong?

460
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,120
You want to know how good I am? Watch me hang up on the nappy collar before you even get some word out.

461
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,400
That's a good one. They try to roast Spencer Tracy alive.

462
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,060
I just did it.

463
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:07,780
Then also, there's also Hangmen Also Die, which is about the Nazis. And it's a really cool Fritz Lang film.

464
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,620
Yeah, his movie, sure. They're all good. I like them. Ever see M?

465
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Dial M for Murder?

466
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,320
No, no. M with Peter Lorre about the...

467
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,600
Dial M for Murder? You need to repeat that?

468
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:26,040
Oh, that's a pathetic little child molester, child killer. They want to kill me, so I have to kill them first.

469
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,780
That's very angry.

470
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,900
Maybe it was the hand. The hand did it. It was the hand.

471
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:41,740
Well, there is a movie with Peter Lorre looking Popeye as a severed hand dances around and plays an arrangement for the left hand on the piano keys.

472
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,820
One of many of the strangest subgenre of movies of the severed hand genre.

473
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,400
Oliver Stone got his start with those.

474
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,980
With Michael Caine's,

475
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,700
My Bloody Hand!

476
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:01,660
But then before that there was The Hands of Orlac, The Beast with Five Fingers.

477
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,500
That was the Peter Lorre one.

478
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,760
Yeah, that's the one where a hand, a crawling hand, torments Peter Lorre.

479
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,540
And there was that hand that climbed through the dust to inject teenagers with alcohol in the 1950s.

480
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,400
In Invasion of the Saucermen.

481
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,880
The hydrocephalonic Martians had hands with eyeballs conveniently located in the back of the wrist

482
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:29,700
that would climb through the brush, slit the tires on their hot rods, and inject teenagers with alcohol.

483
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:41,560
But my favorite part of the social activity of the church is the news group on the internet called Alt.slap.

484
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,520
Which used to be sort of more like a news group.

485
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:44,520


486
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,240
It was more secret, but now you can get to it with Google groups.

487
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,480
And as Princess We Are Dope, Queen of All the UFOs said,

488
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,600
Alt.slap is the most anti-social social activity I can think of.

489
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,660
And every news group has horrible flame wars now and then.

490
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,220
That's all alt.slap is.

491
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,460
And we have some, oh god, there are some really good writers on there.

492
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,520
And at the same time, we have some really good writers on there.

493
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:22,280
And at the same time, and it's flypaper for very good humorous type writers and for kooks.

494
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,720
It's the great kook flypaper.

495
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:31,580
In fact, I think that the feds, whichever one you are, hi, who follow us, they know all.

496
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,100
I should have known.

497
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:44,100
They don't, I think they don't worry so much about us because we're not trying to, we're waiting for the aliens to kill everybody for us.

498
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,780
Right? We make a big deal out of that.

499
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,520
Don't kill somebody just because you think they're pink conspiracy people.

500
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,620
They may be subgeniuses in disguise.

501
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,220
Only Bob and the aliens can tell that.

502
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:04,160
But, at the same time, we can certainly attract, how shall I say it, the differently sang.

503
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,480
Far be it from us to call somebody else crazy.

504
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,960
You know, so we have these other terms that are,

505
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:23,700
one person said, the church is to crazy people making asses of themselves what bug zappers are to bugs.

506
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,600
What matadors are to bulls.

507
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,720
What Lucy Van Pelt with her football is to Charlie Brown.

508
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,620
And we attract such kooks.

509
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,480
Oh, man.

510
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,440
There, I have been accused so many times of,

511
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:42,700
of,

512
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,180
of being, how do they put it,

513
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,920
of,

514
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,600
satanic, masonic, Jewish.

515
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,640
Normally those don't all run together, although my next door neighbor said,

516
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,700
hey, I'm a masonic,

517
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,320
satanic,

518
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,720
Jew.

519
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,300
And that's the other thing he's throwing in.

520
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,540
And he was gay too.

521
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:06,820
But,

522
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,240
I've learned from studying kooks that everything,

523
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,900
proves that everything is a satanic, masonic Jew.

524
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,640
That's what they ultimately, most of those crackpots come down to.

525
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,660
And I do not know what their hang up is.

526
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,220
I'll never figure that out.

527
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,740
But we do know this.

528
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,760
Their hot button is our trampoline.

529
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,420
We like to find the hot button of,

530
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,320
if somebody's got a bee in their bonnet about something,

531
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,220
I don't care if it's unions being good or unions being bad.

532
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,340
Or who killed JFK.

533
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,600
Or whether they moved the flying saucer from Roswell to Area 51 or what.

534
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,080
You know.

535
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,000
Uh,

536
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,320
they're, we, if they have,

537
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,240
we're able to figure out their hot button.

538
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,480
We'll jump up and down on it until they either go away,

539
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,840
or like me, build a really thick shell.

540
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,840
Uh,

541
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,560
it's, although even I can get,

542
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:05,940
uh,

543
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:07,980
upset.

544
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,780
Some of these people, Princess Wee said,

545
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,960
you have to put on the kid gloves for these people.

546
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,200
With kid gloves!

547
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,900
They're that far gone.

548
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,580
And, uh,

549
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,820
You know, speaking of obscenity,

550
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,800
it was the one year anniversary of the Magdalene Court decision.

551
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,500
I guess, by the way, we have some news, uh, about Magdalene for the first time.

552
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,720
And I'll make this real short.

553
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,920
The whole family is together again in a town in Georgia I shall not name.

554
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,760
The, the young boy, Conrad,

555
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,020
John Boe, is, uh, happy to be, quote,

556
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,400
back to normal, unquote.

557
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,020
We learned that the biological, uh, insane criminal father

558
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,580
only served one month of time.

559
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
But the bottom line is,

560
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,160
there is a joint custody,

561
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,100
but residential custody is in the hands of Magdalene.

562
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,540
And she can let the dad see the kid whenever she wants to,

563
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,920
which won't be anytime soon.

564
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,400
So, uh,

565
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,380
and,

566
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,500
. . .

567
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,900
I think you kind of just mentioned something you said you weren't going to mention.

568
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,500
Uh, well, I just came back from Ex Day.

569
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,980
And they took more than just a few joints of, uh, my toe joint,

570
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,060
my big toe joint was taken, ruptured,

571
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,680
and, uh, several more brain cells.

572
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,040
That happens every time.

573
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,700
Nothing to brag about.

574
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,580
No, I'm not bragging.

575
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,160
I think I hit the dump button in time.

576
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,880
The dump button?

577
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,620
Yes.

578
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,560
The dump button.

579
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,840
Yeah, see, I'm up here.

580
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,780
Oh, oh, my.

581
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,740
I didn't want to make it too easy for you, but, uh,

582
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,140
I don't know.

583
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,940
I mean, if you have to do a little bit of homework,

584
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,020
the kooks aren't going to, that baffles them.

585
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,580
Why aren't you . . .

586
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,680
If you just flat out lay it out in front of them,

587
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,380
sure, they'll do their stalking.

588
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,980
Well, I heard something, Mark.

589
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,440
You heard something, too, right?

590
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,020
But if they have to read the instructions, they're not going to, uh,

591
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,560
they're not going to be, they'll just drop the ball.

592
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,320
Insert tab A into slot B.

593
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:07,960
If they even had one to be in there.

594
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:07,960


595
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,000
That's a little bit too much.

596
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,720
That's a little pornographic thing to do.

597
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:10,720


598
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:10,720


599
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:10,720


600
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:10,720


601
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:10,720


602
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,960
If they're that kind of language, I'm sorry.

603
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,880
And we may . . .

604
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,620
You still say in different languages . . .

605
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,260
But then again, what we error by definition is not obscenity.

606
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,480
Those are the kind of instructions that people don't really . . .

607
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,060
That's a little bit too much, too much verbiage for people to go with.

608
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,120
Products are sold to be used by trial and error.

609
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,840
Anything to avoid reading the instructions.

610
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,540
I have, that's one of my pet peeves.

611
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
I have a thing about that.

612
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,320
To read . . .

613
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,660
You got pet peeves?

614
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,560
. . .

615
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,240
You have to tune the plate to remove settings.

616
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,200
Place aside.

617
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,040
I just talk of inserting tabs.

618
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,260
My goodness, can't you just clean this right up?

619
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,380
See, they're thinking, there's something dirty about reading instructions.

620
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,300
You have to be shown how to do things by somebody else.

621
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,460
Lift protective plate and set aside to dry.

622
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,960
Reading the instructions, that's cheating.

623
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,640
Right.

624
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,540
Now, unscrew the detonator cap slowly and carefully without touching the edges.

625
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,720
Reading the instructions is for people who don't have a computer.

626
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


627
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


628
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


629
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


630
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


631
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


632
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


633
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


634
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


635
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:19,600
You should now be looking at the impacted mass of the plastic explosive.

636
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,620
Once you have a college degree, that means you should already know everything and you

637
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,820
really don't need to, you know.

638
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,180
The wire leading away from you is the lead wire.

639
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,080
The yellow wire leading out of the tube is the ground wire.

640
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,300
Oh my God, I can't remember.

641
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,700
Is it supposed to be the ground wire?

642
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


643
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


644
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


645
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


646
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


647
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


648
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


649
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


650
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


651
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


652
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


653
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


654
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


655
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


656
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


657
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


658
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


659
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


660
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


661
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:40,700


662
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,540
The green wire or the black wire?

663
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Take it easy, Sarge.

664
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,560
We'll get it figured out.

665
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:43,740
Hey, look.

666
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,700
You're packing.

667
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,320
You're protected.

668
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,800
There's nothing unless it's got more than three kilotons.

669
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,280
We're fine.

670
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,760
Just keep poking around until you find it.

671
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,880
Yeah, yeah.

672
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,540
One more poke.

673
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,340
No, stop moving your hips that way.

674
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,120
You're making me nervous.

675
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,640
No, they're looking at us now.

676
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,940
All right, call this off.

677
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,720
We got to get out of here.

678
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,740
Stang was trying to hump the bomb.

679
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,660
I am unscrewing the butt plate.

680
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,520
Why?

681
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,680
Oh, water.

682
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,960
Someone set us up the bomb.

683
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,420
Why?

684
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,100
Oh, water.

685
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,520
I'm trying to get out of here.

686
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:10,520


687
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,480
I have a question.

688
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,340
Why did the husband get out of jail so quickly?

689
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,560
And why was he in jail to begin with?

690
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,680
Not the husband, the sperm donor.

691
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:30,680
He was in jail for drunk driving on a school day and injuring people and fleeing the scene

692
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,820
and wrecking property and lying to the judges.

693
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,280
Not being a good citizen.

694
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,600
Right.

695
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,040
But he was out after a month probably because...

696
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,500
Yeah.

697
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,940
Well, he's a good old boy.

698
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:42,860
Right.

699
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,920
He was a good old boy.

700
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,340
He was a good Christian boy.

701
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,080
He said a lot many, many times over and over again.

702
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,460
Christianity is the last refuge of the scoundrel.

703
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,000
Cultists are going to tell them what to do.

704
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,760
I've learned that the biological husband had been sending rants, written rants that

705
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:10,500
he composed to the judge informing him that myself and Bevilacqua were part of the mass

706
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:10,500


707
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:10,500


708
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:10,500


709
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:10,500


710
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:10,500


711
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:10,720
of the Jewish community.

712
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:10,720


713
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,060
I've learned that the Jewish community is a Masonic, Satanic Jewish conspiracy.

714
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,780
As you know, we have good old solid Jewish names.

715
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,720
Bevilacqua and Smith.

716
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,300
That's my slave name.

717
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,260
Agent Smith.

718
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,200
Yeah, it's funny.

719
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,860
Wait, people who were named Smith are really Jewish?

720
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,160
My God, the conspiracy goes farther than I thought.

721
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,360
No, people were named Smith or Agent from the Matrix.

722
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,620
We're going to take the name X.

723
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,480
What we have learned from studying crackpotism, especially on alt.slack is that the name

724
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,480


725
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,480


726
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,480


727
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,480


728
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,480


729
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,480


730
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,480


731
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:51,040
X is a Masonic, Satanic Jewish conspiracy, including Communist China.

732
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:51,980
Yes.

733
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,700
That's an entirely Masonic plot.

734
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,600
Communism was invented by Jews.

735
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,100
A Jewish fellow came up with the idea and wrote it out.

736
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,620
Named Mao Tse-Tung-Ski.

737
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,060
Right, right, yeah.

738
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,580
But where did it leave Jack P. Chick?

739
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,460
He said that the K-12 was the only way to get out of communism.

740
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460


741
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460


742
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460


743
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460


744
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460


745
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460


746
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460


747
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460


748
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460


749
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,060
The Catholics have a secret file on the Protestants.

750
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,900
Well, it's true.

751
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,780
The Catholics...

752
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,940
Well, the Catholic Church is a Jewish plot.

753
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,340
Yeah, you know, St. Peter, man, he was...

754
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:21,360
Everything.

755
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,980
I'm telling you, everything proves that everything is a Jewish plot if you're of that ilk of

756
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,480
scientists that studies history on the Internet.

757
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,240
Study.

758
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,120
Do your homework.

759
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,820
My God, I just realized something.

760
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
It all makes sense now.

761
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,380
Jesus was Jewish.

762
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,880
Christianity is a Jewish...

763
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,300
Right!

764
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,100
Duh!

765
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,460
Oh, yeah.

766
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,960
That's what they tell you right after Mass when they're delivering the sermon.

767
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,120
They say, don't forget Jesus' family.

768
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,880
But they never mention him personally because apparently he's one of those guys who didn't

769
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,040
have a family.

770
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,480
He was a rambling man.

771
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,380
That ain't true.

772
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:01,660
My favorite recent Jewish conspiracy theory is that Hinduism is in fact a Jewish plot.

773
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,420
Yes.

774
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,700
And I'm not...

775
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,860
By the way, I'm not making a funny joke.

776
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,460
This cow's not kosher.

777
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,340
We can't kill it.

778
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,720
No, we can't kill any cows.

779
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,020
No.

780
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,180
No, that doesn't make sense.

781
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,200
Hold on just a minute.

782
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,860
Something's happened.

783
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,340
Good morning.

784
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,340
I don't know.

785
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,320
We can't find out.

786
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,740
Good morning.

787
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,060
We just got here.

788
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,000
We haven't woken up yet.

789
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,380
This is terrible.

790
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,320
I wish we could just go back to the way it was only a minute ago.

791
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Can we just be placing the carpet in there?

792
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,860
Oh, if only I hadn't voted for the president.

793
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,060
If only I had voted for some other president.

794
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,200
This might have happened a minute later instead of a minute before.

795
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,800
Or to some other generation.

796
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,460
Yeah, well, not us.

797
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,000
Not me.

798
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,680
Not me.

799
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,380
Not you.

800
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:40,460
Not you.

801
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,460


802
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,460


803
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,460


804
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,460


805
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,460


806
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,460


807
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,460


808
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,460


809
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,700
Not you, Jane.

810
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,180
Not me.

811
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,860
No, it wasn't my fault, they all said, as they fell in the middle of the...

812
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,620
Not you, Jane.

813
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,280
Not you.

814
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,540
...to Adam.

815
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,000
...to Adam.

816
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,700
...to Adam.

817
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,340
Stop it.

818
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,480
I can only tell you...

819
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:51,480


820
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,120
...the sound of the next one.

821
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,580
Oh, right.

822
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,840
Okay.

823
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,300
Just give me another cup of rubber cement and I'll get started here on the 18th floor.

824
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,440
This time you promised, you promised I could have...

825
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,740
A check.

826
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,960
...a chapter.

827
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,120
Oh, a chapter.

828
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:04,340
Right.

829
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,580
I'm sorry.

830
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:04,860
A chapter.

831
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,460
Not a check.

832
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:05,860
A chapter.

833
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,100
Yeah.

834
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:09,900
Thank you.

835
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,960
Now, if you don't have any money, it makes the church stop.

836
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,220
Hi, this is the sperms.

837
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,680
Don't worry about us, there are billions and billions of us and we'll bury you.

838
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,080
Those were the subgenius sperms.

839
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,560
Those are the happy little ones that stay alive even though they're in the sea.

840
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,840
They're doing their little rifle exercises.

841
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,060
These guys are motivated.

842
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,720
All those were spurious sperms.

843
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,760
You could call them spermatozoon fatuus or fatuus.

844
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,760
You could, but it takes too long to say that.

845
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,080
It's really hard to say that.

846
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,080


847
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,080


848
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,080


849
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,080


850
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,080


851
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,080


852
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,620
When we have to call up the sperm reserves, we have to get them out there right away.

853
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,940
We can't have long names and long-winded stuffed shirt titles.

854
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,660
Okay, okay.

855
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,740
Our first song tonight is called Poster of Dobbs.

856
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,880
It's a song we wrote when we were on vacation in Jamaica.

857
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,360
And Paul's going to sing this one for you.

858
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,220
I am not.

859
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,820
Well, okay, that's all.

860
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,060
I want time and a half.

861
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,100
It's the middle of the night, in case you haven't noticed.

862
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,780
Time and a half.

863
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,680
And travel time.

864
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,680
No, for anti-musicians, it's only like 10.30 in the morning.

865
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,360
Well, I'm trying to emerge from a cocoon of nearing social morgues.

866
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,080
Ah, yes, yes.

867
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,120
Aren't we all?

868
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,760
Well, that's good.

869
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,920
But I wanted to come and talk about it with you.

870
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,260
Because you're doctors.

871
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,040
Well, just sit down right here and open up your very soul and every other barrier.

872
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,020
I didn't realize that I had a problem with the first step to solving it.

873
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,420
And then someone told me about you, and so here I am.

874
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,740
I'm going to climb down inside the show here.

875
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,500
But wait, I...

876
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,360
What are you going to do?

877
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:25,800
Hey, wait.

878
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,620
How?

879
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,400
Hey, Gary.

880
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,580
But you're a doctor, too.

881
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,640
I think I see a checkup in here.

882
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,340
Okay, well, just try to...

883
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,960
Take these forceps and see if you can pull them out of the body.

884
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,860
Here we go.

885
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,260
Watch these.

886
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,660
Watch these guys.

887
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,620
Okay.

888
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:37,620
Disgusting.

889
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,280
Wait, there's no signature on this check.

890
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,840
We just killed another innocent...

891
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,560
I wonder about where medical science is leading to.

892
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,900
And you're about to ask these guys for advice.

893
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,200
Let him go now.

894
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,760
Drop it.

895
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,620
Drop it on the floor now.

896
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,420
Drop the weapon.

897
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:51,860
Sorry?

898
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:52,600
What do you want?

899
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,180
I just want my phone call.

900
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,140
What?

901
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,420
What?

902
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,340
What's happening?

903
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,280
Guys, the way you guys go on...

904
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,420
I don't know what to think.

905
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,560
What has made us...

906
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:08,720
Radio?

907
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,020
...but still fly.

908
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,720
What do you mean?

909
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,380
You didn't turn yours on, I think.

910
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,280
In fact, ask your nearest doctor.

911
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,720
Turned on?

912
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,260
Today.

913
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,300
No, I...

914
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:16,900
Individually.

915
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,120
This shows...

916
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,860
This shows, like, what they...

917
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,320
You know, it's the opposite of a turn-on.

918
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,980
Oh, that's why you're listening.

919
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,840
Hello?

920
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,740
Hello?

921
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,180
We're not being heard.

922
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,840
We're holding this position until dawn.

923
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,420
That's one of the most obscene and consorted...

924
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,500
I mean, contorted positions I've ever seen, Jerry, but...

925
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:34,660
Hey!

926
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,120
Hey.

927
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,000
...at least yesterday, we're looking for an ambulance.

928
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,760
Oh, yeah.

929
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,340
Oh, yeah.

930
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, yeah.

931
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,420
Oh, yeah.

932
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,200
Let's try again.

933
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,000
What do you have?

934
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,500
If you hang up on me again, your body will self-perpetuate in shopping malls forever and ever.

935
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,100
We are isolated from your curses.

936
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,680
Yeah, that's right.

937
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,040
Look at her.

938
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,700
She's crawling around inside the show.

939
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,180
But they've done a wonderful job.

940
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,760
It looks like...

941
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,020
Drag it over here.

942
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,200
It looks like it's dead.

943
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,820
But the blood in his eyes is colliding in here.

944
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,980
Push the face with a sort of a smile.

945
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,300
Put some headphones on it.

946
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,220
I've heard enough.

947
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:05,880
Yes.

948
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,700
Surge is an alert.

949
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,440
Oh, and we start the war over again.

950
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,380
Okay, we'd like to go slow motion over these frames.

951
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,460
Look at those beautiful explosions.

952
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:14,940
They cover immediately.

953
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,900
As we talk about once again, the slow motion reap reaction.

954
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,580
Now, what we'd like to see...

955
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,920
Don't look at the slow motion flash or you'll go blind in slow motion.

956
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,960
...of origin of projectile somewhere in Central Bolivia, South America.

957
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,540
This is not...

958
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,120
The St. Jesus Church recommends that you always wear an eye patch so that just in case,

959
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,280
you're going to die.

960
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,280


961
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,520
You are looking in the direction of the flash.

962
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,920
Only one eye.

963
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,520
Where will I go?

964
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,560
Only one eye.

965
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,320
One eye.

966
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,160
Say one eye.

967
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,380
Oh, come on.

968
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,220
Stop all this.

969
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,600
Stop the doctors.

970
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,340
Yes, and too many doctors.

971
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,900
Constantly here.

972
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,140
At this hour.

973
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,360
As we stand up and hear it.

974
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,980
Watch the last of the so genius troops fighting against the puzzling evidence forces in the desert.

975
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,700
And back there you can see puzzling evidence.

976
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:09,980
I'm John here.

977
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,140
Command center.

978
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,740
Puzzling evidence forces are about a mile from your house.

979
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,660
Might as well just give up.

980
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,760
Let's see what Sandy tried to get through.

981
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,000
It's a sniper.

982
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,780
Who's that sniper?

983
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,260
Is that Hagen?

984
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,440
No.

985
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,700
It's Buck.

986
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:42,700
I'm just going to have to insert into the record here that in 1980, the tomb of the Jesus family was unearthed.

987
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:53,960
The DNA of Jesus, Magdalene, his father Joseph, and the son of Jesus and Magdalene, who isn't in the Bible, named Judah, were all found in their family tomb.

988
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,200
Although it was sealed recently by the state of Israel.

989
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,460
Although it was kind of a hoax.

990
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,320
No, it was not a hoax.

991
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,720
No, it was not.

992
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,200
It was a hoax.

993
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,940
It was a hoax.

994
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,280
It was a hoax.

995
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,280


996
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,280


997
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,280


998
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,280


999
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,280


1000
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,280


1001
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,280


1002
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,280


1003
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,280


1004
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,180
It was turning out that they were not in the material world.

1005
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,460
They were going to be buried in osmanthus ï¿½ardia.

1006
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:10,680
That's

1007
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,580
somehow

1008
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:11,580


1009
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,200
.

1010
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,500
I was

1011
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,300
.

1012
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,260
That's

1013
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,320
oldest Christian writings

1014
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,180
were the epistles,

1015
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,220
which were written shortly after

1016
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,400
the events supposedly occurred. But in the case

1017
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,320
of the Gospels, you're talking about 50 to 100

1018
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,180
years between the times the events

1019
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,340
supposedly happened and the times that they were actually written.

1020
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,120
Well, I'm talking about the archaeological

1021
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,320
excavation in the year 1980 that

1022
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,180
you should really look into.

1023
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,300
A free inquiry and the

1024
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,240
Center for Science in the Public

1025
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,300
Interest signed off on this, and it's apparently

1026
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,580
archaeologically genuine.

1027
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,760
Genuine. A lot of people

1028
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,900
want to believe it's genuine, but...

1029
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,200
They are humanists and atheists.

1030
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,900
Well, that's right,

1031
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,140
because it kind of shoots down the whole...

1032
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,900
Jesus is responsible

1033
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,620
for killing the dinosaurs, because

1034
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,100
it was the meat-eaters,

1035
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,060
like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, that were

1036
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,200
going to threaten the humans.

1037
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,860
So Jesus came down, and he

1038
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,240
rode them like

1039
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,720
when he wore a cowboy hat.

1040
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,660
And he was saying,

1041
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,160
Giddy-up, Mohandas! And the T-Rex was like,

1042
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:31,400
Grrr!

1043
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,680
Grrr! I can see it now.

1044
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,100
Jurassic Park.

1045
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,040
A young world.

1046
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,580
You know, I've actually heard that the last of the dinosaurs

1047
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,460
were hunted to extinction by cowboys.

1048
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,740
Early in the morning of time.

1049
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,940
Imagine a giant dinosaur

1050
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,860
with a crown of thorns.

1051
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,300
Well, if you want to believe the evidence

1052
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,280
in Beast of Hollow Mountain or

1053
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,400
the Valley of Gwangi, you've got your

1054
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,040
cowboys chasing your...

1055
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,800
Now, did you know that Hollywood

1056
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,040
someone in Hollywood just recently announced

1057
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,360
they're producing a movie called

1058
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,060
Cowboys vs. Aliens.

1059
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,240
And yet, if you've read your

1060
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,020
Bobliographon, you'll find that

1061
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,420
J.R. Bob Dobbs produced a movie

1062
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,200
in the 50s called

1063
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,880
Cowboys and Indians vs. Aliens.

1064
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,500
The whole plot is

1065
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,100
described in the sub-G's book

1066
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,020
which was released three or four years ago.

1067
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,740
Now...

1068
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,100
Wait, what?

1069
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,120
I heard that that was already a plot that's coming out

1070
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,480
and Johnny Depp's going to be in that movie.

1071
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:29,960
It's...

1072
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,280
Duck and cover! Duck and cover!

1073
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,180
Put your head...

1074
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,720
Oh no!

1075
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,020
Out of the blue of the western sky,

1076
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,800
Sky King.

1077
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,580
And his lovely confidant,

1078
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,380
Penny, wearing very little,

1079
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,840
if anything at all.

1080
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,820
Imagine it in the sky.

1081
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,460
Creatures that sit

1082
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,900
and wait.

1083
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,640
And man.

1084
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,140
Superior to the creatures

1085
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,520
only in his cunning.

1086
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,080
There are not many men yet.

1087
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,440
Just a few tribes

1088
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,740
scattered across

1089
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,600
the face of the wilderness.

1090
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,300
But one of them has

1091
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,500
Raquel Welch in it.

1092
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,560
This is Jack Hobah,

1093
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,100
leader of the Rock and Roll

1094
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,640
tribe.

1095
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,740
His home was a cave

1096
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,020
in the mountains.

1097
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,040
Knowing only

1098
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,520
a crude staff which responded

1099
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,680
to brute force.

1100
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,800
Life walked

1101
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,520
hand in hand with death.

1102
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,760
Then there was a movie

1103
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
that had...

1104
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,340
The guy's name was Tumek,

1105
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,220
the Tumescent or something like that.

1106
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,620
Tumid, we called him.

1107
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,840
Oh, that feels great.

1108
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,240
Ah.

1109
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,160
That feels wonderful.

1110
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,480
There's a small plane

1111
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,560
flying around my head.

1112
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,740
He blacked me a jam, man.

1113
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,520
He blacked me a jam, man.

1114
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,520
He ain't got no jam, jam, man.

1115
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,320
He ain't got no jam, jam, man.

1116
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,680
He blacked me a jam, man.

1117
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,900
He blacked me a jam, man.

1118
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,860
Yes, that's very nice.

1119
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,180
We'll let you know.

1120
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,180
I hate you.

1121
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,240
I'm sorry.

1122
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,940
You have a story.

1123
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,960
A small plane flying around your head

1124
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:32,800
counterclockwise.

1125
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,880
You're not like Elaine.

1126
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,200
I hate you.

1127
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,820
Yeah, I hate you.

1128
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,640
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1129
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,120
Yeah.

1130
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,820
I don't know.

1131
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,700
We're out here

1132
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,500
on the city street, folks.

1133
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,280
Oh, excuse me.

1134
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,960
That gentleman looks like you.

1135
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,200
Sir, can I just talk to you

1136
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:49,740
for just a minute?

1137
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,440
Sir?

1138
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,500
I guess he was in a hurry.

1139
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,860
Did you say excuse me?

1140
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,000
Oh, excuse me.

1141
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,340
I'm sorry.

1142
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,120
I've seen your email before

1143
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,240
and I'm enjoying your post.

1144
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,300
I'm always allowing to choose

1145
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,680
Don't you remember me?

1146
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,720
I've met my life.

1147
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:10,780
I have.

1148
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,040
Yeah.

1149
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,480
So you canbok yo

1150
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,140
on my side,

1151
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,640
like this.

1152
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,920
And honestly,

1153
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,380
And with the news, oh my god

1154
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,260
She was of overtime, sometimes it's working to

1155
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,280
Get, get, and we date

1156
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,880
And they're

1157
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,700
News

1158
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,440
The world of science

1159
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,740
Well, that was all good fun, and we all had a jolly good laugh

1160
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,800
Now, for the software

1161
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,720
It's an utterly familiar feeling

1162
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,700
To look back on the way one was behaving

1163
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,680
A year, a month, or an hour ago

1164
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,200
And to be amazed

1165
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,100
One's personality is always changing

1166
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,840
And one is always

1167
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,380
Learning new things and forgetting old ones

1168
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,960
There's also the

1169
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,680
Extreme example of

1170
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:22,840
Brainwashing

1171
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,860
We are inclined to say that a person's essential

1172
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,420
Actions

1173
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,460
Identity is unchanged

1174
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,080
Even if he has been given a completely

1175
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,520
False set of memories

1176
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,220
The curious thing is that

1177
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,480
You must express your individual consciousness

1178
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,760
In the same words that I use

1179
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,520
I am

1180
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,060
I am me

1181
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,820
I exist

1182
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,460
The philosopher Hegel

1183
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,520
Was very struck by this fact

1184
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,500
And deemed it an instance

1185
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,280
Of the divine nature

1186
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,100
Of language

1187
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,880
What a conclusion

1188
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,420
Might one draw from

1189
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,600
The fact that your essential consciousness

1190
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,100
And my essential consciousness

1191
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,380
Are expressed in the same words

1192
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,380
We can go far from this

1193
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,260
The essence of consciousness

1194
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,340
Is really nothing more than simple existence

1195
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,260
I am

1196
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,320
Why should the possession of this sort of consciousness

1197
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,340
Be denied to anything that does exist?

1198
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,120
Aquinas has said that God is pure existence

1199
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,340
Unmodified

1200
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,960
Is it not evidence that there is a

1201
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,460
Certain single something

1202
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,920
Call it God or the...

1203
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,800
You are not

1204
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,180
Alright, let's take this point

1205
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,340
Let's back up

1206
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,180
Aquinas has said, Governor

1207
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,020
That God is pure existence

1208
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,920
Unmodified

1209
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,660
No, no, no, no, no

1210
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,280
Pure existence

1211
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,760
I don't know what that means

1212
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,920
Is pure existence

1213
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,640
That doesn't mean anything

1214
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,740
That's pepperoni

1215
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,600
That's saying pepperoni

1216
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,640
Is not sausage

1217
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,060
Well, to exist is to have consciousness

1218
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,580
The other things one might feel

1219
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,020
Are necessary for consciousness

1220
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,040
No pattern can be conscious

1221
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,900
Until it exists

1222
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,660
Until it is brought into reality

1223
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
No, no, no, what does that mean?

1224
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,160
Existence is primal

1225
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,540
Only

1226
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,520
Well, existence primally

1227
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,480
Is the only thing

1228
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,900
That will be required for consciousness

1229
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,000
A rock is conscious

1230
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,120
A piece of paper is conscious

1231
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,320
And a horse is a robot

1232
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,520
Before, both, after

1233
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,800
And after his behavior

1234
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,700
Evolved to our mind

1235
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,300
What does that mean?

1236
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,260
A robot's going to be able to think

1237
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,000
The way we think

1238
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,140
It ain't never going to be able to think

1239
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,840
Mankind will never be able to produce

1240
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,440
Anything equivalent to mankind itself

1241
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,600
The cellular structure alone, man

1242
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,520
There's no way we could ever

1243
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,720
Recreate any of that, Jack

1244
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,480
Now we can...

1245
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,560
We can imitate

1246
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,100
We can imitate, right?

1247
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,160
We can imitate with little machines

1248
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,800
And so forth

1249
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,000
I am truly amazed

1250
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,580
I don't know how to do this

1251
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,280
I don't know how to do this

1252
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,500
Buttocks

1253
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,640
No, no, no, no, no

1254
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,220
No, no, no, no, no

1255
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,880
No, no, no, no, no

1256
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,660
No, no , novi

1257
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,760
No...

1258
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,980
Feli...

1259
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:00,980


1260
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,780
Can you Stat Auburn here?

1261
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,040
Ah...

1262
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,200
Rush

1263
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,420
Rush

1264
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:25,440
Rush?

1265
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:06,920
Have a heart attack!

1266
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:08,300
Ooh!

1267
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,140
Ooh!

1268
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,360
High five, everybody!

1269
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,480
Good!

1270
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:20,680
Wee!

1271
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:22,660
Pow!

1272
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:26,540
Wee!

1273
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,960
Wee!

1274
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,100
Pow!

1275
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,220
Pow!

1276
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,560
Pow!

1277
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:36,680


1278
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,100
Jesus!

1279
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,240
Jesus!

1280
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:42,300
Cheepsy.

1281
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,460
Mmm!

1282
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,140
Ha ha ha!

1283
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,020


1284
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,060
Ha ha ha!

1285
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
Ha ha ha!

1286
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:53,900
Stop!

1287
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,420
And that piece was called

1288
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,020
I Exist, and is by the

1289
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,080
great Reverend Phineas Narcissus,

1290
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,200
co of National Cynical

1291
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,060
Radio, available at

1292
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,900
nationalcynical.com

1293
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,160
Phineas

1294
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,160
puts out amazing

1295
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,080
podcasts, which

1296
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,720
any Hour of Slack pod

1297
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,980
cats and kitties would dig, baby.

1298
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,800
And this Hour of Slack

1299
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,480
number 1186

1300
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,860
is the first

1301
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,620
one to have only one

1302
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,040
credits break. Everything you've heard so far

1303
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,780
was from pretty much only three

1304
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,900
sources. One is

1305
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,300
Radio Synesthesia, Dr. Sinister's

1306
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,880
show on WCSB Cleveland,

1307
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,140
and his guests that July 6th

1308
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,140
were Dr. Howell, Lonesome Cowboy

1309
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,020
Dave, Governor Rocknar, No Money

1310
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,880
Mark, and yours truly, Reverend Stang.

1311
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,960
Another source was the old

1312
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,100
Puzzling Evidence show, I mean

1313
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,100
really old, from like

1314
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,700
1982 or 1983

1315
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,940
on KPFA Berkeley, when the

1316
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,740
show hosts were Puzzling Evidence

1317
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,660
Dr. Howell, Gary Dubrogfrand, and

1318
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,720
Palmer Vreedies.

1319
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,540
They were all baby

1320
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,060
kids, you know,

1321
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:03,120
and they were all

1322
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,200
just like, you know,

1323
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:03,200


1324
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,500
And the other source was the

1325
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,220
Subgenius Devival sermon at the

1326
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,620
2008 Starwood Festival.

1327
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,080
The scenic amino acids

1328
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,180
will be here tomorrow night!

1329
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,440
And we're in the background

1330
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,760
for these credits. Fernanda Nanny

1331
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,400
Leigh Murd did the titles and the

1332
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,120
last two cuts that you'll hear

1333
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,600
at the end of the show.

1334
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,020
This overweening

1335
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,560
show itself is the Hour

1336
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,260
of Slack from the Church of the

1337
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,180
Subgenius, headquartered here at

1338
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,680
Subgenius Foundation.

1339
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,560
Here at

1340
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,760
the Slacker Mansion

1341
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,260
in Cleveland, which also

1342
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,640
produces books and videos and so on.

1343
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,300
All of our shows and related

1344
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,460
shows are archived and

1345
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,220
can be accessed through

1346
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,600
subgenius.com

1347
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,260
And now this.

1348
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,420
Little doctors were spoiling around the room

1349
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,480
using pounds of irradiated air.

1350
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,040
You'll be dead in only twenty seconds.

1351
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,540
Don't let it upset you, little doctor.

1352
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,640
But the ear is really,

1353
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,160
just really messed up still.

1354
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,880
Yeah, can't you do something?

1355
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,120
It doesn't look a bit like it did when it was alive.

1356
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:09,520
I told you to use the size 5.

1357
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,240
If you'd used the size 5,

1358
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,780
it would all be fine right now.

1359
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,780
Jerry was stupid enough to drink coffee

1360
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,400
and now he's off on his own show.

1361
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,980
Not paying attention to the cues.

1362
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,380
You were a subgenius.

1363
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,720
You two would have to get up at 4.30

1364
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
and go to some other radio station

1365
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,400
and stop this show by being on that show.

1366
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,520
When they show that movie,

1367
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,920
I'm just gonna go down on my shoulder.

1368
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,200
Yeah, good idea.

1369
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,260
Because the TV bombers will be over us

1370
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,700
in less than ten minutes.

1371
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,740
And the TV missiles will start taking off

1372
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,080
from the inside of everybody's couches

1373
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,600
and the little TV missiles will start

1374
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,420
flying out of the refrigerator.

1375
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,460
There'll be little TV missiles landing everywhere.

1376
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,800
No, no, no.

1377
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,740
This is a tape.

1378
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,400
Oh, my God.

1379
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,400
YouTube caller on the midnight flight.

1380
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,760
It's a saving the subgenius forces

1381
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,020
out in the desert.

1382
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,860
Yeah, I'm not on the show anymore.

1383
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,380
I'm home asleep.

1384
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,120
This is wonderful.

1385
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,080
I hate being on the radio.

1386
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,800
I'm asleep right now in my bed.

1387
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,160
I'm warm and everything's nice.

1388
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,820
And I won't have to get up for another

1389
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,480
18 and a half hours.

1390
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,800
Oh, look out. My bed's on fire.

1391
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,120
That's all right. There he goes.

1392
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,980
We'll take that Doug away and put in the new Doug here.

1393
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,880
Press the Doug button and start him up.

1394
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,400
I don't know.

1395
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,380
Look at his face.

1396
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,240
I've seen that. I've seen that face

1397
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:28,900
somewhere before.

1398
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,840
It was on some horrible radio show

1399
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,820
in the 1980s.

1400
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,940
Wow, can you feel that?

1401
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,500
It feels like they're shooting little things right through you.

1402
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,460
Somehow or the other I feel my forehead.

1403
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,400
There's a hole in my forehead.

1404
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,100
You're on the air.

1405
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,600
You're on the air.

1406
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,360
And you know your Bible correctly.

1407
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,800
Jesus was Samaritan, now he was

1408
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,580
Samaritan Israel.

1409
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,880
Israeli.

1410
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,000
Samaritan Israel.

1411
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,140
The world can be brought down into two groups

1412
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,600
of people.

1413
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,660
Those who divide the world into two kinds of people

1414
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,560
and those who find such activities fun.

1415
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,920
Jesus was Samaritan, Israelite.

1416
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,220
Actually, there are ten kinds of people

1417
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,900
in the world. Those who understand binary numbers

1418
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,620
and those who don't.

1419
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,480
And if you know your New Testament,

1420
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,740
it also says that Pete's salvation

1421
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,380
comes from the Jewish theology.

1422
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,320
Okay, so...

1423
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,240
And this is his brother,

1424
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,340
Sarcana.

1425
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,320
Lord Gitchenwell,

1426
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,180
Lady Bathrobe,

1427
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,100
and other esteemed members

1428
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,240
of this colonial panel,

1429
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,920
we've noticed

1430
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,520
over the last few four years

1431
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,920
that there are

1432
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,500
numerous of these

1433
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,520
bob heads

1434
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,920
in the caves

1435
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,800
and we're hoping to make friends

1436
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,920
with at least an alliance

1437
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,620
with the Pumitos tribe

1438
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,040
to make sure that we can

1439
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,140
get our goodies and screw

1440
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,240
them in the good old British way.

1441
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,060
Somebody open

1442
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:58,600
a window.

1443
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,440
I'm sorry, I'm fledgling this afternoon.

1444
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,000
The Oolongs

1445
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,200
are off and so am I.

1446
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,800
I'm off. Goodbye.

1447
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,900
There is no

1448
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,580
love lost between them

1449
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,820
and that is our

1450
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,360
story.

1451
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,280
I thought you were kind of a sweet

1452
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:18,860
British babe.

1453
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,980
Yeah, I just want to comment that

1454
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,180
during the Pax Romana,

1455
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,820
Jesus is mentioned more times

1456
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,840
than Julius David and the

1457
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,780
Roman Empire. When were those things written?

1458
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,340
27 B.C. to 180 A.D.

1459
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,080
The Pax Romana,

1460
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,940
that book there? No, Pax Romana

1461
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,900
is a term for the time

1462
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,080
when the Roman Empire was at its

1463
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,160
peak there and then things seemed like they were all right.

1464
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,880
When they imposed what they called

1465
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,440
a Roman peace. Right, a Roman peace.

1466
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,460
They made a desert and called it peace.

1467
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,980
Now what is the context in which

1468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,880
those things were mentioned? Where did

1469
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,820
those writings come from? First in the

1470
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,940
Annals of Tacitus and then in the

1471
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,740
writings of Flavius Josephus.

1472
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,900
Did Tacitus, where did he get his

1473
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,780
information from? He was a

1474
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,180
chronicler of Roman history. Did he say,

1475
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,940
oh, I was here and saw this guy here? Or did he say,

1476
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,180
oh, people are talking about this guy? He talked about a

1477
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,540
disagreeable group known as the Christians

1478
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,820
who were followed, the followers

1479
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,780
of a man allegedly named Jesus

1480
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,480
who was crucified in the reign of

1481
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,820
Tiberius. The Romans crucified a lot of people.

1482
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,480
They sure did.

1483
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,780
Just look at the Servile War. They

1484
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,040
crucified him for miles. In fact, there were a lot of people

1485
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,040
around that time walking around claiming to be

1486
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,940
a messianic figure because

1487
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,740
it was a very distressing time

1488
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,000
for the

1489
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,920
people of Judea there,

1490
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,900
having been recently colonized by these

1491
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,060
pagans. I'm just saying he had a lot of followers

1492
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,100
and a lot of people and he caused a lot of

1493
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,380
What about Spartacus?

1494
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,040
But there are no contemporary

1495
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,140
writings of

1496
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,760
people actually saying like,

1497
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,520
oh yeah, there's this guy and he's doing this.

1498
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,880
He's a poor bozo, a carpenter,

1499
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,880
he's not going to get writings written about him.

1500
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,940
I tend

1501
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,820
to lean in the direction that

1502
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,780
there was no actual individual person

1503
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:00,960
who

1504
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,940
did any of the things that were, you know,

1505
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,900
I mean, it's pretty well documented

1506
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,120
that there were

1507
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,040
a lot of people back then who made similar

1508
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,100
claims, who were

1509
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,020
preaching similar ideas, but I mean, the fact that you

1510
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,600
don't have a single... They don't have a single... That's what they said then.

1511
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,620
They don't have a single... The fact that they don't have a single

1512
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,640
contemporary account. You know, there are

1513
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,400
contemporary accounts of Julius Caesar.

1514
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,940
I mean, Julius Caesar wrote a book himself

1515
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,020
for the conquest of

1516
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,980
Gaul there, you know?

1517
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,780
Well, much in the life of Jesus

1518
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,020
is very suspect. For example, there was no

1519
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,400
order by...

1520
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,260
King Herod

1521
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,660
did not order the firstborn

1522
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,840
all to be slain, then there should

1523
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,960
certainly be a record of that.

1524
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,760
Something so overwhelming.

1525
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,980
But at any rate, it does make a good

1526
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,160
story, doesn't it? That's the important thing.

1527
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,080
That's really all that counts.

1528
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,260
It's a blend of many oriental

1529
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,860
tales. That's another great question. Does it even

1530
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,200
really matter if such a person

1531
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,760
actually existed? I mean, if

1532
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,880
you say then, yes, it's absolutely a very important

1533
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,920
thing, then that's clearly

1534
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,260
a religious position.

1535
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,880
Think of what... And what does this

1536
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,060
mean about J.R. Bob Dogg? It doesn't actually...

1537
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,000
Whether or not such a person actually did exist,

1538
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,240
I mean, it wouldn't go... It's a

1539
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,620
cobbling of many religious traditions

1540
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,240
of the Middle Orient. It wouldn't take us any further in the direction of explaining

1541
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,920
historical record. Nothing would make any more sense.

1542
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,100
The Mithraic traditions, the Druidic traditions

1543
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,840
are even represented, and certainly Greek

1544
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,000
Hellenism is represented because, you know,

1545
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,760
how could Virgin Mary be a Virgin Mary

1546
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,880
if you... Because a bunch of Hellenistic

1547
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,060
guys always said so. I'll have a bloody

1548
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,580
Mary. How do we know that...

1549
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,740
She's not ovulating, so you better not.

1550
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,760
I'm gonna have to wait a little while. Then the slaughter

1551
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,840
of the innocents actually took

1552
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,560
place, and was otherwise called

1553
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,000
the subgenius hour of

1554
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,360
slap.

1555
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,800
Next week,

1556
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,600
The Hill of Foreskins.

1557
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,820
Yeah, actually, there are...

1558
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,800
I have heard about it. I have heard about non-surgical

1559
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,320
techniques for foreskin restoration.

1560
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've recently

1561
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,780
heard about this. People feel

1562
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,860
cheated sometimes. They hang little

1563
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,980
lead-whites and fishhooks off. You're gonna believe

1564
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,980
everything you read. Trying to stretch

1565
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,620
it out there.

1566
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,880
Ah, charnelation. And so the

1567
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,100
Lord tried to stretch it out. He knew

1568
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,920
he was not born of

1569
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,040
the flesh, but still he was

1570
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,900
kind of hoping for something more than

1571
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,980
what his dad gave him.

1572
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,980
And so he tied a little

1573
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,000
brick to the end of it, and decided to

1574
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,820
walk around the Judean hillside,

1575
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,160
errantly taking on snapshots

1576
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,760
in his mind of the sheep's breeding. Well, the bottom line is,

1577
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,840
Jesus has a nice nightclub now in

1578
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,020
some little town in Georgia, and so

1579
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,180
good luck. That's the Republic

1580
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,160
of Georgia and the former Soviet Union. And what a

1581
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,260
brick he was.

1582
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,000
Yeah, yeah. It's in the

1583
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,940
suburb of Tbilisi.

1584
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,940
Sorry, you could have done more than listen to me.

1585
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,460
But I'm gonna go to the radio, but now it's too late.

1586
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,480
Now you only have a minute left.

1587
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,380
It will seem like hours, but it lasts forever.

1588
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,000
The lull show will flash before your ears.

1589
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:56,500
The lull show will flash before your ears.

1590
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:56,920
There is so-

1591
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,940
Don't listen too closely

1592
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,860
or you'll go deaf.

1593
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,100
Jerry of the circus.

1594
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,500
Well, I...

1595
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,520
Well, I...

1596
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,060
Oh, Jerry.

1597
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,980
Gee whiz.

1598
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,400
Here he comes now.

1599
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,460
I'll say.

1600
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,640
Oh.

1601
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,980
Oh, Jerry.

1602
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,720
Now for Jerry of the circus.

1603
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,980
Jumping Jupiter. Does that mean

1604
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,980
they'll have to shoot him? They usually do,

1605
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,080
just that. Yeah?

1606
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,500
It'll do them good.

1607
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,620
Seems to me they should have shot him anyhow.

1608
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,020
Seems to me they should have shot him anyhow.

1609
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,300
You bet.

1610
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,660
Now the prosecutor lifts his hand again

1611
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:52,660


1612
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,680
so Dory can see the object he's holding.

1613
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:55,680


1614
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,020
And...

1615
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,360
Dorothy, do you know what this is I'm holding up to you?

1616
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,620
Yes. You aren't looking closely enough.

1617
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,000
No. Yes, Dorothy.

1618
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,600
Uh-huh. Yes, Mr. Abt. No.

1619
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:07,800
Objection.

1620
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,420
The state contends that this subject is

1621
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,040
layman-kid-ar-istic-ism-an. And I'm

1622
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,660
healthy. For two reasons.

1623
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,420
One, the

1624
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,520
is there. What's he saying?

1625
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,860
Two, Mrs. Grant was

1626
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,860
whom she told my husband part of

1627
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,880
that love was slipping away

1628
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,920
from her. Slipping away from her too.

1629
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,040
That's right. I'm going to tell the jury

1630
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,000
what the truth is.

1631
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,520
Miss Avery, she was

1632
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,140
afraid of her. That's all about it.

1633
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,100
Oh. Oh. That's right.

1634
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,140
for a head of a candidate.

1635
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,060
You didn't understand a lot of what I just

1636
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,040
said. Amazing is

1637
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,520
isn't it? Yes. Oh, yes.

1638
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:45,580
Amazing.
