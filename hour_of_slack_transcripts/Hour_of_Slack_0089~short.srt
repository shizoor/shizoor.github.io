1
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,820
Return to the swelling days of the Old West this weekend with Mr. Rory Tellers on a big

2
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,080
hiatus right, as they celebrate their 100th anniversary. Yes, the 100 days in the business

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,160
means a lot to the men and women of Mr. Rory's, and this weekend means a lot to you, too.

4
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,100
It means Old West prices, like a Big Rory for $1.79 or a Killer At Burger for $1.78.

5
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,660
It means Old West decor, from the cattle skulls on the floor and about bullet holes in the

6
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,940
drive-up speaker box. And it means Old West excitement, too, like the thrill of a bloody

7
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,980
shootout as man matches wits with hyena, or the spectacle of a herd of stampeding hyenas.

8
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,800
Have you силен yet?

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:56,800


10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:56,800


11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:56,800


12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:56,800


13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:56,800


14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,040
First of all, is all that good Mr. Rory's food.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,620
Whether your favorite is hyena tongue or tail, you'll enjoy it even more at a Mr. Rory's Arizona-baked hyena tribe drive-thru.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,740
See your phone book for the one nearest you.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,300
Some people need to be mashed under a large rock, man. You're probably one of them.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,420
Well, you're listening to the arm-twisting adventures of your personal friend Huey on the bastard son of Poop Eye to the Gods.

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,080
You're listening to KPFT and Houston 90.1 FM.

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,260
The radio station that transmits my sick mind through electrical waves into a box in your personal home.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,520
From the largest stock in Texas.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Hey, NON, 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,420
And could express every emotion with it.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,240
Love.

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:45,860
Hate.

26
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,380
Anger.

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,580
Chagrin.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,080
Even contempt.

29
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,120
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,780
You're the beta king.

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,920
It was only fantasy.

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,140
I don't see that as being something you can look at as being tangible right now.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,580
I don't...

34
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,040
Well, I've lost my equilibrium, my car keys and my pride.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,720
By this time, your fingers should be moving more quickly to the desired keys.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,540
Also in...

37
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,840
Oh, what can I say?

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,040
What can a person like myself say to a vegetable?

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,340
But the answer is simple, my friends.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,020
Just call...

41
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
...and I'll...

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,120
...leave this...

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,560
...all the intergalactic laxative will get you from here to there.

44
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,260
Relieve you and believe me without a worry or care.

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,280
...shhh...

46
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:48,540
...shh...

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,220
This is Lou Grubb for Lou Grubb Chevrolet.

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,120
Listen.

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,520
We've got some fine resale cars here at 27th Avenue in Camelback.

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,300
And what's more, if you'll stop out at 27th Avenue in Camelback to see us, you can ask...

51
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,080
Ah, yes, dear friends.

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,000
This is your host, Lou Grubb.

53
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:20,160
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

54
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,460
I'm amazed that upper tape deck works despite...

56
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,720
See?

57
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,480
When George got off his show, he said,

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,520
Now, that upper tape deck, stay away from that thing.

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,940
It's warbling again.

60
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,500
And see, friends, there's nothing wrong with that upper tape deck at all.

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,240
It's playing that Walter Carlos stuff just fine in the background.

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,560
Oh.

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,500
And maybe next time, I hope that next week, that it's...

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,480
We know for sure it's going to work.

65
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,300
I wonder if there's any way...

66
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,160
I bet I could distort this just by flipping this little switch.

67
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,140
Yeah, there we go.

68
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,620
Ha ha ha ha ha.

69
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,280
Well, friends, you'll see next week, I'm going to be out of town.

70
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,220
And Willa Dobbs is going to take over the show for one week.

71
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,100
It'll be his first time on this ugly, ugly board, this mixing board here.

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,380
But, yeah, I've got to go.

73
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,800
I'm going on a special mission for Bob, so to speak.

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,020
But that doesn't mean that you bobbies can be breaking into my house and stealing Bob's skull.

75
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,420
Or rather, the 1984 Bob's skull.

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm sure he's got a new one by now.

77
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Because the house...

78
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,500
That subgenius castle will be guarded by both the Beast...

79
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,780
That's actually my Doberman Pinscher's name.

80
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,780
Both Beast and the Willa Dobbs will be in there.

81
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,180
Never mind the Beast, dear friends, but beware the Willa Dobbs.

82
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,860
Because he...

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,340
Oh, Willa Dobbs, he looks...

84
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,300
You know, you hear him in the background a lot.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,720
And hopefully in the foreground this next time.

86
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,500
And you can't tell much from a voice, I guess.

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,640
But he basically looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger,

88
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,740
only with glasses.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,940
Sort of like me.

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,280
Those of you who know me would pretty much know what I'm saying.

91
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,880
So, uh, you just...

92
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,740
You just better beware, dear friends.

93
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,880
Well...

94
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:44,400
Uh, you can call the Willa Dobbs tonight at 828-9500 or 823-7490.

95
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,200
And meanwhile,

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,940
we will continue...

97
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:51,980
with...

98
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,540
the horror.

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,460
Somehow, actually, I need to shut off that music

100
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,840
and get something a little bit more fitting in here.

101
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,560
Do you know what I mean?

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,180
Boy, no kidding.

103
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,500
We needn't dwell on those other bobs, dear friends.

104
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,840
We'll have to talk about the other bobs tonight.

105
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,920
In fact, actually, I guess...

106
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,380
Dr. Dili Lama,

107
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,180
who is here tonight,

108
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,780
I think could also help us talk about

109
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,760
the other bobs.

110
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,460
The bobs who are coming.

111
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,720
Uh, once again, we're gonna talk about

112
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,620
Robert Anton Wilson coming into town.

113
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,860
Uh, where and when is that,

114
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,500
my dear friend?

115
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,800
That will be Friday, August 7th,

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,620
at 8 PM at the Scottish Rite,

117
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,360
Hospital Auditorium.

118
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,320
You know, that's down there off Oaklawn and Maple.

119
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
Oh, friend.

120
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,620
You wanna make...

121
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,100
You wanna go see Robert Anton Wilson,

122
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,260
uh, bespeak the hideous truths

123
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,240
that you wanna hear so bad,

124
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,040
and the ones that you don't wanna hear, too,

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,640
and the ones that you can't possibly truly hear.

126
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,620
Or your ears will hear,

127
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,160
but only the...

128
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,060
truly attuned will listen.

129
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,820
Truly listen.

130
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,800
Are you aware?

131
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,620
So do, uh, whip on down there.

132
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,340
That mighty writer,

133
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,840
that's what he is, by the way,

134
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,140
for those of you who didn't know,

135
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,140
Robert Anton Wilson is a writer,

136
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,940
but he's a writer who's pried open the shell

137
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,360
surrounding the secrets of life and death,

138
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,860
and made them funny.

139
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,120
And also quite educational.

140
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,000
An agent of slack.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,480
An agent of true slack.

142
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,480
An agent of true slack.

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,980
Slack.

144
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,840
What is it?

145
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,400
Where is it?

146
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,980
We're going to try to figure that out now.

147
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,560
Oh, by the way, I should mention,

148
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,320
earlier tonight, uh, what you heard,

149
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,100
the second version of the

150
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,220
It's Not Just The...

151
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,580
rant from the great G. Gordon Gordon,

152
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,080
the mercenary of Bob.

153
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,000
He shipped that up from Brazil,

154
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,680
from, uh, the...

155
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,580
the town of Araruama,

156
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,720
where he lives,

157
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,460
and where I hope to go

158
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,380
for fun

159
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,660
next Easter.

160
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,200
And then again,

161
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,300
when they give us $40 million

162
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,940
to do the subgenius movie,

163
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,200
we'll all go down there to write the screenplay.

164
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,220
Of course, we'll party for six weeks

165
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,420
and then write the screenplay on the last day,

166
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,040
but that's what you want, friends!

167
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,260
That's the only true way to do it.

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,780
That's the...

169
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,180
This coming up here is called

170
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,680
The Blast Supper

171
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,660
by Reverend G. Gordon Gordon.

172
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,860
G. Don Truby.

173
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,040
Uh, put your headphones on for this, dear friends.

174
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,820
D-Li Lama just did, and he knows,

175
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,680
because he's...

176
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,240
he's b-b-b-been around.

177
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
Hail Eris.

178
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,500
Hey, there.

179
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,240
Yes, yesterday's brains are here.

180
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,240
A slow but steady intelligence

181
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,360
leading me by the nose...

182
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,240
...to the table.

183
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,100
This war hath spread.

184
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,860
You catch, eagles?

185
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,720
You must watch my feet, first,

186
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,960
and then the croc shall strike three.

187
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,060
Inflicting heavy casualties...

188
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,900
As you are to lunch.

189
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,540
I'll take care of this.

190
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,960
I brought my plastic.

191
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,660
Simon Peter assigned it to me

192
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,440
as I flopped out my wallet.

193
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,560
His bulging, belching,

194
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,140
bronze-tan voice

195
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,000
carried through the cafe...

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,780
Intentionally.

197
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,820
...trying to impress the boss, eh, Pete?

198
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,240
Paul retorted.

199
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,720
His bracketed, closed,

200
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,880
bombshell voice...

201
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,980
Blast!

202
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:01,660
...booming...

203
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,080
...across...

204
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,020
...the Neverwax floor tiles.

205
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,680
Boys!

206
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,340
Boys!

207
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,180
Jesus!

208
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,700
...cleared his trout accordionly.

209
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,480
Aye, but I like it drunk.

210
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,960
Maggie moaned to a greasy pair of glasses.

211
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,000
Jesus donned the spectacle

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,080
and declaimed the onside click.

213
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,400
When in Rome...

214
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,940
...do the Romans...

215
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,760
...do the Romans...

216
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,400
...Jesus jousted...

217
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,180
...indeed, the Roman enumerators...

218
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,140
...bucket man!

219
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,660
...John announced from under the table.

220
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
John found his fork...

221
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,380
...and thrust...

222
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,900
...his precepts...

223
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,500
...in a must...

224
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,620
...unkeenly manner...

225
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,040
...upon his stable-mates.

226
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,360
They count on us for an explanation.

227
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,220
John jumped.

228
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,660
But Judas couldn't explain his order.

229
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,480
And the waitress confused did utter.

230
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,760
Look, mister, you must tell me what you want,

231
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,700
or I'll be forced to use my influence.

232
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,700
I can't read your mind.

233
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,520
Then Judas spent his second foot breathing in

234
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,560
and had a strange vision.

235
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,540
He was holding the bearded lord...

236
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,280
...in his wrists...

237
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,200
...bravel-style...

238
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,100
...wracking to a crazy beat...

239
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,620
...faster and faster...

240
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,360
...than slower.

241
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,620
He heard Cab Calloway singing...

242
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,280
...Mini the Moocher.

243
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,000
He smelled the hearty wrath...

244
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,560
...of twice-burned toast...

245
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,300
...and trembling...

246
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:21,620
...egghead...

247
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,840
...earnesty.

248
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,620
He touched and tasted a thousand things...

249
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,180
...and was unsure and wondrously proud...

250
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,620
...into the street...

251
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
...to find wherefore...

252
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,160
...and what not...

253
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,800
...on the bench.

254
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,160
That's pronounced guilty.

255
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,760
The others tittered and toastered.

256
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,300
But Jesus saveth not the hot...

257
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,560
...saveth not...

258
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,460
...in the pit.

259
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,220
...of his ugly mug.

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,840
The sky rained a million volts...

261
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,220
...of lightning bolts and...

262
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,120
...and forty buckets...

263
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,040
...of blood and beer.

264
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,640
And finally Maggie skittered over...

265
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,600
...to our booth...

266
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,320
...heaving and hoeing...

267
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,940
...and the streaming...

268
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,740
...steaming heap of feast.

269
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,360
She glared straight into the...

270
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,580
...belly soul...

271
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,020
...of our savior.

272
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,900
Questing, you order this weather?

273
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,660
Red beans and rhymes in yesterday's brains...

274
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,100
...read the two-inch video monitor...

275
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,220
...implanted firmly...

276
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,160
...in the forehead...

277
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,780
...of our one-eyed waitress...

278
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,240
...Maggie Magdalene...

279
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,900
...Littowitz...

280
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,020
...heh, heh, heh...

281
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,140
...Simon Peter...

282
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,540
...cuffed his face...

283
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,720
...to the side of my mouth...

284
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,460
...and whipped...

285
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,080
...I told you we should have taken him...

286
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,320
...to the awful house...

287
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,960
...their food is fresher and...

288
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,200
...cheaper too...

289
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,280
...but let him look at his men...

290
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,680
...you...

291
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,420
...you...

292
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,540
...you...

293
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,840
...customer implicated by circumstance...

294
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,960
...you fresh-faced...

295
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,120
...side of bacon...

296
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,420
...too many rowers scraped the bowl...

297
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,540
...I could see...

298
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,240
...feel...

299
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,040
...and touch...

300
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,460
...his healing glaze...

301
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,520
...as it shot clean through the tabular sails...

302
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,100
...in Maggie's hot sliding side slots...

303
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,880
...Thomas touched it too...

304
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
...and eagerly agreed...

305
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,840
...yes...

306
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,200
...yes...

307
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,120
...they damn well...

308
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,580
...should have eaten elsewhere...

309
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,420
...but...

310
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,520
...hell...

311
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,560
...here was water...

312
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,320
...silver...

313
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,440
...leave now?

314
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,120
...why, they'd look like acids...

315
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,100
...they'd break my heart...

316
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,120
...my glasses too...

317
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,160
...Matthew decided to know men...

318
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,300
...so with their...

319
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,980
...heads...

320
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,260
...on their knees...

321
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,440
...they broke brains...

322
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,480
...in the house...

323
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,100
...of the rising one...

324
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,700
...it was over easy...

325
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,380
...all around...

326
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,240
...black coffins...

327
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,200
...all of eyeballs...

328
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,780
...a rim...

329
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,380
...an English translation...

330
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,500
...please...

331
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,240
...mouse watered...

332
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,900
...at once...

333
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,640
...and as one...

334
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,740
...but before feasting...

335
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,500
...as always...

336
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,100
...Jesus rose...

337
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,800
...he ass ended...

338
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,940
...and performed a...

339
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,100
...a mackerel...

340
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,020
...Luke faked a knowing...

341
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,080
...and a mackerel...

342
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,760
...a young smile...

343
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,820
...of adoration...

344
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,260
...as he had been hoping...

345
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,280
...for his favorite...

346
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
...the Messiah's interpretation...

347
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,580
...of Chinook salmon...

348
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,140
...fresh water...

349
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,140
...the boys ate...

350
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,200
...feverously...

351
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,080
...Judas...

352
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,640
...the joker...

353
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,520
...choked on thirty slivers...

354
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,360
...as usual...

355
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,560
...he got a big pat...

356
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,460
...on the backside...

357
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,260
...for his deep trouble...

358
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,080
...the lettuce braid...

359
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,080
...and everybody...

360
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,520
...said it was Grace's fault...

361
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,460
...for extolling the stone...

362
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,080
...in front of the shameless...

363
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,220
...steel vault...

364
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,460
...the dirty dozen...

365
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,440
...of ordered donuts...

366
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,500
...in haste...

367
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,220
...they ordered bagels...

368
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,360
...dry...

369
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
...then they ordered...

370
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,160
...many hundreds...

371
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,080
...of hot dogs...

372
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,780
...then they ordered...

373
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,580
...the tube steaks...

374
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,320
...to jump...

375
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,280
...through...

376
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,480
...the pastry hoops...

377
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,000
...sit up...

378
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,560
...big...

379
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,060
...roll...

380
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,740
...over...

381
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,600
...and pop...

382
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,460
...onto their...

383
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,200
...twelve...

384
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,160
...twirling...

385
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,860
...tons...

386
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,560
...imagine...

387
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,520
...their surprise...

388
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,940
...when the dogs disobeyed...

389
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,180
...and spelled out...

390
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,360
...on Peter's placemat...

391
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,480
...the word...

392
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,180
...niall...

393
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,540
...up...

394
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,440
...yes...

395
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,580
...the instantaneous...

396
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,320
...nash...

397
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,720
...out...

398
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,520
...teeth...

399
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,200
...sounded...

400
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,580
...like a lion cub's...

401
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,200
...damalash...

402
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,540
...derby of the salt...

403
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,240
...a smoky robin's nest...

404
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,480
...arose from the brown...

405
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,240
...jane...

406
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,180
...and haloed them all...

407
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,720
...with the foul paw...

408
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,940
...that eventually settled...

409
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,460
...and circled around...

410
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,400
...Judy's bolting purse...

411
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,480
...you foot the bill...

412
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,860
...they all bawled...

413
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,540
...at the Jude...

414
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,760
...who had began...

415
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,820
...to get under their skin...

416
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,980
...to make it better...

417
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,960
...they all...

418
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,160
...were...

419
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,160


420
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,160


421
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,160


422
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,400
...all...

423
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,300
...fall down...

424
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,380
...drunk...

425
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,320
...and asleep...

426
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,620
...and Jesus...

427
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,500
...was white...

428
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,680
...as a sheep...

429
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,740
...he knuckled under...

430
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,700
...and blazed...

431
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,440
...I'll never eat out...

432
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,580
...again...

433
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,900
...and then he ate...

434
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,160
...his words...

435
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,160
...in remembrance...

436
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,220
...of red...

437
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,100
...bees...

438
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,160
...and...

439
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,160
...rhyme...

440
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,120
...s...

441
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,860
...

442
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,420
...

443
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,060
...

444
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,840
...

445
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:32,860
...

446
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:32,860


447
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:32,880
...

448
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:32,960
...

449
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,020
...

450
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,020


451
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,020


452
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:39,760
...

453
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,340
...

454
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:49,840
...

455
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,480
...

456
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,180
...

457
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,320
...

458
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:57,600
...

459
00:15:59,880 --> 00:15:59,920
...

460
00:15:59,920 --> 00:15:59,980
...

461
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:03,720
...

462
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:03,820
...

463
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:03,840
...

464
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:03,860
...

465
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:03,880
...

466
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:03,900
...

467
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:03,920
...

468
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:03,940
...

469
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:03,960
...

470
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:03,980
...

471
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,000
...

472
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,020
...

473
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,040
...

474
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,060
...

475
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,080
...

476
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,100
...

477
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,120
...

478
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,140
...

479
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,360
...

480
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


481
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,080
...

482
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,520
repeatedly on the Hour of Slack radio show.

483
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,200
Plus, Archdoctor St. Margaret Moser,

484
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,120
high priestess of the cult of Chilkat from Austin, Texas.

485
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,780
And J.R. Bob Dobbs will be there.

486
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,660
Yes, he's alive, friends.

487
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,280
The San Francisco cool guy Bob may be dead,

488
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,140
but my Bob isn't dead.

489
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,260
Is yours?

490
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Unfortunately, local broadcaster Ivan Stang

491
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,160
will be unable to attend.

492
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,060
But, friends, you can hear Stang on any radio.

493
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,220
Now these incredible ministers can spit fire,

494
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,120
heal the sick, and sicken the healthy.

495
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,220
Boom, Shakalamaka.

496
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,860
Way to this little snake here, son.

497
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,620
August 8th, 8 o'clock, bar of soap,

498
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,300
across from the Fair Park gate.

499
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,860
Praise Bob, free at last.

500
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,200
I'm not a Bobby in the bunch, dear friends.

501
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,600
Actually, despite all the nasty, nasty things

502
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,420
that I said about Buck's D-Bible last time,

503
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,980
I want you.

504
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,360
I want you all to go out there to the bar of soap.

505
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,400
That's the night after Robert Anton Wilson,

506
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,720
who is on August 7th.

507
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,800
You want to go see old Buckaroo and the Buckeyes

508
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,880
at the bar of soap on August 8th.

509
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,760
Oh, hold it, hold it.

510
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,600
Let me give you.

511
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,480
Reverend Stang, just a little point here.

512
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,280
Robert Anton Wilson will be giving a lecture

513
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,160
on Friday night, and then he's going to give a seminar

514
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,040
in the afternoon from 1 till about 6 o'clock.

515
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,320
At the same place, Scottish Rite Hospital.

516
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,580
And then I'm pretty sure that old Robert's going to end up

517
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,920
going to the D-Bible to see Buck naked

518
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,060
and all the other local sub-geni.

519
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,580
And did I understand that you won't be there?

520
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,440
Is that true?

521
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,320
Oh, I'm not allowed to be there.

522
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,900
This is an anti-Stang D-Bible.

523
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,520
Honest to God, it is.

524
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,140
Buck and I are friends on a personal basis,

525
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,400
but on a professional basis, we are bitter, bitter enemies.

526
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,440
And I refuse to appear on a stage.

527
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,040
I refuse to appear on a stage.

528
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,040


529
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,040


530
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,040


531
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,040


532
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,560
With anybody who takes sub-genius so,

533
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,660
I mean, so unseriously.

534
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,520
You know, I mean, this is a religion.

535
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,960
And apparently some of these other people

536
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,240
seem to think of it as some sort of a comedy thing.

537
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,420
I'm glad to see you sticking by your principles

538
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,820
of schisms in the church.

539
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,180
Yeah, it was, of course.

540
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,080
I mean, and I can no more tell Buck not to do a D-Bible

541
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,920
than I could tell, oh, say, the New York Bobbies

542
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,520
or the Philadelphia Bobbies not to do a D-Bible.

543
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,320
I'm not Bob.

544
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:33,860
You're...

545
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,220
Uh...

546
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,260
Uh...

547
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,400
Uh...

548
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,040
Uh...

549
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,040


550
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,040


551
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,040


552
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,540
Neither are you.

553
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,080
Not really.

554
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,860
Not really.

555
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,940
And I don't want to be.

556
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,820
Don't get me wrong.

557
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,620
I wouldn't want to be Bob.

558
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,240
However, over the swinging love corpses,

559
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,540
I should start talking about my D-Bibles, friends.

560
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,160
These are the ones that Buck doesn't even know about yet.

561
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,980
And we've been working towards that

562
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,460
with the kind help of David Hines,

563
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,000
St. David Hines, we should say,

564
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,180
down at the Stark Club, of all places,

565
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,640
has been donating us video editing time.

566
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,020
And we've been doing a lot of work

567
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,620
with the mighty Reverend Court Holland, SLK,

568
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,280
and I have been down there.

569
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,420
Well, last night, in fact, till four in the morning,

570
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,680
we were down there editing the subgenius video,

571
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,000
Finishing Touches,

572
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,800
and that video will be world premiered

573
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,660
at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts

574
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,060
sometime in October.

575
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,140
And you'll hear about it

576
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,060
because it's going to be one of their main featured thing.

577
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,960
It'll be the main Saturday night thing

578
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,400
and their big video festival

579
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,560
that Bart Weiss is setting up.

580
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,780
So you'll finally see the world premiere

581
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,160
of the...

582
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,180
the much promised...

583
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,440
I mean, this is what's been taking...

584
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,840
been holding up the Stark fist

585
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,440
is this mighty videotape.

586
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,440
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

587
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,860
You wouldn't believe the stuff.

588
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,080
We got hold of some footage last night, friends,

589
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,340
of J.R. Bob Dobbs as a six-year-old millionaire.

590
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,840
And when you see it,

591
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,960
you will fall down on your knees.

592
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,980
You will be knuckle-walking to Jerusalem

593
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,200
when you see this incredible video presentation,

594
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,600
as well as, of course, the deep Bible to go with it.

595
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,080
And this will...

596
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,020
this will also be world premiered

597
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,480
at the Stark Club at some point or another.

598
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,180
We're not sure.

599
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,840
Probably also in October.

600
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,340
I mean, that means we have to finish this thing by then,

601
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,040
you see, friends.

602
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,220
We're putting a deadline on ourselves.

603
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,480
So I know that I can't compete with Buck naked at the...

604
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,780
What's the name of that little tiny hole-in-the-wall club?

605
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,920
The Bar Soap.

606
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,360
Yeah, with the...

607
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,980
I mean, I know I'm selling out.

608
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,060
Jeez, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts.

609
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,060
Here we are telling everybody,

610
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,140
this is a religious...

611
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,160
That's the Museum of Art.

612
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,500
They put it in the...

613
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,620
That's right.

614
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,680
The Dallas Art Museum,

615
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,880
whatever the hell it's called.

616
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,880
They put it...

617
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,460
They're going to put it on and call it art.

618
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,220
But, you know, I guess, you know,

619
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,380
the Sistine Chapel was the subgenius video of its day.

620
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,880
You know, the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo.

621
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,900
That was the equivalent in those days.

622
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,620
And so now we have to...

623
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,000
You know, we can't show you the videotape on television.

624
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,320
Because it's too nasty and bobful.

625
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,780
Hey, listen, you can hear him in the background.

626
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,040
Squirting.

627
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,360
Squirting endlessly in his endless dream.

628
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,180
He lives on in every one of those sandworms.

629
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,520
Bob is coming, friend.

630
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,640
But, yeah, I really...

631
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,440
You should go to Buck's revival.

632
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,200
You should go to Robert Anton Wilson's revival...

633
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,320
The thing.

634
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,240
Buck does devivals.

635
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,940
I don't prefer...

636
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,260
I don't like to use the term revival for what I do.

637
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,680
Because I like to think that it revives people.

638
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,360
I think Buck's definition is exactly accurate.

639
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,120
Absolutely accurate description of what he does.

640
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,620
And, friends, I do think you ought to go ahead.

641
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,500
I mean, it's cheap.

642
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,780
And also, there are...

643
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,240
I mean, I believe Reverend Chastity Belt is going to be there.

644
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,560
And, of course, the Hell Swami.

645
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,740
And Pope S. Cecilia.

646
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,620
You know, so there's people with whom I'm not having a terrible...

647
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,300
...fewed right this minute.

648
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,720
So...

649
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,740
Gosh.

650
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,940
I get so carried away sometimes.

651
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,260
Just, you know, having this soapbox.

652
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,880
Imagine the temptations, friends, to say tasteless things.

653
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,100
It's...

654
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,760
About a rotten day.

655
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,180
Oh, boy.

656
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,140
Oh, boy.

657
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh, that's what I say.

658
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,040
Because that's what the word of Bob says.

659
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,680
I tell you, friend, there's no slack.

660
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,480
There's no slack.

661
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,220
There's no slack.

662
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,140
I tell you, in this world, in this flesh, in this devil, there's no slack.

663
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,980
And if you can't whoop it, go ye down, my friend.

664
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,760
That's what I said.

665
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,040
Go ye down.

666
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,680
There's nothing that says you can't.

667
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,260
The devil don't have a rule book.

668
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,960
That's right.

669
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,640
The devil.

670
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,040
The devil does not have a rule book.

671
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,240
He is not humanistic.

672
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,580
He is not pacifistic.

673
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,100
And he owes you money, my friend.

674
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,460
That's right.

675
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,040
The devil.

676
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,800
The devil owes you money, and so does Uncle Sam.

677
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,160
You have to recognize the devil just like you recognize Uncle Sam.

678
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,860
Now, I'm going down there to pay taxes.

679
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,140
As far as I'm concerned, I might as well be paying taxes to the devil.

680
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,180
I'm sorry, but that's just the way things are.

681
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,860
It's a test of faith.

682
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,480
And that's why God put the devil down here to see if you can tell the difference between the devil and Uncle Sam.

683
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,060
Let there be slack.

684
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,040
And I want to know, if you can tell the difference...

685
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:40,600
If you can tell the difference between the devil and John Birkeland, the devil and Shelly Beeman, the devil and Dennis Bennett.

686
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:49,820
Because these people are just the first three on the list of pledgers to the hour of slack who have not paid their dues, dear friends, to the word of dogs.

687
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,880
There's two stangs.

688
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,460
God almighty.

689
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,800
There's not enough room in this world for...

690
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,060
Friends, I want you to pay up those pledges.

691
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,340
You know, I don't want to have any of the money, you know, I want to have the money to put into the show.

692
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,480
I want to have the money to pay up the money that's being made to the hour of slack.

693
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,540
Because the station really needs money right now.

694
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,120
And not only that, I need the status.

695
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:19,360
George's show, which precedes this show, has gotten twice as much money in as the hour of slack.

696
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,240
Now, how do you think that makes us look?

697
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,780
Of course, they're on twice as long every Sunday night.

698
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,180
But that doesn't matter.

699
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,520
I want to see every cent, every red cent.

700
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,640
And I don't want to have to have, you know, the bad Bob show up at your door, friends.

701
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,720
Caprice?

702
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,180
Now, Caprice, I know you can spare that $5.

703
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,680
Ed?

704
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,020
Edgar Cayce out there in the before life.

705
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,420
I mean, he's a saint.

706
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,840
He's healed many thousands of people magically.

707
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,960
But he hasn't paid that $10.

708
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,260
And in Bob's eyes, he's doomed to hell.

709
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:54,880
All right.

710
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,920
Mother Teresa here.

711
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,220
She could only spare $25,000.

712
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,840
And we haven't seen a penny of it.

713
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,540
Now, Mother Teresa, doomed.

714
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,980
Doomed to an eternity in hell itself.

715
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,660
Because she hasn't paid up to this show, despite all the other good things she may have done.

716
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,540
And, I mean, I'm seeing some names on here.

717
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,000
These are supposed to be friends of the church enemies.

718
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,720
And I just, I mean, I ain't.

719
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,980
I don't want to turn into that old drunk preacher again.

720
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,200
Now y'all point fingers that'll take care of my sister with your

721
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,200


722
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,240
You're blessing your touch down on me, you're blessing your touch down on your family.

723
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,240


724
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,400
She's got the perfect makeshift cup.

725
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,660
And she says a good faith, doing what you're doing.

726
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:49,660


727
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:49,660


728
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:49,720
If you didn't know?

729
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:49,860
You didn't make her milk.

730
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,060
God knows what to do.

731
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,380
And you know why?

732
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,740
He didn't look for her in her own white coat.

733
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,420
the church enemies.

734
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,460
And I just, I mean, I don't want to turn into that old drunk preacher again.

735
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,720
You know, I know y'all don't like that.

736
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,480
But before we get further into the tapes, I want to point out,

737
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,840
I got this, the last time I was at Glen Rose,

738
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,020
we have a creation science museum in Glen Rose just like the Christians do.

739
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,460
But we never get any PR.

740
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,220
Just like the Dallas Morning News did that big section of book reviews

741
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,380
of Dallas authors who've been reprinted and never mentioned the book of the subgenius.

742
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,580
My bile is starting to rise.

743
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,580
I want that money.

744
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,020
I want those recountings of bad drug trips from y'all so as to prevent,

745
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,640
I mean, you and you too.

746
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,460
I mean, I know you guys don't do drugs, but I'm sure you've had bad alcohol trips.

747
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,460
I mean, there's, we need,

748
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,940
we need bad aspirin trips, you know, anything.

749
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,780
We need your personal recountings.

750
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,940
Nobody, we've gotten one.

751
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,780
How about that?

752
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,020
One.

753
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,760
And he wrote and said, oh gosh, I, when you first mentioned it,

754
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,620
I thought that you'd be so flooded with material that I didn't need to bother.

755
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,180
Well, apparently everybody thought that too.

756
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,040
And we aren't flooded with material in Dallas.

757
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,820
We hardly ever get any mail from Dallas.

758
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,300
The mail, the subgenius contributions, the stuff that we play on the air all comes in from outside.

759
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,040
Of the state.

760
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,740
Uh, because I guess since we're not local to them, we're, we're worthy of consideration,

761
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,220
but I guess since we're just local, well, that's not good enough.

762
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:38,600
But in, and in Glen Rose, we're local too, but here the Somervell sun, this is a mighty paper friends.

763
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,840
It says that creation evidence has been confirmed and that Dr.

764
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:51,040
Carl bow, uh, on, on J on June 16th, 1987, uh, the, this creation evidence team.

765
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:59,960
Discovered a, within a few feet of each other on the same level of the Puloxy river, a human tooth, dear friends,

766
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,600
who has been dubbed Glen Rose man soon.

767
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:14,040
I'm sure to take his history next to a pelt down man and his place next to who else was a great little P King man was for real, but they never did find the bones.

768
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,720
Um, yes, Glen Rose man or little David, as they've called him.

769
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh, how religious.

770
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:20,980
Uh,

771
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:33,180
was this human tooth was found within a few feet of a trial, a bite, uh, three dinosaur track and Hugh and human footprints plus possibly mammalian large mammal bones.

772
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,040
And this is a actual scientific evidence of creation.

773
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:51,200
It says here, uh, and I absolutely, uh, disproves the 10 uncountable millions of examples of, uh, evolution evidence that have been found all over the entire planet.

774
00:28:51,460 --> 00:29:15,600
By actual paleontologists, as opposed to the, uh, spacecraft, uh, control system designers and, uh, um, the dentist who, uh, who analyzed this incredible discovery, which they say this juvenile human tooth found next to the dinosaur track was blackened by the ages, which is unusual in the case of a fossil, because usually they're not blackened, but turned to stone itself.

775
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:21,380
Um, but nevertheless, friends, this, it must be true because it's, it says it right here in the Glen Rose.

776
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,180
Weekly newspaper.

777
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:30,420
And not only that, but they've provided a new spelling of the word archaeologist, even when what they really meant was paleontologist.

778
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,220
So, you know, they must be friends.

779
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,220
It's, it's gotta be true.

780
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,280
Uh, you know, uh, the Glen Rose paper said it, I believe it, that settles it.

781
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,460
Well, I've probably been depressing and nasty and mean enough for a while.

782
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,300
I'm just gonna friends call a two.

783
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,360
Three, seven, four, nine.

784
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,160
Oh, if you want to know what's going on or eight to eight 9,500.

785
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,560
Uh, did you have anything more to say?

786
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,840
Uh, mighty, uh, uh, daily llama.

787
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,280
Yeah, I've got a lot to say.

788
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,000
All right.

789
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,180
First, I want to tell all you subgeniuses out there that hadn't paid your dues.

790
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,040
Kill them.

791
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,240
Reverend Stang was being real nice to you when he was talking to you a little while ago.

792
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,420
And you know what Bob does to people who don't follow through.

793
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,220
He'll cut you off.

794
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,460
He'll cut you plum off.

795
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,680
He'll cut you off in places you don't want to be cut off.

796
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:27,960
Right?

797
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,600
It's worse than having your head cut off.

798
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,160
It's worse than having your gonads cut off.

799
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,460
It's being cut off.

800
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,640
Off by copyright 1981 by Buck naked.

801
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,340
Thanks, Buck.

802
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Oh, who is in the, in the great subgenius video quite a bit by the way.

803
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,140
Um, what do we do without it?

804
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,540
That's with his earlier, more explanatory materials.

805
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,020
I, I, I just can't get into this.

806
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,480
This is inside joke stuff that some of these people treat.

807
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,880
I mean, this is a, it's a church friends.

808
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,580
It's a church.

809
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,360
Well, before we, uh, we got some new Jane or hyper cleats coming up.

810
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,260
Oh no.

811
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,140
Yes, we do.

812
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,560
We do hit the profit.

813
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,160
Jane or speaketh again.

814
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:16,320
Uh, so, so, uh, girls hang on.

815
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,720
Cause that mighty tongue of Jane, there's going to be a lashing at you.

816
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,580
Uh, in just a few seconds, let me try that again.

817
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,840
We had this great technique, your friends.

818
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:36,200
Uh, praise.

819
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,020
Buck.

820
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,540
You almost shot and started.

821
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,020
God, I see that.

822
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,900
I feel that he's been just a swimming.

823
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,120
That's never too much.

824
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,000
Never too much.

825
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,640
I just don't want to.

826
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,140
This is not the pleasure.

827
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,740
Sorry.

828
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,480
That huge.

829
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,640
Washing collar down.

830
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,900
His collar is in orbit.

831
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,100
All those worshipers.

832
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,980
I don't know.

833
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,420
You know, collar dead.

834
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,740
Sometimes I think this was all just meant to be.

835
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,100
Collar all scooped up.

836
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,360
Down the collar bag and we'll be able to send them out.

837
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,360
I have a question.

838
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,100
Private staying.

839
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,000
Yes.

840
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,000


841
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,000


842
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,000


843
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,000


844
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,160
Okay.

845
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,800
Go ahead.

846
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,280
Fire away.

847
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,860
Okay.

848
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,120
Um, I, as I was waking this morning, I was looking into my frog stash and my dog had

849
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,100
smoking all my frog.

850
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,980
Is that ethical or should I refrain from that?

851
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Yeah, boy down.

852
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,620
Just send your dog out on the street to get a job.

853
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,700
That's what I do when my kids do the same thing.

854
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:43,880
Well, you got a job.

855
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,300
He's got a job.

856
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,960
He does my job.

857
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,440
Well, then.

858
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,740
Collar's fading away.

859
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah.

860
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,520
He's going around the other side of the planet.

861
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,240
I mean, there's a, the blueness of a wound cleanses away the evil.

862
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,740
So, you know, uh, you'll have to find your yellow collar.

863
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,560
You're going through the ionosphere.

864
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,240
You know what?

865
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,900
You'll have to yell as loud as you can, collar.

866
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,060
You'll be eating your dog in a few years.

867
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,100
Once the ocean rises, you'll be dissecting your dog in a few minutes.

868
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,580
What do you recommend as an entree?

869
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,120
The cat.

870
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,840
Out here.

871
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,960
Well, are you going to talk or you'll be okay?

872
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,840
I'm going to have to turn on the delta interocitor interrogating.

873
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,100
It's so pretty.

874
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,860
It's so clean.

875
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,020
It's so dull.

876
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,700
And those little sparkling lights, they, they seem to walk over my mind and tell me, tell

877
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,840
me over and over again.

878
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
None of this equipment works.

879
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,420
Never again.

880
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,320
Why does a live mother come down here?

881
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,560
You know, you're going to have to go through the tortures of hell to, to, to know what

882
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,080
that's, to really be able to appreciate the slack.

883
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,760
That's the whole point.

884
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,220
But it's the slack you don't know that gets you.

885
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,660
They never talk about the pain that comes before and after the slack.

886
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:49,740
Yeah.

887
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,860
If you look at the chart, the way they draw those charts and the way their seminars run,

888
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,640
it's just, Whoa, it's just one big, solid line of slack.

889
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,760
Just a plateau of slack.

890
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,080
They don't, they don't even get into the agony.

891
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,080
It says your navel is in Vulcan and your punto is in the dog house.

892
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,960
Therefore, Spudge, don't go out of the house today.

893
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,340
Stay inside and put your photograph on them together.

894
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Today could be a day to eat vegetables.

895
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,020
Or it might be time to put off some of that obnoxious mail you've been dreading to write.

896
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,620
As for you moon children, what are you doing on this planet?

897
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,640
Nuff said.

898
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,140
Next week we'll have asteroidology for the moon.

899
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,660
Oh, they're really out there.

900
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,000
Good healing crystals kill the dinosaurs.

901
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,720
Yeah, that fixed them up real good, those little dinosaurs.

902
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,100
Without a shadow of a doubt, the dinosaurs practiced psychic surgery.

903
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,560
Whoosh.

904
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,080
Here a Tyrannosaurus removes large goblets of flesh from a brontosaurus.

905
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,840
Without using his teeth.

906
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,080
That's right, dear friends.

907
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,600
The dinosaurs were killed by psychic surgery.

908
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,580
And, uh,

909
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,240
Oh, oh.

910
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,680
The, uh, Reverend Dili Lama,

911
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,840
one time Pope of all Houston,

912
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,920
just said to me, uh, not to let him get on and start on,

913
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,220
but to let him get on and start on.

914
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,320
And on those creationists,

915
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,740
especially after this lady just called and said,

916
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,780
Are you all the Antichrist station?

917
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,700
Is this the Antichrist radio show?

918
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,760
Well, friends, yes it is the Antichrist radio show

919
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,740
if you're talking about that fake Jesus,

920
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,960
that demon that goes by the name of Jesus

921
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,620
and makes you hate, hate, hate.

922
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,060
But it's science, friends.

923
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,540
Pure and simple.

924
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,740
Evil Dili Lama,

925
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,340
why don't you give us your sickening views on this subject?

926
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,960
Gotta, gotta get a hold of myself sometimes.

927
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,560
And when I think about what's going on,

928
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,860
you know, they're gonna make a law.

929
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,820
They're gonna make a law that you can't think for yourself.

930
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,200
They're gonna make a law that you can't buy a record for yourself.

931
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,720
They're gonna make a law that, uh,

932
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,500
Reverend Stang and all the others like him

933
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,060
can't write books for themselves.

934
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,560
And friends, this is serious.

935
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,180
It's funny, oh yeah, it's real funny.

936
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,780
And you're in your BMW now.

937
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,340
Maybe you're going out to the Madonna concert.

938
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,900
And, oh, maybe you're in your little Volkswagen

939
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,940
and driving up North, North Central Expressway.

940
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,240
Or maybe you're over there in Fort Worth.

941
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,120
I don't know where you are right now, but, you know,

942
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,700
you're gonna, you're gonna be walking one of these days.

943
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
And you're gonna sit back and you're gonna remember

944
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,100
all those chances you had to,

945
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,140
to do something with yourself,

946
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,980
to think for yourself,

947
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,680
to act for yourself.

948
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,700
And you're gonna remember Reverend Stang screaming at you.

949
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,000
You're gonna miss those times, friends.

950
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,240
And it's all gonna be because of

951
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,160
what these creationists are trying to do to your mind.

952
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,700
Trying to convince you that the way you are,

953
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,220
the world was created on October 23rd, 4004 B.C..

954
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,140
Well it said so in the Bible.

955
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,840
It said so, so it must be true.

956
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,520
Because I know God wrote the Bible,

957
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,740
must be God that wrote it.

958
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,360
It couldn't have been a bunch of old wise men,

959
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,320
a bunch of smart-alecks like ourselves.

960
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,820
There's 23 different people that wrote the Bible.

961
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,280
And that's a fact.

962
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,260
And Bob was one of them by the way.

963
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,680
Because he figured it was another way to make money

964
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,700
You know, it's one of the largest selling books in the world.

965
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,660
He owns many of the franchises on the printing operations.

966
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,160
So it's just a money-making scam, friends.

967
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,560
But friends, there's even worse things out there.

968
00:37:52,700 --> 00:38:02,880
And Jane or Hyperclete went on the air at the Sisters Station up in Little Rock on RC Guys Show, Real Cool Guys Show,

969
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:10,760
to talk about the terrible prevalence we've been seeing lately of buckets of naked girls.

970
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,020
You can actually go out and buy a bucket of naked girls in Hollywood these days.

971
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,340
And we're going to get to that tape right after this message.

972
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:34,400
Tonight's episode of the Hour of Slack is brought to you by the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company.

973
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:41,800
The Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company features jobs-approved church wear and all manner of weird things.

974
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,720
Serving the public since God knows when.

975
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:54,520
Weeping Cyclops is at Box 595-148, Dallas, Texas 753-59-5148.

976
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,900
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops, for supporting the Hour of Slack.

977
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,020
And K&L in...

978
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,700
Oh, thanks, Weeping Cyclops, indeed.

979
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,740
I don't know where we'd be without the Weeping.

980
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,600
And friends, you need to send for those Dobbs t-shirts and patches, buttons.

981
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,740
And all kinds of stuff from the Weeping Cyclops at that famous P.O. Box.

982
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,960
I have to cut in here before we get to Jayner to announce it.

983
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,080
I mean, when I put in Buck's cart earlier, it was playing only on one channel.

984
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:33,420
And I was thinking, God, couldn't Buck have gone to the trouble of doing that in stereo?

985
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:40,580
Then I put in the Pope S. Cecilia's Weeping Cyclops cart here, and it was doing the same thing, coming out on one channel.

986
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,280
And I was thinking, this is ridiculous. This shouldn't happen.

987
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:53,560
I was in frustration. I pounded really hard, pounded the cart player, and by gobs, it came to life.

988
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,320
It's a miracle. It's a miracle. Praise Bob.

989
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,120
It just goes to show, I swear to God, this is true, friends.

990
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,520
I have to work with tape decks all the time.

991
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,700
And many, many times, those decks go down, and I spray them out and do things to them, and they're still not working right.

992
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,320
And I think, oh, gosh, I'm going to have to take it to the repair guy.

993
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,000
And I found out how much they charge.

994
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:21,760
I get so mad that I actually pick up those decks and slam them down or put them in the car and drive over bumpy roads.

995
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:30,220
And, friends, 90% of the time, driving that tape deck over a bumpy road will repair your tape deck.

996
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,900
Isn't it the truth, Willa Dobbs?

997
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,300
It is the truth, man.

998
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,500
I mean, I just hit this machine, and we got that right channel in.

999
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,960
The acubiting is the truth.

1000
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,100
Bob spoke of acubiting, friends.

1001
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,660
Well, it's time to go to Jayner.

1002
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,860
And, friends, this is sick what he's talking about.

1003
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,720
I hate to think it's real, too, but here we go.

1004
00:40:52,060 --> 00:41:04,720
We've got here a girl that we recently got from a so-called Jayner Hyperclete's Rick Maverick brand bucket of naked girls.

1005
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,820
Now, when I first heard about this, I couldn't believe that this could even possibly exist,

1006
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:15,000
that Hollywood stars could be purchasing buckets of naked girls on the black market.

1007
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,000


1008
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,000


1009
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,000


1010
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:22,380
I thought that was too decadent to even be real, to even be happening.

1011
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,120
Now, it's true that you came to Hollywood in 1974.

1012
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,380
Is that true, Miss Girl?

1013
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,200
Well, I don't know.

1014
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,540
I don't know what year it was, really.

1015
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,900
They just blindfolded me, and I was just like 12 or 13.

1016
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,800
Oh, who was that?

1017
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,540
They just threw me in the bucket.

1018
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:42,960
Plancy dogs?

1019
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,040
Yeah.

1020
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,920
No, they just...

1021
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,660
They gave me acid and all kinds of drugs.

1022
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,080
Oh, my God.

1023
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:49,960
I know.

1024
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,760
It was just...

1025
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,980
The most abhorrent thing I've ever heard of.

1026
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,500
And so you were led to believe that you could get a part in a film?

1027
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,840
Yes.

1028
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,640
They told me I would be a big star.

1029
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,600
They told me I would be the biggest star in Hollywood ever.

1030
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,140
And they showed me contracts and everything.

1031
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,340
But I've just been in a bucket since I was 13 years old.

1032
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,020
And now I'm 27.

1033
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,340
I want to know when my first movie is going to be.

1034
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,240
I mean, what about this big movie I'm supposed to be starring in?

1035
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,080
This is the most horrible...

1036
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,820
I think the public has a right to know.

1037
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,060
We found...

1038
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:30,900
This is...

1039
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,960
We found a warehouse of buckets of naked girls on the outskirts of Hollywood,

1040
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,260
believed to have ties to Rick Maverick and Jader Hyperclete.

1041
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,520
I thought the whole thing was a joke.

1042
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,500
Some kind of prop.

1043
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,320
For one of their quote-unquote skits.

1044
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,140
But upon opening one of the so-called buckets of naked girls,

1045
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,720
we found this girl.

1046
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,760
It took us two weeks before she was even able to talk.

1047
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:04,180
So well had she been brainwashed and trained by the maniacal white slave owners.

1048
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:11,140
Now, is it true that your skin has been chemically processed to reject clothing?

1049
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,500
Yes.

1050
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,320
I can't even...

1051
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:14,680
I...

1052
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,740
One piece...

1053
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:20,140
One inch of clothing just touches my body and it just disintegrates.

1054
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:20,640
It just...

1055
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,240
I can't wear clothes anymore.

1056
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,280
Why are you flashing on that thing?

1057
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:23,660
I just...

1058
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:23,780
I just...

1059
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,320
I glow when the freeze comes down.

1060
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,020
I can't put on gloves when the freeze comes down.

1061
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,000
I don't know what to do.

1062
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,740
I just...

1063
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,780
I'm just doomed to be naked the rest of my life in a bucket.

1064
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,080
I mean, what can I do?

1065
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,420
It's not so bad, really.

1066
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,580
This is tragic.

1067
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:43,340
I mean, I'm embarrassed that we're even having to talk to you up here with you naked.

1068
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:43,940
I really...

1069
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,260
I mean, this is...

1070
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,160
This is completely sexist for a liberal like me.

1071
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,300
Yeah, y'all ought to see this.

1072
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,680
I mean, really.

1073
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,960
Oh, come on, R.C.

1074
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,020
Give her a break.

1075
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,680
This is a human being.

1076
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,640
This is just one of the most...

1077
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,920
This is the most sick, degenerative thing I've ever...

1078
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,960
It is sick, friends.

1079
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,700
It is really horrible.

1080
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,400
And Dr. Hyperclete's here has been reporting for a long time.

1081
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,180
Of course, some think that this is just a giant advertisement for the hyperclete.

1082
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,240
It's bucket to naked...

1083
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,940
Robert Wisdom just walked in.

1084
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,720
By the way, his show, The American Music Party, is coming up in less than 10 minutes.

1085
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,460
But he walked in and said, they are saying bucket, aren't they?

1086
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,360
Friends, I'm going to try running just out of a sense of fairness.

1087
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,700
I'm going to try running Buck's cart again here.

1088
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,900
Here we go.

1089
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:42,920
Stereo.

1090
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,240
Hi.

1091
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:50,000
Buck Naked, pastor of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius, inviting you to a Bob Righteous

1092
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,080
full squirt devourable August 8th, Saturday night at 8 o'clock at the Bar of Soap.

1093
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,380
See and hear many other wild schismatic preachers.

1094
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,480
Uber Pope's dominatrix, Cecilia Smith.

1095
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,000
Bob Righteous reverend, Buddy West.

1096
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,360
Hill Swami, Satellite Weavers.

1097
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,240
Dr. Chaos of the Chaotic Church of New Deal.

1098
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,960
Deacon Tom Williams.

1099
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,000
Not a Bobby in the bunch, friends.

1100
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,580
All the above have ministered repeatedly on the Hour of Slack radio show.

1101
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:25,160
Plus, Archdoctor St. Margaret Moser, high priestess of the cult of Chilkat from Austin, Texas.

1102
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,840
And J.R. Bob Dobbs will be there.

1103
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,700
Yes, he's alive, friends.

1104
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,220
The San Francisco cool guy Bob may be dead, but my Bob isn't dead.

1105
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,280
Is yours?

1106
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,220
Unfortunately, local broadcaster Ivan Stang will be unable to attend.

1107
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,120
But friend, you can hear Stang on any radio.

1108
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:50,200
Now these incredible ministers can spit fire, heal the sick, and sicken the healthy.

1109
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,280
Boom shakalemaka.

1110
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,940
Afraid of this little snake here, son?

1111
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,360
August 8th, 8 o'clock, Bar of Soap, across from the Fair Park Gate.

1112
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,940
Praise Bob! Free at last.

1113
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,740
This is John Shirley, science fiction writer John Shirley.

1114
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,320
John Shirley sent in his bad drug trip tales.

1115
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,440
Friends, where are yours?

1116
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,720
Are you aware?

1117
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,720
Are you aware?

1118
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,700
Are you aware?

1119
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,760
The sound is movement of the air.

1120
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,760
Are you aware?

1121
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,840
Are you aware

1122
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,760
Are you aware

1123
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,840
That music reaches out

1124
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,820
To shake what's there

1125
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,440
Can you feel it

1126
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,740
It's a physical force

1127
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,640
An unseen touching

1128
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,760
An expression of its source

1129
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,640
Are you aware

1130
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,880
Are you aware

1131
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,380
Are you aware

1132
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,560
That a ghost runs its fingers

1133
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,540
Through your hair

1134
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,440
And did you know

1135
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,660
And did you know

1136
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,740
And did you know

1137
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,460
And did you know

1138
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,460
And did you know

1139
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:52,400
That sound is a kind of light

1140
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,260
Moving slow

1141
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,380
Kind of blind

1142
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:11,320
Can you feel

1143
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,740
My sonic power

1144
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,500
Yes

1145
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,420
Can you feel

1146
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,140
These sonic fingers

1147
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,340
Can you feel

1148
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,100
A sonic finger

1149
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,240
Can you feel

1150
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,000
A sonic finger

1151
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,100
Feel this now

1152
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,300
Feel it

1153
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,760
Well it's a physical force

1154
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,720
An unseen touching

1155
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,980
An expression of its source

1156
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:21,800
себя

1157
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,860
I am touching your flesh

1158
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,240
I am touching your flesh

1159
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,180
Robin Hood

1160
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:40,220
I am touching your flesh

1161
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,960
I am touching the flesh

1162
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:41,960


1163
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:41,960


1164
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:41,960


1165
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,380
I am touching your flesh.

1166
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:50,280
I am touching your flesh right now.

1167
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,480
Are you equal to this dance?

1168
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,200
Will you welcome this invisible guest?

1169
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,800
Are you equal to this dance?

1170
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,200
Will you welcome the invisible guest?

1171
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,480
Can you feel my sonic finger?

1172
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,300
Can you feel my sonic finger?

1173
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,060
Friends, I know you can feel it.

1174
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,400
I know you can feel it.

1175
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,200
And you can, you can, are you up to it?

1176
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,980
Will you go through, will you make it in that final test?

1177
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,800
You can find out by writing for information.

1178
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,120
You don't even have to send money.

1179
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,740
You don't have to send money.

1180
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,700
Not even a dollar.

1181
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,380
Just free for information.

1182
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,280
Not like what you get.

1183
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:21,540
Well, and friends, you can write to that mighty Bob himself at P.O. Box 1403-06 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

1184
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,960
That's right.

1185
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:32,380
Write for information to Bob Box 1403-06 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

1186
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,260
And stay tuned for Robert.

1187
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,480
Robert Wisdom in American Music Party.

1188
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,020
This, by the way, this instrumental going out is by Mark Mothersbaugh.

1189
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:50,020
I honestly have no idea where or how it got here, but it did.

1190
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,760
And we do know it's him.

1191
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,140
That's what G. Gordon Gordon said.

1192
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,940
And he'll kill you if you disagree with him.

1193
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,900
Praise Bob.

1194
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,980
Who he'll move?

1195
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,960
Mother who?

1196
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:26,660
I don't remember.

1197
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,040
pes Zustcé and the audio made by Sculpey.

1198
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,040
