The war is still going on.
But friends, back when we were told it was just starting back in March,
the lymph node institute doctors of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse at Noble WREK Atlanta
reacted to it and did this show, which I'm about to play belatedly.
Except that the war is still going on.
So, in lieu of Hour of Slack 915 or as it, enjoy the lymph node institute's oil war show.
Hello. I'll bet you thought the conspiracy had finally shut us up.
Oh no. You'll know when the man shuts us down,
because we'll all be there together in the great big gulag in the sky.
Tonight's show will be very long and very tough up.
It was born two weeks ago as an Ides of March slash war show.
However, it's no longer the Ides of March, so we'll save that part for the end.
However, if at some point we refer to the impending war,
or if we say hello half a dozen times, it is either due to time control,
or terminal denial.
Hi.
Hello there.
Welcome to Hour 12 of our nonstop Bob's Slack Time Funhouse war-a-thon.
We've been trying to avoid this subject.
We try to be your shining beacon of slack,
so you can avoid these, the general that the world is turning into.
We don't really care about you, the listener, at all, but we feel that it is...
Hey, I do.
I'll edit that out. Don't worry.
Hey.
Okay. Well, he does. I don't.
But we should do something in the way of public service.
The two major monotheisms are about to have a big old rumble,
which I actually thought was going to happen a lot sooner.
But here we are, and it's finally going to happen.
There's been...
It's been a longstanding goal to restore to U.S. control
the second largest oil reserves in the world.
It's been recognized ever since the mid-40s,
quote the State Department in 1945,
that this is a major component of what they called
a stupendous source of strategic power
and one of the greatest material prizes in world history.
And a major theme of U.S. foreign policy since the Second World War
has been to make sure that the U.S. dominates it.
France was expelled on the interesting grounds that...
It was an enemy state since it had been occupied by Germany,
so therefore its contracts were void.
And England was slowly reduced to what the foreign office calls...
British foreign office calls a junior partner.
The U.S. puts it differently.
Forty years ago, a senior statesman,
probably Dean Acheson, in internal discussion
described Britain as our lieutenant.
The fashionable word is partner.
And they like to hear the fashionable word.
But the reality is the actual word.
And control over Middle East oil has been a very large part of it
from the Second World War.
Let me stress that it's control, it's not access.
There's a lot of confusion about that.
The United States really doesn't care much about access to Middle East oil.
From up until 1970, it didn't care at all.
North America was the biggest producer,
but it didn't affect the need to control the region.
Since then,
the biggest importer has usually been Venezuela.
If you look at U.S. intelligence projections,
for example, the National Intelligence Council projections
for the next 15 years,
they predict and suggest that the U.S. should rely on
a more secure Atlantic Basin of resources,
West Africa and Latin America.
But that has nothing to do with control over Middle East oil.
That has to do with it being one of the greatest material prizes in world history,
which means that whoever controls it
and can have an effect on setting the price and production levels
can also determine that the wealth,
the vast amount of the wealth,
flows right back here.
And it does.
It's independent of access to oil.
A source of strategic power has nothing to do with access.
That has to do,
that translates as a lever of world control.
And that's been recognized clearly since the 1940s
and it remains true today.
Well, September 11th gave the pretext,
the domestic politics affects the timing,
and the strategy has been working quite brilliantly.

This species, and especially this country, knows a hell of a lot of things about war.
Started having to fight Indians when we got dumped here.
Well, we didn't have to fight them, but we chose to kill them.
They had all these fields cleared off that we wanted to build our towns in.
We had to kill them and take it.
And then we had to, you know, fight off other colonies.
The frogs.
There's been a longstanding problem with the French in America.
We helped them in their revolution.
Revolution.
And they helped us in ours.
Very much so.
They sent generals.
They sent tacticians out here.
France has done more for us than probably any other country in the world.
And we hate them.
Well, we don't hate them.
The English do.
And the bluebloods of our own society hate them because the French know what to do with their royalty.
They don't let them hang around and draw a stipend.
They empty them out in the middle of the street.
When you are anointed by God to be the king to run the world, egalitarian values.
Don't really work out so well.
So you can take your freedom fries and stuff them up your ass.
I say we bulldoze the goddamn Statue of Liberty.
Just push it into the fucking water.
We don't need anything from those frogs.
The French gave us the Statue of Liberty and we gave them Jerry Lewis.
Listen, you know, the French know a lot about cheese.
They know a lot about oral sex.
French generals suck.
OK, I'll grant you that.
You take my life, but I'll take your soul.
You throw your musket foot or run your throat.
So when you're waiting for the next attack.
You better stay and there's no turning back.
The vehicle sails, the charge begins.
But on the battlefield no one wins.
The smell of acrid smoking hoists is free.
As they plunge on into certain death.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, these words were fair with word to word.
A matter of the rushing gas.
And as we race towards the human war.
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We are the bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians are another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
Oh

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
I burst a rail, take my arm below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting pro-no
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

I've got to get out of this room



Hey, you guys
I'm Captain Kilgore Moose
Jesus
Your Francois, the famous downhill skier
Oui, it is I
We, it is I
Come on, hop on
We got some toy boys to hot-knock
Ponches, ponches
It's Francois Frog, the downhiller
Oh boy, this I gotta see
Oh, boy, this I gotta see
Hey, Francois
Watch me pull out some skis from my helmet
Watch me pull out some skis from my helmet
He's that safe in a helicopter?
Probably not



Probably not. I guess that's why you're the expert.
Hey Pontius, set it down on that mountain top.
Get out and ski, Francois.
What should I do?
You're coming with me. You gotta see this.
Good luck, crazy, stupid Canucks.
Phil and the moose soared high above the battlefield, the sleigh dangling beneath them.
Look how that hill breaks. To the left and to the right.
There it is. That hollowed out tree.
Our intelligence reports say that's where the elves make their cookies.
And chemical weapons.
We're gonna burn the hell out of that tree.
And every damn toy boy in it, under it and around it.
The ski patrol waged a fearsome offensive on the tree with tow missiles.
Alright Pontius, let them have the hot nog.
Oh, this is gonna be great.
You smell that? Do you smell that?
Fresh baked cookies, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that.
Oh, I love the smell of cookies in the morning.
You know, one time we had a tree hot nogged for 12 hours.
When it was all over, I walked up. We didn't find one of them.
And not one goddamn toy boy corpse.
The smell. You know that cinnamon smell? The whole hill.
Smelled like... smelled like victory.
This conflict started August 2nd, when the dictator of Iraq
invaded a small and helpless neighborhood.
The crime has nothing to do with invasions.
It's pretty much duplicating what the US had just done a couple of months before in Panama.
Kuwait, a member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations was crushed.
Its people brutalized.
Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait.
He certainly is a brutal tyrant and a mass murderer, just as he was when the US was openly supporting him.
The overwhelming majority of his crimes were committed during this period when he was a friend and a ally.
While the world waited, Saddam Hussein systematically raped, pillaged and plundered a tiny nation.
No threat to his own.
At the time of the Hababja atrocities and later atrocities against the Kurds,
the atrocities were being carried out with the support of George Bush and Margaret Thatcher.
He subjected the people of Kuwait to unspeakable atrocities.
And among those maimed and murdered, innocent children.
The attack on the Kurds in northern Iraq destroyed large agricultural areas,
as well as killing plenty of people, probably tens of thousands.
Innocent children.
Plenty of people, probably tens of thousands.
Murdered.
That gave Bush an opportunity to do a favor for big US agribusiness
and send extensive credits to Saddam Hussein so he can purchase agribusiness exports.
After they had wiped out the agricultural areas in Iraq.
Others traveled to Baghdad in a variety of efforts to restore peace and justice.
So concerned to evade diplomatic efforts, and they did.
Arab leaders sought what became known as an Arab solution,
only to conclude that Saddam Hussein was unwilling to leave Kuwait.
Chief of Staff Powell in internal discussion said the problem is that Saddam may withdraw
leaving a puppet regime in place at which point everyone in the Arab world will be happy.
That's what they expected and they wanted to prevent.
No choice but to drive Saddam from Kuwait by force.
We will not fail.
The rebelling Iraqi generals requested from the United States, from General Schwarzkopf,
they wanted to obtain, didn't want help, but they wanted access to captured Iraqi arms
that they could use in their effort to overthrow the tyrant and carry out a popular revolution.
Now that was refused. They were not permitted access to arms.
Saddam Hussein was authorized to use military gunships to attack.
Rebels, air attacks are underway against military targets in Iraq.
Our operations are designed to best protect the lives of all the coalition leaders.

Unspeakable atrocities.
Biological warfare with exactly the catastrophic effect that they predicted.
Iraq will eventually comply with all relevant United Nations resolutions
and then when peace is restored, it is our hope that Iraq will live as a peaceful and cooperative member of the family of nations,
thus enhancing the security and stability of the Gulf.
The rebellion was crushed, Basra was devastated, so were other areas,
and the Bush administration was pretty frank about the reasons.
March 1991, after the so-called war, they simply preferred what they called an iron-fisted Iraqi junta
to the threat of a popular revolution.
Cooperative members.
And therefore had to, in the name of what's called stability.
Stability of the Gulf.
Had to support these men.
Major atrocities.
Unspeakable atrocities.
In which very possibly as many or more civilians were killed during the bombing a month earlier.
We will not say.
From here to eternity.
Mildred Pierce reporting.
I was there, I saw it.
I saw women thrown down on 5th Avenue.
And raped in their mink coats.
By blacks and whites and yellows.
While street urchins stripped the rings from their fingers.
A young officer stood nearby.
Aren't you going to do something, I demanded.
He looked at me and yawned.
I found Colonel Bradshaw bivouacking in the Ritz.
I told him bluntly what was going on.
His eyes glinted shamelessly as he said.
Well, you have to take a broad general view of things.
And that's what I have been doing.
Taking a broad general view of American troops raping and murdering helpless civilians.
While American officers stand around and yawn.
We've had it a long time ladies.
The old army game.
From here to eternity.
It pays to pay the boys off.
Tacitus describes a typical scene.
If a woman or a good looking boy fell into their hands.
They were torn to pieces in the struggle for possession.
And the survivors were left to cut each other's throats.
Well, there's no need to be that messy.
Why waste a good looking boy?
Mother loving American army run by old women.
Many of them are religious.
My God.
Hanging American soldiers.
Raping and murdering civilians.
Oh Sarge Bellows.
From here to eternity.
What the bloody hell are civilians for?
Soldiers pay.
There was the American Revolution.
The French Revolution.
And then the second American Revolution.
Which hasn't technically happened.
Not quite.
Not quite yet.
I couldn't believe what they did to those protesters.
God, why would they use gas on American people like that?
I guess they took a page out of the Iraqi methodology.
Gassed his own people.
The Kurds are not Saddam Hussein's own people.
They're in the way.
The Kurds in the way.
Kurds in way.
I mean that's just propaganda.
Propaganda during wartime?
I know it's strange isn't it?
Yes, we have used chemical weapons on our own people.
We've tested them on our own soldiers.
We've released them into the air in San Francisco.
We gave black guys syphilis just to see what would happen.
And same thing with LSD.
We injected black guys with LSD to see how long it would take them to freak out.
The answer?
I don't know.

policy as one of consistent unequivocal support for Saddam Hussein in the war against Iran.
CIA Director Casey personally spearheaded the effort to ensure that Iraq had sufficient
military weapons, ammunition, and vehicles to avoid losing the Iran-Iraq war. The United States
actively supported the Iraqi war effort by supplying the Iraqis with billions of dollars
of credits by providing U.S. military intelligence and advice to the Iraqis. The United States also
provided strategic operational advice to the Iraqis to better use their assets in combat.
Teicher said,
I personally attended meetings in which CIA Director Casey or CIA Deputy Director Gates
noted the need for Iraq to have certain weapons such as cluster bombs and anti-armor penetrators
in order to stave off the Iraq war.
When I joined the NSC staff in early 1982, CIA Director Casey was adamant that cluster
bombs were a perfect force multiplier that would allow the Iraqis to defend against the
human waves of Iranian attackers. Teicher noted,
Teicher's NSC files are in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Archives in Simi Valley, California.
The affidavit can be found online under,

Real History Archives.
Unquote.
The U.S. Department of Commerce licensed 70 biological exports to Iraq between 1985 and
1989, including at least 21 batches of lethal strains of anthrax sent by the American Type
Culture Collection, then situated in Rockville and now in Virginia.
Shipments continued beyond Reagan under President Bush after the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988.
In other words,
Saddam Hussein was still able to purchase biological products for at least four more
years after the justification of U.S. administration worry about Iran was passed.
Also between 1985 and 1989, Iraq's Atomic Energy Commission got 17 batches of, quote,
various toxins and bacteria, unquote.
In 1985, the CDC, now the CDCP, shipped at least three samples of Western-style nuclear

substances to Iraq in addition to the most ghastly ever crowned nile fever virus for from

Coleman et al. vs. Alkalak et al. names several, including Alkalak, Phillips Petroleum, Unilever, Allied Signal, and Teledyne.
The case was dismissed due to jurisdictional reasons.
Aside from biological and chemical products, American companies were also licensed by the Commerce Department to supply Saddam with computers, components, electronics, and specialized equipment for future weaponry.
Other shipments went to Iraq without benefit of licensing.
The late Congressman Henry B. Gonzalez of San Antonio, chairman of the House Banking Committee, entered at least 30 documents into the Congressional Record as part of his investigation into U.S. assistance to Iraq.
That was, again, an excerpt from The Enemy of My Enemy is My Customer, Iraq and the Bush Administrations by Margie Burns, September 5, 2002.
And don't get me wrong, I think Pink Boys killing Pink Boys is tasty.
But when the Chinese general responsible for American re-education presents you with these facts, don't say you weren't warned.
Greetings. This is the Secretary of War at the State Department of the United States.
We have a problem. The companies want something done about this sluggish world economic situation.
Profits have been running more than a little thin lately, and we need to stimulate some growth.
Now, we know that there's an alarmingly high number of young people roaming around in your country with nothing to do with the U.S. economy.

Stir up trouble for the police and damage private property.
Doesn't look like they'll ever get a job.
It's about time we did something constructive with these people.
We've got thousands of them here, too.
They're crawling all over.
The companies think it's time we all sit down, have a serious get-together, and start another war.
The president, oh, he loves the idea.
All those missiles streaming overhead to and fro.
Hey, Paul. People running down the road, skin on fire.
Iraqis.
Saddam.
Been itching for the real thing for years.
Want a little going-away present for Mr.
Hussein.
Well, Afghanistan's no fun.
So, what do you say?
We don't even have to win this war.
We just want a cut down on some of this excess population.
Hello.
Just start up a draft.
Draft as many of those people as you can.
We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on.
Give them an hour or two to learn how to use an automatic rifle.
Send them on their way.
El Salvador and Northern Ireland are a moderately repressive regime in South America.
We'll just cook up a good threat story in the Middle East.
We need that oil.
We had Libya all ready to go.
Although, Colonel Qaddafi's hit squad didn't even show up.
I tell you, that man is unreliable.
The Russians had their finger on the button just like we did for that one.
Just think for a minute.
We can make this war so big.
So big.
The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper.
We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queue if we plan this war.
That's right.
Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls.
Don't worry about those demonstrators.
Just pump up your drug supply.
So many people have hooked themselves on heroin and amphetamine since we took over.
Just like Vietnam.
We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong.
Kept the war functioning just fine.
It's easy.
We got our college kids so interested in beer, they don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again.
The nuclear stockpile in their backyard, they wouldn't even know what it looked like.
So how about it?
I mean, look, war is money.
The arms manufacturers tell me unless we get our bomb factories up to full production, the whole economy is gonna collapse.
The Soviets are in the same boat.
We all agree the time has come to the big ones.
So what do you say?
It was marvelous.
That's excellent.
We knew you'd agree.
The companies will be very pleased.
And then I heard a lot of people get their stuff back.

Dad!
I'm a living fucking
I'm a living fucking
These are the times that rock and soul
I tell you this, I don't know what's gonna happen man, but I wanna have my kicks before the whole dish house goes up in flames, alright!
But, boo-ni-puff-hoo, they have their problems and we have ours.
One of our main problems is that many creatures will exert no effort until forced to do so by a need or threat.
If you are one of these, then it is time to consider acquiring a few defensive adaptations.
Yes, it is evolution time!
Don't worry, your helix is old and has twisted past far worse than this, so just relax and listen.
First and foremost, it is absolutely necessary that you remember that you are not alone.

Remember to breathe.
I know this may sound a bit elementary, but the basics are so easily overlooked.
I have seen many a smooth operator busted by a gasp.
Regulating the depth and frequency of your respiration not only moderates your heart rate and blood pressure, but also provides a certain sense of personal continuity.
In a similar vein, resist the temptation to scratch your itches.
In the literal physical sense now.
Not the dirty little urination.
The things that get you into so much trouble.
While the full explanation of this exercise is out of the question, I will say that if you can refrain from this proprietary habit, then, hypothetically, this practiced willful resistance can travel with you up the scale of physical and psychic invasion to the uncharted territory of technological torture, leaving the, uh, client intact within the parameters of the, uh...
The, uh...
Adverse stimuli.
And while we are on the subject of torture, you need to learn to lie.
That is, pull the wool over your own eyes.
Learn to lie to yourself.
You must fully internalize your lies, whether they are part of a cover story or an innocuous explanation for your particularly freaky endeavor.
Memorize your lies.
Practice them in front of a mirror, a long mirror.
You lie with your entire body.
Lie to yourself in front of the long mirror until you convince yourself.
Also of crucial importance, you will need your senses crackling at full capacity.
By now, you should have already sharpened your defensive paranoia to a hair's breadth.
If not, then you are dangerously behind the curve and the only advice I can offer is to try to notice everything and use every drop of your sensorial flood to construct a mental, emotional, and emotional response.
Evanescent, and ecocentric universe.
Which,
some studies show to be the most accurate model.
Of course, none of this may prove relevant right now, this minute.
Then again, it might.
And I've always thought it better to be overly vigilant in advance,
than to be caught with your input jack dangling in the breeze.
If you still have time,
please direct any questions to PO BOX 670-541 Marietta, Georgia.
PO BOX 670-541 Marietta, Georgia.
30066-0126.
If you missed that,
we will give it one final time
at the end of the show.
Good luck.
We are in it for a comeback
The sirens that live through the day
Prepared for war we will kill
We will all prove what we find our way
Closer to the sword
Feel the smell of burning bodies
The sound of screaming men
For peace we will stay
We rise to kill under God's command
Attack and serve our fatherland
We want to kill and ready to fight
Under God's command
Cause we are right
On the fields are made tonight
Panzers filled with metal
Our heroes will be left behind
In our memories still immortal
We have lost the war
But still we got the will to be free
Which we've placed it in
The songs we sing out loud
We rise to kill under God's command
Attack and serve our fatherland
We want to kill and ready to fight
Under God's command
Cause we are right
Attack and serve our fatherland
We rise to kill under God's command
Attack and serve our fatherland
We rise to kill under God's command
Attack and serve our fatherland

We rise to kill under God's command

Hang on centuries




Oh I realized

War will come to Moea

We'll be right back.
That's the reason why.
That's the reason why.
Break and kill under God's command.
War tech can serve a fatherland.
War boy to kill and ready to fight.
War boy to kill and ready to fight.
War boy to kill and ready to fight.
War boy to kill and ready to fight.
So good luck with that war, everybody.
Yeah, we'll be in the bunker.
We'll probably come back and be talking about shoes or some mundane crap.

Because we don't want to live in a world full of zombies.
Do you?
Oops.
Too late.
You heard Noam Chomsky talking about the American plan to take over the world again.
And behind that and a few other pieces were the master musicians of Zizuka wailing away.
Faith no more.
Belting.
Be aggressive.
The Iron Maidens.
A female Iron Maiden cover band.
LNI did the hot-nogging of the Toy Boys excerpt from Apocalypse Clause.
Then you heard George Bush and Noam Chomsky all cut up there together by somebody.
And then William Burroughs and the disposable heroes of hypocrisy.
Performing Mildred Pierce reporting from here to eternity.
Then Jimi Hendrix.
With the bombs and rockets portion of the Star Spangled Banner.
And then old rummy Don Rumsfeld doing what he does best.
I love that line.
I don't know that.
I'll remember that one.
Then Slayer performed chemical warfare.
And then I read excerpts from an article by Margie Burns.
The Dead Kennedys lampooned kinky sex makes the world go round.
Then you heard the coping with monogamy.
Theologi's lecture.
The Police State Collage.
And then the second half of the lecture from the Police State Survival Show.
All by LNI.
And then you were gripped in the talons of a tough but unwieldy bird.
From Holland.
Hammerhawk.
Performing war.
And I want President Bush to get a good look at this.
Real good look here.
It's the only son I had.
Only son.
And then he walks away a lot of tears.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Superior mutants.
Repent.
Quit your job.
Slayer.
The world ends tomorrow.
