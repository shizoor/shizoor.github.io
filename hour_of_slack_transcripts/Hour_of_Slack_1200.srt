1
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,340
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:25,700
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,500
of our life.

4
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:58,740
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius

5
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:29,980
of our life.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,620
Sometime in early 1996, praise Bob.

7
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,960
Sometime in early 1996, praise Bob.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,520
Sometime in Cleveland.

9
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,040
And it was an ugly, ugly night.

10
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,420
But we survived and we bring you the skeletons, the remnants of that evening.

11
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,700
Hello.

12
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,840
Hello.

13
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,940
Hello.

14
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,340
Hello.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,260
Hello.

16
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,540
My name is Chaz.

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,520
And we are Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

18
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,220
And that's what you were just listening to was Einstein's Secret Orchestra performing

19
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,860
for you.

20
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,000
That was last week's show.

21
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,860
Let's put last week's show away and create a whole new show just for you.

22
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,900
I think we should put this guy over here on the turntable where he belongs.

23
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,580
Oh, he didn't want to do that.

24
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,700
Okay, there he is.

25
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,180
Break dancing.

26
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,500
Well, by the time you get this communicated, it'll be too late.

27
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,400
The pigs are outside the door.

28
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,840
What I want to know is who speaks for Earth.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,880
Hey, here's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

30
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,060
Michelle down in the other studio on that box there.

31
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm sitting here with a keyboard.

32
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,780
And Dave's got his guitar.

33
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,620
And Lisa Lisa is over there.

34
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,160
And the Reverend.

35
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,960
Reverend Ivan Stang standing right behind me.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,040
And that's a dangerous proposition, boys and girls.

37
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,100
Crazy.

38
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,660
Crazy.

39
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,120
Crazy.

40
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Princess Lisa.

41
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,220
The KY Jelly is ready to go.

42
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,820
And everyone is standing around in line.

43
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,400
Look, they fell for it again.

44
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,460
They're back again.

45
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Told you they'd do it.

46
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,760
And they always fall for it every time.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,020
Always will again and again.

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,160
Again.

49
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


50
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


51
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


52
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


53
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


56
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


58
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


59
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


60
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


63
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,160


65
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,980
Thought you could get away, did you?

66
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,160
Look at it.

67
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,940
He doesn't even remember, does he?

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,560
No, no, no.

69
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,020
Just let him guess.

70
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,840
We'll just let him drift in and out of realities for a while.

71
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,460
Who speaks for Earth?

72
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,080
Who sells for Earth?

73
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,720
And who will buy Earth?

74
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,080
I'm afraid this is the end of the game.

75
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,080


76
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,580
Here's one for Mother.

77
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,540
You are about to discover a part of yourself

78
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,700
that you have never dared dream might exist.

79
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,080
This show will be a personal experience

80
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,180
between you and the man with the pipe.

81
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,820
You are about to rip open a yawning chasm

82
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,160
in what you see.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,160


84
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,160


85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:37,240
thought was your personality. You will stand on the brink of a hole deep within yourself.

86
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:45,500
A pit, a pit, and a stinky pit, and then the very deepest, blackest part of the pit that

87
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:59,260
is your mind. You will discover Bob. But first, let's step back out into the real world. The

88
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,580
real world. The real world.

89
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,820
Now that you have achieved, Trans State, come with us.

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,180
Come and travel in the astral planes as we seek that which is dark.

91
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,280
But first, you must pull loose from your own body. Yes, it's easy. Just a little tug.

92
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:43,660
Close your eyes. Float upward and give your soul a little tug. You'll see. You are free.

93
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,660
You're free.

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:53,660
You never thought your soul a little tug? Did you? You never thought it would be so easy, did you?

95
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,580
Then let's go upwards.

96
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,380
Let's float.

97
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:04,660
Upwards. To get perspective. Upwards. Higher. Towards heaven.

98
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:15,100
But we'll stop here in space first. Just past the Earth's atmosphere. You see? We can go anywhere instantly this way.

99
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:26,620
And it was all so easy, right within humanity's grasp all along. And you know the secret. Really. You can go anywhere. Let's try something new.

100
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,180
Trans State.

101
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,200
Trans State.

102
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Trans State.

103
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,340
Trans State.

104
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,180
Trans State.

105
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,000
Trans State.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,200
Trans State.

107
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,300
Trans State.

108
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,860
Trans State.

109
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,000
Trans State.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,480
Trans State.

111
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,340
Trans State.

112
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,400
Trans State.

113
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,940
Trans State.

114
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,760
Trans State.

115
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:58,760


116
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:58,760


117
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,780
Trans State.

118
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:00,840
Trans State.

119
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:00,920
Trans State.

120
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,420
Trans State.

121
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,160
Trans State.

122
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,120
Trans State.

123
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,440
Trans State.

124
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,340
this trench in the middle of this

125
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,760
blistering hell planet

126
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,380
and sent it due to sitting chained

127
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,580
in this ditch forever.

128
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,220
Just waiting, waiting

129
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,440
until the ticks come again.

130
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,220
Yes, just waiting.

131
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,780
The giant ticks.

132
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,660
Here they come again.

133
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,100
Let's start shooting.

134
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,060
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

135
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,700
Yeah, don't look.

136
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,340
Look.

137
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,360
Keep shooting.

138
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,440
You could shoot another one in another hole

139
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,000
and you'll never kill them all.

140
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,960
Keep shooting. Keep shooting.

141
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,080
Just keep shooting.

142
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,680
See, just like your job.

143
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,440
Back at home, ain't it, boy?

144
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Yep.

145
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,400
You just can't get away.

146
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,780
You can't get away from them ticks.

147
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,280
My friends.

148
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,940
My friends.

149
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
So join them.

150
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,120
My mother never answered

151
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
one of my prayers.

152
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,220
I made obeisances.

153
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,540
Well, you paid Obias since today,

154
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:14,980
but

155
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,400
did you pay money?

156
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
Actual cash, green and gravel.

157
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,860
Think about it, boys.

158
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,240
Don't wait till everyone

159
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,920
in your neighborhood's got the bomb.

160
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,720
Nuke them.

161
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,860
Now at Hiroshima Schwartz's

162
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,420
Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

163
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,360
Hi, friends. I'm Hiroshima Schwartz

164
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,840
of Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

165
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,120
Home of the Mini-Mag,

166
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,940
the Pocket Thunder,

167
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,360
the baby neutrino that leaves their apartments intact,

168
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,520
and many other fine, low-range,

169
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,520
bad nukes.

170
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,300
These teeny-tiny warheads actually fit in your wallet,

171
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,320
purse, or pocketbook.

172
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,340
And what's on special this week at Hiroshima Schwartz?

173
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,360
It's the giant X-Day

174
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,100
drill sale.

175
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,820
Now until the wee-wee hours of July

176
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,060
6, 1996.

177
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,640
We are literally giving away

178
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
tons and tons of useless

179
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
and useful weapons.

180
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,620
It's the Werner Von Braumeister Party Special

181
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,820
that blows away 50 party pinks at a time,

182
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,980
leaving the party intact.

183
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,740
Disguised as a four-gallon keg that first draft,

184
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,100
really packs a wallop.

185
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,060
But for paid subgenius,

186
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,340
it's the smart prairie squid face-seeking special.

187
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,640
I'm sorry, I always get that wrong.

188
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,100
It reads your mind

189
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,020
and literally knows where to send the warby.

190
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,600
Finally, now until X-Day,

191
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
bloodier than any golf pro,

192
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,300
it's the exploding head of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

193
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,180
When the pipe lights, it's armed.

194
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,020
When launched, it zaps up to 100.

195
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,220
That's 100 useless bobbies at a time.

196
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,940
Friends, don't wait till it's too late.

197
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,520
Everyone will soon have the bomb.

198
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,880
Nuke them now, from now till X-Day.

199
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,600
And beyond, we are literally

200
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,880
blowing up the competition.

201
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,100
Hiroshima Schwartz's X-Day End of the World Sale.

202
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,880
Tell them Bob sent you and received 23% off.

203
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,880
Batteries not included.

204
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,560
Some assembly required.

205
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,180
You know, I've been eating alien shmegma pie

206
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,620
for almost 50 years.

207
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,680
Since those first shoster crashes near Roswell.

208
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,520
My sons grew up on it.

209
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,300
His sons too.

210
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,060
Here in Wilbur Bullets.

211
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,760
Wilbur Bullets is natural as pie.

212
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,140
But many folks don't know about alien shmegma pie.

213
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,780
Things kind of changed

214
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,020
since we landed on the moon.

215
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,760
Some things we didn't even know.

216
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,980
Some folks believe in things called greys.

217
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Gramps, did you eat your pie today?

218
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,580
It's my daughter, always worrying.

219
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,700
Hey Gramps, when are we going to go

220
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
to the nude dancer's norian?

221
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm going to go to the nude dancer's norian.

222
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:43,600


223
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:43,600


224
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,400
I'm going to go to the massage parlor.

225
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,280
And that grandson of mine always keeps me running.

226
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,580
Then forget our little appointment.

227
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,380
Oh, nice and tidy.

228
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,060
I've been staying in a sack with Grandma for a long time

229
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,400
thanks to alien shmegma pie.

230
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,900
All I know is alien shmegma pie is made of a cheesy wax

231
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,040
from alien genitalia.

232
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,320
It's made me sexually active again.

233
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,500
And it tastes great.

234
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,660
That's all I know.

235
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,800
Building a new race in this life is hard.

236
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,220
And nothing gets it as hard as alien shmegma pie.

237
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,300
Alien shmegma pie, the taste that's out of this world.

238
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,580
Bob loves me and I love Bob.

239
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,360
He hates you.

240
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,900
He hates you.

241
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,560
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

242
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,780
No, he hates me.

243
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,640
He hates you, Dave.

244
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,780
He hates you.

245
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,760
Bob hates you.

246
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,840
J.R. Bob Dobbs has answered all of my prayers.

247
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,680
He even told me go and fling myself down the stairs.

248
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,320
I did it on a lark, but now I'm glad.

249
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,440
Bob loves me and I love Bob.

250
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,140
He hates you.

251
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,060
You may love Bob, but Bob hates you, Dave.

252
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,260
He makes you fling yourself down the stairs for fun.

253
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,460
Oh, I love Bob.

254
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,780
And Bob loves me.

255
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,020
Bob loves me.

256
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,460
We're sweet and slimy just like little bees on a tree.

257
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,120
And he pulls me on Valentine's Day.

258
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
And I'm sending flowers and chocolate.

259
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,480
And he loves me anyway.

260
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,220
I said it.

261
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,240
Bob loves me.

262
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,140
And I love Bob.

263
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,540
He hates me, Dave.

264
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,920
What could be more pure?

265
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,600
It's the purest form of love anyone could imagine.

266
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,080
He answers all my letters.

267
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,100
He calls me up and leaves messages on my phone.

268
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,300
He's always with me.

269
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,400
He's always with me.

270
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:42,480
He's always with me.

271
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,760
He's always with me.

272
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,220
He's always with me.

273
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,400
You know,

274
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,400


275
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,400


276
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,400


277
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,400


278
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,400


279
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,400


280
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,060
Bob loves me and I love Bob.

281
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,300
Don't be a sucker, Dave.

282
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,220
And now he's not in love on his television.

283
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,700
He tells that to all the boys.

284
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,140
He tells that to all the boys.

285
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,300
And now he's so stupid because木 æô бøenoś

286
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,520
He makes you feel good.

287
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:04,680
He makes you feel like this.

288
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,860
It's pure.

289
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,540
Oh, it's your catapult. It's pure. It's beautiful. It's so beautiful.

290
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,100
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. You don't want it.

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,500
This is what Bob meant when he said, pull the wool over your own eyes.

292
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,420
I can't see anything.

293
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,120
Oh, I'm going blind. I'm going blind.

294
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,900
But you can still see Bob in your mind's eye, can't you, Dave?

295
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,200
My mind.

296
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,040
You never stop seeing Bob in your mind's eye.

297
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,720
I can't stop.

298
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,480
Such as it is.

299
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,040
My mind?

300
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,080
What there is of it.

301
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,660
What?

302
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,240
Your mind. Your mind is no longer your friend.

303
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,480
I'm a physical person. I'm in love. I'm in lust. I'm in love with Bob and I don't care what you say.

304
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,180
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

305
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,660
Bob does love a fool. That's true.

306
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,600
Bob loves the fools of this world and truly the king of fools is Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

307
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,700
Now performing the...

308
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,020
The greatest guitar solo in the universe.

309
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,300
Rock out, baby.

310
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,860
Play it, Dave.

311
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,660
I don't hear the music, but don't think you know.

312
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,340
Give me a beat, man.

313
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,480
What do you mean, which one? I thought that was all A-string.

314
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:38,300
And you see, friends, you see how the love of Bob has freed Dave from that ponderous real life around him.

315
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,740
He pays no attention to...

316
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,640
Uh, the...

317
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,740
What other people might think of him.

318
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,840
Sure, they think he's a... a fool, an idiot, a bad person.

319
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,380
He's a... a half-janger.

320
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,440
I'm tired of my... I'm bored.

321
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,840
I'm blue about you.

322
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,080
But he's happy.

323
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,860
You can hear the simple happiness in his voice.

324
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,180
Don't you...

325
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,260
He's a form of... I... I... I can't... I can't express how happy I was when I think about it.

326
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,360
Oh, don't think about it. You won't be so happy if you stop and think about it.

327
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,080
Now, will you, Dave?

328
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,760
Why are my pants all wet? What's wrong with me?

329
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,080
And how come I can't close my mouth or open my eyes?

330
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,020
And why doesn't Bob ever call a writer, answer my letters, or leave anything on my message machine?

331
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,160
You're not losing your faith now, are you, Dave?

332
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,360
That would be a great sin, a grievous sin, indeed.

333
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,120
To lose one's faith.

334
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,840
To lose one's faith in Bob.

335
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,520
I have no faith in Bob. Bob has no faith. He be-haves no faith.

336
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,160
Meaning he only hath a head. He cannot have a faith in a head.

337
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,400
It's... to the watchdog god, Janus, had two faces on his head.

338
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,560
Neither one of them were looking at the same thing at the same time.

339
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:57,420
And Bob can see you out of each one of those dots on his face, like multifaceted eyes of the mighty insect.

340
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,640
The mightiest insect.

341
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,180
Boing, boing, boing, what's happening to this brain?

342
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,340
The mightiest insect...

343
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,500
It's crawling from this life.

344
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,960
Little tiny pea-like thing.

345
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,440
Into a magnificent, magnificent brain.

346
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,260
Yes.

347
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:27,520
The sucking bugs of the amazing Northern Ohio area include among the order Hemptera.

348
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,680
I said the order Hemptera.

349
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:38,340
The sucking bugs, the bugs who suck things through pipes, such as the water scorpion,

350
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,780
and the rantrofuscia,

351
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,340
and the giant water bug.

352
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,800
Did you ever see that movie, The Giant Water Bug?

353
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,700
That was great.

354
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,960
And the giant water boatman was the sequel.

355
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,220
Thus, these are lovely and interesting insects of the Northern Ohio swamp areas.

356
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:02,120
But, aside from the pleasant, happy-go-lucky order Hemptera,

357
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,400
one also finds the order Neuroptera,

358
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,820
which includes in the sinister family Cory Dolly Day.

359
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,280
Do you hear the significance of that?

360
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,880
Cory Dolly Day?

361
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,700
Salvador Dolly Day?

362
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,040
We find a creature, yes, a living, actual bug of the Northern Ohio swamp area.

363
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,900
It's called the Dobson fly.

364
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,320
The Dobson fly?

365
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:36,040
The Dobson fly, which is, you can go see a stuffed, mounted example of this hideous, vicious beast.

366
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,260
In the Cleveland Natural History Museum,

367
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,720
the Dobson fly,

368
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,140
while surrounded by lovely butterflies and not too alien-looking dragonflies,

369
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,180
you'll notice that the Dobson fly has the head of a vicious red ant,

370
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,240
with tedious, clicking mandibles,

371
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,600
and the body, a body that resembles the tail of a rattlesnake.

372
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,640
Horrible, flapping, leathery wings.

373
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,240
Yes, the Dobson fly.

374
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,660
This is not some biological freak that we're making up.

375
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,940
I'm afraid there are thousands of Dobson fly larvae.

376
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,300
Now, they are in their season, their 50-year season.

377
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,380
As evolution lied,

378
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,700
It was in the 40s.

379
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:23,980
As evolution lied.

380
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,380
In the 1940s was the last time the Dobson fly cycle reached its peak.

381
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:36,020
And thousands died as these pincher-like beaks of billions of dobson flies,

382
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,020


383
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,020


384
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,880
attacked the suburbs of Cleveland.

385
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,520
Oh, the days of Velikovsky.

386
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,840
I thought it was Wassily Kambooski.

387
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,320
And every time you swatted a Dobson fly,

388
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,140
a million eggs would squirt out of its ruptured abdomen.

389
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,820
Each egg hatching into another million Dobson flies.

390
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,900
And each time you tried to squash one of those,

391
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,200
it would hatch another million.

392
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,000
Evolution has no plan.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,080
You see, friends, man likes to think himself the grandest thing in all of God's great creation.

394
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,960
But indeed, no, it is the great order of the insectorii.

395
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,980
The great brain of all collective insect hives and tribes

396
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:28,080
is a billion times smarter than any single ego-centered human brain.

397
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,880
Certainly, one Dobson fly or one tick

398
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,980
may possess a...

399
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,360
rudimentary brain.

400
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,460
But they can communicate by radio with each other.

401
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,740
And the millions of each species

402
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,600
each forms a great brain of that species.

403
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,940
And those brains get together to form brains.

404
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,920
And let's face it, you're outsmarted, Mr. Earth Boy,

405
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,860
Mr. Human, Mr. Two-Legged,

406
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,300
Mr. Tool-Using Primate,

407
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,580
Mr. Thinks-He's-So-Big-Time-Smarty-Pants.

408
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,280
But you know, if you took that human back into the early Devonian period,

409
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,160
even here in the lovely Northern Ohio area,

410
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,440
you would find that there was no Devo.

411
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,680
No Devo?

412
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,480
No Devo.

413
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,220
There was...

414
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,100
But because there was a slimy ocean covering the Northern Ohio plains,

415
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:28,560
a filthy, sewer-like, shallow, but murky, muddy, disgusting, smelly ocean.

416
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,960
And in the depths of these foul, murky, pod-lives,

417
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,340
there grew such creatures as the Dunkelosteus.

418
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,580
Yes, the Dunkelosteus.

419
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,120
And friends, I hate to tell you this, but there is a...

420
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,260
It's true that there was an ancient plant discovered,

421
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,480
fossil of this plant, and they named it, yes,

422
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,300
the Clevelandodendron ohioensis.

423
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,160
4411-oe-us.

424
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,760
No, seriously.

425
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,180
The Clevelandendor...

426
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,200
Clevelandendodron ohioensis.

427
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,860
That was merely, however, just a tube-like plant with teeth and thousands of eyes.

428
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,040
From Club Moss.

429
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,560
Einstein's secret...

430
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,540
Yeah, I mean, Club Moss was a great place back then.

431
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,900
I saw Devo at Club Moss in the Devonian period.

432
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,500
Einstein's secret orchestra.

433
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,000
ESO Radio, boys and girls.

434
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,120
Ivan Stang...

435
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,720
in the house.

436
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,200
Hello?

437
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,360
Hello?

438
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,840
As usual, speaking of the all themes of the insect kingdom,

439
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,220
we noticed that through these over-exaggerated sense of smell,

440
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,520
that they also keep, in a form of ESP, extrasensory contact

441
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,980
with each and every other member of their community.

442
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,880
And as we notice here, if I expose one of these insects to this molasses,

443
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,520
all of the rest of the insects will begin to come within the air,

444
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,340
even if they have been exposed,

445
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,820
or have been held in this container,

446
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,340
and are incapable of actually smelling the molasses.

447
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,420
As soon as they're released, they all begin exploding,

448
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,500
because some of them have distal charges in the back of the vacuum in.

449
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,540
Some of them have even approached 300 feet in length,

450
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,340
and some of them are well over 2,000 pounds.

451
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,040
And I see them in my dreams.

452
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,400
I keep on thinking that one of them was...

453
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,100
with Harry that night when they went over the edge!

454
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,480
Oh...

455
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,480
Oh...

456
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:36,600
Oh...

457
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,100
Oh...

458
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,500
Work it!

459
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,020
Work it!

460
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,460
Work it!

461
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,560
And confess to me!

462
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,940
And confess to me!

463
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,300
In this small...

464
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,220
dark...

465
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,720
room...

466
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,180
more...

467
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


468
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


469
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


470
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


471
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


472
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


473
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,120
I kick my quarters.

474
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,460
I kick my overtime.

475
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
Get market meant.

476
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,000


477
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,000


478
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,020
That...

479
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,340
is...

480
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,260
this new magicaaaa!

481
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,300
magic...

482
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,000
It's matter.

483
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,660
It's, it's matter.

484
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,340
This is magic...

485
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,940
magic...

486
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,380
The white zone is for immediate loading.

487
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,640
These phobias can be cognitive.

488
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,180
No!

489
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm all in.

490
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,660
Sex with Anthony.

491
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,740
Harry went over the edge.

492
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,880
Oh, my God.

493
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,040
And how can we surmise that from this incident,

494
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,600
the head of J.R. Bob Dobbs did emerge into the lustrous as a numinous being?

495
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,860
I don't know.

496
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,920
But you can find out by coming to the X-Day Drill in Brushwood, New York,

497
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,880
on July 5th through 7th this year and every year from now till X-Day.

498
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,920
That's right, Ivan.

499
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,580
That's right.

500
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,500
Remember to call for free information about the amazing X-Day Drill.

501
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,300
Yes, it's like the legendary Doc Stock.

502
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,360
That's right, Ivan.

503
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,220
That's right, Ivan.

504
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,500
You'll see the most hated preachers of the subgenius church.

505
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,540
You'll camp out on a lovely, fully developed camp.

506
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,320
Oh, dear.

507
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,980
You'll be surrounded by geeks you'd rather not ever spend much time with.

508
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,440
But by God, you'll know more about the church of the subgenius,

509
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,100
because, friends, you will have practiced for that fatal day,

510
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,700
that glorious day, X-Day.

511
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,160
Yes, only two years from now, in 1998,

512
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,960
the sex goddesses from Planet X shall come.

513
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,820
Oh, dear.

514
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,320
And rupture up the news paying fully Dobbs-approved,

515
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,560
subgenius ministers.

516
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,140
That's right, Ivan.

517
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,440
All 4,000 of us.

518
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,300
And destroy the rest of the planet.

519
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,920
That's right, Ivan.

520
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,440
Well, not destroy it, but turn it back into the stinking swamp

521
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,440
that it was before the filthy humans came along and muddied everything up.

522
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,440
But, friends, you can come along and muddy everything up.

523
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,940
You can wallow in the filth.

524
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,800
You can dance all night.

525
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,860
Oh, dear.

526
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,960
You can pull your clothes off and county law doesn't care,

527
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,700
because we are having the first X-Day Drill this July 5th,

528
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,300
through Saturday.

529
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,580
7th.

530
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,320
Sunday.

531
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,100
Sunday.

532
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:58,960
Sunday!

533
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,960
You'll see the pill.

534
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,440
You'll see the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

535
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,540
It lives.

536
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,380
It bleeds for you if you don't vomit your money back.

537
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,680
Friends, you will see things you wouldn't dare believe,

538
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,480
things you never wanted to believe,

539
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
and things you'll wish you never saw.

540
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,360
That's right, Ivan.

541
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,400
Yetis will be copulating in the bushes.

542
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,120
Oh, dear.

543
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,100
The darkness monster will rise up from the little pond.

544
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:25,660
What?

545
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,760
The crazed pagan drummers will drum all night long

546
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,860
and keep you from sleeping.

547
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,120
Mosquitoes the size of dobson flies will devour you,

548
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,060
but you won't care.

549
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,420
You won't care because you spent your money

550
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,460
and came to the X-Day Drill July 5th through 7th

551
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,720
in Brushwood, New York.

552
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,480
Brushwood, New York.

553
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,360
Only three hours from Cleveland.

554
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,640
And, friends, you can call for information.

555
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,200
216-LF-LF-60338.

556
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,640
I'll give that number again.

557
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,740
Write that number down.

558
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,140
It's the free information divinable hotline

559
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,120
at the Church of the Subgenius here in Cleveland.

560
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,320
0060338.

561
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,980
That's 0060338.

562
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,660
What do those numbers add up to?

563
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,220
Aha, now you know the secret.

564
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,680
Now you know what we're really trying to tell you about.

565
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,560
The froth.

566
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,500
Yes, the froth.

567
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,560
There's no end to it.

568
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:18,780
That's right, Ivan.

569
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,780
Buckets of froth.

570
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,320
Backtops full of froth.

571
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,160
Three months tired.

572
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,740
That's right, Ivan.

573
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,320
A froth.

574
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,420
A different age.

575
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,640
You're only an ocean.

576
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,300
Ocean full of froth.

577
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:26,720
Whoa, dude.

578
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,620
Ancient Tibetan herbs.

579
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,180
Scrolling right up under your feet.

580
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,540
You won't be able to sleep.

581
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,020
There'll be so much froth growing at high speed

582
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,300
underneath your sleeping bag, tossing you around.

583
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,020
It's like a giant funhouse.

584
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,120
Yes, it's insane.

585
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,940
It's crazy.

586
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,080
But ain't it always been the crazy people

587
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,600
that were able to party like the new hell?

588
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,220
Yes, sir, E-Bob.

589
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,920
Yes, sir, ma'am, sir, lady.

590
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,200
You will finally learn what it's like

591
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,040
to be a subgenius.

592
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,960
That's right, Ivan.

593
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,760
Staying in the church of a subgenius.

594
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,900
And so...

595
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,200
Oh, did I say that?

596
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,040
Well, then, pick up on it, man.

597
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,320
It's said that the end of the world

598
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,620
shall come in a great flash.

599
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,140
Ha!

600
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,440
I sure hope so.

601
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,900
Some people might go

602
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,440
and the other ones might last.

603
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,940
Will you be the one who goes?

604
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,440
Where will you be on next day, brother?

605
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,160
Where is your...

606
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,080
Where will you be on next day, brother?

607
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
Will you be in the...

608
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,400
Will you be on next day, brother?

609
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,960
Will you be in the...

610
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,200
Will you be on next day?

611
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,520
With...

612
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,880
There's still lots of room.

613
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,220
Oh, will you be down in the room?

614
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,700
You can have anything you want.

615
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,500
Will you be burning?

616
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,300
Oh, yes, sir.

617
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,700
I'll burn it.

618
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,000
I'll see you this night.

619
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,980
Will it be a perfect pleasure?

620
00:29:59,500 --> 00:29:59,620
Perfect pleasure.

621
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,920
Perfect pay.

622
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,260
Which will it be?

623
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,740
It's up to you to choose.

624
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,100
Bob gives you free will.

625
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,560
But you can't feel anything

626
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,360
until you sign on the dotted line.

627
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,940
And the next day is coming,

628
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,380
so you better move fast,

629
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,320
because where will you be on next day?

630
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,180
I've got plenty of time

631
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,820
to spend my $30 on that Bob ministership.

632
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,220
I've got plenty of time.

633
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,280
That's two more years for next day.

634
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,940
Why mine?

635
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,280
It's a long time.

636
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,280


637
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,280


638
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,280


639
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,280


640
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,280


641
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,280


642
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:42,580
Bob and I are still here!

643
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:42,860
And Fred and

644
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:42,860


645
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,160
Oh, and my names are on a혀!

646
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:51,440
We don't have a connection.

647
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,420
Bob didn't get a call.

648
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:03,120
not that the world's going to end this year, 1996. Probably not. I could probably afford

649
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,840
to take that risk. I mean, I've got that $30. That's not a problem. But there's this Hootie

650
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,280
and the Blowfish CD I wanted to get. And, well, you know, I wanted to go to this movie

651
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:23,660
about water spouts. And, well, I just, you know, I mean, Bob will wait on me. I mean,

652
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:32,060
Bob's a patient man. He ain't a rat, for God's sake. I heard Bob loved this geniuses

653
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,620
even if they never spent any money.

654
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,620
A patient man. A patient man. Man, he ain't no patient. Bob is the doctor. He ain't no

655
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,500
patient man.

656
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:51,040
Bob is the surgeon who will excise the filthy, rotting tumor that is America. That is modern

657
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,880
America today.

658
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,580
Yes, my fellow.

659
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:01,900
Rebellious citizens and untaxed payers and militia members. All the citizens of courts.

660
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,420
We must come together. We must come together. Quick, they're coming. They're trying to stop

661
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,480
me from speaking. All of us religious nuts and crazy, bright-winged maniacs, we must

662
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,060
band together against the man because, oh, wait, they're coming. I've got to get my message

663
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,420
out. The last one.

664
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,460
Oh, come on.

665
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:19,940
We're about to start.

666
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,600
5-5-6-0-3-3-8.

667
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,020
Call.

668
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,960
5-5-6-0-3-3-8.

669
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,440
Here they come.

670
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,260
No, come on.

671
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,840
Yes, yes, yes.

672
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,820
No, please.

673
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,140
Yes, yes, yes.

674
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,500
I'm not telling you it's going to be.

675
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,040
I won't give you long to be.

676
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,400
No, no, no, no, no.

677
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,360
You'll have to laugh one day.

678
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,180
One day.

679
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,600
One day.

680
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:04,720
One day.

681
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:04,860


682
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:05,960
One day.

683
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:05,960


684
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:05,960


685
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:05,960


686
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:05,960


687
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:05,960


688
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:05,960


689
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:05,960


690
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,120
One day.

691
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,400
One day.

692
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,400


693
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,400


694
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,400


695
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,660
One day.

696
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,340
One day.

697
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:08,500


698
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:08,780
One day.

699
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,320
One day.

700
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:09,320


701
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,120
One day.

702
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,980
One day.

703
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,680
One day.

704
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,100
One day.

705
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,360
One day.

706
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,540
Got a cold crusade for a necktie

707
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,420
Got me a church by the roadside

708
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,080
Made out of rattlesnake hide

709
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,480
Bob is gonna ask you, who do you love?

710
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,480
Bob is gonna ask you, who do you love?

711
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,280
Who do you love?

712
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,920
You are my love

713
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,620
Who do you love?

714
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,820
Watch my little book drop it by

715
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,700

00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:05,580


729
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:05,580


730
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:05,580


731
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:05,580


732
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:05,580

Andится on m어지uka HD I didn't even kick money grew and died at work

734
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,180
You mean, am I worthy of Bob's hate?

735
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,240
Of course I'm worthy of Bob's hate.

736
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,400
Everybody hates me.

737
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,680
I'm one of the most hated men ever to walk the earth.

738
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,100
There's no reason why I dare on Bob Dobbs, the old hate master.

739
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,920
He wouldn't want to give me a few stabs with the old poison eyeball.

740
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,780
I'm afraid you flatter yourself, Dave.

741
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,680
It's a form of love, Dave.

742
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,900
You know, like, he beats you up because he loves you.

743
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,700
It's like a heavy thing, you know.

744
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,620
It's like a tough love, you know what I mean?

745
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,360
What's so close to that?

746
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,080
But you know, Dobbs did love Dave.

747
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,280
And there have always been Daves.

748
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,140
Yes, for thousands, even millions and millions of years,

749
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,260
there have been Daves.

750
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,980
Lonesome cowboy Daves.

751
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,760
Generally ignored by science for obvious reasons.

752
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,220
But this month only in Cleveland Natural History Museum,

753
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,680
there is, in fact, a display.

754
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,980
A rather large exhibit called

755
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,240
Cleveland Before Bob.

756
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,240
In which one may actually see fossils of the ancient peoples.

757
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,180
The precursors to the modern day.

758
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,220
The Dave that we unfortunately know now.

759
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,960
There have been, for instance,

760
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,080
there's quite a wonderful set of artifacts

761
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,640
that were raised up from the P-Dog site.

762
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:12,040
There, that prove that even the early Davonians were tool using,

763
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,900
not quite at the level of primates.

764
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,900
We can get my finger all the way up here.

765
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,980
They had an unusual,

766
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:23,680
there were an unusually large number of stone pot shards.

767
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,980
As well as, oddly enough, many pot sherds found at this dig.

768
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,200
Obviously pots were used, overused, probably.

769
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,520
Abused.

770
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,860
The abused, yes.

771
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,280
The abused pots, they were broken all over the place.

772
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,240
Old clones.

773
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,120
However, we do know that the ancient Dave's had a sex life.

774
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,940
But somehow, as we can see,

775
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,880
I see in this a fairly well honed

776
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,800
fluted point carved from stone.

777
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,040
And notice here, the wooden foreshaft

778
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:08,880
of the ancient Dave piece contained quite a wide groove.

779
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,220
So you could take a look at it.

780
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,560
Take that wooden foreshaft.

781
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,880
The ancient Dave, them old Dave men, the old Dave men could take,

782
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,920
they had a wooden foreshaft with such a wide groove and the fluted point of it.

783
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,140
See, now nowadays, modern Dave, it's not even made of wood.

784
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,700
It's just limp like an old wash rag.

785
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,040
It's still got the fluted point.

786
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,680
But, you know, it ain't nearly as sharp as they used to be.

787
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,740
Because the ancient, strangely enough,

788
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,580
the Neander Dave's actually had a larger cranial capacity.

789
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,560
Than the modern homo Daveian.

790
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,500
You see here, slide three, an ugly creature.

791
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,380
But yet, strangely enough, still our ancestors.

792
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,540
Well, yours maybe.

793
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:01,620
And me poised on edge of evolution as we stand together here today on this historic moment.

794
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,920
With brain much bigger than that to follow.

795
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,860
Must rewind all those who follow.

796
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,160
But even with its larger brain,

797
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,160
the ancient Dave men were able to build nothing but crude pipes.

798
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,320
There are thousands of varieties of pipes,

799
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:25,460
shattered pipes found in the ancient settlement in which they smoked.

800
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:31,120
But what as far as we can tell, wild plant materials, including dogwood,

801
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,640
the bark of the dogwood, which was quite strong,

802
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,740
quite a bit stronger than the bite of the dogwood, although it did have a good bite.

803
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:45,400
If he made you a dog stick, dogwood stick, rolled you up, run up some dogwood.

804
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,060
That does have a bite to it.

805
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,420
That's a hell of a bite to it.

806
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,820
And bring to big today.

807
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,280
Come on, Douglas.

808
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,840
However, the ancient Dave men had a natural enemy.

809
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,600
The mammothous primigenius.

810
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,200
Oh, my God.

811
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,620
Here they come.

812
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Or primigenius, which is Greek for primitive subgenius.

813
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,580
Ironically far more intelligent than the modern subgenius.

814
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,740
I want to play on the old record.

815
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,240
As proved by the fact that you're listening to this show at all right now.

816
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,960
I'm going to smoke olive rabe.

817
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,500
And here they come.

818
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,900
Unfortunately, the largest display in the museum showing me Dave men is the items

819
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:32,600
of unknown function, carefully carved and intricately decorated bone and ivory

820
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,120
fragments, which the uses of which have yet to be discovered.

821
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,520
They seem to be senseless.

822
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,120
They are simply created.

823
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,440
Perhaps some size.

824
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,620
Some scientists suspect they may have been used to dislodge unwanted objects from

825
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:55,200
obscure body parts and the early Dave men possessed more orifices than the modern

826
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,900
day, but made copious use of them and also a thyroid wax collector.

827
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:04,700
And also under opinion, a master also beneath both follicles of here.

828
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,600
I'll hold.

829
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,000
Wow.

830
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,040
I love.

831
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,940
In these ancient holographic films, you can see the olden time Dave,

832
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,340
the primitive days chanting in their silly rituals.

833
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,380
Yes, even then, man had religion.

834
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,680
They buried their dead

835
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:29,800
infant

836
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:38,280
Dave fetus skeletons have been found, which showed signs of having been ritually slaughtered

837
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,420
by their parents.

838
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,520
They were forced to leave their body.

839
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,240
For the delicacy, the one the one item of diet that we know that the ancient

840
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,720
Dave men enjoyed was fetus, not quite know how to put that.

841
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,960
Certainly a serious.

842
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:58,080
Those things would go for 1495 an ounce at least nowadays.

843
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,460
You know, then once you're on your way to the piggly wiggly,

844
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,480
you can't hardly get fetus match, but the ancient Dave men were able to harvest these from there.

845
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,400
I am.

846
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,280
Time now. Time to go out and harvest.

847
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,940
I was.

848
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,860
What was it we were harvesting?

849
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,160
This was during the dawn of agriculture.

850
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,700
And these ancient Dave men were, in fact, what we call skull farmers.

851
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,440
There they are.

852
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,760
Three hundred of them just waiting to be.

853
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:37,820
The women stay in the campground, mating with the men

854
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,300
of the rifle tribes as the Dave were out in the fields harvesting the skulls and the heads.

855
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,880
They tried to grow heads, but generally they were so

856
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:56,180
such such badly skilled farmers that they were able to only grow skulls or else they

857
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,480
forget to pluck their heads until they become skulls.

858
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,660
This white is gleaming and is ready to walk.

859
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,520
Now, what do we do afterwards?

860
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,280
We drink, we drink, we come out the store.

861
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,260
We drink and call you a big skulls because we have such big brains.

862
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:18,780
But in a vain attempt to gain the intelligence of the mighty mammoth,

863
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:24,680
the Dave would drink the brains of the mammoth to gain the courage of the mighty

864
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,860
cow and its craftiness and speed.

865
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,900
The ancient Dave men would drink the brains of the cows or rather,

866
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,380
they would suck them up through stone pipes.

867
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,800
Now, remember, some of you drink cow.

868
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:49,740
You imbued with all power of cow strength, beauty, sleep, fast, quick, small, tiny, little.

869
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,980
Shut up.

870
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,700
This is what is known as sympathetic magic.

871
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:01,820
Obviously, today in today's modern world, we know better than to fall for simple superstitions.

872
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,040
I drank that genius's urine just for a taste of brilliance.

873
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,720
That's true.

874
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,780
There is the one exception.

875
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,720
Sympathetic magic does still work in the Church of the subgenius.

876
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:21,620
If you will drink of the fluids of Bob, you will gain the wisdom of Bob.

877
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,460
His great intellectual acuity will be yours.

878
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,420
And you all know how smart Bob is.

879
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,940
He's from the Church of the sub gum guys at subgenius.

880
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,180
They're all geniuses or something, right?

881
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,540
Isn't that what they're trying to say or something?

882
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,160
Yeah.

883
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,980
And Bob's a smart guy.

884
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,280
And so if you kill Bob and drink of him,

885
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,040
if he's an idiot, his body will be as smart.

886
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,400
Nate, Nate's alive.

887
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:54,060
Friends, Bob is not smart nor nor intelligent, but only lucky.

888
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,620
So you don't drink of his brain.

889
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:02,400
You drink of his other fluids until you have gained some of his luck.

890
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,880
Drink his final fluids for good luck.

891
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,520
Wear it on your head.

892
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,960
His armpits sweat.

893
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,080
If you can stand in front of Bob when he sneezes,

894
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,260
you will be able to gain the viruses of Bob.

895
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,940
He's milk is his most precious.

896
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,460
Oh, yes, it's milk.

897
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,400
If you clean up Bob's bathroom after he is finished in there.

898
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,080
And I think you know what I mean.

899
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,440
Hey, I just came to clean up.

900
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,720
No, no, I wouldn't want to do anything like that.

901
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,640
Just trying to fix the plumbing.

902
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,620
You will gain his sales acumen.

903
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,440
I own the plumbing business around the rest of the world.

904
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,400
I will control the plumbing enterprise of the planet.

905
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:45,980
It's true, folks.

906
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,960
You too could be just like the modern lonesome cowboy Dave.

907
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,300
This paragon of manhood and manly beauty.

908
00:45:54,620 --> 00:46:00,800
This this confident and stalwart stud and cool guy.

909
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,060
All you have to do is to know Dave, to know Bob.

910
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,460
But to know Bob, you merely must call the secret number.

911
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,440
Yes, this is a secret.

912
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,760
Don't tell anybody.

913
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,000
Turn your radio down.

914
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,900
Get your pencil out.

915
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,500
Call this number.

916
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,060
Yeah.

917
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,100
60338.

918
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,500
Go ahead.

919
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,160
Yes. Give it a try.

920
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,760
What if you got to lose a little time?

921
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,160
Maybe you did sign the application.

922
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,800
Kids, don't forget to get your

923
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,260
special Bob Dom's decoder ring that explodes in your face for only $49.95.

924
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,040
Oh, now.

1020
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,180
Baby, is it you?

1021
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,240
As a boy, I dream of angels

1022
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,520
As a boy, I dream of angels

1023
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,500
Little darling, tell me why

1024
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,240
I get so cold looking in your eyes

1025
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,620
Is it you?

1026
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,440
Baby, is it you?

1027
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,160
As a boy, I dream of angels

1028
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,480
As a boy, I dream of angels

1029
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,500
As a boy, I dream of angels

As a boy, I dream of angels

My little baby, leather and lace

1032
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,120
Take a minute to go out of space

1033
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,480
Is it you?

1034
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,460
Baby, is it you?

1035
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,340
As a boy, I dream of angels

1036
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,480
As a boy, I dream of angels

1037
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:09,480

00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:09,480


1042
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,140
Little darling, show me now

1043
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,780
Somewhere, somewhere

1044
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,340
Somehow, is it you?

1045
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,960
Ah

1046
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,860
Baby, is it you?

1047
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:40,200
I hope I dream an angel

1048
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:49,540
I hope I dream an angel

1049
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:59,880
I hope I dream an angel

1050
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,560
I hope I dream an angel

1051
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,040
Who speaks for Earth?

1052
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:08,980
Earth.

1053
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,620
Who smells for Earth?

1054
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,780
Who flies in the case of authority for Earth?

1055
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,860
Why is none of it in the webinars?

1056
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,460
Who's paying the rent on Earth?

1057
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,540
That's the question.

1058
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,820
Who's gonna take care of this bill?

1059
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,860
Who's paying?

1060
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,380
It's passed by the pretty piggy.

1061
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,500
Well, who is paying?

1062
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,240
Who stands for Earth?

1063
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,320
I don't know, maybe me, maybe you.

1064
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,860
Maybe nobody.

1065
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,280
Is that your dog?

1066
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,460
It's really the same song.

1067
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,060
No, really.

1068
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,180
What else?

1069
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,420
To Brian Conrad, campus.

1070
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:16,460
You know that I'm now on a stage where I have to go.

1071
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,040
For hours, I was đấy, oi.

1072
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,560
It's just in the camera zoom.

1073
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:18,560


1074
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:18,560

because he's a misanthropist.

1082
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,740
An animal, an animalistic thing.

1083
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,700
But this is, yes, indeed, the jawbone of an ancient yeti.

1084
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,100
And how could you know such a thing?

1085
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,420
Well, it says so right there on the display.

1086
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,580
Is it the jawbone of an ancient giant yeti?

1087
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:43,980
Yes.

1088
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,820
It is about a foot and a half long.

1089
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,160
Looks like it weighs about seven or eight pounds at least.

1090
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,140
You lie like dirt.

1091
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,560
No, I don't.

1092
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,760
There's a skeleton of a gorilla not far away.

1093
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,340
That's conceivable, a skeleton of a gorilla.

1094
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,480
Even with its massive lower mandible,

1095
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,800
it is merely but less than half the size of the gigantanthropus,

1096
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,780
the prehistoric yeti.

1097
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,800
I agree.

1098
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,060
We call it prehistoric.

1099
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,200
Of course, the yetis were keeping records long,

1100
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,260
80 million years before humans knew how to pick their noses.

1101
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,360
Well, I don't bring up a yeti.

1102
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,120
And it was a gigantanthropus.

1103
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,440
It focused on misanthropicus erectus.

1104
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,380
And she was cute.

1105
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,580
Yeah, she was awful hairy.

1106
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,160
She was the hairiest woman.

1107
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:29,820
I ever saw.

1108
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,320
But she was big, wasn't she?

1109
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,680
Yeah, so there was something so fragrant about her feet.

1110
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:34,920
Musky.

1111
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,180
Musky, that's too old.

1112
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,860
Get a whiff of that yeti.

1113
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,620
Musky, musky, musky.

1114
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,740
Oh, yes, musky's a natural phenomenon.

1115
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,840
I was just thinking about it.

1116
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,980
That makes you feel manly.

1117
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,900
They go yeti girls.

1118
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,720
Yes, sir.

1119
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,820
Keep up her leg.

1120
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,480
Are you man enough for the she yeti?

1121
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,400
Are you man enough for one of her legs?

1122
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,220
Are you?

1123
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:56,700
You got it.

1124
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,420
Hey.

1125
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,680
You can.

1126
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,160
You can.

1127
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,700
Ride on that leg, boy.

1128
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:06,080
You can grab you a tight hold on that mane she's got growing down that leg and ride.

1129
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,700
I've tried to ride her in my dreams.

1130
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,700
I've tried to ride her off into the sunset singing my Yahoo!

1131
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,860
Final Dernier song.

1132
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:19,540
But it seems to me every time I begin to mouth the lovely young whatever you might name the lady.

1133
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,600
I seem to.

1134
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,580
Asked her name in a bathroom voice.

1135
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,160
She said.

1136
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:24,820
Wanda.

1137
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,020
Wanda.

1138
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,640
Wanda.

1139
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:28,780
Wanda.

1140
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,060
Wanda.

1141
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,220
Wanda.

1142
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:29,320


1143
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:29,320


1144
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:29,320


1145
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:29,320


1146
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,000
She yeti.

1147
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,260
Oh my God.

1148
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,080
Wanda of the jungle.

1149
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,780
Wanda of the Himalayas.

1150
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,560
I took a walk around in the park.

1151
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,560
She held my hand.

1152
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,680
She crushed my wrist.

1153
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,780
I went up running.

1154
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,360
She caught me just like that man.

1155
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,980
It ain't no fun when a woman can outrun you and tackle you at the same time.

1156
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,540
There I was laying on the ground in Central Park and birds twittering around and screaming

1157
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:50,940
in pain.

1158
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,800
And this huge, huge female yeti is trying to have her way with me.

1159
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,280
Wanda does Dallas.

1160
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,700
Deep.

1161
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,360
Wanda.

1162
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,200
Wanda does Zayn.

1163
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,260
Behind the grill.

1164
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,000
Wanda.

1165
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,980
Behind Wanda's green behind.

1166
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,740
Wanda likes schoolgirl uniforms.

1167
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,500
Yeah, man.

1168
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:12,980
If you've got.

1169
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,360
Did you see the latest issue of Yeti?

1170
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,780
Big Yeti.

1171
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,320
I think it was Big Yeti September.

1172
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:19,320
B-Y.

1173
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:19,860
Yeah, I saw it.

1174
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,360
And, man, there was this prejudice.

1175
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,420
I couldn't believe.

1176
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,240
In fact, it was one of the largest magazines I ever bought.

1177
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,680
We had to get a guy who had, well, he had a Volvo one.

1178
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,680


1179
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,680


1180
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,680


1181
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,680


1182
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,680


1183
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,680


1184
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,680


1185
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,680


1186
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,700
And we loaded up three or four of them.

1187
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,560
And it took half an hour just to get them in the back.

1188
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,000
Oh, yeah.

1189
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,600
The foldout in the middle is like 30 yards long.

1190
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,500
Yeah, we used to go to wallpaper that nation over on the top of the hill there where almost

1191
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,020
repercussions had left.

1192
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,620
Oh, those human stroke books might show some pink.

1193
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,340
But you won't be seeing no pink in Big Yeti.

1194
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,360
No.

1195
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:52,780
Magazine.

1196
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,560
No.

1197
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,340
It is kind of expensive.

1198
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,540
They're like $8.95.

1199
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,980
It's specialty material.

1200
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:05,820
And if you've seen the Yeti binaries on the news, on the internet, you can get you some.

1201
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,480
Boy, there's some pictures out there.

1202
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,980
That's about 30 days to download.

1203
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,560
I don't want them all dead.

1204
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,280
They're so big.

1205
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,000
They're such big.

1206
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:13,700
They're so big.

1207
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,380
Big Yeti.

1208
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,240
Big old Harry.

1209
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:23,660
Because the true women of the Yeti race, they're the big old Harry.

1210
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,780
They're powerful.

1211
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,100
Jesus.

1212
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:32,900
And they could pick us men up by our parts and swing us around their heads and we loved

1213
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,220
it.

1214
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,040
You know, it hurts.

1215
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,620
Yes, it hurts but we loved it because they were disciplining as you see.

1216
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,540
We had discipline in those days.

1217
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,960
The big women.

1218
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,140
The bigger and hairy women taught us discipline.

1219
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,080
And we thanked them.

1220
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,960
Look at the knees and we worshiped them.

1221
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,160
We were polite to a woman in those days.

1222
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,300
And I languished in my decent sweat.

1223
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,080
We equaled our عيون لنع 당시.

1224
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,080


1225
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,080


1226
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,080


1227
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,080


1228
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,080


1229
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,080


1230
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,080


1231
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,280
the woman who came with respect for the woman.

1232
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,620
When we

1233
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,480
dissipated

1234
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,080
a race of gigantic

1235
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,100
yetis, we did it out of respect

1236
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,140
and discipline.

1237
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,680
We did it on time.

1238
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,260
Not like these slackers

1239
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:15,880
of today.

1240
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,160
These holiday slackers.

1241
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,340
In the old days, the very yeti women

1242
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,620
were on time, always on time.

1243
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,860
The blood runs thin.

1244
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,500
They have fluoride

1245
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,180
in their blood.

1246
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,080
They're not like the yetis

1247
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,000
of yesteryear, the yester-yeti.

1248
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,200
But boy, they can make a pickle

1249
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,700
when they put it under the armpit.

1250
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,440
No, I'm sorry.

1251
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,300
I remember that sometimes

1252
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,060
from the yeti women, you could take a whole cucumber

1253
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,220
and slap one into each armpit

1254
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,060
and make a pickle in five seconds.

1255
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,320
I was a little...

1256
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,300
And you too

1257
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,140
can get a whiff

1258
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,500
of one of them pickles

1259
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,920
if you come to the X-Day

1260
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,340
drill, July 5th through 7th

1261
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,940
in Brushwood, New York.

1262
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,640
At Sermon, New York.

1263
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,600
That's right.

1264
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,920
You'll find out all about that when you call that phone number.

1265
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,240
Call that important phone number.

1266
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,540
Who speaks for Earth?

1267
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,060
You can find out at

1268
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,060
216-960-338.

1269
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,020
Praise Jesus.

1270
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,840
And there ain't no

1271
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,420
Chinese fire drill, is there, Reverend?

1272
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,660
Oh, hey, did you know that Jesus

1273
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,840
is now working for the Church of the Sub-Gene?

1274
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,640
I had heard that he was not only on the payroll,

1275
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,760
but that also that he was having eye surgery

1276
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,500
from some crooked Medicare program

1277
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,220
he was running.

1278
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,420
Well, that just goes along with the job.

1279
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,820
We like to look after our employees, but it's true.

1280
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,420
The Lord Jesus Christ,

1281
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,020
who is now about 26 years old

1282
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:40,900
in this incarnation.

1283
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,460
26 to 52, somewhere in the ground.

1284
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,460
He was formerly the owner of the

1285
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,860
now-defunct Flying Lemur

1286
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:48,240
bookstore.

1287
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,800
Jesus has now moved to Dallas.

1288
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,700
Jesus just left Chicago

1289
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,520
and has moved to Dallas.

1290
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,500
He's filling the...

1291
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,000
He's taken over the mail order

1292
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,380
of the Church of the Sub-Gene, friends.

1293
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,620
He's the promotion.

1294
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,640
He who was foretold by Bob.

1295
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:08,020
They said he would come wearing one sandal

1296
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,940
and he would buy a chariot

1297
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,500
from the Eritreans

1298
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,100
and they would cheat him

1299
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,860
and he would be screwed.

1300
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:20,240
And yes, it is as the prophecy said, friends.

1301
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,160
Praise Bob.

1302
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,500
We were saved.

1303
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,580
The smart money guy finally showed up.

1304
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,160
And this time, he's got connections.

1305
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,020
You know what I mean?

1306
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,340
He's got family,

1307
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,980
if you know what I mean.

1308
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,780
Yeah, the Church of the Sub-Genius

1309
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,100
has got some new friends.

1310
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,400
The kind of friends that's got some muscle.

1311
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,680
You know, the kind of friends

1312
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,740
that if you cross Bob the wrong way,

1313
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,000
he may just wake up with cement overshoes

1314
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,440
at the bottom of the Cuyahoga.

1315
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,540
I thought Jesus made them

1316
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:54,240
missions too.

1317
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,120
Jesus was a Capricorn

1318
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,500
and is just all right with me.

1319
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,580
But except that noticeably,

1320
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,720
he sheds.

1321
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,080
Jesus does.

1322
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,120
Now, he lives in my,

1323
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,160
actually in the Sub-Genius offices.

1324
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,940
He works so hard.

1325
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,840
And he's a really nice,

1326
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,680
such a martyr.

1327
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,960
He sleeps on the couch.

1328
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,280
But he sheds.

1329
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,420
Now that it's summertime in Texas,

1330
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,940
Jesus is shedding all over the church.

1331
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,340
I can't believe Jesus

1332
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,220
definitely works so hard.

1333
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:24,220


1334
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:24,220


1335
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:24,220


1336
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,820
All of the above was from ESO Swamp Radio

1337
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,540
on WCSB Cleveland from the old days.

1338
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,340
The show of the late, incredibly great Chaz Smith,

1339
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,220
who also played half the instruments.

1340
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,980
Praise Chaz.
