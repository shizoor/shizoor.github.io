1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,040
It feels like your skin is being torn right off you and then you ache all over and get sick and you can't breathe.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,880
Your nose runs and you have a high fever and then you pass out, but when you wake up it starts all over again.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,380
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,900
Such a stupid, ghastly, tragic mistake.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,780
Tonight's show is a mix of old and young.

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,260
Part of it is old me and old lonesome cowboy Dave.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,600
A new call-in recording.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,940
And the young folks are from the last X-Day drill in Florida.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,120
Reverend Fid Chooley of the Super Sphere denomination.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,060
And the Time for the Show show fame.

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,760
Hosting a late night...

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,580
Sorry.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,220
All night Sunday night in fact at X-Day.

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:17,900
And his first guest was Reverend Purge who is a very pretty young black trans woman with great knockers who is an adult film star.

15
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,800
So it's a different show.

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,640
Like I say, it's the old and the young.

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,560
Not exactly getting.

18
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,820
Together but contrasting I guess in some way.

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,700
And I'm not sure what order it's going to be in but let's just wing it.

20
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,920
And praise Bob.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,680
By the way I'm recording this out in the woods taking a break from walking the dogs with Princess Wave.

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,140
Ahhh.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,120
And it's hot.

24
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,060
Yes.

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,720
But we have special little plastic cheap chairs.

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:56,760


27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,900
And wind chimes.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,380
Yes.

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,860
But the wind isn't blowing.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,360
No.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,080
It's hot.

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,860
It's hot.

33
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,980
Anyway back to this week's strange hour of slack young and old mix.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,360
Praise Bob.

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,180
Yai yai yai yai yai yai yai yai yai.

36
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,200
I don't really yell too much and if I do I yell quietly.

37
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,740
It sucks.

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,260
Slightly.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
Old crow.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,220
Can you hear me all right up there?

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,760
Can you hear me?

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
All right cool cool cool.

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,740
And just make it so everybody has to hear it.

44
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,740


45
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,740


46
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,740


47
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,740


48
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,740


49
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,660
Old crow.

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,860
Sorry.

51
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,840
I think if we just put the floaty in it that's fine.

52
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,580
Okay.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,640
You are now live on freethinkradio.com.

54
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,540
Oh my God.

55
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,560
We are live on freethinkradio.com.

56
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,220
Hello everybody.

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,200
It is the too late show with Dr. Beelzebub.

58
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:46,900
Crow.

59
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,940
Bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,540
Bow.

61
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,340
If you have a great day, you're not going to be a fool.

62
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,540
And you know what, folks, we got a special show for you tonight.

63
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,900
We got a lot going on.

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,060
We've got a marriage that we're going to officiate.

65
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,960
Maybe even get a little you know consummation going on stage.

66
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,260
I don't know.

67
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,660
This might be the wrong part of the resort for that.

68
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,860
I understand there is a nudist part of the resort and then a fucking part of the resort

69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,160
and I don't know if those are the same thing or a different thing.

70
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,840
You know either way.

71
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,860
Thank you.

72
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,940
You know, we got a lot going on.

73
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,080
Okay, this is X-Day.

74
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:32,660
I never really knew that X-Day was a thing until I accidentally wandered down here.

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,060
I got on the wrong megabus, and I got off here at this resort,

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,840
and these fantastic people, they started telling me about UFOs.

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,080
And if you know anything about our show, you know, we talk about UFOs a lot.

78
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,420
We think about UFOs a lot.

79
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,660
We like to make foods, you know, kind of shaped like UFOs from time to time.

80
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,700
You know, UFO pies and, you know, cookies and that sort of thing.

81
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,200
But the point that I'm trying to get across here, folks, is this shit is weird.

82
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,220
All right, this is allegedly the Church of the Subgenius.

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,060
Now, from what I understand, we worship a guy named J.R. Bob Dobbs, all right?

84
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:14,380
And there's a deep mythology and, indeed, a theology associated with Mr. J.R. Bob Dobbs.

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:21,020
But tonight, folks, we're going to highlight for you what we've learned about the Church of the Subgenius over the last few days.

86
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,680
We've met some...

87
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,360
We've met some really lovely people here in Florida over the last few days.

88
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,800
And we would like to sort of, you know, bring that to you back at home, wherever that is.

89
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,240
You know, probably you're watching YouTube.

90
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,140
A lot of people watch us while they're taking a shit.

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,060
A lot of people watch us while they're supposed to be doing their homework.

92
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,320
That's kind of, you know, that's one of our big demographics, people trying to do homework.

93
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,960
We also, we get a lot of traffic from people that click on the wrong video.

94
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,680
And a lot of times when you're in a K-hole, you can't really click away from the video that you accidentally clicked on.

95
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,620
So you end up watching our shit for about an hour and a half.

96
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,300
You wake up later on, you're like, oh, did I even do ketamine?

97
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,140
I feel so dumb.

98
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,960
I usually don't feel this dumb when I wake up from a ketamine binge.

99
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,540
Not that I know anything about that, folks.

100
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,780
I don't do...

101
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,580
Well...

102
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,360
All right, nicotine doesn't count as a drug.

103
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,820
I guess, also, alcohol doesn't count as a drug.

104
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,160
Ketamine doesn't count as a drug.

105
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,780
None of that stuff is drugs.

106
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,960
Look, folks, I'm sorry.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,900
I'm getting distracted.

108
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,680
I'm getting distracted.

109
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,680
Let me introduce you to our crew real quick.

110
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,180
Okay, you know, on the ones and twos and, you know, threes and fours,

111
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,540
and there's probably even other numbers,

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,920
we've got Mr. Jonah Jones.

113
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,600
Call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call.

114
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,240
And then, of course, we have our inestimable producer, Mr. Daniel Holmes.

115
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,140
Call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call.

116
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,000
And running our chyron in the back, you know, we have Dr. Beef Supreme.

117
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,680
Dr. Beef Supreme.

118
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,760
He's around here somewhere.

119
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,800
Oh, there he is.

120
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,840
That's that motherfucker.

121
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,380
So we're going to get right around to it, folks.

122
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,380
Look, we've got a very small time slot today, okay?

123
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,660
We're going to be on for about 10 or 15 minutes,

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,460
and then we're going to be on for the next eight hours.

125
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,520
So, you know, settle in.

126
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,100
Grab yourself, you know, whatever you need to tie off with,

127
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,560
and join us for a long, weird trip down J.R. Bob Dobbs Lane.

128
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
So here's a question.

129
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,580
Where's my second microphone?

130
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,020
Because this is, like, allegedly a talk show,

131
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,660
and if I don't have two microphones, then I can't really, you know,

132
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,020
I can't really talk to anybody, you know.

133
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,780
I can talk to myself, but, you know, nobody wants to fucking see that.

134
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,240
Well, so, I've actually, you know, over the last few days,

135
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,880
I've learned a lot about myself and the limits of moisture.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,560
You know.

137
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,880
I, myself, you know, a lot of folks might not know this,

138
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,640
but I'm actually the half-son of Satan.

139
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,640
So, like, I'm used to a hot climate, you know.

140
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,920
I spent, you know, most of my summers as a child.

141
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,520
Oh, that's a microphone right there.

142
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,600
Bazinga.

143
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,640
I can solve it.

144
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,840
Oh, that's fucking beautiful.

145
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,440
Whoa, it's got a little, it's got a ninja star attached to it.

146
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,800
You can be.

147
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,260
Yeah, it's the kind of microphone you can throw that through the air,

148
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,860
like, really do some damage to somebody.

149
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,680
This is a microphone.

150
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,360
This should be good.

151
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,860
Oh, my God.

152
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,280
Does it, does it say call?

153
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,220
It says call.

154
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,920
Oh, good, good.

155
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,920
Call, call, call, call, call, call, call.

156
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,360
No, this is actually, this is a nice mic.

157
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,500
This one's nice and loud.

158
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,120
Well, I mean, but I'm loud.

159
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,620
Oh, I can be louder.

160
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,320
Well, that's not, that's not good.

161
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,900
Oh, wait, that's not the goal.

162
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,320
Dude, you know, I'm the fucking star of the show.

163
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,000
You're the producer.

164
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,800
Oh, oh.

165
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,680
You can't fucking be louder than me.

166
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,260
I'm just fading into the background.

167
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,460
I will have a meltdown on stage right now.

168
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,060
Not in front of the PA.

169
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,440
I will cry, okay?

170
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,540
Okay, we should get.

171
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,300
Just don't be louder than me.

172
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,920
Okay.

173
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,480
It's important.

174
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,500
All right, sorry, everybody.

175
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,860
I mean, for my producer to upstage me like a fucking monster.

176
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:56,740
Anyway.

177
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,320
All right.

178
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,240
I, you know, I, I, I see, I, I think I see out here in the audience one of our, one of

179
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
our lovely guests for this evening.

180
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,560
Would you like to come up on stage and join us for, for a brief moment?

181
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,620
Call.

182
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,600
Make, make some room for our guest, goddammit.

183
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,800
Well, hi, hi, hi.

184
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,280
Welcome to the show.

185
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,280


186
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,280


187
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,280


188
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm Dr. James Crow.

189
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,900
Hi, Dr. Crow.

190
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,300
I'm Dr. Purge.

191
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,460
Dr. Purge, it's really nice to meet you.

192
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,960
So, tell me, what brings you to X Day?

193
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,740
Are you here for the UFOs or the guy with the pipe?

194
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,320
What, what, what initially drew you to the Church of the Subgenius?

195
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,960
I wasn't drawn to the Church of the Subgenius.

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,640
I was drafted.

197
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Oh, okay, okay.

198
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,140
Like a, kind of a military style, you were forced into service.

199
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,400
Yes, it's that sometimes it doesn't take any time.

200
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,280
It doesn't take, it doesn't take a lot of time.

201
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,480
It's like you stepping forward, it takes everyone else stepping back.

202
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,380
That's true.

203
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,280
You're the only, the lone survivor.

204
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,500
If you wanna make it like a true survivor.

205
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,620
A true survivor.

206
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,240
And, and, and when was this that you were drafted?

207
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,480
I mean, how long have you been a part of the Church?

208
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,980
Oh, time is a, is an illusion, but also I'm not great with it either.

209
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,360
That's a solid fucking point.

210
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,900
A couple of years.

211
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,660
Okay, all right, well, several years.

212
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,540
That's good enough for me.

213
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,340
I, I can't really count much higher than eight or nine anyway, just between the two of us.

214
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,260
So, like, anything beyond that could just be a little bit more.

215
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,360
I can't really go over my head.

216
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,320
And, and so, what do you do in the Church?

217
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,120
You know, I, I, from what I understand, I've been watching a lot of people in leadership

218
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,060
roles and non-leadership roles, and I can't really tell what anyone's deal is.

219
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,920
Like, is this a, is this an organization?

220
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,280
Is this a roving gypsy party style event?

221
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,860
What's going on here at X Day?

222
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,520
Help me understand.

223
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,560
Is that leadership roles aren't doled out?

224
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,180
They're taken.

225
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,880
They have to be claimed.

226
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,340
Yes, they have to be claimed.

227
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,180
Is that it is, oh God, you're going to break, break me into a story, aren't you?

228
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,480
I mean, I, I like stories.

229
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:05,460
Is that, um, upon my first X Day, again, just like yourself, I did not know that X Day was

230
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,500
a thing that actually occurred.

231
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,080
I thought it was something that happened in the past.

232
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,840
Something that you saw in, sorry, God.

233
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,860
Okay, all right, I'm into the mic.

234
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,200
Is this any better?

235
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,260
All right.

236
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,380
I'm going to go.

237
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,220
I'm going to go.

238
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,220


239
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,100
I'm going to go.

240
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,180
But yes, I didn't know that the, um, X Day actually still occurred.

241
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,840
And when I was told, again, I don't know if you guys can tell online, um, probably with

242
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,000
the white balance of the way it's set, I'm probably an unlocked character at this point.

243
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,100
Um.

244
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,060
A mystery character has appeared.

245
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,800
You need more badges to unlock me.

246
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,700
But, um, I'm of a darker skin tone and with all the history and things that come with

247
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:46,920
that.

248
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,420
I was not fully mentally prepared for what I was about to witness.

249
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,440
And also I didn't know what to expect.

250
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,580
I just thought two white people were going to take me into the woods and do terrible

251
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,020
things.

252
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,180
That's just how it goes.

253
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,280
There's a history there.

254
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,780
Yeah.

255
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:09,560
But when I, upon arriving, upon arriving, I, um, was greeted with community and love

256
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,620
and kindness and just this great, uh, social structure.

257
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,900
And, um.

258
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,280
It was just madness and terror and jenkom fumes and it was just.

259
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,640
All the beautiful things in life all combined into one.

260
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,600
However, this year there is no jenkom.

261
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,560
You have to bring your own.

262
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,840
We have running water.

263
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,380
It is nice.

264
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,600
Yeah, that is nice.

265
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,880
But my car didn't get hot enough on the way down here.

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,380
So I'm still, I'm still trying to get my second badge going.

267
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,260
Give it time.

268
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:39,800
Okay.

269
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,040
Okay.

270
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,740
It will eventually ferment and mature.

271
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,180
Okay.

272
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,560
Yes.

273
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:42,560


274
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,820
I like that you, you talked about sort of being surprised by the amount of community

275
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,900
that you saw here.

276
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,600
Like I've been following the writings of the church and I've been listening to the hour

277
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,120
of slack for a long time now.

278
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,620
And, and there's a, there's a very powerful sarcastic edge to, to the church's comedy.

279
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,560
I thought that I might be able to get more of that in the personal interactions that

280
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,540
I got here, but everyone has been so kind and loving and welcoming.

281
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,420
It, it really is a beautiful contrast.

282
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,160
Uh, to the sort of the, you know, the kind of the edge humor that, that happens a lot,

283
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,620
you know, around subgenius media.

284
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,460
I love it so far.

285
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes.

286
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,240
Is that one of the biggest things that they think that when they look at our readings,

287
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,340
they look at our rants and our teachings that they think that we're just generally hateful

288
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,920
assholes.

289
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,700
And that's true.

290
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,600
We are hateful assholes, but it's a clean burning hate.

291
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,000
It's an efficient hate.

292
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,180
Right.

293
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,180


294
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,720
That's not a coal style hate.

295
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,960
This is a nuclear hate.

296
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,360
Yes.

297
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,800
Okay.

298
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,280
Nuclear.

299
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,540
Nuclear.

300
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,960
Nu-cu-lar.

301
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah.

302
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,260
There you go.

303
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,260
You'll get it.

304
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,920
I think that's right.

305
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,020
I'll get there eventually.

306
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,120
From PR News in Washington, I'm releasing a report with 40 recommendations that left

307
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,920
10 people dead.

308
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,420
The actual number of deaths was more than 4,600.

309
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:09,660
Governor says the Resolver can make in-plan the all tougher red metal gun locks to help

310
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,720
identify PR News.

311
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,580
The United States is running out of immigrant children who are being separated from PR News.

312
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,620
Immigrant children usually stay in bed.

313
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,540
Immigrant children jump PR News illegally, unlawfully, in empty government buildings.

314
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,420
22%, 95%.

315
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,620
Retail giant Walmart is threatening to disrupt Canada's second largest PR News.

316
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,400
In Washington, I'm Mike Pearson.

317
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,080
We'll be right back.

318
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,740
Hello?

319
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,560
Dave, listen, I have a UFO.

320
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,460
What the hell is that?

321
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,740
It's a little flying saucer.

322
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,420
Very small.

323
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:46,920
A theremin?

324
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,940
Yeah.

325
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,880
A little flying saucer that, I forget where it came from.

326
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,460
I wish it still had a theremin because I could use one like a sword.

327
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:57,960
Wait.

328
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,380
I'm having trouble understanding you for some reason.

329
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


330
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


331
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


332
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


333
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


334
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


335
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


336
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


337
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


338
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


339
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


340
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


341
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


342
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


343
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,380


344
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,220
Well, that's a cognitive problem in your brain.

345
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,540
So, I'll pretend that I just called you.

346
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,720
Okay.

347
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,500
Hello, Dave.

348
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:12,760
Hi.

349
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,100
How you doing?

350
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,620
Hi, Doug.

351
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:13,980
How you doing?

352
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,020
Hey, Dave.

353
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,340
We didn't really talk for a minute or two before we started this recording or anything.

354
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,700
That's right.

355
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,460
We didn't.

356
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,160
I didn't cut anything off the beginning, any clumsy, awkward sound problems.

357
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,800
Oh, yeah.

358
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,360
Sound problems.

359
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,360


360
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,360


361
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,360


362
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,360


363
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,360


364
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,360


365
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,380
Sound problems, overtures, and various physical liabilities, too, as well.

366
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,660
Well, we actually have those very much so today because any minute, all four dogs might

367
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,380
start barking frantically at deer.

368
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:55,260
There's a tribe of deer or deer-like things that have decided that our backyard is their

369
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,780
toilet.

370
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,200
Well, that's a good idea.

371
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,700
I thought there were bums and...

372
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,940
Other homeless people that would walk by and they saw the sign.

373
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,640
I mean, you put it up.

374
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,840
No, we only have homeless animals out here.

375
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,620
It's too far for bums to walk.

376
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,620
Well, do they need toilet paper and other explanatory vows or are they pretty much...

377
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,600
Maybe I shouldn't leave the rolls of toilet paper hanging from trees because that may

378
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,920
be what's drawing the deer.

379
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,480
It's confusing.

380
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,340
It's making me think, come on home and we'll have some sauerkraut and some...

381
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:37,200
Some pickles and honest eggs and stuff like that and we leave ourselves with nature's

382
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,600
problems.

383
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,900
Yeah.

384
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,040
Nature's vowels, I would say.

385
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,760
Nature's vowels because it's more of a vowel sound.

386
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,420
Well, the deer leave all these little piles of smart pills all over the yard.

387
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,260
The dogs are not very smart.

388
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,680
They try to eat them if we walk them around back there.

389
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,500
See, the deer don't come into the fence part.

390
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,320
Let's call them.

391
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,160
Let's call that the front yard.

392
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,640
It's fenced and the dogs can't get out and the deer can't get in or don't want to.

393
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:17,100
Then there's, let's call it the backyard, which is for all intents and purposes, endless

394
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,460
wilderness.

395
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,980
Yeah, we'll call it the backyard.

396
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:20,640
Yeah.

397
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:28,280
And so the varmints come and go, raccoons and possums, foxes and...

398
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,180
Armadillos?

399
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,180
Armadillos.

400
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,560
Armadillos, yeah.

401
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:37,500
They all go under the back porch with the cats and play poker and smoke cigars.

402
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,660
Yeah.

403
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,600
I'm pretty sure.

404
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,680
Yeah.

405
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,520
That's what I was told would probably happen next.

406
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,440
Yeah.

407
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,100
With the vowels and the chocolate bars and the cigars.

408
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,560
And the wasps and centipedes don't, apparently don't interfere with the game like they do

409
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,340
with me.

410
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,140
You know, I went to the hospital with a wasp sting.

411
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,580
I was in the hospital with a wasp sting all of a sudden a couple of months ago.

412
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,920
I never used to be allergic like that.

413
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:14,480
But my nurse, Reverend Anna Phylaxis, gave me a bunch of injections that made me fall

414
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,660
asleep practically right there at the hospital.

415
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,460
It saved me from dying.

416
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,820
Now I have a special shot that if I go exploring out in the woods, which I don't do anymore,

417
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,120
I can give my wife a shot.

418
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,120


419
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,120


420
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,860
I can give myself an injection.

421
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:31,920
Yeah.

422
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,980
Just to tell you that, my crammer around with you like it was a bad joke.

423
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,420
And if the highway patrol ever stops, you can just like jump out of the car and stick

424
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,000
it in their arm and let them chase you all summer.

425
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,200
At least for a few more years.

426
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,680
Yeah.

427
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,240
The cops chasing me?

428
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,540
I don't want to do that either.

429
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,940
I'm just getting tired of running, you know.

430
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,520
I can't run.

431
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,100
I can't run.

432
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,560
I can't run anymore.

433
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,340
I don't know what to tell you what to do.

434
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,020
You're still wearing the sports sneakers.

435
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,540
I made all these trails, these secret trails that lead from my house down to the

436
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,840
creek and various other hideouts.

437
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,780
And in case the black helicopters show up, you know, I'm always ready to bolt.

438
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,260
As long as they don't have stand sniffing dogs, they wouldn't be able to follow me.

439
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,320
Of course, I'm not sure where I'd go after I die.

440
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,020
Yeah.

441
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,980
I'm not sure where I'd go after I got down to the creek.

442
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,200
Well, I heard that they're using, they are now using, stand sniffing dogs in almost every

443
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,940
adventure with Mr. Stang.

444
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,040
Yeah, that's what I heard too.

445
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,760
So I don't want to have any more adventures.

446
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,580
I really hate adventures.

447
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:52,260
I had a bunch over the years and they all were terrifying and tiring and hurtful and

448
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,360
traumatizing.

449
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,080
Well, maybe you need a nice big pair of pants.

450
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,080


451
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,260
Yeah.

452
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,980
And a pair of panties and a brassiere and confuse the animals into thinking you're

453
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,800
something you're not.

454
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,880
Like maybe, you know, a great college professor or a cyclops or something.

455
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,420
I don't know.

456
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,000
But get them on a different track.

457
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:19,580
No, just wear a wig and a dress and tell them that I'm the queen of England and they better

458
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,240
leave me alone.

459
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,820
Oh, well, that sounds great.

460
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,760
Yeah, I got that idea from my Cheech and Chong game.

461
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,060
There's a game that tells you to be a cheech and chong.

462
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,060


463
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,060


464
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,060


465
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,440
And you dress up like the queen of England.

466
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,380
Well, Chong was going to get deported.

467
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,460
Because he's Canadian.

468
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,920
I don't know if you knew that.

469
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,700
But Chong of Cheech and Chong is Canadian.

470
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,880
So they were going to deport him.

471
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,660
So he dressed as the queen of England.

472
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,360
And the mayor believed him and fell in love with him and tried to seduce him really hard.

473
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,880
Yeah.

474
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,360
Well, it sounds good so far.

475
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,040
Yeah.

476
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,420
So what happened?

477
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,760
Then what did happen?

478
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,720
He got deported and that was the end of it?

479
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,020
Oh, no.

480
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:16,960
Then Bigfoot showed up and it distracted everybody from Chong being deported.

481
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,960
And that just sort of got forgotten because of Bigfoot, the aliens.

482
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,120
Yeah.

483
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,880
Now there's aliens in it.

484
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,020
In fact, there's also aliens in my other game.

485
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,980
The Trailer Park Boys Greasy Money.

486
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,000
I've gotten really far in both of these games.

487
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:46,700
I make like an assload-tillion as soon as I start up a business in those things now.

488
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,380
Because they're so upgraded and corrupt.

489
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,420
You did confuse me because you had me thinking it was all part of the backyard.

490
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,100
And now you're telling me it's a game.

491
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,740
A video game.

492
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, no.

493
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,320
No, that's just where I got the idea of dressing up like the Queen of England and telling the

494
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,320
black helicopters that, hey, hey, don't mess with me.

495
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,040
I'm the Queen of England.

496
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,120
You're trying to start a ... I'd say it's like in a British accent.

497
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,920
You're trying to start an international incident now, are you?

498
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,880
Bloody well, better not be.

499
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,900
See, that's pretty convincing, isn't it?

500
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,740
Yeah.

501
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,980
That's what I was hoping for.

502
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,600
Yeah.

503
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,280
All the time doing our time sheets together there.

504
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,000
Right.

505
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,580
I wanted to see you dressed like that and you did it.

506
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,940
And so now I feel much better.

507
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,140
My beard might throw them off a little bit.

508
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,260
Well, beards throw everybody off a little bit.

509
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,400
That's not your problem.

510
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,340
If they don't like a beard, you go tell them to go take a royal hike.

511
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,280
Right.

512
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,660
I've got a phone app called Faceplant or something like that.

513
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:08,360
And you can take a picture of anybody and replace a movie actor with your face.

514
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:14,080
For some reason, Bob's face doesn't work because it can't handle the pipe.

515
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,660
Yeah.

516
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,420
But my face, it works with my face pretty well.

517
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,260
And so I've added more.

518
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:30,240
My face to Marilyn Monroe movies and Sophia Loren movies and Thai dancer ballerina movies and stuff.

519
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,100
And it's really hideous and scary.

520
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,200
You can see it on my YouTube.

521
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,600
I think it's called Bobmations or something like that.

522
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,680
It's the latest in my experimental animations playlist.

523
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,840
It's really pretty sickening.

524
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,960
So you did, you photoshopped your head into the body of a Thai.

525
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,240
Well, it's moving.

526
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,420
It's moving.

527
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:51,420


528
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,360
The funny thing is it adds your face onto, say, Marilyn Monroe.

529
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,840
And she's talking or singing.

530
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
And when she smiles, you smile.

531
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,900
And when she closes her eyes, you close your eyes.

532
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,800
It's quite realistic.

533
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,900
It's like an instant deep fake.

534
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,280
I could add my face to Joe Biden's speeches and everybody would think I was the president.

535
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,480
I have a stutter similar to his.

536
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:21,180
And they'd be able to collect blooper reels and say I was falling down.

537
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,020
I'm senile.

538
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,500
Really, I'm just falling asleep.

539
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,920
Senile.

540
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,040
Yeah.

541
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,160
I'm not falling down from the senility.

542
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,560
Just falling asleep from it.

543
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:40,560
So as my ex-wife used to say, though, senility is the last thing you have to worry about.

544
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,060
Yeah, I know.

545
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,220
Real funny.

546
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,660
Yeah.

547
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,660
Yeah.

548
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,280
Yeah.

549
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:47,740
Yeah.

550
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,140
Yeah.

551
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:56,200
So I still don't understand if you're in a Thai movie, the queen of Thailand has your face on, right?

552
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:56,780
Yeah.

553
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,420
Yeah.

554
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,220
And she's singing and dancing and everything.

555
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,920
And she's singing like that lady that's in the bridal movies.

556
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,680
It's really disturbing.

557
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,740
They all...

558
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,680
In bridal movies.

559
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,100
I'm sorry.

560
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:15,840
Well, I'd look a little better on monster movie characters and things like that.

561
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:23,140
But the female characters, it looks like my mom with a beard and glasses.

562
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,780
Everybody looks like that to me in some way or another.

563
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,080
Everybody looks like your mom with a beard?

564
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,060
Yeah.

565
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,960
Or your mom with a beard too.

566
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,920
In fact...

567
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:43,820
I saw a movie in which this mentally ill man, superhero, was so traumatized by his evil mother,

568
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,120
who gave him his unique powers at a great cost.

569
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:57,200
And everyone he sees looks like his mom, which makes it easy for him to kill people because he hates her so much.

570
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:07,620
And they have scenes where he tells somebody, well, I find it easy to kill others because everyone looks like my mom.

571
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,140
And you see, for a couple of times, you see through his eyes.

572
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,800
And sure enough, everyone looks like him.

573
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:13,980
Even his mom.

574
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,760
The fat guy looks like a fat version of his mom.

575
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,280
The skinny guy looks like a skinny version of his mom.

576
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,660
Everyone looks like his mom.

577
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:35,500
And the strange superpower that is given to this man in this movie called The Suicide Squad is that he can shoot polka dots out of his flesh.

578
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,880
These polka dot tumors form all over his body.

579
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,500
And when they build up too much and he becomes too hideous,

580
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,200
he expels them and they blow things up.

581
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:45,820
Polka dots.

582
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Multi-colored, gaily colored polka dots come shooting out of this guy's diseased body and, like, blow up buildings and stuff.

583
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,260
That's his superpower.

584
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,820
That sounds like a good weapon to use.

585
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,440
Polka dot man.

586
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,900
Yeah.

587
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,120
Yeah.

588
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,980
That sounds exciting.

589
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:11,500
My friend Dr. Philo Drummond started a Facebook page called Bad Supervillain.

590
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,660
He's got super villain and super hero names.

591
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:21,320
And I should just read a list of them, but I don't have it in front of me.

592
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,720
Oh, yeah.

593
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,460
That's what I was going to say.

594
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,380
Read a list, but you don't have it in front of me.

595
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,040
Right.

596
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,500
I also have a list of all the mystery men who weren't in the mystery men movie but are mentioned in it.

597
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,500
And they're pretty funny.

598
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,580
There's, like, the Waffler ballerina man.

599
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,340
The Waffler?

600
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,440
Yeah.

601
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,440


602
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,540
French tickler.

603
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,460
Oh, Lucky Pierre and the French tickler.

604
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,640
White flight and black rage or something like that.

605
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,520
Another Paramed in Heaven, yeah.

606
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,160
Yeah.

607
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,000
All these superhero things that are pretty funny.

608
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:10,220
And I'm hoping they're all, if not heterosexual, at least some form of sexual.

609
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,320
Yeah.

610
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,760
Oh, they're all over the place.

611
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:19,280
I saw another superhero movie called The Old Guard, which was really pretty fun.

612
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,500
And it has these five immortals that have been around for thousands of years living in secret,

613
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,300
mostly doing good deeds by killing lots of bad guys.

614
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:40,260
And two of the five immortals are gay men that are really, really deeply in love with each other,

615
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,640
which is an unusual aspect for a superhero movie.

616
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,600
They're always holding hands and hugging and kissing and stuff.

617
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,500
And then they kick ass, you know, and kill bad guys.

618
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,560
I just learned there's going to be a sequel to it.

619
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,300
I'm very excited about that, actually.

620
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,280
Yeah, that's usually where I put the bookmark in there.

621
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,400
And I read a couple of chapters post-tense.

622
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,100
And into the next.

623
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,020
And it's part.

624
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,440
Because I don't want to, you know, think too many thoughts at one time.

625
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,880
Because this has easily crushed my brain.

626
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,220
Does anybody else?

627
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,020
You know, so.

628
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,200
Well, yeah, your brain crushes mine every time we do a show.

629
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,960
Mine in reverse, too.

630
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,120
It's the same thing to you.

631
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:38,200
And when I listen back to it, it's like I have to relive getting my brain crushed over and over again.

632
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,240
Well, I'm sorry about that.

633
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,480
That part, I couldn't help that.

634
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,380
I know.

635
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,020
Well, Dr. Hal does it, too.

636
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,800
He crushes my brain.

637
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,000
Philo does.

638
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,000
Philo is one of the only people who doesn't crush my brain.

639
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,980
Because we have almost exactly the same brain powers or lack thereof.

640
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,140
And also, we tend to sound a little bit alike.

641
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,960
So it doesn't matter which one of us says what.

642
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,660
It's going to come out the same way either way.

643
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,140
Yeah.

644
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,360
Like an Andrew Flaxloid or whatever.

645
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:12,980
Yeah.

646
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,500
People can't tell us apart except that I'm so much better looking than him.

647
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,860
Well, I heard this one woman scream out in the middle of the parking lot.

648
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,840
It's alive.

649
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,440
It's alive.

650
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,880
And it was pointed at a picture.

651
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,720
And it looked like you dressed up as the queen of Thailand.

652
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,660
Yeah.

653
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,760
And Philo dressed up as the queen of England.

654
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,060
Right.

655
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,100
That's Philo Dina.

656
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,780
Philo Dina.

657
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,160
A tea party, you know.

658
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,800
Yeah.

659
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,500
With everything that you could imagine at a tea party besides tea.

660
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,440
Sandwiches, cookies, Godzilla voices.

661
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,160
So what do you do outside of the Church of the Subgenius?

662
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,180
Oh, I'm an adult film star.

663
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,260
Wait, what?

664
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,380
Yeah.

665
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,660
Oh my God.

666
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,780
Like you didn't know.

667
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,220
Oh, I guess I did.

668
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,480
A little behind the scenes here.

669
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,660
I actually don't meet these people on stage for the first time.

670
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,600
We talked beforehand.

671
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,240
And I know you don't want to see how the sauce...

672
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,760
Sausage is made.

673
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,760
But I feel like we do want to be transparent here.

674
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,460
They do with me.

675
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,960
Oh, oh, oh, I see.

676
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,920
So let's get into the sausage a little bit.

677
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,340
Okay.

678
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,200
So you're part of the adult film industry.

679
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,260
Yes, yes I am.

680
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,020
So how did you first get into that?

681
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,820
Was it, were you a self-starter?

682
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,600
Were you approached?

683
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,440
How did you first get into it?

684
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,340
Um, huh.

685
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,240
Again, another thing you can't tell probably from the fact that I'm a film star.

686
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,240


687
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,240


688
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,240


689
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,240


690
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,240


691
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,240


692
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,240


693
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,240


694
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,240


695
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,540
I'm a person who has a lot to learn from the camera is that I'm trans.

696
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,320
Okay.

697
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,640
Very proudly so.

698
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:51,260
But like at, in my own personal headcanon, I believe that at one point in time, earlier

699
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,060
on in life, I really, really wanted to be a porn star.

700
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,900
And somewhere a monkey's hand slowly closed.

701
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,000
And it trans-ed my gender.

702
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,840
And yeah.

703
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,780
It's much easier to be a porn star when you're a girl.

704
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,120
So yeah, things were made, things were made, things happened.

705
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


706
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


707
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


708
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


709
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


710
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


711
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


712
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


713
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


714
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


715
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,260
I approached the studio

716
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,160
they said yes

717
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,000
I don't know why

718
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,440
but they did say yes

719
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,740
they saw something in you

720
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,520
or something that they wanted to be in you

721
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,120
exactly

722
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,080
and it just has been going on well ever since

723
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,100
like the most put together my life has ever been

724
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,300
is when I became a porn star

725
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,280
oh that's great

726
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,240
yeah it's great

727
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,520
so tell me a little bit about the day-to-day logistics of this

728
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,800
like I'm always fascinated with like the minutiae of jobs

729
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,260
how do you schedule stuff?

730
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,480
like do you do it months in advance?

731
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,420
weeks in advance?

732
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,700
is it kind of a spur of the moment thing from time to time?

733
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,660
is that it is a bit of a spur of the moment thing

734
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,980
however you're doing well if you have two weeks of content prepared in advance

735
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,800
for bigger studio shoots

736
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,880
you may have those planned months in advance

737
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,860
like I had my August schedule planned in February

738
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,400
okay well all right that's pretty far in advance

739
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
I'm going to be doing like

740
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,080
eight shoots in the span of a week and a half

741
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,300
I don't know how

742
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,420
sounds exhausting

743
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,040
oh yes

744
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,800
do you just have to get like a flat of Powerade

745
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,500
and like a bunch of cashews

746
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,040
like how do you survive it?

747
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,920
oh um oh that's cool things I can talk about

748
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,620
the logistics of a porn girl's like packing

749
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,060
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

750
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,120
um usually pack uh several things

751
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,940
several interchangeable outfits for lingerie

752
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,800
okay sure sure sure um do you usually so do you do uh mainly video or mainly photography or both?

753
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,940
um is that

754
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:56,440
I do video primarily um however there is usually photo shoots of about 150 200 photos per scene

755
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,240
um little things behind the scenes that usually um in porn like when you look at the photos they

756
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,900
aren't just stills of the video you actually restage that

757
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,500
those events that timeline in photos

758
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,880
you get the storyboard you go through it again

759
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,500
exactly okay okay

760
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:20,000
so you take the pictures and then you go through that those actions and try to hit those same markers

761
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,240
interesting so are okay here's kind of a weird question are there any directors

762
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,840
that are good at the photo shoot part but total trash at the video or vice versa

763
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:37,420
uh yeah however I have been blessed with seeing multiple good um well-versed producers slash directors and stuff

764
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,080
photographers usually they start in camera photography stills and then they go on to do

765
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:50,080
video that makes sense yeah get the static stuff down first and then you're able to do the dynamic

766
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,780
stuff a little more easily and they usually have some every producer usually has their own formula

767
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,320
of how they like things to go okay sure and so they'll do the same things over and over again

768
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:06,140
they kind of have a a grindhouse style of production yeah yeah yeah yeah because for a

769
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,940
lot of porn production companies like they're putting out a shitload of scenes all the time

770
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,000
like i would imagine like as a producer for that you gotta like you gotta get people in and out the

771
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,960
door oh yeah is that um the typical porn scene on in my particular case lasts about two hours

772
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,520
okay all right all right how much of that is down time like how what is the longest out of

773
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,100
stretch that you'll actually be filming um usually i count it from when things start

774
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,940
sometimes there is

775
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,800
makeup and like production but usually when you get there everyone's already there and set up

776
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,280
and you're the diva late to the party yeah yeah i i love being in that position personally

777
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,840
as a host i love bitching at my staff you know being like yeah you got the wrong m&ms

778
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,460
you're probably a lot nicer than the people that you work with you know these are technically

779
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,200
i don't pay them so it's a much less professional relationship yeah

780
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,120
from a PR news story

781
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,120


782
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,120


783
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,560
news in washington i'm at a televised press conference today that was staged as part of a

784
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,820
scheme to expose an alleged racist russian intelligence plot after an explosion in

785
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:24,720
kentucky fire officials appear to be an accident tweet tweet tweet tweet broadway officially ended

786
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,640
this week two gross people were injured sharply according to statistics close to 14 million 0.9

787
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,960
and 1.7 billion 0.1 percent can be explained by

788
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:43,240
PR News. The Commerce Department is posting a 2.2 percent of roughly 3.4 percent.

789
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:51,500
The Russian foreign ministry says this is PR News. I've got to watch this recorder here. I just,

790
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,880
it went from two, the battery was at two of four and now it's at one of four.

791
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,940
One of four. Yeah. It'll either. I don't know what that means.

792
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:09,720
Well, it's like, it's like cell phone power. You know, it's like, I'm only getting one bar.

793
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:16,300
Oh my God. I don't, I'm not getting any bars. This is a dry County. There's no bars out here.

794
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:24,600
Is it really a dry County? No, no. Where I am is you can't get hard liquor except in,

795
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:32,080
you have to join a club for an hour to drink a hard liquor, but they don't sell it in stores here.

796
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,540
They used to be dry until my,

797
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:40,140
my family moved here and my father, the lawyer put an end to that first thing.

798
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,660
Then, then he quit. Then after, then he quit drinking.

799
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,480
Well, nice gift to the rest of the community.

800
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,240
He was, he was a heavy drinker and he moved out here and he said, I'm going to have to make this

801
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,040
County wet again. And he did. And, uh, and then a few years later he kind of went,

802
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,020
I don't think I better drink anymore ever again.

803
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,720
And he was 45.

804
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,160
When that happened and he turned into a really nice guy.

805
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,380
Yeah. Strange.

806
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,580
Yeah. But his old drinking buddies thought he was, you know, it's like, what happened to captain

807
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,380
Stang? He's, he's not, he, what, what happened? Do you, do you know why he quit? And I said,

808
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,440
I always guessed that maybe he woke up in a ditch with his car rolled over on its side.

809
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,520
Somebody's bloody panties in his mouth.

810
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:34,820
And he,

811
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,620
and he doesn't even know who's they were and where they came from.

812
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:37,960
Yeah.

813
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,060
That's what I assume.

814
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,260
Usually. Yeah. That's what usually happens.

815
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:41,540
Yeah.

816
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,360
Why'd you quit drinking? Because well, why? Because the same reason most people quit drinking.

817
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,680
Yeah. That was why I quit drinking, but then it happened again and it traumatized me so much.

818
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,840
I started drinking again.

819
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,880
Yeah. You can't, you can't go 70 and 35 mile an hour zone. You just can't, you can't do that anymore.

820
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,420
I'll tell you what I have not operated a motor vehicle under the influence of

821
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,620
anything in years and years,

822
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,960
Not even Polish cake?

823
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,800
Well, my riding mower.

824
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:17,780
Yeah. And the utility vehicle that my dad left me that it's

825
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:28,600
prinses now used to used to drive way out to the back 40 and, uh, work on my globe. No,

826
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,860
no. We, we, we let go. Um, that's no good. Yeah. Unless they do this Medical have a together mat grind, have they, have they ever done this with a mental fit? Because I think enforceers are afraid of toxic◉ I would

827
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:35,160
We were actually cleaning out dinosaur tracks and making casts of them.

828
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,360
And then when we were finished, we'd celebrate by drinking two beers each.

829
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,240
And then we'd drive back real crazy, wild, screaming.

830
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,420
But this is our own property.

831
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,680
So, you know, and there's no—we're not likely to run into anybody else

832
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:56,280
except my drunken nephews and nieces driving their utility vehicles all over,

833
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,960
or their dirt bikes and stuff.

834
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,000
Well, you're allowed to be a yahoo on your own time.

835
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,640
Yeah.

836
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

837
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,620
Actually, somebody told me that in Texas it's illegal to drink and drive on your own property.

838
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,580
And this is supposed to be a patriotic state where you can do anything you want

839
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,600
except get a shot and wear a mask.

840
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:23,380
You better not do that because, you know, the government has control over your body for that.

841
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,420
Yeah.

842
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,420
And abortion.

843
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,900
You can't get an abortion and you can't get a shot.

844
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,020
Because what will the neighbors think?

845
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:37,160
Speaking of which, you know, the only person who comes here is a nurse for my mother-in-law,

846
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,220
my 92-year-old mother-in-law.

847
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,440
This nurse comes twice a week.

848
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,200
And she told me about two weeks ago,

849
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,520
we went out to the Rangers game and sat in the stands and just hollered and yelled.

850
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:56,880
And I realized this woman in front of me, although she was wearing a mask,

851
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,940
was in a crowd of screaming rural Texans in the big city packed together.

852
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,160
I bet she comes down with the COVIDs.

853
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
And she did.

854
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,980
She had to call in sick on Tuesday and say, I can't come in because I got a fever.

855
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,680
And it turned out she did indeed have COVID.

856
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:24,320
And I hope she can handle it at home because we ain't got no beds left in this county or the next county

857
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,560
or the county after that.

858
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,400
They have to fly people to Oklahoma.

859
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,200
Because they're slightly less backwards there, believe it or not.

860
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,300
It's shocking.

861
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,460
But they've legalized medical marijuana in Oklahoma and Arkansas.

862
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,240
But not Texas.

863
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,160
Oh, hell no.

864
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,220
That's just what the people want.

865
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,160
Like Governor Frankenfurter or whatever his name is.

866
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,660
Oh, God.

867
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,480
Oh, Jesus.

868
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,800
It's quite an anal mess of garbage.

869
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:55,940
Oh, yeah.

870
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,060
Oh, yeah.

871
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,420
They.

872
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:08,520
You know, the funny thing is they thought that the COVID was just going to kill ethnic groups in big cities

873
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,180
that traditionally vote Democrat.

874
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,380
And it did at first.

875
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:23,100
But now it's starting to hit the people who I'm not going to wear a mask even if God King Trump tells me to get a shot.

876
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,480
I'm not going to get that.

877
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,920
King Trump.

878
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:25,860
Yeah.

879
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,580
And they.

880
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,340
And now they're dying like flies.

881
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:36,620
There's going to be a lot fewer, let's say, red state type voters soon.

882
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,160
So there is a silver lining, you could say.

883
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,460
And people are starting to say that, too, I've noticed.

884
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,380
I think we talked about this.

885
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,140
I was wondering about the same thing about Sturgis.

886
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,060
If that turned out to be.

887
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:51,840
Oh, yeah.

888
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,260
The Sturgis biker.

889
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,160
Biker rally.

890
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,480
Yeah.

891
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,900
I ain't afraid of no.

892
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:56,960
COVID.

893
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,060
I'm a tough guy.

894
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,540
I can't breathe.

895
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,000
I ain't going to get no shot.

896
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,580
What do you think?

897
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,080
I'm stupid.

898
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,180
Yeah.

899
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,620
One of them guys in the news, he said, why are you doing this?

900
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,780
It's my freedom.

901
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:14,740
Right.

902
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,740
Well, that's, you know.

903
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:22,020
Well, it's my freedom to drive a car at 120 miles an hour with my headlights off at night.

904
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,020
That's my freedoms.

905
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,920
Yeah.

906
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,420
I don't need to obey red lights and stop.

907
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,360
I'm not going to let my freedoms be abridged by a robot.

908
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,920
I actually heard one of my dad's cousins when I was about six years old.

909
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:47,140
The concept of traffic lights had just been invented in this little South Carolina town.

910
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,500
And this redneck cousin was saying, I'm not going to obey no robot.

911
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,200
That's just crazy.

912
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
So to him.

913
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,080
To him, it was an infringement on his rights to have to stop at an intersection and let

914
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,260
somebody else go through.

915
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,760
It was like, I guess he must have gotten.

916
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,060
Oh, no, he didn't get used to it.

917
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,700
Come to think of it.

918
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,880
He lives in Thailand or someplace now.

919
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,240
Oh, really?

920
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,840
Yeah.

921
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,700
Well, he can't afford to live anywhere else.

922
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:21,160
I thought he took the road insecure, you know, and decided just to go and rat himself out

923
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,920
and live somewhere where they didn't have any kind of robot machines.

924
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:33,160
Because I robot says that you must never hurt another robot or maybe it's people or one

925
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,620
or the other.

926
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,320
You're not allowed to harm them.

927
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,740
Unless, of course, you got the adequate equipment like guns and firecrackers and stuff.

928
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,720
I had a job in Beijing, China in 1986.

929
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,100
And they they didn't have traffic lights.

930
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,620
And most people were on foot or bicycles.

931
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,760
But there were lots of cabs.

932
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,400
And of course, I have no idea what it's like now.

933
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,200
But these cabs wouldn't stop for anything.

934
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:12,040
In fact, a couple of times we we saved bicyclists lives because this guy was just going to run

935
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,460
him over because because he want because they were in the way.

936
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,140
I mean, it was it was it was the weirdest thing.

937
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,460
I told him.

938
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,860
I told him.

939
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,420
I told that that cab driver that I like the music he had on and he just pulled out the

940
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,680
cassette and gave it to me.

941
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,120
Was it were you just being factual or were you?

942
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,140
No, I was I was serious.

943
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,780
It was some kind of folk music that was pleasant.

944
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,880
It wasn't like Chinese opera, which sounds like to our ears.

945
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,980
Sounds like coffee cans being banged together and people shrieking.

946
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,420
Nasal ducks.

947
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,140
Yeah.

948
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,820
And and I had.

949
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,880
I made a friend there, Reverend Lee Lee Jing.

950
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:04,800
And it turned out he I tried to I gave him some music that I thought he might like.

951
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,660
It was Oingo Boingo.

952
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,400
And he hated it.

953
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,400
He said, don't give me more American music.

954
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,760
I I hate it.

955
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,360
I just don't like it.

956
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,940
He liked Chinese opera.

957
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:23,340
He was he was a sound man for Beijing Film Studios and they filmed a lot of those operas.

958
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:23,740
Yeah.

959
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,680
He really liked that.

960
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:38,500
The film was songb remained feedsong shifting on almost Koreans going to the Ivory Coast.

961
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,880
As farther away as it was going to come.

962
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,780
And the funny thing is, the fact that like the Chinese forchlag cosa first show does everything the jury

963
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:45,980
walked for is their song.

964
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:45,980


965
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,580
actually said, look, you know, you know that case goes to you.

966
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,240
I was like, it is like you're asking a question.

967
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,240


968
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,520
Basically.

969
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,720
I'm just to that's figure.

970
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,900
I'm not going to ponto out to the truth.

971
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,420
dead. He's floating face down in the pool.

972
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,700
There's no way he can be breathing. I think

973
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,880
he just went over there and died. Sure he's not snorkeling? There you go. Oh no, he's alive.

974
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,940
Okay. He came up for air. He spouted a minute ago. There's a little

975
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,560
hole in his back. I saw some water squirt out. It's weird.

976
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,640
The Martians also created giant insects to vex

977
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,260
the Earth people during the attack period.

978
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,800
Something which was supposed to go into the movie but was cut out.

979
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,200
Now that's every TV show. Tragic superheroes,

980
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,180
out of control giant monsters.

981
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,580
Just what the public demands. I got to the point where if I see

982
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,540
another werewolf face transformation I'm going to scream. And I used to

983
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,420
live for those. But you only saw a good one every

984
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,620
year or so and then it got to where they were on every TV show.

985
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,120
Oh my God, we'll morph from this.

986
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,100
Face without makeup to a face with a mask on. What a special

987
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,200
effect. It's a lot better than a bunch of dissolves of Lon Chaney.

988
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,940
Really? I thought those were somewhat artfully done.

989
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:08,220
It blurs a little bit. Even a kid could see through it. Well you know it's

990
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,340
an effect but you know also what it represents and the music is portentous

991
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,020
and it comes after a period of dread and then the first

992
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,880
beam of moonlight. The difference is it was rare then.

993
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,140
It was hard to do. It took a lot of time.

994
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,220
Yeah, you do it in your phone. That's one of the tricks of the conspiracy

995
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,500
that they'll take anything that's fun and they'll just beat it to death until you hate it.

996
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,060
Yeah. Like the hippies, you know, for a while there it was kind of cool and then well you

997
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,820
like hippies, we'll give you hippies. Yeah, punks. Same thing. I had to warn the punks

998
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,100
that that was going to happen to them. They didn't believe me. You're just, you're just

999
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:48,580
an oppressor now. No, you'll see all your fashions, your music will be used in beer

1000
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:52,240
commercials in about two years. Sure enough, that's

1001
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,520
it. BLM. Then they had to come up with something even worse than punk. This is

1002
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,820
showing the man and now they're painting the intersections and every major city.

1003
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,900
Yeah, it's like every little fad that the teenagers think is going to change the

1004
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:11,260
world just turns out there been a fad. God damn it. I like the hippie one, that's

1005
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,620
why I still got my ponytail and everything. They were, I got kicked out. I almost got

1006
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:21,200
kicked out of school for for having hair about as long as yours and ever since

1007
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,960
Since then, I was like, by God, when I get old, I'm going to have a haircut just like I wanted to when I was 17

1008
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,060
and look like the bass player for Quicksilver Messenger Service.

1009
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,420
And sure enough, my dream came true.

1010
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:41,140
And wouldn't you know it, every other old redneck in Texas looks exactly the same way.

1011
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:46,960
Every old guy that retires, they grow their hair long and end up with a ponytail.

1012
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:54,520
I used to hide the ponytail in Texas because I might be carrying something they'd mistake for contraband.

1013
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,260
But I'd hide it in my hat.

1014
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:03,120
And then I gradually realized, shit, every old bastard around here looks just like me.

1015
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:08,040
Who needs to bother to go into a town for a God-darned haircut anyway?

1016
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,340
I thought it was like a Chinese reference.

1017
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,880
You know, you had that little pigtail and maybe it was Belcro.

1018
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,320
No, it was more like an iron butter.

1019
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,860
Yes, if bullies cut off Reverend Stang.

1020
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,460
Stang's bony tail, he will lose his strength of ten.

1021
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,420
Cultural appropriation.

1022
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,840
Ching Chong subgenius sitting on the rail.

1023
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,060
Long come a pink boy and chop off his tail.

1024
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,420
That would be the, don't tell your wife that.

1025
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:29,780
No.

1026
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,960
Yeah, the Monster Hunter movie got censored in China because there was a joke about Chinese.

1027
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,740
Now, in context.

1028
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,660
I'm sure they could get along without it.

1029
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,140
It was sort of fitting because there was these two guys that.

1030
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,200
Told bad jokes to each other.

1031
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,800
And one of them was a Chinese-American.

1032
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,860
He said something about, you know, Chinese, ha ha ha.

1033
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,940
It was a bad joke.

1034
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,900
And in China, they wouldn't release the movie.

1035
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,520
Because it translated all wrong into some sort of racist thing.

1036
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,860
Which it wasn't at all.

1037
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,620
But there you go.

1038
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,700
They couldn't edit it out, that one joke.

1039
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,240
They did.

1040
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,460
They did edit it out.

1041
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,220
But by then, public opinion was so riled up.

1042
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,520
This is that movie that hates the Chinese.

1043
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,040
Right.

1044
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:17,740
Yeah.

1045
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,200
Yea, verily, yea.

1046
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:25,980
It's accurate to the game in that it takes forever to kill one of those big monsters.

1047
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,940
So therefore, they could only have two boss fights in the movie.

1048
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,900
There's only time for two boss fights.

1049
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,340
I suppose humans.

1050
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,780
Because it was true to the game.

1051
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,920
Humans are as mosquitos to those lumbering giant monsters.

1052
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,740
So it takes a lot of them to put one down.

1053
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,500
A lot of my fellow Monster Hunter player fanatic addicts.

1054
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,700
Refused to even see the movie because they mixed in modern times with it.

1055
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,500
It's a modern soldier team ends up in Monster Hunter world.

1056
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,060
It's not pure.

1057
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,580
Their weapons are useless against the monsters, of course.

1058
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:05,260
Only an experienced Monster Hunter knows how to make the bow that shoots the special poison made from other monster parts.

1059
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,640
Yea, it would be hard for me to believe that modern artillery couldn't put away any monster.

1060
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,160
Oh, you haven't seen a Rathalos in action, Tal.

1061
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,240
They're faster than you can imagine.

1062
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,420
Anyway.

1063
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,280
It was really fun for me.

1064
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,840
I was supposed to go to Rathalos when I graduated high school.

1065
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,000
You gotta be scared of anything violating the laws of physics.

1066
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,620
Well, sure.

1067
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,700
All giant monsters do that.

1068
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,120
Yes.

1069
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,200
Well, we were watching the Warcraft movie yesterday.

1070
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,780
Well, they basically took the game and turned it into a movie.

1071
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,960
Did you see that one?

1072
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,520
I started watching it.

1073
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,760
I never saw the whole thing.

1074
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,040
It did have a lot.

1075
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,420
There's something kind of corny about it.

1076
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,980
I like the CG.

1077
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,200
Okay.

1078
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:55,460
Yea, it does have that trying to look very much like Lord of the Rings look.

1079
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,540
Is it in a sort of quasi-medieval period or something?

1080
00:51:59,720 --> 00:51:59,860
Oh, yea.

1081
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,680
Oh, really?

1082
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,740
They had the elves.

1083
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,900
But see, the elves here have eyes that glow.

1084
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,720
That must be off-putting.

1085
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,360
So I think they mixed in Dune with the rings.

1086
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,480
The smiles that win, the looks that glow.

1087
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,400
Got it.

1088
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:12,700
Cool.

1089
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:18,000
You know, the old monster fans on Facebook detest CG.

1090
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,940
All you gotta do to give those guys heart attacks is say,

1091
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,660
Oh, I thought Peter Jackson's Kong was much more realistic than the original.

1092
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,040
Oh my God, the next day I felt like I'd mugged a room full of old men.

1093
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:37,600
Yea, they got upset, but they're very partisan to the...

1094
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,360
The other thing you can do to really shake them up is say,

1095
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,420
Well, you know, Lon Chaney Jr. is actually a terrible actor.

1096
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,460
Oh, fuck.

1097
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,300
They'll just go on and on about how,

1098
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,400
Those guys were so much...

1099
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,300
He was so much better than these modern day actors.

1100
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,880
I'm not sure he was so bad.

1101
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,160
A son of Dracula, he's pretty good.

1102
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,880
If he was better than Lon Chaney Sr., I wouldn't say that.

1103
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,380
Lon Chaney III, who actually goes to conventions, you know, just to...

1104
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,240
Well, that's amazing.

1105
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,840
...come to account of his name.

1106
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,860
I hope he comes here.

1107
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,340
Lon Chaney Sr. didn't have to be a great actor.

1108
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:11,340


1109
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,820
He didn't have to talk.

1110
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,100
And he invented all those makeup tricks.

1111
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,340
Well, Lon Chaney Jr. tried to do the makeup tricks, but they wouldn't let him,

1112
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:25,900
because by then the unions were so strong that he couldn't trespass on the makeup people's union.

1113
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:32,660
He made his own makeup for 1 million BC, which was better than what he ended up with.

1114
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,640
And he did that compound fracture thing with the bones sticking out.

1115
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:37,980
But...

1116
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,180
Unions.

1117
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,160
They screw everything up.

1118
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:41,340
Yes.

1119
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,120
My favorite...

1120
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,460
Unless you need to be involved.

1121
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,760
...Lon Chaney Jr. werewolf transformation is in House of Dracula...

1122
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:47,760


1123
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,800
...where he shows up at the police station and says,

1124
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,540
I'm going to go through another one of these werewolf things, and I can't stand it.

1125
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:58,980
Just lock me up in this cell, and don't let me out to whatever I do.

1126
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:06,000
So the inevitable Lionel Atwell police inspector calls in the local mad scientist, and he says,

1127
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,140
Well, my boy, you may think you turn into a beast,

1128
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:14,480
but this is caused by intracranial pressures, and I think in my clinic I might be able...

1129
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,200
You don't understand.

1130
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,400
I'm about to go through the torches of the damned.

1131
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,960
Well, you may think you will, and in our minds we often have strange pictures.

1132
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,420
And then right in front of them he turns into the werewolf with that...

1133
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,220
Is that House of Dracula?

1134
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,080
Yes, yes.

1135
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,860
The hair grows on his face, his teeth start working, his nose starts...

1136
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:36,120
And then he's hurling himself at the bars, gnashing, trying to get at the guy who was just saying it.

1137
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,060
It was all an unfortunate illusion, my boy.

1138
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,960
Which I can cure in my clinic.

1139
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,120
But the funny thing is, at the end of the movie he did cure him.

1140
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,240
But he himself turned into a monster.

1141
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,960
You say it's funny, I thought it was horrible.

1142
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,520
We got no more sequels after that.

1143
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,460
Oh, no. There were, because it reasserted itself.

1144
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:00,960
He cured him, but then it came back so that in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, which is next...

1145
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,680
He's on the phone trying to warn them about the monster conspiracy, which is another thing.

1146
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,500
He never realized...

1147
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,040
Yeah, yeah.

1148
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,460
He was on the monster side.

1149
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:17,100
He counts himself on the human side, Larry Talbot, but he actually belongs over there on the other side with the monsters.

1150
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,940
He's trying to stop their plan and stop Dracula from reactivating the Frankenstein monster.

1151
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,040
He's a good monster.

1152
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,040
Well, he's not...

1153
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,480
When he's not transformed, yeah.

1154
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,660
He won't accept his werewolf identity in any way.

1155
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,600
Well, it was fantastic in In Mice and Men and, of course, the original Superman.

1156
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,460
Yeah, that made such an impression.

1157
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,260
It made all those cartoons with it.

1158
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,560
Which way did he go, George?

1159
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,520
Which way did he go?

1160
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,480
That whole performance was...

1161
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:49,000
He did a very obscure television series called something like The Devil in Room 13 or something.

1162
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,340
It was only about a dozen episodes.

1163
00:55:51,680 --> 00:56:02,000
He did a lot of thrillers and he did on Route 66 the episode Lizard's Leg and Owlet's Wing with Peter Lorre and Boris Karloff.

1164
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,000
Now, when you say thrillers, do you mean thrillers as in the thriller TV show by Boris Karloff?

1165
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,200
Because I don't know what you're saying in there.

1166
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,980
I believe he was in a couple of those.

1167
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,860
I mentioned Lon Chaney Jr. being a bad actor.

1168
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,340
In fact, one of them was a Frankenstein.

1169
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,960
Ten minutes later, we're still on Lon Chaney Jr. tripping.

1170
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:26,120
Well, I feel sorry knocking anybody down to tell the truth.

1171
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:34,360
And the reason these people are prominent and we talk about them is that they have got something and maybe it's a subgenius something.

1172
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,980
Maybe it's a talent that is not experimental.

1173
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,660
Maybe it's not expressed as people understand it.

1174
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:43,460
It seems certainly to stand for a number of things.

1175
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,160
I'm sure we all have a problem like that.

1176
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,860
Stankus doesn't like it because this is all parts he has to edit out.

1177
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,140
But that's what we talked for so long.

1178
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,040
I'll be silent until someone introduces a new subject.

1179
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:06,520
Well, there's an hour of slack that I collected together all of the doctor's explanations from House of Dracula where he goes on and on about how, well, I've got this new fungus I'm growing.

1180
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,320
Yeah, he's growing funguses underneath the castle.

1181
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:14,360
Little does he know that the body of the Frankenstein monster is also down there.

1182
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,460
It's all very scientific.

1183
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah, it's quite scientific.

1184
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,460
Yeah, those were the lines I liked from that movie.

1185
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,220
Well, don't forget the gorgeous hunchback girl.

1186
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,860
They combined two monster types, the gorgeous girl nurse and the hunchback into one.

1187
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,680
She gave me mixed feelings as a child.

1188
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,720
Yes, she's supposed to.

1189
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,160
Yeah, that hunchback is.

1190
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,500
Especially when she's attacked in the end by J. J. Martin.

1191
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:36,500


1192
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:36,600
Yeah.

1193
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,300
And Dr. Edelman.

1194
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:43,240
Now, Hal, you would know, did Lon Chaney do all of his stunts as the Wolfman?

1195
00:57:43,540 --> 00:58:05,260
Not only did he do all of his stunts, but sometimes he put on the Frankenstein makeup and did stunts for other people in Frankenstein movies, particularly Bela Lugosi in Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, but also in House of Frankenstein where Hugo the hunchback is thrown through the glass window by the monster.

1196
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,500
Well, he was very interesting.

1197
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:06,700
He was very interesting.

1198
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:06,700


1199
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,280
And he was actually Chaney Jr.

1200
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,340
I can remember some scenes in which he was extremely athletic.

1201
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,320
He was a great big guy.

1202
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:19,460
He's this huge lumbering doofus, which is why he's incredibly improbable as Claude Raine's

1203
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,580
son in the original Wolfman.

1204
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,400
Well, you never knew who Claude Raine's wife was, so big break, though.

1205
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:25,800
Yeah.

1206
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:32,380
Evelyn Ankers said that she was scared during some of those Mummy movies because, as the

1207
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:35,520
Mummy, Lon Chaney Jr. didn't have to act, really.

1208
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,840
You couldn't really see his face behind the makeup.

1209
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And he would get drunk.

1210
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,880
He would sip vodka through a straw.

1211
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,560
Yes, he had an alcohol problem.

1212
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:48,100
And then he had to carry this actress along these trails.

1213
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,280
He was strong enough.

1214
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:49,980
He could do it.

1215
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,580
Yeah, but she was terrified.

1216
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,540
And she was really pretty.

1217
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:56,860
Because he was drunk, and she was afraid he was going to drop her off this ledge.

1218
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,100
Very pretty woman.

1219
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:58,840
I always thought it was Manna Leaves.

1220
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,520
Beautiful actress.

1221
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,460
Tanna Leaves.

1222
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,320
The Tanna Leaves.

1223
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:02,920
That was vodka.

1224
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,760
That was all bilge and bunk.

1225
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,620
Yeah, he was drinking.

1226
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,120
That was the original movie.

1227
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,980
That was in all the sequels that he had to have Tanna Leaf tea.

1228
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,220
All right.

1229
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:17,040
Although, it was something in the Tom Tyler one, whatever that one was, where they spill

1230
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:22,060
the tea and the mummy frantically gets down his hands and knees trying to lap it up with

1231
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:26,120
no tongue to get even a few molecules of Tanna Leaf tea.

1232
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,720
Yeah, the slurping, the great slurping.

1233
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,860
That would be a great product to make, though, Tanna Leaf tea.

1234
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:32,940
I think that would really sell.

1235
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,800
They did a good thing for the...

1236
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,500
I think that would sell.

1237
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:40,480
Whatever the mummy movie is that Tom Tyler plays the mummy, where they just optically

1238
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,900
blanked out his eye sockets, so they have a traveling mat on his eyes so there's nothing.

1239
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:52,520
You're looking at his eye holes, but there's nothing in there whenever you see him.

1240
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,280
Yeah, I hate when that happens to me.

1241
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,800
Well, it shows.

1242
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,640
Those traveling mats really irritate your eye.

1243
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,040
They sort of sparkle around the edges.

1244
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,260
Being a supernatural phenomenon.
