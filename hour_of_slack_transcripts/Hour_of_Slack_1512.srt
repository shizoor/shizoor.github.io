He has to be stopped.

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,820
We've always done things our way.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,360
Now he wants to come along and change things for the people.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,220
Change is trouble.

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:06,640
For me

106

ights

107
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,440
I'm hoping when I wake up all you people will be gone.

108
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:51,380
But I don't have a chain, I'm always in a loop.

109
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,200
Lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock.

110
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,880
If space is one, it goes in a way.

111
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,540
A lock that's shining the dark.

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,440
If time is the one that looks friendly.

113
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,360
But so does the way that's sharp.

114
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,040
But, but, but, but, don't ever change.

115
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:22,200
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

116
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,500
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

117
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,120
If there is one with a firelight that shines on the comfort.

118
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,780
That glitters and gleams in the twilight.

119
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,080
It clearly goes right.

120
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,460
But, but, but, but, but, but, but.

121
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,960
He's gone

122
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,260
But he'll never change

123
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,040
He's gone

124
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,640
Always will be

125
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,760
He's gone

126
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,140
He's fine as the one with the double

127
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,200
That rings on the most like a rhyme

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,020
He's naked as the one with the bottle

129
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,720
In a family full of pride

130
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,220
He's gone

131
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,440
But he'll never change

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,100
He's gone

133
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,840
Always will be

134
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,920

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,540
He's gone

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,520
Make a thing name

139
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,280
Run

140
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,520
He's gone

141
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,280
He's gone

142
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,260
He's gone

143
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,040
He's gone

144
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,760
Thank you.

145
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,920

Our water is pulling toward EOR.

157
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,540
I got Bob in the sky.

158
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Well, I played the Beastie B.P. one bright and sunny day.

159
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:34,240
When I finished listening to it, I put on some Q&A.

160
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,480
My turntable started jumping.

161
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,420
What it did I know not how.

162
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,140
Oh, yeah, Bob knows how I cried.

163
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,300
Oh, well, I got Bob in the sky.

164
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,300
And it scratched my duty now.

165
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,460
You can sing it.

166
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:07,460
May your records be unbroken by and by, by, by and by.

167
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:18,340
There's a vinyl heaven waiting in the sky, Bob in the sky.

168
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,300
Well, I bought a cello.

169
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,440
I got a second copy.

170
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,060
Listened through red-eye express.

171
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:39,940
When my girlfriend came on to me, she started taking off her dress.

172
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:50,820
Oh, yes, with come hither, I she called me in a sweet and sultry voice.

173
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:57,720
I just told her, you gotta wait now, girl.

174
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm listening to Freedom of Choice.

175
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,320
Oh, come on.

176
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:12,600
May your records be unbroken by and by, by, by and by.

177
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,740
There's a vinyl heaven waiting in the sky.

178
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,360
Bob in the sky.

179
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,320

190
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,940
Well, I know I've been a sinner

191
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,660
Gave my life that evil twist

192
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,540
Gotta say I ain't no Christian child

193
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,880
Cause I'm a new traditionalist

194
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,140
When I hear that truth evolving

195
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh no, I never stop

196
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,640
Cause my heart is

197
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,940
Never gladder

198
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,560
Than when I shout that name above

199
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,140
God, may your records

200
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,800
Be unbroken

201
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,680
By and by, by, by and by

202
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,660
There's a vital heaven waiting

203
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,320
In the sky, Bobby, in the sky

204
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,540
Now I know I ain't no young'un

205
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,180
One day I'm gonna be old

206
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:30,060
Got that total evil feeling

207
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,320
And now it can't be told

208
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,740
But I got my high five

209
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,460
Got my jukebox

210
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,980
Got my albums in my lap

211
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,200
Should I ever

212
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Lose my way now, Bobby?

213
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,680
Well, I got smooth noodle maps

214
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, hey, may your records

215
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,620
Be unbroken

216
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,560
By and by, by, by and by

217
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
There's a vital heaven waiting

218
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:20,060
In the sky, Bobby, in the sky

219
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,540
One more time

220
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,480
May your records

221
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,920
Be unbroken

222
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
By and by, by, by and by

223
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,980
There's something

224
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,140
For everybody

225
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,140
Yeah!

226
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,600
Yeah!

227
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:41,600


228
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:41,600


229
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:41,600


230
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,980
In the sky, Bobby

231
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,060
In the sky

232
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,940
Ooh, yeah

233
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,220
All right.

234
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,100
Peace.

235
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:33,720
And dear friends, that was our good friend, Reverend Andrew Genus with the Mutant Mountain Boys, recorded last X Day Drill, a song, May Your Records Be Unbroken.

236
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't mean to be sexist, but she is as beautiful looking as she sounds.

237
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,560
That is so true.

238
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,240
Understatement.

239
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,860
We heard PR News by Leemur.

240
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:56,260
We heard a song called Pink Boys by, I guess it's pronounced Jerry Faison.

241
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,920
It sounds like a French name.

242
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,480
Jerry Faison or Jerry Faison.

243
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:10,980
Anyway, before that, Dr. Hal Robbins' classic song, He's Bob, redone by Reverend Weaver.

244
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,980
Wilhelm Stahlhelm, a serious remix there.

245
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,820
Before that, another Dobbs Barrage by the Psychoskeletons.

246
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,200
That's the actual title.

247
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,760
Before that, a little piece of Bob music by The Large out of Finland.

248
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:39,140
And the song Give Me Slack was by Max Slack, who sent us a whole album's worth of songs around 2008.

249
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,740
They were all played on.

250
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,720
It showed and then kind of disappeared until recently.

251
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,960
So we're assembling albums.

252
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:53,780
Stinking Sack of Slack, Near the Beginning was by Reverend Duet, if I'm saying that right.

253
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:03,760
And the title song was by the El Queso All Stars, wherever and however they may be these days.

254
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,440
I've wondered about them a lot.

255
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,760
And I have a little rant here.

256
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,980
Actually, I have two or three rants.

257
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,820
I have two or three rants to read that I collected off of Scrub, or which were censored off of Scrub Genius Forum on the Internet.

258
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,740
Well, the one by me was censored by me, if I get around to it.

259
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:31,440
But there's a nice rant here called Slack Is by Reverend Dr. Shawgoth.

260
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,140
Whoever he or it is, I don't know that person, I don't think.

261
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,900
Although technically, I could look him up and find their human street.

262
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,020
Name and home address and possibly even credit card numbers.

263
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,300
Does that scare you, friends?

264
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:47,780
It should.

265
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,620
But you shouldn't be scared by Slack.

266
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,800
Slack is, and this is a minor rant in a minor, I suppose.

267
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,440
Slack is the feeling of walking in your favorite shoes.

268
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,380
Slack is the secret grace in idle times.

269
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,120
Slack is the knowledge that 7-Elevens are our cathedrals.

270
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,880
And smokes and a big gulp are our bread and wine.

271
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,700
TV killed the radio star over Slack.

272
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,460
I shot Liberty Valance because he told me it would give him slack.

273
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,660
I hope it did.

274
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,780
I accept no blame.

275
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,880
Slack is the feeling when your deadbeat neighbors actually pay you back a ten buck.

276
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,580
And you're not even paying the tax they owe you.

277
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,600
Slack is what you feel when you steal from work and cheat on your taxes.

278
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:58,840
Slack is when you find an extra twenty in your pants on a day you're broke and just need twenty bucks worth of froth.

279
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,240
Slack is the fact that 9-11 was art.

280
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,220
Slack is Bud Dwyer.

281
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,980
Slack is the fact that 9-11 was art.

282
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,120
Slack is knowing you're the pinnacle of creation.

283
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,280
Slack is being able to live off nothing but the boogers you pick.

284
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:28,580
Slack is customer rewards cards that actually give you something like a free hot dog instead of fake discounts.

285
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,240
Slack is bosoms.

286
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,020
Slack is peni.

287
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,860
Slack is special holes and butt flaps.

288
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,320
Slack is an uncomfortably sexy clown.

289
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:56,080
Slack is dreaming you're broke and waking up remembering you have more wealth than any millionaire because you have slack.

290
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,840
Slack is nothing more and nothing less than slack.

291
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,840
Nice.

292
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,220
That was, again, that was by Reverend Dr. Shawgoth.

293
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,700
I hope he's not really a Shawgoth.

294
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,460
That would spell the end of our reality eventually.

295
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,860
It's probably just a name.

296
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,100
Nice, clever name.

297
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,700
Anyway, here's another rant.

298
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,760
Easter is Freedom Day.

299
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,920
This is our Easter rant.

300
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:35,460
It was posted, I think, yesterday by Reverend Biggerstaff, which is a new name to me.

301
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,100
I don't know.

302
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,440
It's a nice British Isles kind of name.

303
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,480
Biggerstaff.

304
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,940
Mm-hmm.

305
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,900
And people who aren't listening closely might be offended.

306
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:55,220
But if you listen the right way, you'll realize this is all good.

307
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:07,220
Having been wished a happy Easter enough times to make me want to puke, I've decided to be a little more proactive and begin wishing people Happy Freedom Day instead.

308
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:17,780
You see, about 2,000 years ago, a dirty subversive named Jesus was conspiring to commit acts of terrorism against both church and state.

309
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:28,460
Making no attempt to hide his anti-government message, this self-appointed Christ went from town to town proactively encouraging public dissent.

310
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:37,200
A man of little tolerance for other religions and quick to point out the petty shortcomings of others, he was frequently spotted in the company of prophets.

311
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,200


312
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,140
His

313
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,360
turning around.

314
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,140
His

315
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,020
turning around.

316
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,980
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

317
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,220
. STATING

318
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,140
STATES

319
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,400
STATES

320
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,180
STATES

321
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,540
to believe that he had another very powerful but hidden accomplice.

322
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,000
Stories of this powerful but unseen ally

323
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
bringing horrific retribution to anyone that stood in the way of Jesus

324
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,060
began to spread.

325
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,200
Soon the people were bound by a climate of fear.

326
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,360
They were completely powerless against the terrorist Jesus.

327
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,780
Luckily, conservative forces within the government

328
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,440
were not afraid to act.

329
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,880
After just a little political wrangling,

330
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,720
Jesus was captured, tried, and executed for his crimes.

331
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,700
Thank God!

332
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,640
Thanks to all those brave centurions

333
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,480
and thanks to the courage and determination of the conservative party.

334
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Now, at last, we're finally free.

335
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,440
Free from traitors and terrorists.

336
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,920
Free from dissension.

337
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,860
Free from the fear of gangs

338
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,260
and retribution from untouchable gang leaders.

339
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,580
Free. Free at last.

340
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
Thank God Almighty.

341
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,660
We're free at last.

342
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,540
So, happy Freedom Day, friends.

343
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

344
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,260
Yeah, by Dr. Reverend Biggerstaff.

345
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,820
The good Reverend Biggerstaff.

346
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,440
Or he might be a bad reverend.

347
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,160
With a name like that, he might be real bad.

348
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,720
But see, friends, don't you get it?

349
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,000
Everything's backwards now.

350
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,800
It's all reversed.

351
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,460
You just haven't noticed yet

352
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,600
because you've been brainwashed

353
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,900
by all that history book reading and world traveling.

354
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,200
Because today, it's the gay bullies

355
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,300
who are in the vast majority in this country

356
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,900
who pick on poor defenseless minority loners,

357
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,640
such as the nice Christian boys and girls

358
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,420
who have no support group.

359
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,300
These queer bullies

360
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,440
and their leftist commie PETA member servants

361
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,380
beat the Christians up,

362
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,800
drive them to suicide,

363
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,380
drag them behind trucks,

364
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,940
out them on the internet,

365
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,520
and want to take the phrase under God

366
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,640
back out of the Pledge of Allegiance.

367
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,880
Leftist perverts totally control all media,

368
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,280
especially the most popular,

369
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,540
popular radio talk show,

370
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,760
news networks,

371
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,200
and TV punditry.

372
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,360
And worst of all,

373
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,640
the socialist state forces innocents

374
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,420
to perform disgusting abominations

375
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,300
such as baking sick Adam and Steve wedding cakes

376
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,040
instead of inspiring Adam and Eve wedding cakes.

377
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,420
It is so incredibly unfair

378
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,120
being a white male Christian in these United States,

379
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,820
this hotbed of witches and Stalinists,

380
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,800
and the

381
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:44,500
most corrupt and corrupt people in the world.

382
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:54,120
And I'm not saying that we should all be

383
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,200
on horses and ride west.

384
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,820
That will show those liberal elites.

385
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,520
Now, what is this button over here?

386
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,500
What's going on here?

387
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,540
I don't know.

388
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,280
What is happening?

389
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,880
What's happening over there?

390
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,540
Okay.

391
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,440
I thought it was...

392
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,500
I saw a little buzz,

393
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,680
a little light over there.

394
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,520
I thought it might be, you know.

395
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,600
Yes, I thought it might be, you know, too.

396
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,200
That cowboy.

397
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,200
That lone, lonesome, lonesome cowboy.

398
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,080
But in the meantime,

399
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,480
we'll just listen to this sailor jig here.

400
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,200
Sailor music from the country of Mocha.

401
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,040
The ancestral Mogians used to dance to this kind of music.

402
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,780
How about that?

403
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,380
Traditional Mogian tune.

404
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,120
Yeah, the ancestral Mogians.

405
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,980
Yes, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

406
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,600
What?

407
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,200
I did the credits.

408
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,680
I did the three rants.

409
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,020
I do have another song here I could put on.

410
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,780
Another song?

411
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,680
Yeah, I think I will.

412
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,100
I will.

413
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,200
I will.

414
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,280


415
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,280


416
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,280


417
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,280


418
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,280


419
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,280


420
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,500
Fat Mandy.

421
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,200
I love Fat Mandy.

422
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,840
Converted her song,

423
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,500
the Gandhi Shake,

424
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,080
to the Bob Dobbs Shake.

425
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,900
And I believe this is a version that was recorded

426
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,620
in lovely...

427
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,220
Well, let's see.

428
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,000
First, I have to stop this,

429
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,400
put this thing on track.

430
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,480
What is it, nine?

431
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,540
We should hear the dulcet tones

432
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,860
of P-H-A-T, Fat Mandy.

433
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,300


434
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,500
Bob Dobbs lives and Bob Dobbs breathes.

435
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,680
But only if you so believe.

436
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,820
You don't deserve.

437
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,940
You were a saint.

438
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,140
Well, a tent is and you just ain't.

439
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,920
Bob Dobbs is all I'm fighting for.

440
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,480
He's living in our big hotel.

441
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,360
Don't tell a soul, alive or dead.

442
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,280
It might be a lie, but it's a lie.

443
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,360
So, τις' mind dog as bad as Mr. Demysik.

444
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,500
And I'm just gonna shake you.

445
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,300
Shake, shake, shake.

446
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,880
Bob dobbs shake, brought up.

447
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,280
Shake, shake, Bob Dobbs shake.

448
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,280
You do the shake, shake, shake.

449
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,160
Wait, ropes' comp.

450
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,280
Shake, shake, shake, recommend shake.

451
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,300
You do the shake, shake, shake.

452
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,720
Sheikh, shake, shake.

453
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,780
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake!

454
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,800
Brisbaneco Bob Dobbs.

455
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,760
Brisbaneco Bob Dobbs.

456
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,860
Super Bob Dobbs.

457
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,640
He sweep so совершtee.

458
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,820
Brisbaneco Bob Dobbs.

459
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,780
Brisbaneco Bob Dobbs.

460
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,880
Brisbaneco Bob Dobbs.

461
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,580
Shushi.

462
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,000
And that was Fat Mandy.

463
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,600
And this should be Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

464
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,600
Yes, we just passed the 30 minute mark.

465
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:06,040
I think it's a Lonesome Cowboy Dave imitator who's playing a trick on us.

466
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,020
Really? Like an able-fueled trick?

467
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,580
Yeah, because they could hear us waiting for Dave, so they took advantage and they called the number.

468
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,800
And this guy's, it's probably the large...

469
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,800
Doing his best Dave imitation.

470
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,420
Yeah, Reverend Angry Lonesome Cowboy Larry.

471
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,440
What Dave, huh?

472
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,120
I just said I was not a very important person. I'm an infinite potato.

473
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,660
I'm a sack of spud.

474
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,420
No, no, no, no, no.

475
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,960
Take a creepy nuggin.

476
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,920
Your mind's all screwed up, see?

477
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,840
No, I'm sorry.

478
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,900
Well, yeah, that's okay.

479
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,900
It's supposed to be that way. Bob's not finished with me yet.

480
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,500
Mm-hmm.

481
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,320
Oh!

482
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,880
It's just funny. We're screening devices.

483
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,680
Oh.

484
00:32:52,420 --> 00:33:00,520
Well, as long as your socks fit, you know, and you feel free as a bird, what else you got to worry about in this world, you know?

485
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,660
Yeah, we got nothing to worry about.

486
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Not a thing.

487
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,700
Yeah, right.

488
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,440
When the saucers come, our cups are going to be ready.

489
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,020
Yeah, or they'll be running a thing over, all over our pants.

490
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,500
No, well, yeah.

491
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:15,860
Cups.

492
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:26,340
Hey, since we're recording this broadcast on Easter Sunday, how was, did you find any Easter eggs or secret messages?

493
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:34,980
I found a bunch of secret messages scripted in the sky, sigils of an abstinence.

494
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,700
I was told.

495
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,500
So God planted Easter eggs in his mighty program that we call reality.

496
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,060
If you can hack into it, you can find those Easter eggs.

497
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,780
They're just fan, you know, little tips of the hat for the fans.

498
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,480
Inside jokes and stuff.

499
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:01,280
You get a free Mario Brothers hat for your character if you crack the reality code.

500
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,540
Since God is now in league with Nintendo.

501
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,460
Yeah.

502
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,320
Well, what do you think of the name?

503
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,360
One of the holy names of God is in Nintendo.

504
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:18,880
He's just Nintendo or any, uh, oh, what's it's like some sort of Catholic religion of the East.

505
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,460
We're like dollars or something like that.

506
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:33,460
And as we read here in the book of Nintendo, the prophet Mario came forth and he did battle with the donkey Kong and other demons of the abyss.

507
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,760
Only to then.

508
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,940
Then find his lost brother.

509
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:43,440
How come their last name is Mario Brothers and the guy's first name is Mario?

510
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:43,880
Okay.

511
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,820
We've covered that.

512
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,920
There's no answer.

513
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:52,960
I believe the Japanese designers said that is a mystery that will remain to the end of time.

514
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,020
Uh-huh.

515
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,080
Ha ha.

516
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,640
Stupid.

517
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:02,420
It would be the same as if some European designers came up with the Suzuki Suzuki method.

518
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,760
It's just like the city is so nice.

519
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,580
They named it twice.

520
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,520
Was that, uh, San Paolo, Brazil?

521
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:20,220
Well, or the La Brea Tar Pits since La Brea means the tar pits, the tar pit tar pits or Pikachu Peak, which means peak peak in Arizona.

522
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,160
I suppose somewhere there's somebody has named something the ocean sea.

523
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,500
Oh, that was Christopher.

524
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,020
Yeah, that was Christopher Cullen.

525
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,620
Yeah.

526
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,880
The famed, uh, you know, extropologgrapher.

527
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,200
Yeah.

528
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,280
Geographist.

529
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,460
Christopher Cullen?

530
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,340
The man who explored the back entryways of the, of the entrance to the hollow earth?

531
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,200
Yeah, of course.

532
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,320
The Arnie Sotnesium of colonoscopy?

533
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,080
Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, that's the guy.

534
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:51,640
Yeah.

535
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,580
He was, uh, let's see, he was, uh, absconded in, uh, 1492.

536
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,340
Oh, you're thinking of Christopher Columbo.

537
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,520
That's different.

538
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,860
Also called Cristobal Cologne.

539
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,020
Oh, right.

540
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,580
Cologne.

541
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,200
Which is, you know, an easy pronunciation if you're trying to make yourself laugh when all you can do is cry.

542
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,800
Well, we can bitterly gripe about how he discovered the, uh, ways, the fastest way to torture Indians.

543
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,380
But that isn't this holiday.

544
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,740
This was Easter holiday.

545
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,560
Of course, by the time most of our listeners hear this, it'll be thankfully long past.

546
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,080
They'll, if at best, they'll still have belly aches from eating too much candy.

547
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,540
Yeah, the bunnies will be stinking.

548
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,900
And there'll be snot, slot, slot-laden bags everywhere around the house.

549
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,280
And most of the kids, you know, have already gone to sleep already.

550
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,900
In the bosom of, uh, Morpheus.

551
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,360
Or something like that, right?

552
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,180
Never mind.

553
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,480
Yeah, Morpheus.

554
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,660
He's the guy with the red pill and the blue pill.

555
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,860
And the purple pill.

556
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,640
And little Nemo.

557
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,560
Yeah, I know, I know all about that.

558
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,580
I read all my comic books.

559
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,520
Ever since the turn of the pre-war era.

560
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,160
Slumberland?

561
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,500
Huh?

562
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,400
Were you a lover of Little Nemo and Slumberland?

563
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,280
Uh, I, I, I'm more of a jilted lover of Little Nemo.

564
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,540
He was kind of too young for me, and he was a little boy.

565
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,300
So, yeah.

566
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,600
No wonder he left you.

567
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,960
However, I had a big crush on Windsor McKay, the guy who drew Little Nemo and Slumberland.

568
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,960
And didn't exactly invent comic books and cartoon animation as we know them.

569
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,520
But he was one of the first.

570
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,400
The first that was really good at it.

571
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,260
And proved that you could do great stuff that will last the ages.

572
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,260
Kids, if you're not familiar with Windsor McKay, check it out.

573
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,480
Don't be fooled by the imitation Little Nemos and Slumberland that are around.

574
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,620
Although, they're not bad.

575
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,880
We picked up some of those for our grandchildren.

576
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,520
Yes.

577
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,700
And the artists were trying really hard to duplicate that psychedelic style.

578
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,940
Truly great.

579
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,900
And I think it's a good example for them to chew, though, you know?

580
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,060
At that age, thinking of some kind of ubermatch, you know?

581
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,180
From the demonic mind to control people.

582
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,400
Oh, those comic books will give you, they'll give you nightmares as bad as, I don't know,

583
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,120
a rare bit.

584
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,520
Well, yeah.

585
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,260
I think of Lovecraft.

586
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,880
He was a, wasn't he some sort of infidel or, I don't know.

587
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,840
H.P., the writer H.P. Lovecraft, inventor of the Cthulhu mythos?

588
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:33,940
Right.

589
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,440
Or discoverer, I should say.

590
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:41,320
Because a lot of people believe that he was a prophet of Cthulhu and the flying spaghetti monster.

591
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,100
Of course, we recognize these as primitive superstitions.

592
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,180
Really?

593
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:55,360
Quaint and interesting and certainly of interest to anthropologists and people who study pathetic,

594
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,560
run-down, beat-up cultures.

595
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,480
Good for nothing nobodies.

596
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,180
Yep.

597
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,960
So, yeah.

598
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,160
But unlike us.

599
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,260
With our superior culture of fairy tale religions.

600
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,920
And our razor-sharp intellect.

601
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,100
Like Paul Bunyan.

602
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,520
We can pick apart flaws and attend to little gratuity.

603
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,780
Never mind, the seminary is closed now.

604
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,900
Well, we, you know, we can, we have more sophisticated gods.

605
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,960
Paul Bunyan.

606
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,620
Bob Dobbs.

607
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,980
You know, we're not, people can't be satisfied with these.

608
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,140
We can't be satisfied with these.

609
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Primitive superstitions.

610
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:46,700
Well, some people have said that Paul Bunyan's great blue-ox babe is actually an incarnation of the Brahma bull.

611
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,200
The bull of Brahma.

612
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,760
Right.

613
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,020
The third night of Prawaya, which in the Hindu religion means when all the relaxation is going on.

614
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,560
People are in the hot tub.

615
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,060
That's at least until Tuesday.

616
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,360
And then they have to change their whole way of thinking again.

617
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,780
And it requires another hipterdoctor.

618
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:16,020
Well, and Paul Bunyan himself was the reincarnation of the Hindu god or goddess Kali, the destroyer.

619
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,340
With his mighty axe and his seven other arms.

620
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,660
All holding jackknives and switchblades and bowie knives and things.

621
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,480
Axes.

622
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:29,960
Yeah, key-openers.

623
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:30,960
Yeah.

624
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,900
Car keys.

625
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,400
But Bob is the one.

626
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Is the one true Huguenot.

627
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,820
Is that the right phrase?

628
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,440
The one true Huguenot?

629
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,400
The lunch me Huguenot?

630
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,180
Is that the same character?

631
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:50,020
No, the Huguenots were the French resistance against the Popish Catholics of.

632
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,220
Oh, the Popish Catholics.

633
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,700
Yeah, the especially Popish Catholics.

634
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,840
The papist Popish Catholics of France.

635
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,340
France.

636
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,480
And under Louis the.

637
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,240
Cator.

638
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:03,380
Cator.

639
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,020
14th.

640
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,620
Yeah, he burned a lot of Huguenots and made them into galley slaves and stuff.

641
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,300
Yeah, they did.

642
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,080
I mean, that was, they were what we would call Protestants.

643
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,280
And back in them days, why it was Catholics versus Protestants.

644
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,000
Just like they had in there in Ireland.

645
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,360
They had them in France too.

646
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,580
And the Catholics won.

647
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:32,140
They usually did because there was more of them than there were what we might call freethinkers or even mere Lutherans.

648
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,760
I don't know, man.

649
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,460
It was complicated bunch of stuff.

650
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:41,340
Luckily in the Church of the subgenius, we just have the rewardians and the emergentiles and there's no competition.

651
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:48,200
The emergentiles win by default because they're the only ones who are trying to get anything done whatsoever.

652
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,980
And then the.

653
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,640
Even if they fail, they win.

654
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,680
What happens to the disgruntled?

655
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,920
Well, there's no room in the church for the disgruntled.

656
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,920
If you're not gruntled.

657
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,320
We don't want you.

658
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,060
You might as well go join some other silly religion.

659
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,180
You know, I was worried about that because gruntles are mounting up.

660
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:21,460
I find vast gruntleds are in disfavor with practically everything I've encountered in my local mail service and my Internet too.

661
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:29,880
And I think it's because of the corruptigation caused by these various psychic elements that try, you know, just like a demon would.

662
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,900
They work their way up.

663
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,740
They work their way into a system and then become the system.

664
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,580
So I'm living with these little demons that I call computers and stuff like that.

665
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,600
And I can't do anything with them other than, well, you can't kill a demon.

666
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,900
You can only make it go away and go into something else.

667
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,720
At least that's what I was told.

668
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,860
But Huguenots told me that when they were Dalek slaves.

669
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,840
Well, they weren't very good with them.

670
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,080
They were no better with computers than you, Dave.

671
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,620
And that's not saying very much.

672
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,780
No offense, you idiot.

673
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,400
Well, I try.

674
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,740
I'm not, you know, I'm.

675
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,200
Well, I'm a bit of a Luddite, of course.

676
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,740
Of course.

677
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,020
It's from all that lead you've been eating.

678
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,920
If you'd quit, if you'd lay off the lead for a little while, maybe you'd be able to work one of these damn machines.

679
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,260
They're not that different from horses.

680
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,280
You just have to kick them, whip on them, you know, show them who's boss.

681
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,480
Yeah.

682
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,240
But have you ever had Ludd pudding on an Easter morning?

683
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,560
There is nothing like that in the world.

684
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,160
Oh, no.

685
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,420
Having your head shaved.

686
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,700
I have been kicked in the head by a computer.

687
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:30,720
Yeah.

688
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,220
I've been bucked and thrown by a computer.

689
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,480
Luckily, I landed in the computer manure instead of the cactus patch.

690
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,940
But it's about the same as horses.

691
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,100
Still sounds painful.

692
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,420
Computer's nothing but a glorified hammer, and you shouldn't be afraid of it.

693
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,600
No, I mean, it is.

694
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,120
It's a tool.

695
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,600
It's just an extension of your hands and eyes and ears.

696
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,060
And, you know, that's all.

697
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,600
It's just another machine, a tool.

698
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,060
It's a damn tool.

699
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,480
How are you saying that?

700
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,260
I've been using it to pound nails.

701
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,120
It's a good thing.

702
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,340
Right.

703
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:03,860
Exactly.

704
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,320
Why not?

705
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,540
I've put it in photographs and arguments.

706
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,920
You could be doing computer animation if you choose to use your computer as a literal

707
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,400
hammer.

708
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,820
Well, it's still getting used.

709
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,340
Yeah, I keep on thinking of the hammer of Zeus, the hammer of Thor, and all these other

710
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,220
nativist gods.

711
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,560
Just like in all the books that we fail to read.

712
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,140
The pipe of Dobbs.

713
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,460
The ball of peen hammer of Dobbs.

714
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:29,460


715
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:29,460


716
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,140
Yeah.

717
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,860
Most importantly, of course.

718
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,780
I mean, I've tried to use Bob's hammer as a pipe for many years now, and I found nothing

719
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,560
but frustration.

720
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,500
And I think that's the way it was intended.

721
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,380
He kept pulling on that little ball peen hammer going, this thing is clogged.

722
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,960
I'll just try sucking harder.

723
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah.

724
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,780
Yeah, that's what happens when parts of your brain are decaying.

725
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,680
Parts of your brain are decanted?

726
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,440
Did you see you decanted?

727
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


728
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


729
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


730
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


731
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


732
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


733
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


734
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


735
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


736
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,440


737
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,660
Yeah.

738
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:04,460
You're able to ... Could you spare some of that decanted brain?

739
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,580
Of course, I got it for sale, baby.

740
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,020
I mean, I'm not giving it away.

741
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,060
What do you think, I'm crazy?

742
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,660
This stuff's worth some dough.

743
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,140
Well, yeah.

744
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,580
Real-life Dave brain?

745
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,040
Mm.

746
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:16,560
Mm-hmm.

747
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,720
Isn't that an album?

748
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,620
Wasn't that an old album that we did?

749
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,600
Real-life Dave brain?

750
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:20,700
Yeah.

751
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:27,760
Something like Escape of the Dave Brain, Escape from the Dave Brain, Son of ... I can't remember.

752
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,420
Son of the Dave Brain.

753
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,420


754
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,420


755
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,420


756
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,420


757
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,420


758
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,420


759
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,420


760
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,420


761
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,280
Well, you're trying to make it like some vast erstwhile blob figure that devours everything

762
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,380
and just kind of keeps slopping along.

763
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:38,740
That was it.

764
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,080
The blob meets ... Yeah.

765
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,440
Son of the blob meets the Dave brain.

766
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,480
And they had babies at the end.

767
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,560
They were just like little cute blob ... It was a comedy movie more.

768
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,520
It was more of a takeoff on B movies.

769
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,180
Well, the original had Lucille Ball playing the head mommy.

770
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,420
And Ricky Arnaz is ...

771
00:45:59,420 --> 00:45:59,420


772
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Ricky Arnaz is the banker.

773
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:07,940
He would come by and have relationships with various women he didn't want to talk to anymore.

774
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,080
And he made a lot of money that way and started a Cuban band.

775
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,020
I think they called them the Marimbas or something.

776
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,220
But how would I know?

777
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,380
The Marimbas.

778
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,400
It was that.

779
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,220
Made a clickety clacky kinky sound.

780
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,420
There's more of that ancestral Moguian music.

781
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


782
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


783
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


784
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


785
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


786
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


787
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


788
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


789
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,420
There's a lot of music in the background.

790
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:38,360
Some anthropologists recorded the Moguians before they were all wiped out by the monsters.

791
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,320
The tidal waves.

792
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,080
Monster Island.

793
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,900
Oh, man.

794
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,940
That sounds sad.

795
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:51,560
I mean, if we're getting topical now and talking about things that are happening in our world,

796
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:57,420
the sacrifice of those poor, poor people at the hands of the Moguians.

797
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,860
Is that what you said?

798
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm not sure if I ...

799
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:09,740
Well, the bird-worshiping Moguians wiped out the lizard-worshiping Moguians was the problem.

800
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:15,700
And next thing you knew, the birds took over and then there were no Moguians whatsoever.

801
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,560
So they blew it.

802
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,100
The lizards be keeping the bird population down by eating their eggs.

803
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,860
So that's what happens when people interfere with this stuff.

804
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,460
We try to teach them science, the forbidden sciences, as well as ...

805
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:28,840
Yeah.

806
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,960
The accepted sciences.

807
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,220
But they'd rather watch YouTubes of each other.

808
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,560
Upsetting the balance all the way.

809
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,120
Yeah.

810
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,180
Yeah.

811
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,780
And this is a time, more than any other time, especially when the Earth is ready to spin

812
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,380
off its axis and plow into ...

813
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:47,560
What?

814
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:47,680
Again?

815
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,300
What?

816
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,340
Again.

817
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,300
We just did that.

818
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,900
The odd time this week, man, that this could be the one that we have to worry about.

819
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,400
Are we going to end up back on what we used to call Mars?

820
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:58,840
Yeah.

821
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:58,840


822
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,180
We're going to have to switch planets yet again.

823
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,580
If it spins off of its axis, is it going to collide with the horse's asteroid?

824
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,020
That happened in that Ben-Hur space movie.

825
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,860
We were both supposed to say, nay, nay, nay, nay real quickly like that.

826
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,420
Okay.

827
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,440
Nay.

828
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,700
There we go.

829
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,080
Okay.

830
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,420
There was scissor space.

831
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,500
We can insert that cut.

832
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,820
The meteorite is coming.

833
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:28,820


834
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:28,820


835
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,320
The music in the background might suddenly change.

836
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,800
It didn't work.

837
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,040
Watch it a little bit more.

838
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,820
Oh, man.

839
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,100
But there must be slack.

840
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,000
Somewhere there must be slack, Dave.

841
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:46,620
Somewhere.

842
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,180
Somewhere.

843
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,940
Did you look under the bed?

844
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,220
Did you look in your car?

845
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,540
Maybe you left it in the car.

846
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,880
Could it be in the glove compartment?

847
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,780
Maybe it fell and got kicked under the seat.

848
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:58,800


849
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:58,800


850
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:58,800


851
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:58,800


852
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:58,800


853
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:58,800


854
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,760
Where is the slack?

855
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,140
Where is the navel of the universe?

856
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,700
And it's not DNA level C as we've said so many times before.

857
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,720
Where is the true navel of the universe?

858
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:11,840
It's belief.

859
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:19,360
That would be where the umbilical cord brought food into the fetus planet.

860
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,320
So you would look for something like the nozzle on a bike tire.

861
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,180
Someplace where there was an insert point.

862
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:28,780
Where you just...

863
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,620
could be pumped up.

864
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,980
Where is the Earth's belly button, friend?

865
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,560
Skull Island?

866
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,080
Sunk beneath the waves?

867
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,680
Atlantis?

868
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,460
The great crystal of Atlantis

869
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,860
used to plug the belly button of Gaia?

870
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,680
Mrs. Gaia?

871
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,680
Whatever happened to Mr. Gaia

872
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,340
and the little Gaia years?

873
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,180
Yeah, really, we don't much care about that.

874
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,200
All we do is care about

875
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,040
the preternatural navel of Gaia.

876
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,620
We don't care about Pappy.

877
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,280
You know why?

878
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,360
Because Gaia has bosoms.

879
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,920
That's why everybody likes bosoms.

880
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,060
Everybody likes boobs.

881
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,480
Because it sounds like Bob.

882
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,900
It's just an extra zero in it.

883
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,140
Or an O, I mean.

884
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,700
That's different.

885
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,200
Slightly.

886
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,560
I didn't know you were going down that trail.

887
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,580
I thought you were, you know,

888
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,880
going to describe the area,

889
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,760
the regional zones,

890
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,040
and the different conflicting administrations

891
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,080
and interagency groups and departments

892
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,420
that all rely on the navel of Gaia

893
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,600
for their nourishment.

894
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,260
Yeah, they're also saying

895
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,500
don't mess with Mother Nature,

896
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,460
Mother Earth.

897
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:27,920
What about,

898
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,860
what about Pappy Earth?

899
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,420
What about old Grandpa Earth?

900
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,360
You know, that's what I meant.

901
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:34,980
That's what I'm saying.

902
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,700
Men are just being kicked around.

903
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,900
They're an abused minority

904
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,660
because the feminazis of color

905
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,600
are just abusing the poor, innocent,

906
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,200
put-upon, overweight, white males

907
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,960
of Christian descent.

908
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,140
It's just shameful the way

909
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,620
that people, nice old wasps like me,

910
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,800
just get bullied so terribly.

911
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:01,500
They're just tough, tough gay fairies.

912
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,180
They hurt my feelings.

913
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,540
They made me feel not like a first-class citizen.

914
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,140
And Christians are persecuted.

915
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,480
You're always the first class, you know what?

916
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,760
And don't worry about it.

917
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,100
Don't cry.

918
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,460
You're getting drool all over my shoes.

919
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,320
They pick on us big, tough men.

920
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,060
Don't worry.

921
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,020
They pick on us big, weak men.

922
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,980
They're sissies.

923
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,020
And, and,

924
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:32,220
and minorities, religions, and, and peoples,

925
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,340
they pick on us poor, poor, poor, innocent...

926
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,320
honky dudes.

927
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,580
I'm Bradley.

928
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,480
They make fun of us rednecks, too.

929
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,140
Have you noticed the elites?

930
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,560
They make fun of us rednecks.

931
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,780
They just think we're like second-class citizens.

932
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,680
They think we're ignorant

933
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,820
just because we don't know nothing.

934
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,800
They think we just don't know nothing.

935
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,040
They think we're just a bunch of idiots.

936
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:58,040


937
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:58,980
Just because we don't know nothing.

938
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,020
I hate stimulates and science, science peoples

939
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:09,840
and their silly, psps, psss, knowledges and stuff.

940
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,000
I hates that.

941
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,320
It's just, it's oppressing me.

942
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,380
That's a salt.

943
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,640
I just don't...

944
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,000
When they make me feel stupid,

945
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,700
that's a salt!

946
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,060
That's a salt!

947
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,460
I thought that was nitrous oxide.

948
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,020
I had no idea that was a sulfite.

949
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,580
Er...

950
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,600
Anyway, how could people need the navel for nourishment?

951
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,700
Wouldn't they need the bosom of Gaia?

952
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,500
No, first you need the belly button hose.

953
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,080
Then when you come out, you need the bosom.

954
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:47,920
When you're in the earth, you no longer need to be directly influenced by the earth's currents.

955
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:54,300
Once you emerge from the earth, just like the San Hopus Indians out in the many areas of Arizona and stuff,

956
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:59,120
when they climbed out from the belly of Mother Earth, then they had to get a job.

957
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,040
They had to feed themselves, and that's why there are so few Sanskrits left in the...

958
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:11,780
Well, what you do is you get a job sucking the milk of Mother Earth, which we know as oil and gas.

959
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:21,360
These lactating areas of the planet can eventually be drained completely dry.

960
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,280
We can also do that with all of the underground.

961
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,700
Underground water as well.

962
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:31,300
And eventually, once it's all in our bellies or burned up in our atmosphere,

963
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,780
then we just move on to the next planet, as Bob dictated in his mighty wisdom.

964
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,100
Because, you know, there's useful planets everywhere.

965
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,440
They have some kind of air.

966
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,600
Sure they do.

967
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,860
They have some kind of gravity.

968
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,500
Some of them have tons more gravity than we have here.

969
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,120
Wouldn't that be nice to have?

970
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,000
Extra gravity.

971
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,080
Yeah.

972
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,040
I don't know what's wrong.

973
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,940
Why don't we just desalinate?

974
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,860
Why does the liberals conspiracy be talking about having to run it out of water?

975
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,660
Why don't we just desalinate the ocean?

976
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,920
There's a whole ocean out there.

977
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,160
We're just desalinating plants.

978
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,100
That's all they need.

979
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:10,640
They just make...

980
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,540
They're stupid.

981
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,040
They're just stupid because they don't make the desalinating plants.

982
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,820
Anybody can do that.

983
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,160
It's easy.

984
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,460
It's easy.

985
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,120
They're just stupid.

986
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,540
Why don't they ever think of anything smart?

987
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,660
What's wrong with these people?

988
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,980
They're below a subgenius.

989
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,540
They're below the primates.

990
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,320
Wait.

991
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,580
We're primates.

992
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,800
Well, anyway, they're terrible.

993
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,400
Well, that's one thing we share in common.

994
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,960
We all hate primates.

995
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:46,640
If it wasn't for those damn primates, we'd be walking around on four legs instead of six and we'd be talking to butterflies.

996
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,220
We'd learn how...

997
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:52,960
We'd talk about cabbages and different vegetables and fruits and stuff like that.

998
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,060
Man, we would...

999
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:57,360
It would be like the beginning of a new epic or a new era.

1000
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,780
And we would...

1001
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,540
I don't know if we'd consecrate the earth with our sweat and blood and urine,

1002
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,120
but of course we'd probably provide some kind of moisture because that's the kind of guys we are.

1003
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,560
And you know that Dobbs is going to do something like that.

1004
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,820
Bob Dobbs was made for such a task.

1005
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,560
Although I can't really recollect what the task was, I know that he's capable.

1006
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,480
He's going to do it, whatever it is.

1007
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,020
Well, he may not do it, but he's going to do something.

1008
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,840
And that's all that matters because it's Bob.

1009
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,580
If it's Bob, it doesn't matter what he does.

1010
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,680
As long as he's doing something.

1011
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:40,960
Even if he just sits there smoking on that pipe of his, grinning like some kind of a card shark that knows something you don't know.

1012
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,300
Or he wants you to think he knows something you don't know.

1013
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:52,040
Or you've shaken it upon yourself to decide that he looks like he's trying to look like he knows something you don't know.

1014
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,860
But really, he's not trying at all.

1015
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,220
That's all on you.

1016
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,160
You're the one that decided that.

1017
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,480
He's not deciding anything.

1018
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,120
He's just letting things happen.

1019
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:05,300
Because no matter what he does, whatever he lets happen is going to happen in his favor.

1020
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,400
That's just the way it is.

1021
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,420
It's just a coincidence that never ends.

1022
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,260
For Bob, that doesn't work that way for every subgenius.

1023
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,400
I've known a few that thought they were going to be like Bob.

1024
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,840
Remember Pope David Black?

1025
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,180
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

1026
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:23,780
All right.

1027
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,120
I don't think so.

1028
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:35,620
When you decide that you're equal to J.R. Bob Dobbs, my friend, then you just put up a challenge to the universe.

1029
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:43,400
That sooner or later, that universe is going to slap you back in just the way that's going to make the most people laugh at your sorry butt.

1030
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,080
It's a form of comedic karma.

1031
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:53,300
It's watching yourself slip backwards in the bathtub and strike your head and die while everyone is, instead of helping you, they're laughing.

1032
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:53,760
Like, blah.

1033
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,220
Look at the idiot fell down and struck his head in the bathtub.

1034
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:04,820
It's one of those super silly as afternoons where you just warm your feet and drink hot cocoa and think of the next thing that's going to happen.

1035
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,280
And it just doesn't.

1036
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,440
It just doesn't.

1037
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:21,080
You know, that description of slack makes me want to quit what I'm doing now and go home and just soak my feet and soak my head and soak my tub.

1038
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,340
I have a tub that needs to be softened.

1039
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:23,700
I'll soak.

1040
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,520
I'll soak the tub first.

1041
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,160
Then I'll put water in it and then I'll get in the tub and everything will be soft, soft, soft.

1042
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:30,620
Slack.

1043
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,720
No jagged edges.

1044
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,140
Slack.

1045
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,100
It would sure beat doing this radio show.

1046
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,640
I wish the incoming host would show up.

1047
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,820
Because if he doesn't, I'm just going to have to put on puzzling evidence and walk away.

1048
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:51,880
But then again, if we think of today as being Easter day and you think about a pathetic interloper like Dr. Smalls

1049
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,760
and some of the other people in the world, I'm going to have to put on puzzling evidence and walk away.

1050
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:53,920
I'm going to have to put on puzzling evidence and walk away.

1051
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,780
People that have been arguing downstairs, you know, and causing trouble with the police.

1052
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,820
These are the very same people you must extricate like a bad wisdom tooth.

1053
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,480
Those fannies and disarmed robots from your immediate family.

1054
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,880
You have to throw them out.

1055
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,120
You have to say, look, here's the door.

1056
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:17,600
Then you point out the window or some other part of the house until they understand what's really going on.

1057
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,700
And you don't.

1058
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,400
You squeeze that part of the house like it's a big pimple and just squeeze that pus.

1059
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:30,200
out that unwanted those unwanted guests like pus out of a big old pimple just get that stuff out

1060
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:38,760
of your life for friends it's an abscess it's a form of spiritual abscess and you fill the void

1061
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,780
why you fill it with bob because same thing that's in that void it's the same thing that

1062
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:52,860
bob's full of same thing it's in his head nothing and everything my friend but you know dave

1063
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:59,400
i don't know if you have a clock or a watch or a sundial or something but this show is basically

1064
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:06,740
over and i have to say that that some few people have been listening to the hour of slack from the

1065
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:13,200
church of the subgenius broadcast from wcsb at cleveland state university and if they want to

1066
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:21,900
know more which after this hour i seriously doubt they could check subgenius.com yes if they were

1067
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,760
interested they could do that we can't

1068
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:31,520
make them do it i have the original porky pitch from the 1930s or daffy ducks from the 1930s

1069
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,640
hang on to them not literally of course because most of you are shredded anyway most of you people

1070
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:44,640
out there you're in the wastebasket that's what you're looking more of the same and that's where

1071
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:50,200
you're going now and me too and princess we were all going down down down i'm fading these

1072
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,900
voices down because i'm going to put on some

1073
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:01,340
other person's radio show that could go on for another hour because i was ready for that in case

1074
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:06,860
you don't have incoming show host doesn't show up okay it's we're all just going down

1075
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,300
i gotta bring the music down too
