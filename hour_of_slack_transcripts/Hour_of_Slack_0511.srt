1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,660
Dammy. Dammy. Welcome once again to Dammy Fine. Dammy Fine. Dammy Fine. Dammy Fine. Dammy.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,940
It's a Dan Fine show. Dammy. It's a Dammy.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,660
Now we're going back to the Dockstock party for a big memorial breakfast for those who died during the show.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,380
Ah yes. We'll be leaving here soon. We'll be boarding our private jet flying back to Arkansas.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,500
The amount of destruction just.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,620
You guys are ready to go, right?

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,360
We're ready to go, aren't we?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,980
Sam, you ready to go?

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,900
You ready?

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,640
No problem, Bob. Frisket will help me. Come on, boy.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,100
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,760
The subgenius.

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,980
Hour of Slash.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,380
I hope Bob's doing better than us.

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,520
Don't worry, Enzo. Bob wouldn't have gone to meet Hexadecimal without a really good plan.

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,960
I'm sure he'll be able to do it.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,060
That's your whole plan?

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,120
Yep.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,540
And neither of us are expected to survive?

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,820
That's right.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,420
Well, that's not much of a plan, is it, Pilgrim?

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,320
Oh, well, we never were known for our excellent plans, now were we?

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,560
Now where were we, though?

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,240
The crime takes place on voice or computer conversations over digital phone lines.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,840
Sooner or later, they'll begin to believe it.

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,980
On digital lines, communications are transmitted in electronic pulses represented by the ones and o's of computer conversations.

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


33
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


34
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


36
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


37
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


38
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


39
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


40
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


41
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


42
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


43
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,860
Yes, it's all binary now. Not like the analog world I grew up in when I was a boy.

44
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,360
No, everything's different now.

45
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,680
Everything's digital.

46
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I give the new technology a big zero.

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,340
And I give it a big thumbs down.

48
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,680
No, it's number zero.

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,940
Well, but that is a high number, right?

50
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,220
It's kind of a mixture between infinity and nothingness.

51
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,140
It's a big valve.

52
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,760
We prefer to think of it as a valve with rather crunchy numbers instead of a switch.

53
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,360
Oh, you mean a number vacuole or a number valve in a mathematical structure.

54
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,480
Yeah, I'm putting a number in here.

55
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,320
Oh, look at it go. It's infinite, of course.

56
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,820
It builds it up right instantly.

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,440
The fact that we have a technology that is superior in every way.

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,900
This is having a bad habit of actually working out that we're computer Armageddon.

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,840
We prefer this valve technology.

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,020
And here we are in the technological future as we march forward.

61
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,120
We are the new technology.

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,120


63
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,280
We are the new technology that is going to turn our world into our, whatever, destiny.

64
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,520
Well, you know, that's what that is over there?

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,860
That's right.

66
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,560
We must grasp the nettle and strike forth bravely and boldly.

67
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:38,680


68
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,920
With our special daggers, with the wonderful language and lost words.

69
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,860
Oh, it's so good to be back in a radio studio of some kind.

70
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,100
Even if it's somebody else's radio studio.

71
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,360
Yes, that's the way we have to do it nowadays.

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:04,300
days, but I'm going to bring up this old-timey music here and just share some time with you,

73
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,980
dear friends, some Christmas time.

74
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,540
Even though, I mean, I know that you're going to be listening to this show two or three

75
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,980
weeks from now at best, and now, for me, it's Christmas still.

76
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,320
I mean, it's just about to be.

77
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,180
It's time control, friends.

78
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,460
And, yes, it's true that we had quite a pain-filled and depressing show last week.

79
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
Now, didn't we?

80
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,240
I kind of like it that way myself.

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,340
But we had had a number of failures, you might say.

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,960
Things had just kind of stacked up a bit.

83
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,480
And, you know, that's the one thing, though, the one constant in life, dear friends, the

84
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,160
one thing that never fails is failure.

85
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,680
Failure.

86
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,120
That's one of our new wise quotes.

87
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,600
But now, at least, I feel like we can get back to blaming the conspiracy instead of

88
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,300
blaming ourselves.

89
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,680
Yes, the froppy shipments came in, and everything should be okay.

90
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,800
And besides, as the sexecutioner pointed out to me, he said, well, you shouldn't worry

91
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,160
about spreading too much hate on the hour of slander.

92
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,600
And another boy was dying yesterday.

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,000
He said, well if we forget about the적인 term for what we do, if we don't treat somebody

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:46,980
like Youh's pretty much bad in many ways in our own development, why is that the Yesterday

95
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:46,980


96
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,000
And heी's confused, because he said that bodyism, we say, is part of life, is part

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,160
of self, part of who we are.

98
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,160


99
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,160


100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:58,600
X point out, that missing mass is accounted for by the invisible self-contained hate particles,

101
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:08,420
yes, the hate particles that comprise at least one half of our universe and create the push-pull

102
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:16,180
dynamic, the tension with its opposite particle, slack, the slack particles, and thus we have

103
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,540
a constant in and out, in and out of slack and pain and hate, and that leads me to our

104
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:29,720
second most recent wise quote, and this is one I'd like to put on, I came up with this

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
myself, and I'd like to put it on bumper stickers.

106
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,840
I'd rather be killing optimists.

107
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,660
Friends, I would indeed rather be killing optimists.

108
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,140
I do.

109
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,680
I didn't get kind of fed up that last week because, well, I was getting such weird feedback,

110
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,320
and my feedback, unlike the great Jimi Hendrix heard here in the background with his too

111
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:09,000
late holiday themes, my feedback comes from the telephone and email and the World Wide

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Web and everything else, the mail, the regular squid mail, and what I keep hearing is second

113
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,640
hand reports of people going, I've heard that Stang dude, he's like, he's blind, but he can see in his

114
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,920
visions, and he has this white hair that's seven and a half feet long, and his voice has like been

115
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:36,060
modified, and he can like hypnotize you, because he has like ten cigarettes sewn into his throat,

116
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,900
and he has this harem of weird chicks that's like, because that's like all he can get off on, man,

117
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,360
and he's like so mean, he has such a power of hate, man,

118
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,960
and harness it, and like explode your gas tank, he has like super powers, dude, like he's almost

119
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,420
the anti-bob, he's almost the exact opposite of slack, he's like this super genius, he's just

120
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:05,060
this head, and he invented these drugs, but he's like twisted, man, and I don't know what your

121
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,100
problem is, there ain't nothing wrong with my vision at all.

122
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,100
Dear friends, we do wish you a happy new year, and we're going to bring you a show that goes

123
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,740
on and on about the revolution.

124
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,540
Resurrection! Yes, the resurrection, not of Jesus, nor even of Bob, but of merely Dr. Legume,

125
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:31,080
that disgusting lion preacher, so well known to subgenius followers, and psychofants, and bobbies,

126
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:39,760
and even his fellow preachers, and we can't do justice to the Legume resurrection devival,

127
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,180
because we don't have time, but...

128
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,660
Get your pulpit up here, we need those...

129
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,080
Black balloons on our second set, so they're going to be laying around trying...

130
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,460
Well, I won't move the pulpit up here until you guys are done.

131
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,880
No, we're only doing, we're doing two separate sets.

132
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,360
Oh, are you? Oh, okay.

133
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,280
So we're doing one set, and we're, some preaching, and then we're doing another set, black balloons,

134
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,780
like our third song, our second set.

135
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,260
Oh, okay.

136
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:02,640


137
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,800
Okay.

138
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,580
Oh, man.

139
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,120
Well, I changed my mind, friends.

140
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,820
That's, uh, pardon me, what?

141
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,740
What, what, what, what?

142
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,700
That's, uh, forms of insanity.

143
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,120
There, uh, from, that's typical, uh, subgenius devival music, see?

144
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,100
The monster mash.

145
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,740
Uh, actually, that's one of the, one of the few...

146
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:45,740


147
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,840
I don't know if there's a movie that's clean enough to play any of, but that wasn't actually what I was going to do.

148
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,780
Um, because I changed my mind.

149
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,560
I have to bring you this news report here, and this is true news from Pilot Magazine.

150
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,080
All right.

151
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:06,320
The Arizona Highway Patrol came across a pile of smoldering metal, metal, embedded in a cliffside

152
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,260
that they thought at first was a wreckage of an airplane.

153
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,020
Close examination showed it to have been a car.

154
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,640
Initially identified...

155
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,340
from the remains, but laboratory examination revealed an extraordinary truth.

156
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:28,160
The car had been a Chevrolet Impala, to which the now dead driver attached a...

157
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:39,200
jet-assisted takeoff solid-fuel rocket of the type used to boost the takeoff performance of heavy military transport aircraft.

158
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,980
Out in the deserted road, he fired up the...

159
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,740
jet-assisted takeoff rocket.

160
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:45,960
Unit.

161
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,080
Highway Patrol specialists estimated the Chevy was traveling at 250 to 300 miles per hour.

162
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,900
Its brakes completely burned away in an effort to stop.

163
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,580
By the time it reached a cliff-flanked kerf.

164
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,480
Smoldering wreckage embedded in a cliffside, friends.

165
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,440
It was a man who went for slack the only way he knew how.

166
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,720
Put a jet plane engine...

167
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,520
on the back of his car in the middle of the desert and just take off.

168
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,700
Go for it, man.

169
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,500
Ohhhh yes.

170
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,920
I'm sure we'll all meet him on the other side as well.

171
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,600
Alright.

172
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,600
How's everybody doing?

173
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,320
Alright.

174
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,680
Well, a lot of people have been having a hard time finding this place tonight and...

175
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,720
Well, that's because we hit it on purpose.

176
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,200
Only you have been able to find it...

177
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,360
Only you have been able to find it...

178
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,360


179
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,720
which means only you are supposed to do it.

180
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:45,720


181
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,940
to be here. Well, tonight we're here, by the way, I'm Reverend Bevilacqua, and we're here

182
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,580
tonight for a momentous occasion. First, it is the second year of Lemuria, which is a

183
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,420
celebration of the dead flying lemur, and we're also here to celebrate the very dead

184
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:15,880
Dr. Legume. Let's hear it for Dr. Legume. Thank you. Tonight you're going to observe

185
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:23,620
something that most mortals will never experience, the subgenius memorial service. Now, the official

186
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,020
report is that Dr. Legume was killed several months ago while riding his motorcycle. He

187
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:35,280
was hit by a drunk driver. The driver of that car has since disappeared. He never went

188
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,400
to work. He never went to work. He never went to work. He never went to work. He never

189
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,400


190
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,720
went to work. He never went to work. And it appears he was just simply released. In

191
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,240
fact, every attempt at getting the records, which we have tried, has come up with absolutely

192
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,680
nothing. In fact, if it wasn't for the initial report, it would be as if it never happened.

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,360
It's not hard to figure out that this is an obvious plot by the conspiracy. For when

194
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,760
they found out a subgenius was killed, the offender was probably not only released, but

195
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,400
celebrated and given a reward. And it probably was all about the fact that he was killed

196
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,400


197
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,700
plan from the beginning, but tonight is not a night to seek vengeance, for we're doing

198
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,720
that tomorrow night. Tonight, we celebrate Legume, who is crushed like just so much roadkill

199
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,900
on that dangerous highway of normalcy.

200
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,880
Shut up! Shut up, freaking animals! Shut up!

201
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,320
Shut up!

202
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:34,220
Hello, friends. It is with heavy heart that I stand before you today in remembrance of

203
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:41,080
the great, late Reverend Legume. Those of you who were blessed to hear his fire-breathing

204
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:48,720
diatribes knew that Legume wasn't just familiar with Bob. He was possessed by him!

205
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,100
Give me a praise, Bob!

206
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:01,840
He preached the real word of Bob, words of hate and power, not the Uncle Tom, touchy-feely,

207
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,480
oh, why can't we just get along?

208
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:12,580
Good new world order and touchy-feely new age Bob talk. The conspiracy labeled him controversial,

209
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,500
polarizing, inflammatory. Ever since he took his 12-gauge shotgun and blew around through

210
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:28,440
the roof in a conspiracy church in Pittsburgh, they would never forgive him. Oh, yes, their

211
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,980
religion is based on forgiveness, but for Reverend Legume, never forgive!

212
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:40,760
Dear friends, that is because Legume offered the greatest threat to their system. He wasn't

213
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:49,120
just talk, he was action. At work, the conspiracy hierarchy issued psychological profiles for

214
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,680
each of the little peons to fill out. Legume took his, drew a big X on it, and added a

215
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,480
little love note. The CEO heard about it, and that he labeled his profile a crock of shit!

216
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:13,940
He went ballistic! Who would dare? Who would dare question the conspiracy's right to creep

217
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,600
into the very minds of all its little worker peons? Who would do this? The answer, of course,

218
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:28,040
was Legume. They wanted him fired at once, but Legume's supervisor refused, because it seems that

219
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,640
Legume did all the work around there. In fact, he was their best employee, so long as he was treated

220
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,560
decently.

221
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,980
Which, of course, the conspiracy has a very tough time doing. Eventually, the top brass backed

222
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,100
down, and Legume prevailed. By standing up to them, he sent a chilling message the conspiracy

223
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:52,900
would never forget. Legume is not a team player! Legume can't be beaten down or pushed around.

224
00:14:53,260 --> 00:15:00,200
Legume makes waves! His defiant example inspires others to stand up to authority as well! Legume

225
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,080
is a threat to their system. Legume must be destroyed!

226
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:13,340
And now it just seems that they achieved exactly what they set out to do. Now, on the eve of his

227
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:19,860
East Coast tour, a tour in which thousands would hear the important words that Legume had to

228
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:30,100
deliver, he is cut down. Coincidence? I think not. We believers in Bob may not be geniuses, but we

229
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,200
can still add two plus two. We can add two plus two to the game. We can add two plus two to the game.

230
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,020
We can add two plus three and four plus nine as well. I've surveyed these things, I know.

231
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,140
That's because we become a little suspicious when our rising stars are cut down on the eve of their careers.

232
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,760
After all, it wasn't too long ago that Bob himself was assassinated live on a stage in San Francisco

233
00:15:50,760 --> 00:16:00,960
before an entire audience of followers. We admit this could have been a coincidence. Oh, I could line up

234
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,200
with the molecules in the floor and fall right through, but it's very unlikely.

235
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,200


236
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:10,940
Isn't it? But how many coincidences, dear friend, does it take before a pattern emerges?

237
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,820
As Legume himself was fond of saying, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.

238
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,700
And how right he was! On the Friday night, 24 hours before his untimely death, Legume phoned me to say

239
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:31,900
he had uploaded his first ever recorded rant on the sacred 900 number, the fly of which you'll find right over there

240
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,860
and you can tell yourself that he died.

241
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,540
This was the first rant that he delivered to a mass audience of needy subgenies like yourself.

242
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:48,520
He planned many more. Rants that would tear the bleeding scab of silence off the conspiracy wound of censorship.

243
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:56,000
When later I heard that his alleged accident had led him incapacitated, in fact somewhat cold and dead,

244
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,540
I called up the sacred 900 number in order to hear his words of guidance.

245
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,020
I wanted to hear these final words.

246
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,200
He had spoken to me, and yet they were erased.

247
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,700
God! Missing! Coincidence! Another coincidence! Possible, maybe, but unlikely.

248
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:22,540
If the conspiracy thinks that they can shut us up through incrimination, intimidation, or assassination, they have another thing coming!

249
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,480
Praise God!

250
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:33,520
As the end times approach, expect them to get more and more desperate, to resort to lower and dirtier tricks to achieve their sinister purposes.

251
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,080
On July 5th, 1998, they're going to pay for their sins with interest.

252
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,560
If we're wrong and they're innocent of this particular crime, we apologize for nothing!

253
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,140
They can direct our anger to other schemes they committed against us,

254
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,960
a sea of sins they perpetrated against us that we were unable to detect at that particular time.

255
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:02,920
But on July 5th, 1998, we are going to rip out those sewer lines and follow that toilet-papel trail,

256
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,060
right up to the very butt-heads that tried to commit their evil against us!

257
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,860
And we've got a special hell reserved for them.

258
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,260
We'll leave the details of that hell as a secret.

259
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,880
Because if there's one thing pinks can't stand...

260
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
It's suspense.

261
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,480
In the meantime, we'll fight on!

262
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,460
The goon must be Saucer's apprentice.

263
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,380
For instance, carrying water for Bob.

264
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,580
When the conspiracy cuts him down, accident or not,

265
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,160
two more subgenius rise up to take his place.

266
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,980
And then four, and then sixteen, and on and on and on!

267
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,160
Because the essence of Lagoon is still alive, my friends.

268
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,280
His spirit lives, breathes, and fights in each and every one of us who stand up to the conspiracy!

269
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,020
Give us your praise, Bob!

270
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,420
We won't forget him, and we won't allow the conspiracy to forget him either.

271
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,980
We'll burn his name into the foreheads of the pinks, just like the cattle they represent.

272
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,280
Lagoon will be the thunder heard in the distance before the world splits in twain.

273
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:23,940
And as those end times arrive in the pleasure saucer's land, guess who'll be the bouncer guarding the gates to that saucer?

274
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,960
It'll be Lagoon!

275
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,920
With his skin-head polished bright, and his baseball bat ready for action!

276
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,300
I think I pity the fools that do not have their tickets ready, my friends.

277
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,620
Because I know Lagoon!

278
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,620
And if he can't punch their tickets, I'm sure he'll find a convenient substitute.

279
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,000
Hear it at the word of Bob! Praise Bob! Amen!

280
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,520
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,000
Um, I'm gonna have to go pretty soon, because...

282
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,120
They're trying to finish making a Lagoon face here, a Lagoon mask.

283
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,180
Which... are you gonna blow that up too?

284
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:08,420
I don't know. It all depends on what... if Lagoon shows up, we're gonna have to... we're gonna have to...

285
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,220
I don't know... subdue him somehow.

286
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,140
Uh, slip him a Mickey or something. Put him... put him to sleep.

287
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, spunk him a Flicky and tie down his legs with both, uh... you know, with both hands under it, like you did the last time, I think it was in Philadelphia, when he started brutalizing that, uh... that, uh... that... uh...

288
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,720
Japanese lady.

289
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,100
Yeah. Well, you weren't supposed to know about that.

290
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,680
I was standing right there.

291
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,020
Then go on the air and do the show.

292
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:39,680
Well, this... you don't have to worry about any of this stuff. We got... we have integrity. We were plugging all this stuff and everything, but this is a closed cellular phone line.

293
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,420
Oh, okay.

294
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,500
And, uh, as a matter of fact, not only can no one get in, no one can get out, you know.

295
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,860
So... but... at the Lagoon wake...

296
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,200
Yeah. I was there. I witnessed it.

297
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,980
Yeah. Um, you... yeah, I was surprised.

298
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,000


299
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,700
I was surprised you only did two songs. We were hoping that you would do more after you broke the mic.

300
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:11,800
Well, I was hoping I'd just go up there and break the mic and then fall off the stage and not break my guitar, but maybe break enough, you know, of my hands or something like that that I could pretend that I had... had a more serious injury and get out of it entirely.

301
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:25,420
Well, the thing is that some people thought that... that... that... that things like that were in poor taste at the funeral of a... of a man who had died but was beloved by many.

302
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,700
Well, he was a man who was beheaded by...

303
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:36,680
What really made him mad was that at the end of it, the guy that was supposed to be dead walked out and laughed at them.

304
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,080
Laughed at everyone who had come to pay their respects.

305
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,820
I know, and in his silly tooth-nail-polished-mincing style, he began to dress everybody down.

306
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,260
He started to tell you that your shoes were wrong for the... I guess the color of your hair.

307
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
He called me an old man.

308
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,760
He called you a very, very old man and a... and a...

309
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,980
not-so-young woman.

310
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:05,720
And then he stormed around the stage making these huffing-puffing noises while long... long fronds of his own expectorate came out of the side of his head.

311
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,320
And...

312
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,280
Yeah, he mocked those who had mourned him the most.

313
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,360
I know, and I just... I...

314
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,260
He talked for abusive treatment.

315
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,760
Well, I... I respected him for that.

316
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:25,300
And then he decided that the Church of the Subgenius had been... had been too huggy, sweety, you know, new-agey...

317
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,640
Kissy, smoky, uh, huggy.

318
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,100
It was...

319
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,260
He thought it was what had turned into the Fuzzy Little Bunny Church.

320
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,080
And then he had... and then he went around and did the Huggy Bear Bunny with everybody in the front row, which was the most disgusting part of the whole thing.

321
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,740
And he was not mocking it.

322
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,780
He had just ruptured... I guess his inner ear had ruptured when somebody threw that grape there.

323
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,000
And then he was just on his own from that point on.

324
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,300
He was, like, totally out there, and that's when, uh, the restraint things happened.

325
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,280
Ladies and genitalia, this is... this can only be tricked for topical reasons.

326
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,340
This cannot possibly be.

327
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,400
I...

328
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,080
This would be like telling us that pro wrestling is fake.

329
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,160
This is not possible.

330
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:22,180
Brothers and sisters, this is just living proof that... that Bob could appear in the skies tonight and speak to the entire world, but then still be some dick that would say he's not real.

331
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,680
Yeah!

332
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,220
Yeah!

333
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,500
Yeah!

334
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,100
And then he would claim that there was something in the water!

335
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,780
That some scientist had... had mass-hypnotized everyone!

336
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,060
But here you have it! Proof! Proof of Bob Dobs!

337
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,320
Yeah!

338
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,580
Speak to us, though, Bob, to the corpse of the goons!

339
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,120
Somebody get me my bat!

340
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,320
Yeah!

341
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,600
Took me from the afterlife!

342
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,800
Took me from the warm womb...

343
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,040
of subgenius hell!

344
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Ha ha ha!

345
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,480
Oh yeah, there were many of us in subgenius hell!

346
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,660
Yeah, subgenius hell is definitely not suffering a shortage.

347
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,440
As a matter of fact, one of the people I saw in subgenius hell...

348
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,340
was J.R. Bob Dobs himself!

349
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,700
That's right, brothers and sisters, I saw J.R. Bob Dobs himself in subgenius hell!

350
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,360
Right!

351
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,060
And let me tell you something, brothers and sisters...

352
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,060
He was not smiling.

353
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
No, Bob was not smiling!

354
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,880
Oh yeah, we shared the pipe, and he told me the story.

355
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,460
He told me that the church of the subgenius...

356
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,820
was turning into some kind of touchy-feely, pansy-ass support group for losers.

357
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,140
Fuck yeah!

358
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,160
That's right!

359
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,320
Oh yeah!

360
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,520
There were old subgenius preachers, some of the old hierarchy...

361
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:00,580
who complained that the church is filled with evil people!

362
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes, the church is filled with evil people!

363
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,140
Oh, how terrible!

364
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,600
Oh, evil people in the church of the subgenius.

365
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,160
Who would think that evil people would be in the church of the subgenius?

366
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,340
Oh yeah!

367
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,380
And there are some who complained because of my last...

368
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,680
deviable appearance.

369
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,280
I sent beautiful half-naked women out to collect the money in the collection plate.

370
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:32,280
Oh, I expect the conspiracy to use sex to make money, but not the subgenius preacher.

371
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,180
Why not?

372
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,940
Why not?

373
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,780
Yeah, why the hell not?

374
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Hell, we got more of a right to sex than any of those uptight assholes.

375
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,660
Yeah!

376
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,620
And he said, look you, they still need you back there.

377
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,360
The conspiracy has not been destroyed.

378
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
The conspiracy hasn't been destroyed.

379
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,980
The conspiracy is even stronger now that you're dead.

380
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,700
Who else is going to have the balls to go nose to nose with them?

381
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,760
Oh yeah!

382
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,520
So I split subgenius hell.

383
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,840
And I come here tonight.

384
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,600
Oh yeah!

385
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,340
To stop the church of the subgenius.

386
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,340
To put an end to the church of the subgenius.

387
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,840
Not the old church of the subgenius.

388
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,360
The good old boy, good old subgenius.

389
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,620
That's fine with me.

390
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,260
That can stay.

391
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,920
Oh, but the new church?

392
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,200
Oh yeah!

393
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,140
That new touchy feely church?

394
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,480
Oh yeah!

395
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,860
Oh yeah!

396
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,660
But, hey, you know, maybe I'm wrong.

397
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,700
Maybe we should give this new church a chance.

398
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:45,600
I guess, once we give up such things as illicit sex, maybe Bob will be happy then!

399
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,460
Oh!

400
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,340
Maybe if we stop expecting little things to ever happen, maybe we can start to get

401
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:48,340


402
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:48,340


403
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,780
exploiting all the bobbies.

404
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,980
Maybe then the church will be a happy place.

405
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,460
Oh, yeah.

406
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,960
Oh, yeah, I can see all you subgeniuses out here

407
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,120
with the new church of the subgenius.

408
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,520
Oh, yeah, no smoking.

409
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,860
I see some people lighting up back there cigarettes.

410
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,500
Can't be smoking in the new church of the subgenius.

411
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,800
That's bad for you.

412
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,220
Oh, yeah.

413
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,000
Can't have any faggots in the church of the subgenius.

414
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,200
Oh, yeah.

415
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,660
Can't have any of that.

416
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:16,920
That.

417
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,560
No more smoking dope.

418
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,040
No more cussing.

419
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,500
No more blaspheming.

420
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,740
No more Bob.

421
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,100
No more Bob in the church of the subgenius.

422
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,120
Because Jesus just wouldn't approve.

423
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,060
I meant to ask you, if you've got any of that brain on your guitar,

424
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,180
if any of that brain messed up your guitar,

425
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,600
you know, we'll pay for this.

426
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,180
I mean, you're not going to get a cleaning job or whatever.

427
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,780
Oh, that's good, because I ain't going to pay for that mic case.

428
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,460
Uh, constrol.

429
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,440
We're suing the kid that started throwing the brain around.

430
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,120
Hey, who was the jerk that went ahead and put a mic stand up there

431
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,200
when my foot wasn't within 300 feet of it?

432
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,860
That was Reverend Toth Wilder, who had provided that mic stand

433
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,100
with his band, Forms of Insanity.

434
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,980
Oh, he sure, sure.

435
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,740
And allowed you to use it, thinking that, oh, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

436
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,540
he's a professional country western singer.

437
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,720
Surely he knows how to stand in front of a piece of equipment without breaking it.

438
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,660
Well, I swear to God, when I first went up there,

439
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,460
my eyes were so swelled up from crying and stuff.

440
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,740
And I'd been blowing my nose, and I'd been just going through all kinds of hell.

441
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,440
I had to take some sedation and everything.

442
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,760
Well, like you thought, that was pretty funny.

443
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,680
He was sitting behind you the whole time in that ghost outfit.

444
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,440
He's on his heels, ladies and gentlemen, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

445
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:41,980
Woo!

446
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,520
Hi.

447
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,480
Hi.

448
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,080
I'm really distraught about this little thing.

449
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,740
I don't know what you're saying.

450
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,040
I heard it on the internet, and I had a few ideas about it.

451
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,480
But, Jesus Christ, it's on fire.

452
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,700
It's literally on fire.

453
00:28:59,560 --> 00:28:59,960
Ah!

454
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:00,640
Ah!

455
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:02,980
What?

456
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,500
Kid, I broke this here.

457
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,920
Oh, Jesus, I broke this thing.

458
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,440
Hold it for me.

459
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,120
I'm going to sing you a song.

460
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,240
Give him more medication.

461
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
I got one for him.

462
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,320
You did your pills.

463
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,360
Give him pills.

464
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,360
Give him my pills.

465
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:14,980
Give him my pills.

466
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,520
Good, good, good, good, Totten.

467
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,780
Friend of the dead Totten.

468
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,680
Good, good, good, good, Totten Lagoon.

469
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,180
He was here, he was there.

470
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,960
He fell down the stairs.

471
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,020
He died on 95 last June.

472
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,760
Great song.

473
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,100
More medication.

474
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,160
More medication.

475
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,380
More pills.

476
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,120
Give him his pills.

477
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,340
How many of you are ascribed to the notion that Dr. Totten Lagoon is a ghost?

478
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


479
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


480
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


481
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


482
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


483
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


484
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


485
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


486
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


487
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


488
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


489
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


490
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,880
He died on a lonely road on stretch of I-95 as a result of a drunk driver.

491
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,020
Well, you're deluding yourself.

492
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,180
And this is not my place to say it, but you're sadly deluded.

493
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,900
You talk about the conspiracy, you addle brained twitch.

494
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,460
You talk constantly about the conspiracy, it's all around you.

495
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,880
They killed Dr. Totten Lagoon.

496
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,840
You're a crust of mud.

497
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,140
I dreamed, I dreamed, I saw.

498
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,000
Lagoon last night.

499
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,680
And why they slew or me.

500
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:30,620
I dreamed I was among the ones who put him to death.

501
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm breaking the mic, see, there's not a lot I can say.

502
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,640
He thought your songs were funny too.

503
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,020
He thought we were all funny when we mourned him.

504
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,640
It's good to be back in the corporeals.

505
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,120
Today we're back in the corporeals.

506
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,960
All right, brothers, it's good to be back here in the meat shell.

507
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,220
Yeah, more than ever.

508
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,140
I got more meat than most of y'all can handle.

509
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,020
You thought that the conspiracy could kill me?

510
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,700
I'm telling you, he was dirty.

511
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,380
Yeah!

512
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,360
Yeah!

513
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:04,960
Yeah!

514
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,380
Yeah!

515
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:06,380


516
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:07,500
Yeah!

517
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,120


518
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,140


519
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,140


520
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,320
Yeah!

521
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,320
A little of that shit!

522
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,380
Now, I'm gonna recommend a little of your songs.

523
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,600
It's called I Know I Can See You!

524
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:30,600


525
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:30,600


526
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,040
I know U got nothing to say.

527
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,140
This is the song of that day.

528
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,220
This is the point when you fail

529
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,440
before smokin' is where it's at.

530
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,840
Thank you.

531
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,440
Damn, that's a hard-ass lyric.

532
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,640
So cool.

533
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,280
When Satan sees the buddy, he's just...

534
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,940
...

535
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,020
...

536
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,140
...

537
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,480
...

538
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,480


539
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,480


540
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,480


541
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,480


542
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,480


543
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,480


544
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,480


545
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,640
...

546
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,400
...

547
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,400


548
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,160
...

549
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,380
...

550
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,460
...

551
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:22,580
...

552
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:22,600
...

553
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,420
...

554
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:23,500
...

555
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,300
Yeah!

556
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,380
And dying and coming back,

557
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,060
which you're not supposed to do.

558
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,340
Only Jesus is supposed to do that.

559
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,900
Every time somebody else dies and comes back,

560
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,900
it shakes Jesus' power on her.

561
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,840
I know.

562
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,240
No more Bob. No more Bob at all. That's what we need. No more Bob.

563
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,960
You know, I guess the thing to say about Christianity,

564
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,460
I guess it would be wrong to go out and beat up Christians with my bat anymore.

565
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,800
And I know that a lot of y'all out there would be out there with the bats too.

566
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,100
Beating up Christians after 1998, driving them into the sea,

567
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,300
driving them like lemmings over the cliffs.

568
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,820
Oh yeah. Well, there's one thing I can say for you people

569
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,980
who would rather be nice and happy and go soft on the Christians.

570
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,420
That's right. You like Christians so much, if you can't beat them,

571
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,480
you might as well just join them.

572
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,800
Ladies!

573
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,820
Ladies and genitalia!

574
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,740
If I may have your attention, please.

575
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,840
What you're about to see is real.

576
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,640
What you're about to see is real.

577
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,040
What you're about to see is real!

578
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,220
What you're about to see is real!

579
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,140
This is reality, baby!

580
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,760
Up close and personal and in your face!

581
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,400
And you have to deal with it!

582
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,000
And, well, it is real.

583
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,660
And that was...

584
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,080
That was the fine David Apocalypse of Circus Apocalypse.

585
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,380
There, that legume wake.

586
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,500
At the end, preceded by Dr. Legume.

587
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,120
By the way, before I go any further,

588
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,900
the music in the background right now is a song called Yeti

589
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,460
by Only a Mother.

590
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,480
Oh yeah, and what were we listening to on side one of show there?

591
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,540
Friends, I can tell you real quick,

592
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,720
there was Lonesome Cowboy Dave singing his Dr. Katahdin Legume morning song,

593
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,720
his sad song of death.

594
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,020
And also, many excerpts from yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

595
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:52,120
guesting by telephone on the WCSB Cleveland show,

596
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:58,940
ESO Radio, with Dr. Chaz and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

597
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,460
We heard Joe Mama ranting at me,

598
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,080
at the sad legume wake,

599
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,520
with a redo of his fine sermon,

600
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,880
In Doubt of Dobbs.

601
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,600
We even heard Reverend Steve Bevilacqua

602
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,320
from that self-same show,

603
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,100
as well as some KPFA puzzling evidence

604
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,240
and Dr. Howell from the Berkeley subgenius show.

605
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,160
More than an hour, less than a show,

606
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,460
and I'm sorry about the reruns and old shows

607
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,800
of the last few weeks, folks.

608
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,120
But, you know,

609
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,200
your dear prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang,

610
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,800
had to have his yearly nervous breakdown.

611
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,640
Only they seem like they're coming more like twice a year now.

612
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,660
Well, actually every weekend.

613
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,640
But, I really did get a letter from this guy saying,

614
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,560
Reverend Stang, you're working entirely too hard on slack.

615
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,000
And he may be right, but that's the way I get slack.

616
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,620
By working too hard on it!

617
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,440
In fact, I suspect that what Rob's making,

618
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,340
or me, of slack,

619
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,200
are the things that keep me from working myself to death on slack.

620
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,220
Like all those normal things,

621
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,980
like food, and exercise, and sleep,

622
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,900
communicating with humans, sex,

623
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,240
all that boring stuff.

624
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,540
Excuse me, some of that boring stuff just interfered.

625
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,420
Okay, it's a cinch I haven't been working too hard on the app.

626
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,140
But, you know, I'm not a fan of slack.

627
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,140
I'm about to, if I live that long.

628
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,960
But, I've been negligent.

629
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,340
I slacked off regarding this show.

630
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,420
On the last hour of slack that you heard that wasn't a rerun,

631
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,900
the news was that Dr. Legume, the great preacher,

632
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,780
had been called home-ba-bob and killed in a motorcycle accident.

633
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,060
Well, now it's old news that Dr. Legume was resurrected,

634
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,200
yes, bodily, raised up, in the flesh,

635
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,620
back in action at his own wake.

636
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,520
Yes, the Legume Memorial Wake in Cleveland about umpteen weeks ago.

637
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,920
And, uh, we were all moping around,

638
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,400
having that sad devival that I've been playing clips from,

639
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,940
and talking about what a noble bastard he was,

640
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,040
and right when I was standing there saying,

641
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,060
Oh, there is no God!

642
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,000
Hell, there's probably not even a Bob!

643
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,800
If there was a Bob, Dr. Legume would still be alive!

644
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,020
And, of course, right at that moment,

645
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,880
out walked Dr. Legume,

646
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,160
who throughout the whole show had been sitting there

647
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,760
in a ghost costume going,

648
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,580
Ooooooh!

649
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,640
And, uh, he proceeded to deliver a wallpaper-peeling rant

650
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,820
that I've had to play here only in parts,

651
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,860
you know, because it has too much cussin' in it.

652
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,220
You know how all the other, all the subgenius preachers are,

653
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,160
aside from Papa Joe Mama.

654
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,480
But we'll play it on the other Hour of Slack, friends,

655
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,800
the X-rated Hour of Slack,

656
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,260
and about details of which we'll reveal shortly,

657
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,680
maybe next week.

658
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,940
But yes, there is, in a parallel dimension,

659
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,060
there is another Hour of Slack,

660
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,480
just like this one, but better, infinitely ilthier.

661
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,480
Because in that dimension, there is no FCC.

662
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,540
There are almost no Christians, and there is no law.

663
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,480
And that dimension is,

664
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,700
I have to say it again, friends,

665
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,400
it's the Internet.

666
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,860
And, uh, in the last few months,

667
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,880
even more techno breakthroughs occurred,

668
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,700
and one can now, shall we say,

669
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,220
broadcast live sound transmission

670
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,580
from computer to computer.

671
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,220
Internet radio, friends.

672
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,700
And this show is already available to owners of PCs

673
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,960
in one format, and pretty soon it's gonna be available

674
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,520
to owners of all computers.

675
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,860
Macintosh is also in another format,

676
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,180
and we'll hear of that later.

677
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,060
Thank you.

678
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,960
Oh, and one last thing.

679
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,700
That song that I played just a little while ago,

680
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,780
Dirty Filthy,

681
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,680
was, of course, Gwar.

682
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,860
And we'll have stories of the semi-disastrous

683
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,880
Subgenius and Gwar mini-tour next week.

684
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,640
But for now, more about...

685
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,680
Now, more bits and pieces, remnants, shall we call them,

686
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,320
from the, uh, strange death

687
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,900
and even stranger resurrection

688
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,640
of Dr. Katahdin Legume.

689
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,260
Thank you.

690
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,000
Whoa.

691
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,100
He thought your songs were funny, too.

692
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,460
He thought we were all funny when we mourned him.

693
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,560
I'm glad I didn't mourn him much.

694
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,300
I'm glad I talked about what a lousy, nasty person he was.

695
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,420
Yeah, well, big...

696
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,060
I still thought he was dead, too.

697
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,360
I didn't know he was alive.

698
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,060
Well, cripes, you spurred on his very corpse

699
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,180
and that whole audience there.

700
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,660
I mean, that whole, uh, rectangular auditorium,

701
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,160
you just, like, spat on his grave.

702
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,140
You continued to talk about how you were...

703
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,900
In a way, they're right.

704
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It is a very disrespectful thing.

705
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,800
But, you know, at the same time, you have to remember,

706
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,260
this was an event that occurred within the church of the Subgenius.

707
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,480
And the sacred doctrine of erasability, Francis,

708
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,800
our...

709
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:22,740
Ever...

710
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,860
You know, no one can accuse us of bad taste.

711
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,320
We bypassed that whole reality from the word go,

712
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,120
from the very first thing on the first pamphlet.

713
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,920
And if somebody got offended

714
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,340
because they thought that their friend was dead

715
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,860
and then found out he was alive,

716
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,740
well, maybe we should kill that friend.

717
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,400
I think what the series is...

718
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,440
We hope to do that tomorrow night at the GWAR show.

719
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,460
It is not a Subgenius show.

720
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,320
It's a subgenius opening for GWAR, you know.

721
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,360
It's like I'm working for them.

722
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,900
Well, you ain't getting paid very much either.

723
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,960
Oh, I'm getting paid quite a bit.

724
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,300
What they're so upset about is that I'm...

725
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,860
We're on first, so we reap the souls that they were expecting to harvest.

726
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,140
There's not any money in any of it,

727
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,600
but who cares about the money when you have an extractor?

728
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,780
And we've got one and they've got one.

729
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,440
Hey, you know, who needs dough when you're a soul sorter?

730
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,000
You're a sucking monster.

731
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,580
Exactly.

732
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,300
Exactly.

733
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,900
I mean, some people, they thirst after riches.

734
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,460
Their loins are filled with a desire for pleasurement.

735
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,460
And other people just know all they gotta do is just walk on out of, you know,

736
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,960
a human essence and they're a...

737
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,500
What is the only orgasm that is worth even experiencing?

738
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,720
Pleasure, mere fleshly pleasure or riches,

739
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,520
material things of this world are nothing

740
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,420
as compared to power over this world.

741
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,920
They're the souls of men and women, mere humans.

742
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,680
Yet to you, they're just like this big, massive throng of swarming beetles.

743
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,620
What you can do with which is you will,

744
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,580
like you can sweep them away with a broom.

745
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,920
You can just cast them asunder like there was nothing.

746
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,560
This is sweet to be savored.

747
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,360
I don't know if I got some reservations on that.

748
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,540
It's all a thing that God doesn't jip us all in the end.

749
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:13,960
Bob?

750
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,140
Gypsies?

751
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,320
Well...

752
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,260
Liberally.

753
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,940
I'm capable of doing anything deliberately.

754
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,220
I don't see how that makes it.

755
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,600
Bob Gypsies is delivering.

756
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,200
God, if he ever heard me saying...

757
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,180
If he ever heard a recording of me saying this,

758
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,060
he'd kill me.

759
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,140
Well, uh...

760
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,940
Oh, speaking of death, I better go.

761
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,140
Oh, yeah, you thought I was dying, so you better get going.

762
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:37,960
Well...

763
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,980
Well...

764
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,020
Well...

765
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,700
I keep a sharp lookout out of the window and...

766
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,920
I knew him, Horatio.

767
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,540
Did he have a gun?

768
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,740
Full of infinite appetite.

769
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,600
Yum, yum.

770
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,460
Did he have a gun?

771
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,820
You better watch out.

772
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,780
You're gonna be looking like one of them Yerkes pretty soon.

773
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,400
You know what I'm saying?

774
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,980
Are you hostile of Eastern?

775
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,080
Aye, Dr. Legume.

776
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,020
We remember you as you were.

777
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,640
A dirty lion snake in the grass.

778
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,900
Feel the pennies off of your neck.

779
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,980
You're off a dead man's eyes, Dr. Legume.

780
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,300
In fact, I've seen you do it.

781
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,600
Dr. Legume, you were better off dead.

782
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,040
Search more money as a martyr.

783
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,160
Listen to your rants when they didn't think they'd ever have to sit through a whole one again.

784
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,580
Yes, Dr. Legume, we miss you.

785
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,740
Kill you and kill you again.

786
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,700
As the great Gwar song lyrics go off their new album,

787
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,300
Bush, kill, destroy.

788
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,820
Well, friends, what do you make of that?

789
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,680
The river Niven stanged, about to be stuffed in a leather suitcase and hung out by the woods...

790
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,680
...in the wharf by the Hudson River in the...

791
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,040
...the

792
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,400
...the

793
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:19,620
...the

794
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,840
...the

795
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,280
...the

796
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,620
...the

797
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:48,620


798
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,820
...the...

799
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,500
...the...

800
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,160
...the...

801
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,160


802
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,160


803
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,160


804
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,160
It's all coming down.

805
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,860
Doug, are we still on here?

806
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,680
We still there.

807
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,520
On the lighter side.

808
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,740
You could give us a call at 687-6900.

809
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,160
Give us a call.

810
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,940
Tell us your deepest wishes.

811
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:26,700
We have stuff, all kinds of fun stuff for you to play with, to have, to hold, to make and to hold.

812
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,920
To what you want.

813
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,860
687-6900.

814
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,780
I must hear from you.

815
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:42,320
I require a phone call from someone just like you.

816
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,660
Are you going bye-bye?

817
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,780
I must go back.

818
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,780
Reverend Stang has now decided to leave the planet.

819
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,680
Seed, papers from whence I came.

820
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:53,980
Papers?

821
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,480
I must cross back.

822
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,060
27 ways he can leave the planet.

823
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,360
I cannot stay in this world for long.

824
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,780
So he is choosing number 22.

825
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,600
What's one need to understand?

826
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,520
I am a short giver.

827
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,020
They're calling me.

828
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,280
Number 22 is spontaneous combustion.

829
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,620
I don't deserve to die.

830
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,980
Spontaneous combustion is a rather painless way to go.

831
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,200
Don't go, Reverend.

832
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,040
Switch on rewind.

833
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:27,460
All you have to do is believe and then blow up into one massive ball of flame.

834
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,220
All things must come to an end.

835
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,100
People everywhere.

836
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,160
You tie your shoelaces.

837
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,700
You talk about the day.

838
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,260
But will the undertaker.

839
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,540
That he disappeared.

840
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,180
Tonight.

841
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,800
From the planet.

842
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,180
Blam and Gilead.

843
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,840
We'll know there's no bomb in Gilead.

844
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:54,220
Children will get a day off from school to celebrate the great one's departure.

845
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,380
For Christ's sake, is there any beer in Cleveland?

846
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,280
I need a drink.

847
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,120
People from generations.

848
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,000
Puppet strings pulling you through the streets.

849
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,780
Civilizations.

850
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,080
Puppet show.

851
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,440
That are not yet invented.

852
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,380
They call the life of.

853
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,180
Clinically.

854
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:08,660
Lone.

855
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,320
Or cybergenically.

856
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,560
Cowboy Gag.

857
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,980
You feel all jiggly like there's something she's been doing.

858
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,700
And soon your candle will wink out.

859
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,760
Will eventually.

860
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,780
Another insignificant candle snuffed in the great.

861
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,320
Cylind.

862
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,380
Of insignificant short lived little Gag day.

863
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:29,900


864
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:30,780
The fire.

865
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,720
But I'll come back.

866
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:31,820
In late spring.

867
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:32,840
Reaching.

868
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,060
And no afterlife.

869
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,160
No dreams.

870
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,540
No nothing.

871
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,640
Do not go to the harem.

872
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,960
There's no damn before life.

873
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,920
There's no life to begin with.

874
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,640
Do not go.

875
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,000
Lest.

876
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,380
You were a sub-genius.

877
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,620
Ordained.

878
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,360
Yes.

879
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,040
Yes.

880
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:50,400
Yes.

881
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,980
With that small love offering.

882
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,400
Where.

883
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,580
Would you buy your way.

884
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,080
Off.

885
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,360
Of.

886
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:55,900
That wheel.

887
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,600
Of useless.

888
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:56,820
Your.

889
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,740
Tickets.

890
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:09,180
Move on up through the heavens, the hells, and the Asgards and Valhalla's, all the way to the very tip-tops of the pyramid at the end of reality.

891
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,860
Be God and be told, finally, the punchline.

892
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,780
Get out of my house.

893
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,160
Not bad for 30 bucks.

894
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:27,400
You can get all that for 30 bucks and you can get a mug for 25 dollars.

895
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,720
Or triple your money back.

896
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,700
Friends, call 687-6900.

897
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,060
It's your salvation.

898
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,940
You can get a compact beach.

899
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,060
You must be saved, even if it kills you.

900
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,860
Do not despair.

901
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,260
Be saved, my mom.

902
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,380
There will be a special holiday in memory of this day.

903
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,860
But, over here in Texas, the sun is coming up and I must climb back into my box.

904
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,180
Bye.

905
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,660
Close the lid and have the boys nail it down.

906
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,440
Bye-bye.

907
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,100
Thanks so much for calling us here tonight at the ESO radio camp.

908
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,080
Bye-bye.

909
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:12,620
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't get down there, but we had to unload one truck and load the other truck.

910
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,100
Camp meeting just won't be the same without you.

911
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,500
Those boxes of dirt from my homeland are precious, but they're very heavy.

912
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,340
It did bring the voodoo stick, though.

913
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,380
A message.

914
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,380
Hide.

915
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,060
I can't even lift that voodoo stick anymore.

916
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:27,480
Shh.

917
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,140
It reminds me of the man you used to be.

918
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,960
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

919
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,320
Kill, he's in shape.

920
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,200
You're wrong and all that.

921
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:41,260
I am of the new flesh now, Dave.

922
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,740
You're a rubber monster now.

923
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:48,080
I have become as into a rubber monster suited god.

924
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:55,240
I've drank the souls of the rock and roll fans.

925
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:55,840
Yes.

926
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
That's breaking on.

927
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:57,340
Yes.

928
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:57,380


929
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,360
It's a sweet nectar to be savored.

930
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,820
That's breaking on down.

931
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,300
Yeah.

932
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,480
And you can get like five or six bucks with those little tiny bottles.

933
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,160
Oh, death.

934
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,880
Oh, death, drop me asleep.

935
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,640
Bring me to quiet rest.

936
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:42,900
Let pass my weary, guiltless ghost.

937
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:50,620
Out of my careful rest.

938
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,320
Oh, death.

939
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,600
My pain.

940
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,060
My pain.

941
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:00,380
My pain.

942
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,460
Who can express?

943
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,900
How last they are so strong?

944
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:18,160
My dollar will not suffer strain.

945
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:25,760
My life or to hold on.

946
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,580
That stuff will look great in the promos.

947
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,820
Where do you want me to do the eulogy for Dr. Legume, sir?

948
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,880
We'd like you to stand right there to deliver the eulogy.

949
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:47,720
Oh, okay.

950
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,760
What? What? What? What?

951
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,340
Oh, no. Why don't you stand over there?

952
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,980
Oh, what a funny funeral we're having.

953
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,100
On with the eulogy.

954
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,320
Walter is gone, but he wouldn't want us to cry.

955
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,800
No, he'd want us to laugh.

956
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,360
He'd want us to laugh all the laughs he never got during his career.

957
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,000
He, he, he.

958
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,320
Ah, Walter.

959
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,020
What a relief.

960
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,960
Yes, to get rid of Dr. Legume.

961
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,060
Well, he's not gone for good.

962
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,100
But get your pencils ready, friends.

963
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,040
We need to give you some addresses.

964
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,000
These are important.

965
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,680
Number one, I did dig up the address of Only a Mother.

966
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:42,620
By the way, that piece of music that we cut into the middle of just a while ago

967
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,080
was a song called Death by Only a Mother.

968
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,800
And here's their address for those of you with tape decks running.

969
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,520
It's P.O. Box 531.

970
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:57,240
That's P.O. Box 531 in Wyandotte, Michigan.

971
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:04,380
And Wyandotte is actually spelled W-Y-A-N-D-O-T-T-E.

972
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,020
Meh.

973
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,080
4-8-1-9-2.

974
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,280
You can ask them for information on them, Only a Mother.

975
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,860
And, friends, what you're listening to right now

976
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,760
is, of course, the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

977
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,760
And if you need more information on the word of Bob,

978
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,340
or the tapes of this show and such like,

979
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,940
just feel free to drop a self-addressed stamped envelope to

980
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,560
Bob

981
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:38,500
at Post Office Box 140306.

982
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,160
That's 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

983
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,140
Home of all great crackpot religions, right?

984
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:50,760
And that zip is 75214.

985
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,640
Uh, yeah.

986
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,840
Hold on just a second.

987
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,500
Ah, there it is.

988
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,020
See, now, for me, that was several minutes.

989
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,700
But for you, by the miracle of time control, it was instantaneous.

990
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,240
I now have the address of ESO Radio.

991
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,360
If you're interested in tapes of Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz,

992
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,040
and you should be,

993
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:17,040
and that's ESO at P.O. Box 14776.

994
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,260
14776 in Cleveland, Ohio.

995
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:25,880
44114.

996
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,260
And, uh, that is the, that is the end.

997
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,420
That's all I have to say.

998
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,580
And there's nothing more to be said about Dr. Legume.

999
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,900
We won't go on and on about it.

1000
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,460
Thank you.

1001
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,880
When I heard of his demise, it was such a relief, really.

1002
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,280
Finally, that's over.

1003
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,740
Shut up! Shut up!

1004
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,460
Ha, ha, ha.

1005
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,680
Ah, how I hated Dave.

1006
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,380
Endangered species.

1007
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,740
But, uh, speaking of endangered species,

1008
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,280
some of you out there might be under the mistaken impression

1009
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,580
that the late, great Dr. Legume was resurrected last week

1010
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,400
at the Cleveland Divival.

1011
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,340
Yes, that's right.

1012
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,100
A rumor had reached me some time ago

1013
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,380
that Reverend Stang and the rest

1014
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,260
would attempt a revival at the Divival.

1015
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,240
And for a while there, I was wondering,

1016
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,740
is Dr. Legume really dead?

1017
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,660
After all, can Reverend Stang actually raise the dead?

1018
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,700
I mean, I thought some things about this church

1019
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,600
were no more than sick inside jokes.

1020
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,420
But if doctors for Bob can raise not only hell,

1021
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,520
but the dead as well,

1022
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,880
then maybe my faith in old Bob ain't what it should be.

1023
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,240
I decided to investigate, and here's what I discovered.

1024
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,580
It saddens me to a degree beyond description

1025
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,800
to have to report to you, my brethren,

1026
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,160
that our own Reverend Stang,

1027
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,280
yes, Stang himself,

1028
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,980
has resorted to the lowest forms of trickery and ledger domain.

1029
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,580
For he has used the church and the dead Dr. Legume

1030
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:11,040
for no higher purpose than the almighty conspiracy dollar.

1031
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,240
But what the hell?

1032
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,300
If I could make money off Legume's swollen,

1033
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,940
discolored, festering carcass, I'd do it.

1034
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,780
After all, he isn't worth it.

1035
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:21,780


1036
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,680
He's worth anything to me alive.

1037
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,460
I have it on the very, very highest authority, my brethren.

1038
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:33,520
The highest authority that the man who appeared as Dr. Legume in Cleveland

1039
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,620
was an imposter.

1040
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,820
Yes, a deception was perpetrated upon that divival crowd

1041
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,800
in DNA Level C,

1042
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,820
and the man Reverend Stang claimed to raise from the dead

1043
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:50,620
in order to sell a few more tickets to his raggedy-ass divival

1044
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,760
was an actor.

1045
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,440
He was an actor doing a very poor impersonation

1046
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,020
of that unimpersonatable subgenius extraordinaire,

1047
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,140
Dr. Katalin Legume.

1048
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,300
Shame, shame upon you, Reverend Stang.

1049
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,700
What do you take we subgeniuses for?

1050
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,080
A pack of normals or something?

1051
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:13,940
I delivered his eulogy on the air, and that settles it.

1052
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:19,120
And besides, my secret but very high authority

1053
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,760
assures me that Dr. Legume is not a subgenius.

1054
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:21,760


1055
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:24,340
He is still as dead as he ever has been.

1056
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,200
What are you going to believe?

1057
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:31,360
That Stang actually bothered to resurrect Legume's highway hamburger buns?

1058
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,320
Or that Legume was never dead,

1059
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,800
and that your old pal Reverend Void got hoaxed and faked out

1060
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,780
by a premature announcement of his demise in the first place?

1061
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,660
Or are you going to believe me now

1062
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,580
when I tell you that the man raised in Cleveland

1063
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,420
was not Dr. Legume,

1064
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,760
and his status since I announced his...

1065
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,520
death has not changed?

1066
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,920
But enough of this ghost baiting and skeleton rattling.

1067
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,260
It's Halloween, that's most unholy of Bob's unholidays,

1068
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,480
and the Funhouse crew here has been busy all week long

1069
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,660
sacrificing normals and other large insects

1070
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:12,020
on the altar of high weirdness

1071
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:16,580
in hopes that Bob might clog their third nostrils

1072
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,140
with his literally ungodly psychic stench

1073
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,760
and inspire them to...

1074
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,200
new depths of depravity and self-abasement.

1075
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,160
And they have succeeded, my brethren.

1076
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:33,580
Yes, Bob, that smiling oaf whose meatloafs

1077
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:36,520
on the brainpans of all true-saved yeti

1078
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,360
has gone and done it again.

1079
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,020
At least I hope he's gone and done it again to their brains,

1080
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,960
because he hasn't done a damn thing for me lately,

1081
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,340
and I don't have any material for this show.

1082
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,740
That's right, I'm lost in Clueless,

1083
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,500
and winging it on a prayer tonight.

1084
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,960
But it's a prayer to Bob,

1085
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,880
and hopefully he will give me the luck I need

1086
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,880
to think up something clever to say about Halloween.

1087
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:04,040
Uh...

1088
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,240
Meantime, I'll just let the Funhouse gang

1089
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,720
kind of take over this show

1090
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,680
and carry me like the cold, dead bag of bologna that I am.

1091
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,860
Just remember, even when we're stupid and you're bored,

1092
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,720
this is Bob's Slack.

1093
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,200
I'm Funhouse, and we're here for Funtime.

1094
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,600
They're down with Dracula in the lab.

1095
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,660
Gonna have some fun time.

1096
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,380
Might get killed.

1097
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,500
Hey, baby, we like your lips.

1098
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:57,240
Hey, baby, we like your pants.

1099
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Funtime.
