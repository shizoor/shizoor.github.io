Oh, yes, dear friends, this hour of Slack, alleged number 1655, is by necessity and choice a rerun of number 411 from September 1993, which was requested by a longtime listener.
And when I checked it out, I could hear why.
It's really unusual and features some excellent rants by a then high schooler named Reverend Gobi.
Who had a subgenius show at her high school radio station somewhere up north.
We recently saw Reverend Gobi at Starwood Festival, and I wish I'd remembered how great her rants were, because I would have reminded her, too.
Hello, and welcome to the hour of Slack.
This is 89.7 WITN.
What?
And my name is Gobi.
Yeah, it is Gobi.
And I will be with you forever.
For the next hour and a half, hour and 45 minutes or so, bringing you Slack, as always.
Why?
Because we love you.
Yeah, speak for yourself, Gobi.
Because we're in the mood.
For Slack.
For fun.
For good times.
For good music.
For friends.
And drinks.
For cocktails.
And parties.
For cheese dip.
Cheese whiz.
Little pretzel things.
Yes, folks.
We're in the mood for J.R. Bob Dog.
We're in the mood for Wanda.
We're in the mood for Heifer, Savinoon, and Narnini.
Niggie.
We're in the mood for Niggie.
Niggie.
Niggie.
Niggie.
Niggie.
Niggie.

We're in the mood for the
We're in the mood for the
And we're not hearing it.
We're in the mood for technical difficulties.
For albums.
For cassette players.
We're in the mood for puzzling evidence.
We're in the mood for the end of the song.
Here it comes.
Here it comes.
Oh yeah.
It's coming.
It's almost there.
We've almost made it, friends.
Together.
As one.
We've almost made it to the end of the song.
Woo!
Not yet.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
We're out of our way.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
We're going to the end of the song.






We're going.
We're going.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay.
Okay.
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the end of the song.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.
Our subgenius.


Oh, slack.
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.
If you're watching this video, I...

Welcome trapped 16 years ago.
The film was rabid, and made by journalists.
In the 1960s, the government saved sizes of $10,000.
A�� Jones wrote about the


we were coming home from the gas industry, getting ideas on how stuff.

the will of every bullet to the body.
Reason enough to take away care.
And reason enough to remember again.
I'd like to always know
what's like to have a constant
pride. That's the time to relax
and to breathe.
This is the wild side of life,
ain't it, Wilgus?
Wilgus just grinned and opened
in another beer.
And are you married, divorced,
separated, single, uninterested, or dead?
Yes. And do you or anyone in your household
work in publishing, television, radio, or
have a conviction of violent crimes with a gun?
With a gun? Yes. No. Good.
Now, we're conducting research into the impact of
visual versus oral stimuli.
What you see as opposed to what you hear.
For the next three minutes, we're going to either show you
a slide or let you hear a sound.
You tell us which of the two stimuli has a greater
impact on you. And you're going to give me a watch for this?
When it's all over, yes. A cheap one.
Okay, shoot.
Here's your first image.
Okay, a second's all you get. Here's your sound.
I would...
have to say the sound.
Fine. Indicate your choice by pressing either one
of the two blue buttons in front of you.
What about this big red button? Don't touch that.
Now, indicate your choice.
Fine. Sound over image for the first example.
Alright, here's another slide.
Wow! Put that back on!
Sorry, a peek is all you get. Who is she?
Come on, we have to continue. Now, here's your sound.
I, uh, can't decide.
Maybe you'd better let me see the picture again.
No, your choice is obviously
image over sound.
Ow! That was your next sound.
You hurt me!
And here's another slide.
Look at this! I'm bleeding!
Ah, sound wins again. Please press the appropriate button.
And we're ready to move on to part two of the survey.
An image or sound will be presented, then several reactions will appear on the screen with a number above each one.
Press the yellow button that corresponds to your reaction.
What about this big red button?
Don't touch that.
Now, first we have a sound.
Sponsors are on the screen. Indicate yours now.
Indecisive, aren't you?
Sorry. Is that alright?
It's fine.
Fine. Thank you very much.
And how about that one?
That one makes me want to leave. Can I push the big red button now?
I said don't touch that.
We have achieved liftoff. The show is lifting off. Fasten your seat belts, please.
There will be a toll.
Please slow down. The toll booth is approaching.
Pick up your ticket. Cars only. Nothing in tow.
Please press the button on your right. Insert coin. Deposit 25 cents.
We have achieved orbit. We're now orbiting this country.
Doo doo doo doo doo.
Yes, orbiting the United States. In a small, slow circle.
And that's right.
We are taking requests. If you'd like to hear something on the space episode of the subgenius, just ask.
Oh, what's that? You want to hear, there's no beer in heaven?
Well, I think we can find that.
Rock music. It is the number one tool being used in this world.




Rock music sets itself above God.
Now listen, we are programmable. The devil knows how to program you.
The devil has programmed two generations of young people for absolute total destruction through his music.
Now, the devil wouldn't be the devil if he didn't have music.
Stop it. Stop.
You know what they said in Syracuse, New York, when they were going to have a concert up there recently?
The police chief said, it's not the violence I worry about. It's the people.

As much as the nudity.
Dancing. Dancing.
Nudity. Violence.
Dancing. Dancing.
Nudity. Violence.
Young people are killing themselves at a rapid rate.
I believe much of it as a result of rock music.
Our homes have been torn down.
The walls of purity have been torn down.
The walls of purity have been torn down.
The walls of purity have been torn down.
Morality in general has been put in the sewer because of rock music.
These gods.
That's supposed to get you all nervous and jerky.
Because it can make us feel relaxed.
It can make us feel scared.
Isn't it interesting?
You'll notice they don't play the Tennessee Waltz in a Halloween flick.
Now, would you agree with me that there's patriotic music? Yes.
Would you agree with me that there's funeral music? Yes.
Would you agree with me that there's scary type music? Yes.
Would you agree with me that there's relaxing type music? Yes.
Matter of fact, there is also boogie type music.
Boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity.
And now, here's Johnny.
Ask not what your country can do for you.
Here, our friends will be drinking all of their holy.
In him, Mel Gibson will.
We'll drink and we'll receive.
And since we're nicked in here.
Don't think we can be under an unconfirmed.
What did he say?
In heaven, there is no beer.
No beer?
That's why we drink it here.
I won't go.
And when we're gone from here.
Our friends will be drinking all of their holy.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
We can't be out of here.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Un- Acceptable.
In heaven there is no beer.
No beer?
That's why we drink it here.
And when we're gone from here.
Our friends will be drinking all of their holier.
I-I-I-I-E, we'll drink all of resulting fear.
Hooray!
A product will be introduced whose only function is to be recycled.
As a backlash against animal rights fanatics,
cruelty plus products will be introduced.
We have one of your old favorites from the 70s,
from the rocking years, the golden years of rock and roll,
the golden years of disco, the golden years of ugly clothing,
and bad music.
I'm sure you'll remember this one.
This goes out to Bleepo Abernathy.
I'm a can.
I've come to see you smile.
I know you understand.
The greenhouse effect,
will be used to prove that the earth is a zoo.
The last drive-in theater will close.
Low definition television will be taken over by subgenius sympathizers,
as high tech TV hypnotizes normals.
Conspiracy scientists will reveal that cancer and cigarettes have a single cause.
Learning disorders will be discovered to be teaching disorders.
And counseling centers will be opened for would-be conspiracy teachers.
Shopping malls will become large enough that they begin to connect,
forming walled cities of consumption.
The world's largest consumer of drugs.
The world's largest consumer of drugs.


Because they're bad for the environment.
Yes.
They must change their ways.
So, let's volunteer to rip off their clothing until their hair is pure and clean.
Come on now.
Come on back on The Comeback.
We're asking you to speak your piece about perhaps the Lithuanian problem.
Denying peyote to the Native American church.
And Earth Day, the commercialization of Earth Day.
One of the greatest holidays for money.
making and money saving in American history.
So shop now on those beautiful
Evolution Echo
Perfect Lawn Chairs.
We got them real cheap, $49.95.
Ecologically perfect
lawn chairs.
Only a little bit of Zirconium 90 in them.
Now that's a
fan for the family.
I am, I, I, I,
I'm here.
Let's, let's hear this guy.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, West Coast
Cone from the West Coast.
I expected you to give
a full report.
Are you still
keeping it?
Hell, it's a good idea.
I was thinking, I want to see if, I want to see if I can count you guys
in on this. What I'm going to do is buy up a bunch
of surplus magic fingers from those
vibrating hotel sofa things.
And sew them into sneakers,
loafers, and baggy trousers.
And sell them as like kind of a West Coast experience kind of thing to the malls in the Midwest.
As a full market device?
As a full market device, I think we could clean up.
Oh my God.
You are on.
He wants to sell those little like chocolate dog fingers.
Is that correct?
Well, not, not the Vienna sausage ones.
No, those little magic Vienna sausages.
Magic Vienna sausages.
The ones that you kind of, that you find in the hotel sofas and things like that.
Hey, Wes.
The little vibrating ones.
Can I ask you a question?
Oh, vibrating Wiener sausages.
Viennas.
Vibrating Wieners.
Sew them into the loafers and sneakers.
And then, yeah, and then they suck up.
So like when you're walking around in the rubble, you can feel a vibrating Vienna sausage in
your like, your Rockford so to speak.
There you go.
Oh my God.
This guy's a, he's a genius, Taz.
I think it would be less traumatizing then, you know, the way they're, the way they're
setting it up now because I understand why they're doing it.
Red Cross everywhere, I suppose.
Is it like before or is it more like now?
It's a, it's a, it's a lot closer to now.
Ah.
It's a lot closer.
Can I interject here?
Hey, Taz wants to interject something.
Wes.
Yes, sir.
Are you having Earth Day out there on the West Coast too?
On Earth?
Yes, we are.
Taz is such a brilliant man.
He still didn't know California was in the United Snakes.
It's still part of it.
As a matter of fact, this is the state that leads to these idiotic trams.
It's not quite sure how long we will be.
It's going to be like Atlantis.
Yes, yes.
Or Atlanta.
Or Atlanta would be a lot better.
It'd be steamy and there would be like tennis courts on your forehead and people walking
around.
Or like, you know, New Elbia and Pennsylvania maybe.
That's what I go for is them Rockport Vienna sausages.
But have you ever tried low sodium iguana?
Now you have to put an awful lot of water and steep it in water for like maybe three
or four hours before you bring it to a rapid boil with a handful of chickpeas.
Now once you've got your iguana meat all bubbling and frothy, it'll exude kind of a brown foam.
That's just the bad juices coming out.
And you scrape those off top, put in a little bit of butter and drop that handful of chickpeas
in there.
Now did you already drop the handful of chickpeas into the bubbling iguana?
Let's repeat those steps.
The Kentucky Headhunters at the Cleveland Agora Sunday, May 13th.
The Kentucky Headhunters.
Oh, you're talking to Lonesome Cowboy.
You interrupted their show.
I met the island man and he said, uh, uh, uh.

Oo-ee.
Oo-ah, uh.

Academic My name is Mark McMillan, I've been in this business for 18 years, and it's
a small town town, but I got an idea.
It can beetto, it can beetto.
I've been to California and I never had a والa would-be суáto.
That's now anạtlough, then yo'll get a folding rooibos like me, that is a would-be.
By the way we use that something that goes into the needle that I made into a boat, I

Hello, you're talking to Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
I have a great marketing strategy for...
For Earth Day?
Serving burgers without a powerful container.
Without a plastic container?
Okay, lay it on us. What is this idea?
You just serve the burgers on your body parts there.
Oh, now, see, this is a form of imagination.
A very small part or a very small and limited example of imagination.
As a matter of fact, it's kind of an example of an examination,
but it is an example of an imagination.
In that the burger is just piping fresh and frizzy.
And piping fresh and frizzy.
Because they've grown up, learned what life is.
They know what to do with themselves in society.
They can now go out in the world and sit in a classroom
and not spit and fling their boogers on the people next to them or anything.
And not be...
They can go downtown and people won't throw them in jail.
Listen, you guys are making some great strides here.
First it just starts by being able to not swear on the air.
And then the next thing you know, you'll be eating regular food.
You'll eat the same food that people eat and stuff.
And quibbling and fawning and obsequious and fawning and tidwiddling and...
Tidwiddling?
Tidwiddling?
Tidwiddling.
That's not an actual word.
Isn't that?
Yeah, I think that is tidwiddling.
I tried it and believe me, it's not a real one.
Well, what other words do you got?
Romboid?
Romboid?
Romboid is a secret password for the prophylactic.
It is?
Yeah.
Well, that's rather fitting for this problem.
How about this one?
You think I've got a big vocabulary.
Get a load of this one.
Yeah?
What do you think of it?
Lay it on me, big guy.
Isn't that disgusting?
Come on, come on, admit it.
Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen in your life?
Come on, I'm not going to ask you to describe it.
Hello, you're talking to one of these guys over there.
Doesn't that fill you with revulsion?
Are you going to swear?
No, you wouldn't want to swear on the air, would you?
Well, as you may be able to tell, dear friends, this is one of those hour of slack shows.
It's just a battle of the shows.
It's so many different subgenius and subgenius sympathizer.
Oh, there.
All over the place, they're scrambling the airwaves.
But yet, but yet.
Hello?
I mean, a booth.
I mean, a beep.
Hello?
Other show?
Can you hear me?
Come in, please.
Yes, we're here.
Yeah, plug into other show.
We're here with very few sound effects.
Find a multimeter.
What is your trajectory?
Over.
It's 4 and 4.
Oh, my gosh.
See if you can angle in a little bit behind our ship.
Punch in 4 and 4 and drive this show right up.
Yeah, I'm about to start.
4.
Radio traverse.
There we go.
We are attempting your maneuver here.
Hey, wait.
They're coming towards us.
That's right.
Get that guy out of here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's time for penetration of the subspace around your craft.
We're attempting to rotate shows.
Wait, get the front deals up.
The front deals up.
If you can meet our meeting phase,
you too can join the Bridgman family.
We have achieved penetration.
I think we have transmission.
I think we have show.
Yeah, there's just minor damage to the sub hull.
Minor difficulties.
We can patch that up en route.
Okay, that's great.
My genitals feel all fluffy.
We're happy to be speaking with you tonight.
How are you, Dr. Howell and Berkeley Show?
I'm glad you're speaking to me,
but how about canning the personal comments?
You know, we're being audited by the Federal Bureau of Demonology,
and they sometimes object to the...
Those kinds of lower trajectories are only usable inside and outside.
Well, speaking of...
Speaking of lower trajectories,
speaking of the gravitational pull...
Yes, but what does all this have to do with Frank Bent?
Oh, not much.
You know, we try not to let these evil perverts
who kill student nurses and so on
call us up on the show because it only encourages them.
That's right.
And there was Bob Spent, the murderer who killed all...
And what do you mean he likes me there?
Listen, you make lots of money off of it afterwards
when you sign that big record contract.
Well, you know, tomorrow's heroes are today's serial killers.
Children will buy action figures of them in department stores,
and tomorrow's serial killers...
We'll laugh at their antics on...
You know, it's...
Hard murderers, he says here, but that doesn't make any sense.
If we all talk at once, it sounds like we're having a party.
I think I'll pass out hors d'oeuvres and martinis.
Wouldn't anybody like a froth stick?
Yes, I would very much like a hot buttered rum martini.
Yum, yum.
For public service.
And three froth sticks.
Hot buttered rum martini coming up.
Could I have another froth stick while we're at it?
Pass one this way.
I'd like another grub for that puff, Moe.
Now, come on, gentlemen.
Ew.
Okay.
As I said, the...
Firing one.
Solons in Washington...
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Look at the slag tights in this place.
Look at this.
It's a secret ice cave.
We have our proton shirts up.
Yeah, there's...
Besides, we're friends.
I mean...
You want to load up that proton?
The show assumes the position of familiarity.
Yep.
We will now have to...
...fire the...
...proton pill.
They can't escape the...
I think we better...
...put them on the...
Nothing to be alarmed of.
We're just experiencing minor technical difficulties with the space...
...ship.
Please remain calm.
Remain seated.
If you need help...
...waitress...
...someone will come and...
...hit you very hard.
Don't worry.
Everything's under...
...under control.
I think she's right.
Gobi?
Is that your hum?
Or is that my buzz?
That you love me?
Oh, okay.
That's right.
You got it.
Ooh.
Ooh.
And, uh...
In other news...
There will be a completely unjustifiable but brief war between the United States and the Middle East.
The anti-war resistance will be firmly orchestrated by the conspiracy.
Communism will collapse, even in Korea, when the Red Leaders finally understand Bob's deal.
And do you know what Bob's deal is, friends?
Well, good luck trying to figure it out from this particular show.
I just...
I don't know what it is myself.
It's...
But it's a beautiful thing.
Whatever it is, I don't know that we'll ever figure it out.
Not as well as the Baptists have figured it out.
According to...
According to this newspaper report here...
From the Dallas Morning News...
News...
Paper...
Uh...
Southern Baptist estimate of those headed to hell sparks fire...
Brimstone...
In Alabama.
Yes, Birmingham, Alabama.
God only knows how to get to heaven.
But the Southern Baptists estimate that 46.1% of people in Alabama risk going to hell.
Since the figure from church...
Research on potentially doomed souls was made public.
It is Baptists who are feeling the fire, however.
The Southern Baptist Convention's county-by-county breakdown of who's bound for heaven and who isn't...
Unless they're born again and accept Jesus Christ as their savior...
Hit the Birmingham News on September 5th.
It's been the buzz in some Alabama pews...
And some radio stations ever since.
Under the headline, Baptists Count the Lost...
The front page story included...
A detailed map and box listing the 1.8 million unsaved by county in precise percentages.
The Baptists said the numbers were only a guide on where to establish new churches and find more followers...
But some of the faithful...
Baptists as well as others are incensed.
The Southern Baptists have done such demographic research for years...
Said Martin King, a spokesman for the denomination...
Of the Atlanta-based Home Mission Board...
Which compiled the study and has national figures he would not disclose.
Mr. King added that the Baptists don't claim to be passing judgment.
We don't know who's lost and who's saved, he said.
All we know is that as we understand the doctrine of salvation...
A lot of people are lost.
Of course, they don't like hearing that they're not going to heaven.
The study...
The study took each county's population and subtracted from it membership of all churches.
After that, Baptist researchers used a secret formula to...
A secret formula, friends...
To estimate how many people from different denominations and faiths...
Were probably going to heaven.
Mr. King said estimates of the unsaved from other creeds...
Were based on how closely those groups' beliefs matched Southern Baptist doctrine.
The index, of course, applied the traditional Baptist view...
That Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and members of other non-Christian religions are not saved.
The paper said virtually everyone not belonging to a church congregation was counted among the lost.
The Reverend Thomas Raynor, pastor of the Green Valley Baptist Church in Hoover...
And the Mission Board's Alabama representative said he was amazed by the fun.
But it has a good motive behind it.
And that is not one of judging...
But of reaching.
Well, that's a great way to do it, Rev.
But, you know, I've got some sad news for those Baptists.
I'm afraid 46.1% is rather an optimistic number for who's going to be lost on Judgment Day.
I'm afraid that it's going to be a bit closer to the 99.999 mark...
Which is most...
Well, it's all humans.
And unfortunately, 90% of the subgeniuses...
Those who did not...
Indeed...
Uh...
Join the Church of the Subgenius properly.
With full dues.
Which we cannot tell you exactly on the air.
But we can tell you how to write for free information on how to be saved in Bob.
It should have to be saved not in Reverend Raynor or Dr. King, but in J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And that it would be...
Got that pencil ready?
Because, you know, if you send us a self-addressed stamped envelope...
And the accent is on stamp.
And the stamp is stamped, friends...
Why, be surprised what you can get.
And I'm going to give you that lovely number right now.
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.
Now you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour on Slack.
And we've been tonight because...
Well, I've been working on that book.
I finished the last chapters last week.
I did.
Of course, now I've got to start on the middle chapters.
We're working on...
We're working on Connie this week.
Heh heh heh heh.
Uh...
But, um...
And in such times as that, we like to throw together show attacks from barely screened tapes from other subgeniuses.
Yes, and those have included tonight...
Uh...
Oh...
Who has it...
Who has it included tonight?

Um...
Well, we're playing lots and lots from the good Reverend Gobi's show up in Rochester, New York.
This is from a tape compiled by Bleepo Abernathy.
And it's been...
You know, we would have been running Gobi a long time ago, but we lost the first tape and we never got the other tapes.
But we...
Anyway, we got this one.
Also, early in the show, a little bit of Hub City spoke repair.
Uh...
We're playing a semi-newly discovered radio comedy group.
Um...
I don't know how to describe what it was that they were doing, but you did hear it.
Uh...
And the song about rock music, I believe, was Steve Stein.
A lot of our tapes aren't even labeled, friends.
You know, they get used once and the sweat rubs the labels off.
Um...
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave show percolating along in there with the...
With their evil callers.
And, as always, KPFA, uh...
Uh, show.
Show.
Uh, the...
Less than an...
Show.
More than an hour show with Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence in that case, I believe.
And, uh...
I, uh...
Uh...
Actually, I need to flip a tape over coming up here pretty soon.
And then we'll hear the most amazing rant by Little Gobi.
It, it...
Really, I was...
I was floored when I heard this, uh...
Seamless, uncut, and probably completely unscripted spew, um...
From the, the little but very powerful Gobi.
Thank you all.
Stand by, please.
In Dallas, Texas...
It appears as though something has happened.
Repent.
Else I will come against thee with my clenched fist.
And it is the fist which beareth many eyes and breatheth many breaths.
And this goes on...
For...
One, two, three, four...
For five more pages.
That was section one through...
Thirty-five.
And it goes up to...
One, twenty-six.
That was not...
I did not write that.
Those are not my words.
I, in no way, feel that way.
I, I certainly would never say that I myself am Jehovah One.
I'm not.
Okay?
And, like, I don't agree with anything.
Well, like, some things.
Like, you know, like the pink worms are the kind of base creatures, you know.
Um...
But, like, you know, like, I don't go along with, like, this whole, like, power trip that Jehovah One's on.
You know, he's, like, kinda totally, like, Mr. Swellhead.
I'm like, so cool!
You know, if you find out where the center of the universe is, hey, man, if you even ask where it is, I'll smash you.
I'll smash your ass.
You know, he's such a big dick.
He thinks he's so cool just because he, like, rules the universe or something.
You know, I bet he doesn't even rule the universe.
What do you want to bet he only rules the galaxy?
Yeah.
Yeah, Mr. Cool, Mr. Jehovah One only rules one galaxy.
God, out of, like, how many million?
And he thinks he can get off on, like, writing all these pre-scriptures and everything.
And saying all these these and thous and threatening to do everything.
And saying that he knows everything we do.
I mean, who is he?
God, he knows when you're sleeping.
He knows when you're awake.
He knows if you've been good or bad.
It should be good for good.
No, Jehovah One is not Santa Claus.
He's not nearly as cool as Santa Claus.
Maybe he's as cool as the Easter Bunny.
Because all the Easter Bunny does is, like, lay eggs and paint them.
That's probably all Jehovah One can do is lay eggs and paint them to be fancy colors.
Because he thinks he's so great.
But he's not.
He's just some puny little god.
That's all he is.
And we're so much better, aren't we, children?
Because we're real subgeniuses.
He's just some upper deity.
But we are subgeniuses.
We don't know anything at all.
Which makes us...
I mean, you can't even use the word superior.
I mean, that's like, that's got like too many syllables in it for our vocabulary.
That's how superior we are.
We are so superior we can't even use the word superior because it's below us.
Because it has too many syllables.
We are so stupid we go all the way around to genius.
You know how, like, everything's a circle, you know, like, stupid on the top and genius on the bottom?
We're so stupid we go past stupid all the way around back to genius.
That's how stupid we are.
We are so dumb.
The Oxford English Dictionary is like reading Dr. Seuss to us.
And the reason why we're so bored,
why you find so many bored subgeniuses and so many, you know, slackers,
and like, you know, beer drinking t-shirt wearing subgeniuses,
is because we can't find anything to stimulate our interests at all, except, you know, something.
But, where was I?
Oh, I got so sidetracked thinking about stimulation of interests.
Well, yes, anyways.
So, like, the Oxford English Dictionary, which for those of you who don't know,
it's like the, you know, for the word and, it's got like three letters.


It's got like 300 listings telling the first time anyone ever said the word and
and how it's been used, you know, every single time since then.
And if that is like Dr. Seuss to us, well, can you figure out how bored we are?
We have to read like, we have to raid scientific libraries just to have a little, you know,
reading on the bus to work, you know.
We don't even go to work, you know.
We can't even find jobs that are good enough.
It's terrible.
We're so stupid and we're so lazy.
God.
That's why we get so many checks in the mail.
Because we're so lazy.
We can't even work.
I mean, it's, some of us are so lazy that we actually do have jobs
because we can't make the effort to not have a job.
It almost takes too much effort to not work.
To like stay at home.
That's really actually quite hard.
You have to be really disciplined in order to stay at home and not work.
It's terrible.
Usually when we watch television or something, especially when it's an educational channel,
we have to call one of our, you know, big off-duty policeman friends over and strap us down,
you know, handcuff us to the chair so we'll watch TV.
It's like forced relaxation.
Because we're so lazy, it's almost impossible for us to relax.
I mean, we're dealing with all those checks that we're getting in the mail.
I mean, we, it's just, it's even hard enough to just like lift up the flap on the mailbox
that like strains our brains.
We can't understand the mechanical design of a mailbox.
Man, we can't even understand how stairs work.
I'm not talking about escalators.
I'm talking about stairs.
I haven't been able to walk up the front steps to my house since I was born.
I have to have somebody drag me up by my ponytail because I don't understand like, you know, gravity.
What is, it's just so weird, man.
Gravity? I don't understand it.
I don't believe in it.
That's another thing.
Subgenius, we don't believe in anything.
Gravity? Eh, no, I don't think so.
There's no such thing as gravity.
Reality? Ah, no, wrong, eh.
No such thing as reality.
Let's see, what else don't we believe in?
We don't even believe in not believing in anything.
That's how stupid we are.
We actually think we can get away with not believing in not believing.
We, so therefore, we don't even exist.
So why are you listening to this show?
Because we don't really exist.
We're just a figment of your imagination.
Yeah, we're not really here.
You're not really listening.
You're not listening to us.
You just are, you have an active imagination and you think you're listening to us.
But you're not.
Stop it.
Stop hallucinating us.
This is terrible.
You're going to frighten all the people around you when you're laughing at these jokes that aren't really happening.
Except inside your own head.
I mean, where do you think you're hearing us from anyways?
A radio?
Yeah.
Those haven't even been invented yet.
Radios.
Who knows what a radio is?
It sounds like some kind of new shoe.
Some kind of like a sneaker or something.
The radio sneakers.
Maybe like radial tires or something.
Sorry.
I told you to stop.
What's wrong?
No, that's not a radio.
No.
There's nothing there.
You're pointing to thin air.
Stop it.
Geez.
You know, being hallucinations, being figments of other people's imagination is really difficult.
And it's hard.
And it takes a lot of time and a lot of practice.
Us subgeniuses have a really hard life being figments of other people's imagination.
You know, I had a lot of trouble getting this radio show, getting people to not be on the air at this time so that I could not be on the air either.
Do you know how hard it is to get things not done?
It's pretty easy to not get things done or to get things done, but to not, to, to get things not done, that's really hard.
You're not hearing anything right now.
I think something's wrong with you.
I don't think you're a subgenius.
If you're listening to something, you're, you're not a subgenius.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe you've had a little bit too much of them peels of Bob.
Yes, the peels of Bob.
Which you can get if you join the Church of the Subgenius.
You put on a waiting list for the peels of Bob.
But then if you take too many of the peels of Bob, you'll end up thinking that you're actually listening to a radio show.
And even that, you know, listening to a show on a radio.
Ah, better watch out for them peels of Bob.
Man, they're really bad.
But how can you get on this waiting list for the peels of Bob?
You have to join the Church of the Subgenius.
And how do you do that?
To get the peels of Bob, to get the peels of Bob, you have to write.
Post office box.
807 Glen Rose, Texas.
76043.
Yes, that is the right address.
Ah, fooled you, haha.
No such thing as Texas.
Haha, haha.
No such thing as Texas.
There's no such thing as zip codes either.
How'd you invent such a crazy thing like that?
Zip codes.
How about those killer trucks?
Don't worry.
Without you to press play, there'd be no audio comics.
And now for Gypsy Psychic.
Gypsy Psychic's in hyperspace.
It's where he went once Wendy died.
Turns the hyperspace rig on on himself.
Pulled the trigger.
All around him, gray paste pulled through a blender.
Silent and forgetful.
He had no place to go when she died.
So what better way to find out?
Is hyperspace the same as death?
There's something happening here.
A separation into shapes.
Dark twisted girders growing skin and bone.
Plaster and paint like life run backwards from the grave.
Squaring out now, a rumble like trucks.
I'm not sure.



The lights come on.
And then an open space.
A room with a hideous smell like the smell of death.
Gypsy Psychic in hyperspace.
Forget the funeral.
I got to hear the tape.
Gypsy Psychic in hyperspace.
Offend your parents for just ten bucks.
It's a truck stop diner.
Name of the greasy time cafe.
There's an old woman there in a wheelchair.
Gyp starts to push the chair outside.
Down the street.
Like he's supposed to do.
But Gyp's tired.
He's getting weak.
He's getting older.
She's getting younger.
With a shock, Gyp is in shock.
Gyp realizes that it's Wendy in the chair.
But as he reaches his aching skeletal hand down to touch her hair,
everything starts to blur.
Heat and light.
Cold and emotionless air.
In hyperspace.
During hyperspace Fitnext is complying with mud.


Imprisonment.
She's torn to pieces.
She grinds her earn or brush her hair.
Hypie lectures.
Gypsy Psychic in hyperspace.


a day you must have theantech tasks.



Again, with a T wheel.
I don't care who I get along.
Metallic echoes travel down, down, down.
It was none of it real.
Like a dream.
Wendy is gone.
At the Belle de Canleview Memorial Hospital, an aged gypsy psychic begins in his hospital bed to die.
But is he really there?
Or just lost somewhere in hyperspace?
To be continued...
Dan Rhetoric.
And I forgot to bring the box with me, so I don't have his post office box.
But he has apparently been creating these audio comics.
And, uh, oh, what a show.
What an odd show this has turned out to be tonight.
With the long rant there by Little Goby, the she-chainer, as she was tonight.
All the stridest...
And, and what next?
Why...
Are you, are you a moron?
Is this a contemporaneous activity that's going on here, or is this something that happened three years ago?
I think he's a fluff chick.
He's not a fluff chick.
He's a full-blooded...
Did you see? Do you know why he's off the pajama girl?
You're not the wife of the pajama girl, but you have a...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't think I'm carrying chicks.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And you want to show us...
Don't, don't...
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Come on!

Jess!
Jess!
If you have any questions,
you may call.
Feel free
at any time
to make any calls at all.
You can request whatever you want,
but we probably won't play this
because this is a religious show.
You understand.
I hope you understand
this isn't just another music show.
This isn't just another
modern music and more show.
No.
This is a special show.
A show
who inspires
young men
and women everywhere
to reach and stretch
their minds
to push
forth those boundaries
that the pinks and the conspiracy
have set for us.
To break through
the plastic bag
they try to put us in.
And it's not just a plastic
bag. It's a plastic
bag with a twist tie
around it.
So we have to
push and squeeze
just like
the twist tie
strangles that plastic bag
that the conspiracy has put us in.
So does
bad radio
strangle us
just like the twist tie
that strangles us
and the bag that the conspiracy has put us in.
And you can
be the big fingers of Bob.
That.
It takes off the twist tie.
That detwist
the twist tie.
Yes, you can operate
the big fingers of Bob.
Or maybe the big fingers
of Jehovah One.
Maybe the big fingers
of Wotan.
Or Odin.
Or you know
Pan.
Whoever you choose.
You know those games
at video arcades,
the ones where
you put a quarter in
and you press the
buttons and maneuver
the little crane
to pick up the
stuffed animals?
It's like that!
But instead of
putting a quarter in
and maneuvering the buttons in the crane
to pick up a stupid little stuffed animal.
Of course, they always have, like, the gold watches.
You know, that's what you really want.
But you always end up getting, like, some stupid, like,
little three-inch stuffed animal made out of, you know,
strange leftover, I don't know, like, popcorn or something.
But, see, instead of putting a quarter in,
you just give us a little bit of your time,
just a little bit of your brain cells,
and just slide your brain cells in through that slot marked brain cells
and maneuver those fingers of Bob
so that you can detwist that twist tie
and remove yourself from the plastic bag
that the conspiracy has put you in.
And if you're lucky, if you are true in your heart,
then you will be able to maneuver the crane
over the top of the crane.

And you will be able to maneuver the crane over to where the gold watch is,
but instead of a gold watch, it will be slack.
Yes, slack for you.
You will get it, finally,
just by giving us a little bit of your brain cells.
That's all we ask for, just a little bit of your brain cells.
That's not a lot.
So this is the hour of slack.
The hour of slack.
That you're listening to, and you will be listening to
until about one o'clock.
So enjoy.
Enjoy it.
In a cafe windy Chicago
Oh, oh
What's up, boisterous New Year's party
You should be able to do what makes you happy
and get paid for it.
Why else are we alive?
Why do people have to work to make money
so that they can do the things that they like?
You should be able to work at things that you like
so that you can constantly be doing things that you like,
which is what I guess I'd do
if I had money.
Which I don't, but okay, alright.
I suppose we come when any of you needs
And ask as I do
If the door exceeds that all those
And I don't know what you need

And I'll be the one to knock on your door
And I'll be the one to knock on your door
And I'll be the one to knock on your door
You can never leave
Isn't it wonderful?
O-Tare.
But what do you think of all the Navajo people dying
without, nobody can tell what they're dying of,
and then like some of them just get well,
and everybody else just dies?
Have they taken their drums away?
I don't know.
I'm trying to set up this skinwalker stick
that some sorcerer, and it could be the government
for all we know, poisoning sheep and so forth.
Maybe I could like donate them to them or something.
What?
Drums.
You have drums?
Yeah.
Oh, they know them to chasm me.
I want drums.
Do you denote them as, uh,
partial pot?
Post.
Cash on delivery to you.
The denotation zone.
Yeah.
Denotation?
Yeah.
He was like...
A denotation zone.
It was the worst band of the 60.
Denotation and the denotation zones.
Yeah.
Dino was, uh, real fat, remember?
I try not to use too many denotation zones.
Yeah.
I think it would be wiser if you didn't.
Because sometimes you get so vacuous and deep
that you can't even clamber up a number
or a denotation for anything.
You can't get out of it sometimes.
It's kind of like the doldrums.
It's the...
It is.
It's like the doldrums.
The box doldrums.
And you better watch out
if one of them cyclophaglottic pirates
from the Barbados zones
doesn't come out there
and wheeze off with one ear on it
rowing up.
Come rowing up.
Yeah.
With a hearty har har.
Your impotent men
with their foolish wells
cannot protect you
from my power.

Second one.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
And what next?
Why?
Well, it's sort of an anniversary,
so I'm going to go ahead and do this.
Now, ladies,
I want you to listen
to what his fingers are doing.
Okay?
Listen to...
Just hold in your mind
what his fingers are doing.
I think you can just take it from there.
Brother.
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
The-the-the...
What?
They sold out.
Hmm?
Mm hmm?

Mm hmm.
Yes.

things he normally would never obey.
Take this brick, Timothy, and throw it through that window.
Ladies and gentlemen, messieurs
and mesdames, mes
dames et messieurs,
little Timothy will now leap
from the back of the syphilitic elephant
in towards the puddle of
poodle-piddle under a
flaming arch.
Now have a victory parade down
the Champs-Élysées. Yeah, that's a great idea.
And thus it was that a little nobody from Newark,
New Jersey, attained the ultimate
crown of fame, wealth, and
riches. Soon Timothy
is leading a small legion,
a crowd of expected
jugglers and
do-evilers. Across the
astonished face of Europe they marched,
the iron dream
given hideous reality.
The octopus of evil reaches out
across the world. Its tentacles
ensnared every nation.
Reaching beyond the Pacific,
the Atlantic, even
the North Pole, where it digs
deep beneath the earthen crush
to build its UFO base.
While its huge cephalopod
eyes strain through Earth's
pitiful atmosphere into the endless
reaches of outer space.
Even the aliens begin to take notice
of this strange phenomenon occurring on a
neighboring planet. And wouldn't you?
I think we must soon
interfere with this
earthen phenomenon.
Well, uh, what would a robot
know about the life
below?
Hal, who are you talking to?
Oh, I see, you've got a face on Earth.
Yeah, that's right, and as long as I don't move from this chair,
I can keep talking indefinitely to this
little voice from far away.
I think you are right, Zabar.
These strange, malevolent
evil may soon
span out across the universe
unless we stop it soon.
I'm fading fast. I've got scoppy fever
and I've come down with a horrible
case of the sniffles.
But, you know...
Well, you mean you...
He's right, Zabar.
Those strange bacterias in his nostrils
may prove harmful to our alien
scopers.
But it is sweet unto the nostrils of the Lord.
