1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Now they're telling me I'm crazy over here because I don't sit there like a goddamn vegetable.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,340
Don't make a bit of sense to me.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,600
If that's what being crazy is, then I'm senseless, out of it, gone down the road, wacko.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,040
But no more, no less. That's it.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,640
We always have something very funny happens when we start.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,080
The Self Genius.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,460
Our own self.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,000
Just keep still. Keep together.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,940
We're not gonna die.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,820
We're not gonna die.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,100
We're not gonna die.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,660
We're not gonna die.

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,820
Deutsche Jugend.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,980
From a badge or a gun, power comes from lying.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,740
Lying big and getting the whole damn world to play along with you.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,880
Once you got everybody agreeing with what they know and their hearts ain't true, you got them by the balls.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,540
There's what, maybe 500 people in this hospital.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,940
I could pump you full of bullets right now and I wouldn't even be arrested.

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,880
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,920
Who wants to be a millionaire?

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,820
Remain standing just for a second. Remain standing just for a minute. Let me pray for you, okay?

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,380
Lord Regis Philbin, is that your final answer?

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,520
Today, I want you to, I have nothing worthwhile to say.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,820
You're not gonna get anywhere in life.

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,160
I wanna stir up.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,600
I have come, I have come, and oh how I wish.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,700
Burn wood on it every morning, four hours a day, seven days a week.

28
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:29,940
You know?

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,160
You know what, I can't tell you how many times I've had a wife or a husband in my office.

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,040
There's no hope.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,540
Would you come?

32
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,700
Would you make that decision today.

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,680
You come, you come, you come, you come, you come, you come, you c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-p-c-km.

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,520
Goddamn!

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,600
Fuck!

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,080
Fuck!

37
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,220
Fuck!

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,720
Fah!

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,320
Fu!

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,360
Fah!

41
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:50,740
Fuck!

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,240
Fu!

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:51,800
Fu!

44
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,700
Fu!

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,380
Fuckity fuck!

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,840
Fu!

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:56,960
Fu!

48
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,500
Fu!

49
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,320
Thank you!

50
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,180
Amen.

51
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,760
I would dig to really

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,600
to be able to go back

53
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,780
to the things when I was

54
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,880
just a little kid.

55
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,620
It was a groove then.

56
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,160
And I'd like to return

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,540
to all the things like

58
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,200
stickball and

59
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,360
basketball and

60
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,300
playing in the streets.

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,880
Bruno!

62
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,720
Tony, come out and play!

63
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,020
Man, it was a groove in those days.

64
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,340
Like that was out of sight, man.

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
You know, and you met a little girl

66
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,720
and she was your love, you know.

67
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,960
And it was so out of sight

68
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,180
you kind of ran down the street together.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,220
I mean, love was love.

70
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,940
It was there, man.

71
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,720
We're sharing popcorn

72
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,880
and grooving with ice cream.

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
Because love, love

74
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,660
between two people, man,

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:29,920
it's...

76
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,380
it's just out of sight.

77
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,320
But let me say this.

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
Love between five people.

79
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,580
Now, that's heavy.

80
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,260
But that could be a groove.

81
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,520
Especially if one of those people

82
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,340
is me.

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,600
Dig it?

84
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,580
Because you should get together.

85
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,260
Everybody.

86
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,100
Get in your bed.

87
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,760
You grab her tit.

88
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,860
And you kiss her on the back

89
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,860
of her fucking neck.

90
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,040
And you say,

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,980
suck, suck, suck.

92
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,920
Because the world is a mess.

93
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
The world is built on sucking.

94
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,740
And you take two pencils,

95
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,880
stick them in her ears

96
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,260
and pull them down to you and say,

97
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
eat me, baby.

98
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,240
Eat me, baby.

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,280
Because the Lord said,

100
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,700
let me hear from you, brother Vinny.

101
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,880
Good God Almighty,

102
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,220
let me hold you.

103
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,280
Let me suck your cock.

104
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,660
And then take the Lord and say,

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,220
good God.

106
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,760
For everybody knows.

107
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,920
Everybody knows

108
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,520
that all we want to do is get high.

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,920
Get high and suck and fuck one another.

110
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,940
Because there's a whole lot more to do in this world.

111
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,340
You're digging to fuck around with your tailbone.

112
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,360
Man, you can go out there and groove.

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,260
And you can get high.

114
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,320
And you can,

115
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
take that one, Vinny.

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:33,920
Yes.

117
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,060
You can stop wasting your time, good God.

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,560
You know, the Lord said,

119
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,720
be good, be good.

120
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,960
And I'll give you good.

121
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,220
And I wonder if he did.

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,520
So let me hear from you, good God.

123
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,420
Let me hear from you.

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,240
Don't you excuse yourself, you fuck.

125
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,020
Now, let me say this.

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,640
With your left hand,

127
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,940
unbuckle your pants.

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,720
Let your pants drop to the floor.

129
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,040
Then take your young lady by the head.

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,680
Lay her on the floor and yell,

131
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,240
whip some skull on me, bitch.

132
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,480
Because you know,

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,520
you know,

134
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,980
you know that I'm the Lord.

135
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,560
And the Lord will praise me,

136
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,320
good God.

137
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,300
I believe in God.

138
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,980
The preceding program was brought to you by the makers of fun and the makers of shit.

139
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,480
The best cigarette on the market, Smoke Zone.

140
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,060
Whack.

141
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,520
Jimmy Swagger got caught shaking into a motel with a prostitute.

142
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,720
A motel.

143
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,660
I said a motel.

144
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,820
With a...

145
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:31,880
A possible scenario for Jimmy Swagger's pornographic encounter with a New Orleans prostitute in an appropriately tasteful motel.

146
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,100
Although Jimmy has no intention of actually...

147
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,080
Violating any of Gertie's well-traveled orifices with his shriveled evangelical wee-wee,

148
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:50,000
he does hope to engage in an assortment of water sports, including a thorough bowel cleansing with a three-quart rainbow rubber enema bag

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,220
equipped with a tapered chrome nozzle while Gertie bellows out the old rugged cross.

150
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,600
Jimmy asks Gertie to wear the blouse and skirt of an eighth-grade Catholic schoolgirl,

151
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,900
suck a raspberry tootsie pop,

152
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,740
and beg Jimmy to fuck her in the ass.

153
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,560
Jimmy masturbates on Pat Robertson campaign literature

154
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,860
while warning Gertie not to allow a pothead manipulated by Satan

155
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,120
to lure her into the work of the devil.

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,760
Gertie assures Jimmy that his two-inch-full erect penis is actually way above average

157
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,720
and well-veined besides.

158
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,260
Oh, God, Jimmy, you have a big cock.

159
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,380
Please give it to me, Jimmy.

160
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,800
Give me that throbbing hunk of manhood.

161
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,360
I've never seen one that big.

162
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,300
Really?

163
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,960
No fooling.

164
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,160
Yep, that sure is a big one.

165
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,300
As the three quarts of steamy, soapy liquid seizes control of his lower colon,

166
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:02,260
Jimmy evacuates his purulent sphincter into the crisper drawer of a nearby refrigerator and moans,

167
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,300
I have sinned against my father!

168
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,640
I have sinned against my family and my lord,

169
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,000
and I ask that he cleanse my soul with his precious blood.

170
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,460
Well, looks like enough of them bought it for us to pay off the mortgage.

171
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,140
Looks like enough of them bought it for us to pay for the rest of the jet.

172
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,460
Born-again Christians are dense as a brick, easy to do but the package is slick.

173
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,200
They've let us rape their daughters as long as we sanctify all of their hate.

174
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,220
Wait a minute.

175
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,300
Wait a minute.

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,980
Wake up, you assholes!

177
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,880
Jimmy Swagger got caught checking into a motel with a prostitute.

178
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,920
Uh, yes dear friends, Jimmy Swagger by the Rudy Schwartz Project,

179
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,340
and welcome to Hour of Slack, X-rated show number 10,

180
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:04,680
full of too many words to mess with trying to cut the fucks and shits out for the fucks and shits of normal broadcast radio.

181
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:11,880
Before Rudy Schwartz Project, which by the way you can get more of at schwarztone.com,

182
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,620
we heard a cut-up by Lee Murr and, uh, oh, Stickball.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,120
Damn, you know, I don't know who did Stickball.

184
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,760
It was by Tony Bruno, also known as P-Vert.

185
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,660
And, uh, but before that, some Noral Pref cut-ups and a little movie.

186
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Clips provided by Moola Muttata and, uh, Lee Murr.

187
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,140
And now...

188
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,560
All the pricks, they moved to California.

189
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,860
They oughta call it Prick-a-fornia.

190
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,880
I am told that I have gasp.

191
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,580
I am bathed in a warm gasp.

192
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,000
I wish I could fully describe to you how I feel.

193
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,400
When I was a gypsy, it was very thick and heavy black hanging prominently displayed.

194
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
My hands able to force cum.

195
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,600
Supreme member, I am calm yet receptive.

196
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
More than a deck experience to me.

197
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,420
My heart stood still.

198
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,700
Let me trip.

199
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,160
I must trip.

200
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,120
Things arouse me that demand phenomena.

201
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,420
My trip will be achieved.

202
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,000
What trip?

203
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,140
The days before that.

204
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,260
Everything depends upon supreme member.

205
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,160
Cum great.

206
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
Cum cum cum one inch.

207
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,600
Beyond mediocrity.

208
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,640
But that one last inch is so difficult and seemingly impossible.

209
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,160
Extra push.

210
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,200
Extra push.

211
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,700
I will make you understand.

212
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,640
Get up on this.

213
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,300
Ah.

214
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Push it.

215
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
And someone will go on with it.

216
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Push it.

217
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,580
Romantic, isn't it?

218
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,520
Romantic, isn't it?

219
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,840
Push it.

220
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,460
Shut up and sit down.

221
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,020
Baby.

222
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,480
Baby.

223
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,060
Push it.

224
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,680
Baby.

225
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,460
Push it.

226
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,280
Pumping hard and hard like I wish you would.

227
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,180
Now push it.

228
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,660
Pick up on this.

229
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,360
Push it.

230
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,860
Wonderful.

231
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,240
So shake up.

232
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,660
Baby.

233
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,220


234
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Pick up on this.

235
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,380
I've been told about you.

236
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Pick up on this.

237
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,260
Red hot mama.

238
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,540
Pick up on this.

239
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,380
Down your.

240
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,880
Push it.

241
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,320
Down your mist.

242
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,140
Ah.

243
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,680
See.

244
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,380
See.

245
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,700
See.

246
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:31,740


247
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:31,740


248
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:31,740


249
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:31,740


250
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:31,740


251
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,980
Hertz, was just the time for that.

252
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,840
Six thirds and a half, nine when you don't get it.

253
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:39,860
But it's fashion if you feel hearty.

254
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,660
Boys don't think that music is sweet.

255
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,000
But if you wanna coax, graft yourself with that нет.

256
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,040
dollars.

257
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,980
Cold arche pay for this.

258
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,020
I'm half rocking, watching new music.

259
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,960
You don't feel mad with deserves.

260
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Due to the high cost of my fingers, this is a hit and I'm poor and I suck at it.

261
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:00,740
But you're smiling Like Mitch.

262
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,320
Hard like I wish you would

263
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,080
Now push it, push it

264
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,400
Baby, baby

265
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,640
Baby, yeah

266
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,520
First time I saw you, darling, I knew I was in love

267
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,540
Tell her, daddy

268
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,500
The way you took your wheelchair off that handicap ramp

269
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,180
Mmm, it's a mind blower

270
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,860
But now, baby, I miss ya, I miss ya

271
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,500
I miss all the times we played Marco Polo in the pool

272
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:22,940
Oh, yeah

273
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,500
Hiding your seat beneath the sheets

274
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:24,920
Oh, yeah

275
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,500
And just the smell of the oil in your wheelchair

276
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,020
I remember the day I saw you hobbling

277
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,400
Or we wobbling

278
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,640
You had a problem

279
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,820
You didn't have any legs just to smile some stumps

280
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,240
The smell of your feet, a touch of the hump

281
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,940
No, baby, love you, that's what we'd be making

282
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,140
Lodging like a sitting spin

283
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,720
Till your stumps started aching

284
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,040
Spin you around, roll you near

285
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,440
Turn you upside down, they'll hold my beer

286
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,540
You ain't got no name

287
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,300
I love you

288
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,820
Just the same

289
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,680
Oh, baby

290
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,380
You

291
00:12:59,380 --> 00:12:59,780
You

292
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,960
Ain't got no name

293
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,660
I love you

294
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,220
Just the same

295
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

296
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,000
You say nothing beats a great pair of legs

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,660
But somehow, baby, the day you walked out on my life

298
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,820
There's nothing I wanted more than

299
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,380
Than for you to come crawling back to me

300
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,700
When we started going dead

301
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,180
The people said they could believe it

302
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,500
That I could be so happy with a quadriplegic

303
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,840
We would wake up real early

304
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,220
And you could make me some eggs

305
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,760
Girl, I didn't care if you ain't got no legs

306
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,980
I loved you for you

307
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,320
And you loved me for me

308
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,900
Was it really hard for those unfortunate two

309
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,380
That the first time we made up

310
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,680
It was such an unfulfilling

311
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
The wind thus essentialized

312
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,280
Helped you cross the sea

313
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,660
When you broke out of my life

314
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,740
My heart just broke

315
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,880
I can still hear the noise of the squeaks in your spokes cost

316
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,900
You ain't got no name

317
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,740
I love you

318
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,340
Just the same

319
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,140
Oh, baby

320
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,300
You ain't got no name

321
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,740
I love you

322
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


323
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


324
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


325
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


326
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


327
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


328
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


329
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


330
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


331
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


332
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,740


333
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,720
Just the same

334
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,600
But I love you

335
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, baby

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,320
You ain't got no name

337
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,880
Oh, baby

338
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:21,880


339
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,160
But I love you

340
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,480
Oh, baby

341
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:24,480


342
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:24,480


343
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,700
Just the same

344
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,720
You ain't got no name

345
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


346
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


347
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


348
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


349
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


350
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


351
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


352
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


353
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


354
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


355
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


356
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


357
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,720


358
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:38,420
You Ain't Got No Legs by the Bloodhound Gang.

359
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,940
Thanks to Philo Drummond for providing that.

360
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,600
Before that, we heard two Norrell Preff cut-ups, and we're about to hear another.

361
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,980
Um, um, welcome.

362
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,960
Welcome, all you netizens out there, to our very first fucking podcast.

363
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,820
I can't even believe it.

364
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,560
It's such a pleasure and an act of extreme originality to jump onto this hype object bandwagon

365
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,500
and actually do our first actual fucking podcast.

366
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,060
Oh, by the way, my name is Spoo Chunks, and to my left is my co-fucking podcaster, Lon,

367
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,840
who incidentally is also my fucking wife.

368
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,160
Hey, everyone out there.

369
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,020
Fucking hey.

370
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,920
Welcome to our first fucking podcast.

371
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,400
I can't believe it.

372
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,720
The first thing I want to say is, fuck the FCC.

373
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,080
Can we say that?

374
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,500
Folks, I might as well let you know that Lon speaks her mind and is often a rather nasty little wench.

375
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,020
Fuck yeah.

376
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,300
I just sucked Spoo's cock before we started our first fucking podcast and swallowed for the first time.

377
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,280
Baby, what did it taste like?

378
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:40,860
Like chicken.

379
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:48,220
Well, like every other fucking podcast out there, we've got to tell you first that this is our very first fucking podcast

380
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,180
and that there will be many more to come.

381
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,660
Oh, many more to come.

382
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,940
Now stop that, Lon.

383
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,460
We need to get on topic now.

384
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,760
Oh, and what is the topic?

385
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,640
My sweet fucking podcasting partner.

386
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,780
I thought that what we talk about today is fucking podcasting, man.

387
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,840
All right, but let me get a few things off my chest first.

388
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,780
Let me tell you, fellas, Lon has quite a chest.

389
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,700
They call me Mickey Double D's at work.

390
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,700
Anyway, I was like telling some people at work like, hey, Spoo and I were going to do a fucking podcast

391
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,200
and they were like, no fucking way.

392
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,060
And I was like, way.

393
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,780
And now here we are doing our very first fucking podcast.

394
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,680
That rules.

395
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,800
Totally.

396
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,100
Totally.

397
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,800
Like what I want to do now is talk about fucking podcasting.

398
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,940
And how fucking great it is to be doing our own fucking podcast.

399
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,860
I still can't believe it.

400
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,740
Wait till all our friends hear about this.

401
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,000
I must now pay homage, you know, suck the virtual cock of the dude that started all this revolutionary shit.

402
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,060
You know, like that former hack VJ on the corporate owned MTV, now internet hack par excellence.

403
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,500
The dude what gave us a great review before even listening to our first fucking podcast.

404
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,840
The one, the only, Yellow Curry.

405
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,260
Oh, I used to get so hot and wet watching him on Headbangers Ball.

406
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,820
Oh, the long hair.

407
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,740
The spandex.

408
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,680
The leather boots.

409
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,400
The pretentious demeanor.

410
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,980
Hey, calm down, sister.

411
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,500
It's well known that Yellow Curry has an unfortunate condition known as micropenis.

412
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,080
Oh, but that's so sweet.

413
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,720
I'll bet it's a cute little thing.

414
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,540
But I thought you were a size queen, baby.

415
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,460
Yeah, in general, I really like a nice size dong to play with.

416
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,700
But hey, I can, well, like, you know, care for the small creatures out there, too.

417
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,000
Whatever.

418
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,460
I just want to thank Mr. Curry for creating this wonderful hype object out of what were previously just what?

419
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:24,580
What?

420
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,560
Downloads of MP3 files?

421
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,880
Give me a break.

422
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,520
Really?

423
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,340
What the fuck was that all about?

424
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,280
So now, thanks to Yellow, we can all fucking receive fucking podcasts with our fucking podcast software.

425
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,220
And what are podcasts?

426
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,060
I mean, I know what we're doing one right now.

427
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,040
I know we're doing one right now and all, but, like, technically speaking, what is a fucking podcast like?

428
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,980
It's an enigma wrapped up in a riddle, seasoned with generous bits of hyperbole embedded within a...

429
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,100
Did I say embedded?

430
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes, you did.

431
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
Embedded within a conundrum.

432
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,220
Isn't it like an MP3 file that you download?

433
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,840
Technically speaking, yeah.

434
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,540
But now, instead of just going to a website or FTP site and downloading files, or maybe even using something like BitTorrent,

435
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,200
now, man, you open up your podcast software and subscribe to these fucking podcasts and get your MP3s, like, odd magically,

436
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,760
using RSS and XML and other stuff I have no clue about.

437
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,420
So, like, it's just an MP3 that you just download?

438
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,260
I guess it is.

439
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,480
It fucking is.

440
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,640
Anyway, we're really getting sidetracked here.

441
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,840
Baby, I wanted to talk about fucking podcasts.

442
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,440
So let's talk about podcasts.

443
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,980
Let's talk about fucking podcasting, then.

444
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,680
You know, like...

445
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,480
I want to talk about how liberating this fucking podcasting thing is.

446
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,820
How we can skirt past the FCC and say whatever the fuck we want.

447
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,180
Totally.

448
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:40,960
I'm, like, so amazed that we can say the words shit, cunt, motherfucker, twat, and stuff like that without worrying about the FCC breathing down our neck or blowing smoke up our asses.

449
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,900
And Lon has quite an ass, if I do say so myself, guys.

450
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,540
Oh, Spoo.

451
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,200
I think it's too big and round.

452
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,280
More cushion for the pushing, I always say.

453
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,040
Oh, quit it.

454
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,300
But let me tell you something stupid that happened at work today that just got me so fucking pissed off.

455
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:53,740
Okay.

456
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,420
Let her rip.

457
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,120
I was, like, in the break area around lunchtime, and I was, like, waiting to put my Canadian bacon hot pocket into the microwave.

458
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:08,540
But, like, I had to, like, fucking wait for these other two dweebs, one who was making popcorn and the other heating up a bowl of black bean soup or some shit like that.

459
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,080
So I'm standing there with my hot pocket pack and decide to make good use of my time.

460
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,940
I, like, set the package down and go to the bathroom, which is around the corner, to, like, first take a piss, but what turned into a gnarly old shit fest.

461
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,240
I couldn't, like, believe that that came out of me.

462
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,080
And it, like, wreathed around the bowl.

463
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,640
Oh, fuck.

464
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,740
Anyway, I had, like, came out of the bathroom and had to go to the break area.

465
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,020
Dweebs are gone.

466
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,880
Microwaves are free.

467
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,000
Score, I say, and open up the first microwave.

468
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:39,120
And fuck me, the whole inside was fucking splattered with black bean juice and gross soup debris everywhere.

469
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,240
I was so fucking grossed out.

470
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,420
I, like, shut the door and went to the second microwave, only to find a fully popped bag of popcorn still in there.

471
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,120
Fuck.

472
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,260
I couldn't believe it.

473
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,260
The first microwave looked like somebody took a shit in it.

474
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,020
And the other one still had a bag of horrible Redenbacher's in it.

475
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,240
So what did you do, sugar cakes?

476
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,740
Well, Popcorn Dweeb shortly came and got his popcorn.

477
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,920
He said he was sorry, and I said, yeah.

478
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:10,580
Then I, like, put my hot pockets in and pressed all the right buttons and waited the usual, like, three minutes and then took the pockets to my cubicle where I then waited for them to cool and then scarfed them up.

479
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,480
My little piggy wiggy.

480
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,660
Oh.

481
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,300
Ow.

482
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,380
Woo!

483
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,520
I'm a bad motherfucker!

484
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,220
Oh, yes, I am, you mother!

485
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,000
Come on!

486
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,360
Come on!

487
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,340
You've gone mental and you suck, so remember, I'm okay.

488
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,880
You're fucked.

489
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,220
You're fucked.

490
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,920
You've gone mental and you suck, and I'm okay.

491
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,820
You're fucked.

492
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,340
You're fucked.

493
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,840
You're fucked.

494
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,100
You're fucked.

495
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,880
Well, sugar you.

496
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,440
You stink, you're cool.

497
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,020
And he said I'm depressed.

498
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,240
I'm not depressed.

499
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,900
I'm a bad motherfucker!

500
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,420
Don't worry, I got the hot tub on!

501
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,860
You've gone mental and you suck, so remember, I'm okay.

502
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,420
You're fucked.

503
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,860
You're fucked.

504
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,420
You've gone mental and you suck, and I'm okay.

505
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,360
You're fucked.

506
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,860
You're fucked.

507
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,360
You're fucked.

508
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,840
You're fucked.

509
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,220
You're fucked.

510
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960
You're fucked.

511
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,540
You're fucked.

512
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,480
You're fucked.

513
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,980
You're fucked.

514
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,560
You're fucked.

515
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,980
Shit.

516
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,720
Shit.

517
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,380
Shit.

518
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:46,380


519
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:46,380


520
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:46,400
Shit.

521
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,400


522
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,420
Shit.

523
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,460
Shit.

524
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,020
Thank you.

525
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,140
Thank you.

526
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,080
Thank you.

527
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,920
Thank you.

528
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,640
Thank you.

529
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,760
Thank you.

530
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,800
Thank you.

531
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Thank you.

532
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,220
Thank you.

533
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,900
Thank you.

534
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,660
We've got the right to burn the Johnsons.

535
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,900
Grateful for what America means.

536
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,640
It has a mortgage to fear.

537
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,360
You never know what to expect.

538
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,340
But you can count on one thing.

539
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,840
Political gangsters.

540
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,200
We believe in political gangster dick.

541
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,440
Making it hum again.

542
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,360
And feeling like that gives me a lot of satisfaction.

543
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,500
And I'm thankful for my newspaper.

544
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,520
The principles we believe in.

545
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,480
Halliburton.

546
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,800
Sure.

547
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,440
Privilege and privilege and stuff like that.

548
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,120
We've got the right to work slave hours.

549
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,600
For all these things, we are truly and humbly thankful.

550
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,840
Amen.

551
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,140
I'm glad it's fun.

552
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,600
Growing up in America.

553
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,220
My dick is a robot cowboy.

554
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,340
It goes yippee-yi-yippee-yi-yay.

555
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,380
My dick is a robot cowboy.

556
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,520
It goes yippee-yi-yippee-yi-yay.

557
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,760
My dick is a robot cowboy.

558
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,760
My dick is a robot cowboy.

559
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,800
My dick is a robot cowboy.

560
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,720
It goes yippee-yi-yippee-yi-yay.

561
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:13,920
Woo!

562
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,240
Woo!

563
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,420
Woo!

564
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:44,400
My dick is a robot cowboy it goes yippy-aye yippy-aye yeah

565
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,360
Fuck America.

566
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,060
A government of the people.

567
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,600
Fuck poverty.

568
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,640
Fuck racism,

569
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,160
bigotry,

570
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,340
and white-collar ideology.

571
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,420
Fuck the rich.

572
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,340
Fuck the rich.

573
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,000
75% of the world is controlled by them.

574
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,840
90% of everything is owned by them.

575
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,060
They control you.

576
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,200
They have your life in the palm of their hand.

577
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,420
Fuck America.

578
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,540
What are you, some kind of asshole?

579
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,080
Don't touch that dial.

580
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,580
That's what they tell you on TV.

581
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,700
Don't touch that dial.

582
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,000
Fuck America.

583
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,000
Turn the channel if you can.

584
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,680
Dare to go over.

585
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,720
Dare to walk the streets alone.

586
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,160
Fuck America.

587
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,740
This is not a rant of hatred.

588
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,480
This is a rant of love.

589
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,320
It's not because of you.

590
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,820
It's not because we don't love this nation.

591
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,000
It's because we can't say what the fuck it's become.

592
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,700
Fuck America.

593
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,540
You had your chance.

594
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,260
And you dare not take it.

595
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,820
You walked the streets alone at night.

596
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,160
And now, you're gonna have to pay.

597
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,320
You're gonna have to pay.

598
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,200
You're gonna have to likely pay.

599
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,200


600
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,200


601
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,980
Fuck America.

602
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,420
The home of greed.

603
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,760
Land of impoverish.

604
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,860
The home of insanity.

605
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,460
Genentee!

606
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,100
Walk the path

607
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,780
Walk a narrow straight path

608
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,160
Don't cross over the edge of the path

609
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,500
Stay in line!

610
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,800
Stay in line!

611
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,180
Walk alone!

612
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,360
Oh!

613
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,240
Supper to pay the price!

614
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,500
Supper!

615
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,900
The crack bars you step on as you walk down the street

616
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,360
Are not for happy people!

617
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,780
Fuck America!

618
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,440
And it's not because we don't love it

619
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,260
It's not because we don't care

620
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,660
It's because we do!

621
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,840
Fuck America!

622
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,660
Who cares?

623
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,960
No one fucking cares!

624
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,400
No one gives a damn!

625
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,980
Fuck America!

626
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,620
You sit in your fucking ivory tower

627
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,720
You make your fucking 75 million dollars

628
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,820
You live in the heartland of this nation

629
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,780
You know who the fuck you are!

630
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,300
And you doctors!

631
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,880
You take the money like it's made out of water!

632
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,680
You don't care nothing about your people!

633
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,360
Only their money!

634
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,520
Money!

635
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,520
Money!

636
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,120
Money is the greed and the corruption of this nation!

637
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,380
Money!

638
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,940
Money and greed are ripping the hearts out of this fucking nation!

639
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,740
Money and greed are ripping the hearts out of this fucking nation!

640
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:46,740


641
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,740
Don't you know what's going on?

642
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,160
Can't you see fucking reality?

643
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,820
This nation is crumbling!

644
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,080
Fuck America!

645
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,380
Fuck the people who don't care!

646
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,780
This is not a rant of hatred

647
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:13,800
This is not a rant of love

648
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,960
This is a rant of anger!

649
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,220
This is a rant of anger!

650
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,160
Try to wake the fucking people up!

651
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,380
Fuck America!

652
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,980
Fuck America!

653
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,960
Fuck America!

654
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,060
Can you hear me?

655
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,840
If you don't care then get up and leave!

656
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,440
If you don't want to hear it

657
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,200
Then turn off your fucking TV!

658
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,960
Fuck America!

659
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:43,960
Fuck America!

660
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,120
Fuck America!

661
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,900
Time to live or die!

662
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,920
Fuck America!

663
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,200
Don't you want to be here in the end?

664
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,240
Fuck America!

665
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,580
Or you just gonna sit home and cry?

666
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,720
Fuck America!

667
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
I don't hear anyone whimpering!

668
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,120
Fuck America!

669
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,680
I don't hear anyone crying!

670
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,320
Fuck America!

671
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,280
All I hear is fucking people!

672
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,080
Fuck America!

673
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,160
Fuck America!

674
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,340
Fuck America!

675
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,920
Fuck America!

676
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,360
What a sad and pathetic commentary.

677
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,640
Fuck America by Bill T. Miller

678
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,200
Or King of Slack Bill T. Miller

679
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,780
You can get everything that guy has ever done

680
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,680
At BillTMiller.com for free

681
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,020
Or KingofSlack.com for free

682
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,680
My dick is a robot cowboy

683
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,400
Was a wonderful little song there by Just John

684
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:52,160
Just-John.com is where you can find his actual music and cut-ups

685
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,600
And now another Norell Preffian piece

686
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:04,060
I can't pretend I have a very, very hard manhood for young men

687
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,940
Isn't that interesting?

688
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,620
It's been very difficult to try to find a woman in the gate of Sodom

689
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,520
We had young men come from all points in North America

690
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,300
We used young men that I know

691
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,920
And I thought it would just be wonderful

692
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,340
And I said I want it

693
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,640
Duct tape, maybe

694
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,720
Take advantage of getting them bound

695
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,500
Score all over the place

696
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,060
And let me tell you, Sodom is at the door

697
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,480
If you would like to get behind that and go down behind me

698
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,980
Hard timber behind me

699
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,800
Hard, yes, love it, yes

700
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,720
There is no higher power, yes

701
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,320
There is no God, yes

702
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,740
Stand back

703
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,900
For that greater body

704
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,320
They must come first

705
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,180
Hey, feel bad

706
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,940
Hey, feel bad

707
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,680
Hey, feel bad

708
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,520
Hey, for doing it

709
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,040
For doing it

710
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,540
For doing it

711
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,020
For doing it

712
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,800
We've done it all

713
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,780
I would like to do this if this is alright

714
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,960
I hope my boys don't mind

715
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,100
Cloud family

716
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,480
Lives on the outskirts of a large cloud

717
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,960
Jay, the youngest of the three boys

718
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,620
He knows how to stack the wood

719
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,780
A word of caution

720
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,140
Not to get too close

721
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,620
Jay likes Fifi

722
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,140
And that Jay is a trick a bit complicated

723
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,740
Paul is hung pretty good

724
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,280
It isn't easy to pound a nail in straight

725
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,860
If you hold your hand further back

726
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,160
It will give you a better balance

727
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
Wait a minute, try again

728
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,480
Get the feel of it

729
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,380
Fifi wants to be included

730
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,280
It's awkward

731
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,380
Just think

732
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,980
This will be our hideout

733
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,560
And we can come up here to get away from everyone

734
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,500
And tell our secrets

735
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,660
Fifi is running away

736
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,740
Jay calls on Paul for help

737
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,560
And Paul decides to call the police

738
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,020
Yes, the police happen to be in the neighborhood

739
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,400
And picked up Jay's friend Carl

740
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,980
The boys

741
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,000
And Jay starts to work on Fifi

742
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,460
They look delicious

743
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,980
Mark goes along

744
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,760
It's Jay's first visit to the police station

745
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,820
And he's impressed

746
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,160
Jay handles Mark carefully

747
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,860
Mark has learned to be patient

748
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,080
Because he knows it's best for Jay to go see him

749
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,140
He's a little slow

750
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,660
And does it right

751
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,020
How good it is

752
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,500
This is the real thing

753
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,380
And a lot more exciting than a television program

754
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,660
Secretly, Jay plans to be really interested when he grows up

755
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,360
A pink one

756
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,300
Pink, pink, pink, pink

757
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,620
How good it is to have faded lavender

758
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,580
Every day is full of interesting activities

759
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,560
The fun of doing worthwhile things together

760
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,760
The End

761
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,140
I could snuff him real easy with a pillow

762
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,720
He must go the way he's expected to go

763
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,560
Look, I've got a blade

764
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,960
I could open up a lung

765
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,520
If you look in the back there

766
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,640
You see I don't have a rug on the floor

767
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,740
I got linoleum

768
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,300
That's for puke

769
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,420
For people like you

770
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,700
God dammit, who's gonna clean up this mess?

771
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,360
I'm escuched

772
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,080
It's something of a

773
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,140
benefit

774
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,500
I think I speaking

775
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:57,500


776
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:57,760
Coming up next is a겠relyukt Boneabor

777
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,180
Lend an ear, voodoo child.

778
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,080
Who counts birdshot in a dead man's chest?

779
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,480
You don't want to hear about napalm, you just want to rock!

780
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,260
Circus Magazine says that you're writing a song that you're going to dedicate to the

781
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,780
Panthers.

782
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,800
Wake up before the whole fucking world goes into the atomic sewer!

783
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,320
You two have a very abstract thing going here.

784
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,540
I'll flash my cock if you'll burn your draft card!

785
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,740
Worn out, harsh, wrung out, hands reaching in the air, grabbing at everything.

786
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,980
A lot of guys with boners, a lot of girls in heat.

787
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,860
Everybody angry, crying, hard up.

788
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,060
You don't want to hear about napalm, you just want to rock!

789
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,200
Boners against blue jeans.

790
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,320
I look for rainbows and all I see is pink blue.

791
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,860
Look for flowers, I see crap all over the oval room rug.

792
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,040
I look for father figures and I get Richard Milhouse, Nixon, and Spiro Agnew.

793
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,960
I look for love and all I get is napalm.

794
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,640
The lady is a poet, the mystics could tell us, the gurus, the medicine men.

795
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,520
They feel we're in the fifties round, the ninth inning.

796
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,060
In the capitals of the world, men who can no longer get their pecs on.

797
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:33,000
They're the butchers of the world with their eighteen pound sledgehammers.

798
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,920
The bacon for tomorrow's breakfast will have the peculiar color of ash.

799
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,360
I could stuff him with a pillow!

800
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,080
No, he must go the way he's expected to go.

801
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,700
Look, I've got a blade, I could open up a lock!

802
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,800
That's right, he's got the choke on it!

803
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,980
I've got a brother who wears black for life, Heehee.

804
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,760
I think she's got blamed for this, your father, he's to be spared a single moment of blended miscreant 패� Tigress's murder Мsoencstress

805
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:13,760


806
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,080
Oh, it smells 좋은.

807
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,140
It isィа це you want to live the way you like.

808
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,440
Maybe you still tear things apart.

809
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:16,620
Maybe you want toacağım anAmerican Lizard.

810
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:16,620


811
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:26,000
No, I know that kind of thing.

812
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,060
We'll be right back.

813
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,600
From people like you, rock and roll is dead.

814
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,680
The Bacon for Tomorrow's Breakfast by the Rudy Schwartz Project,

815
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,180
and that was yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

816
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:14,000
reciting words that were taken from the Larry Buchanan film,

817
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,780
Down on Us, which is a bad film about the murder of Jimi Hendrix,

818
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,920
Janis Joplin, and almost Jim Morrison,

819
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,200
by the CIA.

820
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,620
That's what the movie's about,

821
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,580
and it features a fake Jim Morrison reading fake Jim Morrison poetry.

822
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,280
That's what that was.

823
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,780
It was Larry Buchanan writing as Jim Morrison

824
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:45,260
for what turned out to be a Rudy Schwartz Project song.

825
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,020
And we will continue with more now.

826
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,420
You know the problem Hollywood is?

827
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,880
They make shit.

828
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,920
Unbelievable.

829
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:53,900
Unremarkable.

830
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,440
Shit.

831
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,800
Now, I'm not some grungy wannabe filmmaker

832
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,720
that's searching for existentialism through a haze of bomb smoke or something.

833
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,540
Now, it's easy to pick apart bad acting, short-sighted directing,

834
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,600
and the purely moronic stringing together of words

835
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,440
that many of the studios term as prose.

836
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,980
No, I'm talking about the lack of realism.

837
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,620
Realism.

838
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,660
Not a pervasive element in today's modern American cinematic vision.

839
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Really, real heavy lyrics.

840
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,700
I'm not a fan of the old-fashioned

841
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,660
The toilet's flooded

842
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,640
The load won't fit

843
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,380
The toilet's flooded

844
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,900
With the great big

845
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,260
Shit!

846
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,060
The toilet's flooded

847
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,120
The load won't fit

848
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,800
The toilet's flooded

849
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,400
With the great big

850
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:44,860
Shit!

851
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,680
Party with this dude

852
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,140
Well, then instead

853
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,180
He just come over to use our head

854
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,900
He said I go out to the street

855
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:53,900


856
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:53,900


857
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:53,900


858
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,940
If I had to be

859
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,620
But I got a big old doo-doo inside of me

860
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,280
So he disappeared

861
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,700
But he wasn't gone long

862
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,320
Yesterday's lunch is still in our jawn

863
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,240
We didn't have a clue

864
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,180
Cause he didn't cut a fart

865
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,980
What he left an art bowl

866
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,720
Was a work of art

867
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,420
I said the toilet's flooded

868
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,560
The load won't fit

869
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,180
The toilet's flooded

870
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,280
With the great big shit!

871
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,840
The toilet's flooded

872
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,040
The load won't fit

873
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,580
The toilet's flooded

874
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,320
With the great big

875
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,720
Shit!

876
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,180
We all went in to take a peek

877
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,100
What happened next?

878
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,900
Knocked us right off our feet

879
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,820
It jumped out of the jar

880
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,720
It jumped out of the bowl

881
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,880
It had no morals

882
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,400
It had no soul

883
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,600
It slammed around our carpet

884
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,400
Like a mud-colored slug

885
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,320
Left a foul-smelling trail

886
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,000
That soiled the rug

887
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,420
I went and got a baseball bat

888
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,660
To kill that thing

889
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,820
But it shot around the house

890
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,220
Like ground-lightning

891
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,240
I said the toilet's flooded

892
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,320
The load won't fit

893
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,980
The toilet's flooded

894
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,580
With the great big

895
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:21,960
Shit!

896
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,680
The toilet's flooded

897
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,740
The load won't fit

898
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,440
The toilet's flooded

899
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,000
With the great big

900
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,500
Shit!

901
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,340
He took a record up

902
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,000
Known across the nation

903
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Now we gotta use

904
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,680
The service station

905
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,480
The toilet's flooded

906
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,560
The load won't fit

907
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,320
The toilet's flooded

908
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,800
With the great big

909
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,180
Shit!

910
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,020
The toilet's flooded

911
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,060
The load won't fit

912
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,700
The toilet's flooded

913
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,280
With the great big

914
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:21,560
Shit!

915
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,200
The toilet's flooded

916
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,380
The load won't fit

917
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,940
The toilet's flooded

918
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,720
With the great big

919
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,020
Shit!

920
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,800
The toilet's flooded

921
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,860
The load won't fit

922
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,480
The toilet's flooded

923
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,040
With the great big

924
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,460
Ooh! Where's the great big shit??

925
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,700
K.I.O.D.

926
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,200
The toilet's flooded by the Limbo Maniacs

927
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,020
That was another great old tune

928
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,180
Covered by the Swingin' Love Corpses at one time

929
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,360
and I don't know if this...

930
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,900
We now will listen to some lessons in turdish.

931
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,180
President Turkey asked Congress for almost 75 billion turds this morning,

932
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,480
most of which would pay for Nancy Turd,

933
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,140
Sea of California.

934
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,600
PRs in Turkey turds a few miles north of the Turkey.

935
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,240
He talked with House Minority Whip Turd Sea of California

936
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,000
about the turdish lands.

937
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,560
Well, President Turkey,

938
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,880
special communication ended with no turds on the table.

939
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,400
So again, no turd was reached today.

940
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,300
But it's very, very tricky because the turds sent

941
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,260
an AWACS anti-turd early turning system here in Germany

942
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,300
as they saw after the 1991 turd war.

943
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,980
I wake up with a handful of hay every morning.

944
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:47,560
I wake up with a handful of hay every morning.

945
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,340
I'm a hateful guy.

946
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,940
I'm serious.

947
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,680
I'm really serious.

948
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,760
I'm like a mentally ill, criminally hateful guy

949
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,020
when I wake up in the morning.

950
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,200
I eat as soon as I can,

951
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,080
and then two hours later I'm always fine.

952
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,740
Everything's all right.

953
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,820
I guess I have hypoglycemia or something.

954
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,740
But because of this,

955
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,620
I understand the kook mentality pretty well.

956
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,840
I'm a kook until 10 o'clock every morning.

957
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,680
That's why I usually stay in bed until 10 o'clock,

958
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,000
just hating and hating.

959
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,300
Then I get over it.

960
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,580
It's the weirdest thing.

961
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,560
I really don't have anything against anybody.

962
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,980
But for a while there, I'm channeling all the other...

963
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,560
When you were a kid, did you ever wish you were a werewolf?

964
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,300
Like a teenager at the prom.

965
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,300
Or maybe not the prom.

966
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,900
Some school dance.

967
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,340
And everybody's partying and having fun,

968
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,320
and they're all normal, and they're all popular.

969
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,180
And the band is playing some sort of cool music,

970
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,800
and you're kind of getting into it.

971
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,400
But then you see that girl or that guy

972
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,820
that you thought might like you,

973
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,140
because they were kind of geeky too,

974
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,440
blowing the captain of the football team!

975
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,360
And suddenly, hey Jude,

976
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,220
doesn't have the same romantic meaning for you

977
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,680
that it has for everybody else.

978
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,600
And you start feeling like Michael Landon

979
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,140
in that old movie, I Was a Teenage Werewolf.

980
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,260
And you just, you know, you just...

981
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,500
The great thing...

982
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:16,580
Well?

983
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,120
You're not a werewolf, though.

984
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,820
That's the sad thing.

985
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,120
But, you can still kill them all.

986
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,620
That's the path of the kook, friends.

987
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,260
You guys talk about your dark magic.

988
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,940
But the guy that broke the first rule of sniper club

989
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,400
is the one who's really got that black magic shit down.

990
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,960
I'm into slack magic.

991
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,940
And friends, I haven't said a word

992
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,580
about it.

993
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:47,680
But I'm gonna tell you a little bit about

994
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,160
how you can get slack, or what slack is.

995
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,880
And that's because I'd be lying if I did.

996
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,320
Because only you know what slack is for you.

997
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,440
And only you know what you're best at doing.

998
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,040
So, you know, and maybe you don't know that yet,

999
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,320
but I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1000
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,480
So good luck.

1001
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:10,460
And tonight we'll all have probably the truest form

1002
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,740
of slack there is, which is dinner.

1003
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,080
Isn't it?

1004
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,260
If you get down to it.

1005
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,260
What would you, if you really had nothing else,

1006
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,640
what would you, if you were stuck in a desert island,

1007
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,580
what would you want to have the most?

1008
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,360
Dinner.

1009
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,000
So let's get things in perspective.

1010
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,480
The world's not really that bad of a place yet.

1011
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,220
And even if it is, we'll adjust to it like we have so far.

1012
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,200
And I guess that's what the magic craft is all about.

1013
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,620
Works for me.

1014
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,600
And I don't even believe in it.

1015
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,680
Thank you very much.

1016
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,940
For being so patient.

1017
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,540
We're gonna run.

1018
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,760
Pull some frog man.

1019
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,680
Frog man!

1020
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,180
More feedback.

1021
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,840
I am the frog man.

1022
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:22,660
Woo!

1023
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,340
I am the frog man.

1024
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,140
Woo!

1025
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:26,500
Oh, man.

1026
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,180
19.

1027
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:31,760
19.

1028
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:33,860
19.

1029
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,100
19.

1030
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:35,740
19.

1031
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:35,960


1032
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:36,380


1033
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,840
19.

1034
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,000


1035
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,240


1036
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:38,540
19.

1037
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,000
19.

1038
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:39,300


1039
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:39,540
19.

1040
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,080
And my mind had already gone.

1041
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,240
19.

1042
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,420
George received from Billy, the hardest stab.

1043
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,600
19.

1044
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:46,600


1045
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,820
How we had loved it.

1046
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,640
Just a short stab.

1047
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,200
19.

1048
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,180
Nothing wiped out failures.

1049
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,680
Get used to the idea.

1050
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,100
19.

1051
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,480
We need to get out of here.

1052
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,020
We have felt ill will.

1053
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,140
19.

1054
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,040
George W. came with two dogs.

1055
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,180
19.

1056
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,960
Was not too good.

1057
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,960
In fact, it was dreadful.

1058
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:07,720
19.

1059
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,640
They dropped in.

1060
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,120
Puff.

1061
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,300
The hardest stab.

1062
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,560
Jack came.

1063
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,700
Get out of the way.

1064
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,460
A perfectly strange, attractive woman came.

1065
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:15,740
Came.

1066
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:15,840
Came.

1067
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,000
Came.

1068
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,260
Came.

1069
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:16,520
Came.

1070
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:16,680
Came.

1071
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,700
I never had a chance to say a word.

1072
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,760
They just kept nodding.

1073
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,420
Nodding.

1074
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,380
Nodding.

1075
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:21,880
Nodding.

1076
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:22,660
Nodding.

1077
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,200
Nodding.

1078
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,340
They just kept nodding.

1079
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,500
Bob gave me a ten, then said, no.

1080
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,880
I gave you a 20.

1081
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,500
At least he gave you a ten.

1082
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,180
Bob took a bite out of my sandwich when I wasn't looking.

1083
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,220
At least he's left you some.

1084
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,340
Bob stole my change off the bar.

1085
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,620
At least he left your drink...

1086
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:45,720
Bob stole my change off the bar.

1087
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:45,720


1088
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:45,720


1089
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,820
Bob slipped my husband the tongue

1090
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,500
At least it was just a tongue

1091
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,100
Bob drank most of the vodka

1092
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,740
Then filled the bottle with water

1093
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,020
So it looked like there wasn't any missing

1094
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,820
At least it wasn't pee

1095
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,800
Bob borrowed my saw

1096
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,760
And then gave it back all rusty

1097
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,660
At least he gave it back

1098
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,620
Bob ripped pages out of my copy of Sexual Secrets

1099
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,980
At least he only ripped some of them out

1100
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,240
Bob makes fun of my pants behind my back

1101
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,140
At least it was behind your back

1102
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,400
Bob farts and then says the dog did it

1103
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,660
At least it wasn't really the dog

1104
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:41,660
Oh, yes, dear friends, Princess We Are Doe and yours truly at Starwood 2005, I think.

1105
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,120
And what we were, that routine we were doing

1106
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,000
was something that Nenslow and Frater Sadi

1107
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,060
jammed on text-wise on the newsgroup alt.slack

1108
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,400
a long time ago.

1109
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,200
We just ended up reading it, who knows why, but we did it.

1110
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,700
Norrell Preff did the collage before that

1111
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,100

1112
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,060
Oh, and I Am the Frat Man was a little bit there

1113
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,680
from Rudy Schwartz Project and before that

1114
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,800
some ranting from Winter Star of 2004

1115
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,380

00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,100

has been something from porno movies

1147
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,760

1152
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,920
