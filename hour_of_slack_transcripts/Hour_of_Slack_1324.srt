1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
The one God, one aim, one destiny for all, one race.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,140
The human race.

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,760
The human race.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,740
That was his last show on WCSB.

5
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,780
His show, African Abstract, has preceded Hour of Slack at WCSB for many years.

6
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,180
And he's the nicest guy in the world.

7
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,400
And I always loved his sign-off.

8
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,860
But he's moved on to another station.

9
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,920
We did two, actually.

10
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,060
We're on three more stations than we were last month.

11
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,460
But we're still in Cleveland and still faithful to WCSB.

12
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,560
For they...

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,340
Took us in when we were banished from KON and Dallas 20 years ago.

14
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,080
Ironically enough, for not being the right color.

15
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,660
This way to pink, right?

16
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,160
It's pink. It would be really pretty on you, though.

17
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,380
This way to pink, right?

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,900
It's pink. It would be really pretty on you, though.

19
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,400
This one has a little bit more pink.

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,020
This one has a little bit more pink.

21
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,960
This one has a li...

22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,760
This one has a li...

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,200
This one has a little bit more pink.

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,000
I let Bobby Jr. do music for him one day.

25
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,140
One of Bobby's songs is perfect.

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,760
Welcome, welcome.

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,920
Everything's pink.

28
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,100
Everything's pink.

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,240
There's a large...

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,220
A large...

31
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,660
A large...

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,160
There's everything's being recorded.

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,940
There's a large...

34
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,040
There's a large...

35
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,040


36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,040


37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,040


38
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,320
There's...

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,320


40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,320


41
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,000
There's voice...

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,080
There's...

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,540
There's...

44
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,440
There's voice...

45
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,840
individuals.

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,480
Everyone's hearing me?

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:19,960
I've been hearing you.

48
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,860
One ofроftheIsorsons has apparently been Barack Obama.

49
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,620
Truth is...

50
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,600
Now, Inex Wear.

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,460
I'm Bobbie.

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,340
I know, I know.

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,560
Listening to the same sounds over and over and over again.

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,660
Well, now, sometimes you hear it backwards.

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,460
I?

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,580
I'm Bobbie.

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,740
Drunk as Lemur, lurched out of the darkness.

58
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,500
This is the season for the house.

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,140
I'm alone.

60
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,260
From PR News in Washington, I'm Omar Gaddafi's son, sentenced to life in prison by Thursday.

61
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,100
NATO says the situation in Japan is very serious and very dangerous.

62
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,480
A change in tone from Monday when rebels hit the U.S. mainland.

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,720
One reason, the unexpected appearance of Vice President Trump.

64
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,480
President Biden, as he rallied his father's dangerous supporter, praising the people of Tripoli,

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,560
fighting two Somali men with the National Piracy Center.

66
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,600
Both admitted helping take over PR News in Washington.

67
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,280
Only J.R. Bob Dobbs can show you the subgenius power of the slacker.

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,620
The

69
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:17,900
U.S. is a country of the rich.

70
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:24,740
And all that wonderful mess there was edited by The Large, who, we were surprised to learn,

71
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,560
lives in...

72
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,440
Finland.

73
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:35,780
At 14X Day, he got the Bobbie Award that used to always go to Mr. Fernando Nani Lemur,

74
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,860
who has vanished.

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,360
I think he got mad when we made fun of the baggers instead of the choosers.

76
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,640
Anyway, this is Hour of Slack number 1324.

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,200
And we're kind of randomly running through some of my favorite recordings from 14X Day.

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,540
Mostly bands.

79
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,100
And singers.

80
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,100
And the lone ranters.

81
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,720
Starting with the gal whose diligence and bloody woolly brain is what kept X Days going

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,560
when I was about to give up in 2006 due to exhaustion and rage at the number of lazy

83
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,940
pinks who had green money but nothing else at all.

84
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,980
So now, the bloody woolly brain of Priestess Pisces.

85
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,480
So, 6 got the rage.

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,720
I got the impatience.

87
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,060
You know?

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,320
I get...

89
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,440
I'm so fucking tired.

90
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:48,100
And not just tired of being uninspired by the people who I see around me who are too busy

91
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:55,720
trying to drown me, who are too busy trying to bring me down because they've been saddened.

92
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,280
They're on the ground.

93
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:07,420
People who decide to fight not because it's their right but more because they feel bad

94
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,500
and they want everyone else to feel sad just like they do.

95
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,680
And that's a really fucking pink thing to do.

96
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,720
I'm so fucking tired.

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:25,720


98
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:25,720


99
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:25,720


100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:25,720


101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:39,940
I want to say to you, brothers and sisters, I still love you because you are members of

102
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,880
my cult.

103
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:53,060
And I accept you with open arms even though you may wish me harm because I know the great

104
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,560
secret that Bob's foretold.

105
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm so fucking tired.

106
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,700
And it's true that even if they are pink, their money is still green.

107
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,640
But Bob has his own method for dealing with those who would do the most obscene thing

108
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,800
that you can ever do as a subgenius.

109
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,800
The most horrendous sin that you could commit.

110
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,340
Which is stealing.

111
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,700
And I'm so fucking tired.

112
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,880
I want to kill that subgenius who really can flatten the

113
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:30,880


114
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,040
Or maybe even all theCUchnage.

115
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,400
Because they don't like walrus-4 impossible stuff.

116
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,420
I have to find a way to get them to truly climb the hills amid their wilfulness.

117
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,260
Or maybe a more

118
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:43,780
pantalla watch.

119
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,420


120
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,580
They're not impressing me.

121
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:55,700
It's the vaunes that will tell me who's the feelest king in this fucking world.

122
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,540
your own saucer on X Day.

123
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,820
I don't wanna steal your slack, boys and girls.

124
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,940
That's not what I wanna do.

125
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,160
And I would love to see each and every one of you

126
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,240
share what I know you've got inside of you.

127
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,680
Cause we're a group of people who are the unwanted.

128
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,280
We're the mutants, the unloved.

129
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,000
We are the different and the peaked.

130
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,860
They would love to bring us down.

131
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,580
They would love to drag our souls into the mud,

132
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:48,000
into the ground, but it's a real,

133
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,140
real,

134
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,540
real bad shame when someone who bears their subgenius name

135
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,540
would choose to tear apart another's slack

136
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,360
by putting their own knife in the back.

137
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,600
That's really all that I have to share.

138
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,460
And I hope that now everyone is aware

139
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,220
that I'm not the only one who's a mutant.

140
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,820
And I want you to repeat after me

141
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,700
that most important rule

142
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,960
so that it's nailed into your skull.

143
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,700
So repeat after me, boys and girls.

144
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,220
The subgenius must have slack.

145
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,640
I can't feel that from you.

146
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,080
I don't think you're really into it.

147
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
So let's try it again.

148
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,560
The subgenius must have slack.

149
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,580
That's what I like to hear.

150
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,100
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the point actually

151
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,140
where I could actually use a little bit of your help

152
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,140
because we need to know, I need to decide

153
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,640
what vocals to use next.

154
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,360
But the scary right bit,

155
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,880
I mean, it's good and everything,

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,200
but Miss Frilly Pants, by the way,

157
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,680
could I hear it, please, for Assistant Frilly Pants?

158
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,180
Normally for the wheel of mashup,

159
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,120
she is the vana for our wheel of mashup.

160
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,320
I have the virtual wheel.

161
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,240
She is here to negotiate the decision of vocals

162
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
for this next track,

163
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,880
which is going to be between Ozzy and Queen.

164
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,580
Ozzy and Queen, those are your choices.

165
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,880
So, all right, let's take a vote right now, please.

166
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,800
So first, Ozzy Osbourne!

167
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,780
And now Queen!

168
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,860
Whoa, kind of close.

169
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,580
What do you think?

170
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,440
Well, I think they asked for Queen,

171
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,860
but I like Ozzy better.

172
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,520
Oh, no.

173
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,700
Wait, so what do I do?

174
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,420
What do I do?

175
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,980
Can we do both?

176
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,220
I mean, it was your birthday recently,

177
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,500
so I'm willing to give you a little bit here.

178
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,820
Maybe I should do both.

179
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,640
Let's do both.

180
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,720
Okay, I'll do both.

181
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,260
We can do both.

182
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,920
That's all right.

183
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,820
And I think the best way I can send her,

184
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,640
though, is to make her run back.

185
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,140
Oh, okay.

186
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


187
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


188
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


189
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


190
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


191
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


192
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


193
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


194
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


195
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


196
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


197
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


198
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


199
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


200
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


201
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,340
Cast like witches at black masses

202
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,620
Even minds that plot destruction

203
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,720
Sorcerer of death's construction

204
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,900
In the fields the bodies burning

205
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,320
As the war machine keeps turning

206
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,180
Death and hatred to mankind

207
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,060
Poisoning their brainwashed minds

208
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,560
Oh Lord, yeah

209
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,980
Oh Lord, yeah

210
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,200
Oh Lord, yeah

211
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,420
Oh Lord, yeah

212
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,680
Oh Lord, yeah

213
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,100
Bloody or a boy, make a big noise

214
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,340
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday

215
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,520
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace

216
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,640
Kicking your can all over the place

217
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,660
We will, we will rock you

218
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,880
We will, we will rock you

219
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,000
Bloody or a young man, hot man

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
Shouting in the sea, gonna take on the world someday

221
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,440
You got blood on your face, big disgrace

222
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,740
Waving your banner all over the place

223
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,780
We will, we will rock you

224
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,020
We will, we will rock you

225
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,080
Bloody or a poor man, poor man

226
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,600
Sitting with your eyes, gonna make you some

227
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,540
Be some day, you got mud on your face

228
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,360
Big disgrace, somebody better

229
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,640
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

230
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,720
Put your bag into your waist

231
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,700
We will, we will rock you

232
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,880
We will, we will rock you

233
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,240
Everybody

234
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,200
We will, we will rock you

235
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,420
We will, we will rock you

236
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,780
Alright

237
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,820
Willie, can you handle this?

238
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,920
Michelle, can you handle this?

239
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,080
Beyonce, can you handle this?

240
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't think they can handle this

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,300
McCoy Kelly, can you handle this?

242
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,240
Michelle, can you handle this?

243
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,560
Kelly, can you handle this?

244
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,640
Michelle, can you handle this?

245
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,340
It's actually very quiet up here.

246
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,560
Did we lose an amp?

247
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,060
How's the sound out there?

248
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,040
Oh, that's better.

249
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,240
Much better.

250
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,280
Can you handle this?

251
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,340
Get those UK handles, bitch.

252
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,240
Then we came alive.

253
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,420
Looking sexy, looking fly.

254
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,480
Nothing bad is tricking, tricking time.

255
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,520
DJ Gemini.

256
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,280
Tonight, spy on me, attend the fan, baby.

257
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,360
There you are, the common brain, baby.

258
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,540
Don't you want to put me to sleep?

259
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,060
Get the hip, hand me.

260
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,840
You're gonna do much better

261
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,920
if you're gonna dance with me tonight.

262
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,320
You're gonna hurt your jet lag

263
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,220
if you're gonna dance with me tonight.

264
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,180
I don't think they're ready for that jelly for no more.

265
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,240
I don't think they're ready for that jelly for no more.

266
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,920
I don't think they're ready for that jelly.

267
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,300
Me, I'm Taylor, Michelle, and Kelly.

268
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,800
It's time for take off.

269
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,620
I'm ready for this jelly.

270
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,500
I'm ready for this jelly.

271
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,820
I don't think you're ready for this jelly

272
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,200
My body too foodie, this just for you, baby

273
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,960
I don't think you're ready for this jelly

274
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,100
I don't think you're ready for this jelly

275
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,060
I don't think you're ready for this jelly

276
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,720
My body too foodie, this just for you, baby

277
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,480
Oh, I'm telling you, what a chance

278
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,660
When I walk with my hips just like boys in a dress

279
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,780
I'm hoping you can handle all this joy that I have

280
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,620
Now let's have a run while we shake it off

281
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,940
I'm about to break you out

282
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Every time I'm going home

283
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,300
From my hips to my thighs

284
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,400
To my hips to my eyes

285
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,080
Looking hot to hot to hot to hot

286
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,760
Telling you who the light

287
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,940
I'm from the hood, let go of my shoulder

288
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,960
I love you, kid, can you handle, handle this?

289
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,360
Gotta do much better

290
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,380
Don't dance with me tonight

291
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,620
Gotta work your chest

292
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,660
Don't dance with me tonight

293
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,780
It's got the music in the Burger King bathroom

294
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,600
If you like what you see

295
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,500
Don't go fool with the hang with me

296
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,640
Bottomless, I got you too, so forget me

297
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,240
See, girl, it's time for takeoff

298
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,200
It's got the music in the Burger King bathroom

299
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,060
Give it up, this jelly

300
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,100
We had two bags of grass

301
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,300
Seventy-five pellets of mescaline

302
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,720
Five sheets of high-powered flora acid

303
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,520
For salt, sugar, and for cocaine

304
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,700
And you know the whole galaxy

305
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,060
We had bumpers, downers, screamers, whackers

306
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,300
We were bound to get one line of law

307
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,260
We got two dozen tables

308
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,940
And once you get locked into a serious drug collection

309
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,120
The tendency is to push you this far as you can

310
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,720
Bumpers, downers, screamers, whackers

311
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,380
Bumpers, downers, screamers, whackers

312
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,380


313
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,380


314
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,380


315
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,360
Somebody better warn you

316
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,320
Break the shunning, kill the twiddling, do it on

317
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,440
Blocking this pot like California

318
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,120
Bumpers, downers, screamers, whackers

319
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,300
Bumpers, downers, screamers, whackers

320
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,460
Make your No. 2 side last

321
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:41,100
Oh, I know all about those screamers

322
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:48,660
and laughers. That was the Evolution Control Committee live at X-Day 14, Wisteria Campground,

323
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:56,060
Ohio. It was really fun to watch and videotape Trademark Gunderson at work doing these mashups

324
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:03,100
live because he has his interocitor hooked up to a big screen so that the audience can see his

325
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:09,660
virtual desktop as he moves these loop tracks around on it. He's not just playing a CD,

326
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,120
and it's also fun to watch Princess Frilly Pants go-go dance and lead the crowd.

327
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:26,740
You can get it all, including their new album, at www.evolution-control.com.

328
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,900
I will try to get a YouTube of them up on my RevStang account.

329
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,820
Not finishing up the X-Day videos is one of my greatest sins.

330
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,520
Speaking of sins, we're doing something wrong, boys.

331
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,480
And what is that?

332
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:50,180
Over there, there's only about four guys and about 20 pretty girls.

333
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,100
Why don't you go and join them, Stang? It would be amusing to see them rise like a flock of

334
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,220
pigeons and come over here. No, I'm just kidding. You should go there. It would obviously ease

335
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:07,420
yourself to go over and give them a familial greeting from their pastor and friend.

336
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,640
Precursory glance reveals that they're all...

337
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,240
All gathered around bald men. Women like bald...

338
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,640
One in particular, Dr. Legume and his magnetic personality.

339
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,600
See, women like the men without hair. We don't learn this until it's too late in life.

340
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,540
By the time we figure it out, it's just not the same.

341
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,040
That explains a lot.

342
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,020
Yeah. They're just regiled. They're all staring straight at the scalp, I can tell from here.

343
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Hmm. Well, of course, that's why the scalp is such an important prize to be taken,

344
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,640
by the way.

345
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,480
Native American warriors.

346
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,360
And yet, just beneath that little flap of skin lies the most important subgenius organ,

347
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,920
second only to the other most important subgenius organ.

348
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,460
What lies within that pulsing mass of gray matter?

349
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,760
What, the solid bone, you mean?

350
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,660
You got a bone up there?

351
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,340
The human Pachycephalosaurus. It's a solid mass of bone.

352
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,460
Yeah, if you...

353
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,500
If you were to X-ray J.R. Bob Dobbs' head, you would find that it was solid all the way through.

354
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,020
Almost solid. There is a small brain in there, but it needs protection from this bony layer.

355
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,340
Like the mighty Stegosaurus. He has a secondary brain at his hip bones.

356
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm afraid that's a myth.

357
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,260
I know. I know that is.

358
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:37,040
What this is is a large glycogen body. It does help move the hind legs, though. The front end is somewhat forgetful.

359
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,320
Future subgeniuses.

360
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,580
Future subgeniuses will have to cut through that bone, remove it, and replace it with a slightly larger piece of plexiglass.

361
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,780
Yeah, they'll wear out a couple bone saws if the conspiracy ever gets their hands on Bob, but that will never happen.

362
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:58,780
It is then and only then will the hats come back into fashion so that when we tip our hat to a lady, they'll actually be able to see the size of your brain.

363
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,400
Well, you can put a clear dome over there so you can look in and see the brain.

364
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,780
And the brain is not that impressive to look at.

365
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,060
We have to take knowledge before.

366
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,120
And certainly if you've ever touched...

367
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,920
Or touched it or felt it, it's very unimpressive.

368
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,880
We could have done this years earlier, but the fact is...

369
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,840
It doesn't have a solid, meaty feel. It's like a meringue or something.

370
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,760
It's the little LED lights that make this really possible.

371
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:27,140
Because now, along the chrome edge of the plexiglass, the LEDs will light up the brain, so you'll be able to appreciate the...

372
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,300
I guess that's what was happening with Brainiac, Superman's... one of Superman's many enemies.

373
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,580
You remember him? He was a robot made to look just like a human, but the aliens who made him...

374
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:44,280
just left this little part sticking out, these little lights around the outside of his head or studs that stick out.

375
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:52,080
You'd think with all their skill, be able to make a human being a very marvelously contrived thing, they wouldn't have to have anything stick out.

376
00:20:52,260 --> 00:21:02,240
But these little lights that Reverend Papa Joe Mama discusses will be a badge of status and honor in the unthinkable wonder world of tomorrow.

377
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,460
Of course, it kind of makes you wonder just how smart Brainiac was if he was trying to blend in.

378
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,420
Why didn't he wear a hat?

379
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:14,400
He had delusions of grandeur. You know, that also distinguishes these supervillains.

380
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,360
They have to stand out in some way.

381
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,500
I think they just want to blend in.

382
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,540
Now, take Superman. Superman is an alien pretending to be a human.

383
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,240
All these other guys are humans, and then they transform into the super guy.

384
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,980
Batman is really Bruce Wayne.

385
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,560
But Clark Kent is Superman.

386
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,820
Superman is not really Clark Kent.

387
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,600
Clark Kent is the fiction, and Superman is the reality.

388
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,820
And you know, folks, we've been over this before, but he's not even human.

389
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,160
Sex with Lois Lane or any other babe with the initials LL would be bestiality.

390
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,940
He's shaped like a human because of a phenomenon we call convergent evolution.

391
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,060
And if the sperm of a Kryptonian were to escape,

392
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:12,420
it would also have super powers, be able to fly and transect normal speed.

393
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,580
And if Clark Kent, so-called, had a nocturnal emission,

394
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,680
the whole vicinity and environs of Smallville would be illuminated by the purplish glow of Cherenkov radiation

395
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,560
as these super sperms flew about.

396
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,740
And where would they be going?

397
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:35,940
To the house of Lena Lang or whatever teenage babe they fancied.

398
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,860
Lisa Lefkart.

399
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,960
Yes, any with LL that allows you to be the mate of a superior being.

400
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:49,240
But, of course, in the normal course of things, as we know from our sex education lectures,

401
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,480
the conception of a human occurs as a sort of gangbang

402
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,220
where all these spermatozons try to be accepted by the egg.

403
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,060
And they all cluster in, but only one is accepted.

404
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,580
The membrane then keeps the others out.

405
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,920
But with these super pensozoins, you have very young spermatozoans and the other spermatozoans is already dead.

406
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,520
super sperms, there'd be no contest. They'd all pile in there, you know, and there would be no

407
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:19,320
generation, which is perhaps a good thing since if such a cross-fertilization were to occur,

408
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,340
the resulting offspring might kick its way out of the womb or do something even worse with its

409
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,700
developing x-ray vision. So you wonder why none of this ever happened. Well, that's also part of the

410
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:40,320
bothersome aspect of Superman. He also has super self-control. He doesn't get to have an orgasm on

411
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,120
his own or let himself go. No, and when he punches a bad guy, he's pulling his punch 10,000 times.

412
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,160
When his punch could send a planet out of orbit, he's barely nudging the guy, and he's causing

413
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:59,860
multiple jaw fractures, loss of teeth, broken collarbone, all these problems just by barely

414
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,260
tapping them. Where is the satisfaction?

415
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:09,480
Where is the full-blooded enjoyment? That doesn't come with the superhero. That comes with the

416
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:17,260
supervillain who gloats with pleasure over what he does. And usually has a cute girlfriend.

417
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,700
Yes, in some fetching costume, too. Maybe Superman is just not out yet, and he's trying to, you know,

418
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,720
give all appearances that he's straight and hanging out with these gals, but he never really

419
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,440
consummates it. It could be that Superman is in an undeveloped or immature

420
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,680
situation.

421
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:42,620
We don't know how long a Kryptonian lives. His nads may not even have developed in the natural course of things.

422
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,360
And under our yellow sun, they may develop in an abnormal fashion. Who needs red kryptonite?

423
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,000
But these are abstruse matters of theology, which probably don't interest most of our audience.

424
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,100
It's also possible...

425
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,060
I don't know. Actually, this is my favorite part of the whole show so far.

426
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,680
They may not actually give a normal childbirth.

427
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,200
They may not actually give a normal childbirth on planet Krypton. They may have to do test-tube babies.

428
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,700
They may decant them out of bottles. You know, there's such a thing as being too scientifically advanced.

429
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,160
It would explain a lot of things.

430
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,900
Well, you know, how can they come? They can only send one baby.

431
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,120
Actually, a lot of Kryptonians survived the catastrophe.

432
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,880
Yeah, what about Supergirl?

433
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,580
The bottled city of Kandor, or Supergirl's hometown, which was blasted out as one...

434
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,080
Is she related to Superman?

435
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,040
Distantly, yes, but close enough so that they can't have sex either.

436
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:48,800
However, he could shrink down and go into the bottled city of Kandor for R&R, and maybe that's what he does.

437
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,860
Did they come to bodily harm?

438
00:25:51,080 --> 00:26:02,280
Well, it would if someone blundered and smashed the bottled city of Kandor, as in one so-called imaginary story where the Superman bizarro did just that.

439
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,760
Or actually startled Superman so that he broke the bottled city of Kandor.

440
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,360
I always wondered how they got those ships in that bottle.

441
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
It was, you know, the skyscrapers and everything.

442
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,600
They just shrink them down.

443
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,120
But there were a turn deposit for the bottle of Kandor once it was used up.

444
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:24,520
There will be one day, but it's Kryptonian, and probably if the entire Earth blew up, that would be floating among the detritus.

445
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,740
Don't tell Brady, eh?

446
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,060
Oh, we got one more?

447
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,800
And who is a Misfits fan?

448
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,720
Me.

449
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,420
Okay.

450
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,100
I am.

451
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,360
Because?

452
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,140
Because?

453
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,500
Well, I got something to say.

454
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:45,320
I killed your baby today, but it doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead.

455
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,400
Well, I got something to say.

456
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:01,200
I raped your mother today, but it doesn't matter much to me as long as she's dead.

457
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:31,180
I had the salted meat, I had the

458
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,720
I got something to say

459
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,140
I raped your mother today

460
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,940
But it doesn't matter much to me

461
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,460
As long as she's spread

462
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,820
Sweet lovely death

463
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,140
I'm waiting for your breath

464
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,240
Come sweet death

465
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,560
One last caress

466
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,680
One last caress

467
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,440
Sweet death

468
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,420
One last caress

469
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,160
Sweet death

470
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,060
Oh

471
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,960
Oh

472
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:04,500
Oh

473
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:04,860
Oh

474
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,780
Oh

475
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,740
Oh

476
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,420
Oh

477
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,560
You're up for buddy day

478
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,880
The Duke of Uke

479
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,080
Live at 14X Day

480
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,580
Accompanied in this case

481
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,060
By

482
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,220
By

483
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,420
By

484
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:28,520
By

485
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,240


486
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,660
By

487
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:29,700
By

488
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,700


489
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,700


490
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,700


491
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,700


492
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,700


493
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,700


494
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,700


495
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,700


496
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,700


497
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,860
I recently had to admit to the Duke

498
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,680
That I'm so ignorant of pop music

499
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,760
That usually his versions of tunes

500
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,940
Including that one

501
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,660
Are the only versions I've ever heard

502
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,080
Only when he does real oldies

503
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,680
Like Anarchy in the UK

504
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,500
Do I actually get it

505
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,400
I quit hearing pop radio

506
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
When my kids learned to drive

507
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,100
And the big hit song then

508
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,360
Was called, I think, something like

509
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,400
Can't find the butter man

510
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:06,380
Duke of Uke, by the way, is at duke-of-uke.com

511
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:11,800
Before that, Papa Joe Mama, Dr. Howland, you are truly at the Wisteria Cafe stage.

512
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,080
Next up, and also heard in the background on these credits,

513
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,240
Boron Nuzzle, live at X-Day.

514
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,120
I might get a remix of this next week.

515
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,100
It'll make me wish I hadn't used this soundboard version, but it sounds good to me.

516
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,360
Of course, I need a hearing aid.

517
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Boron Nuzzle is not just on Mars, as heard below, but also on Facebook,

518
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:43,060
and their name is spelled Boron, one R, Nuzzle, not nozzle.

519
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,900
We are...

520
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,240
tuning in our receivers now to receive the year 2037.

521
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,180
We have triangulated on the planet Mars.

522
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:16,800
We're receiving the last known transmission from the ill-fated Argo.

523
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,500
Terraforming mission to turn the red planet blue.

524
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,320
Here is what we received.

525
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,600
We received a warning that the planet is under attack.

526
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:35,600


527
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:35,600


528
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:35,600


529
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,520
I'm not sure how much of this will get back to Earth.

530
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,360
Maybe none of it.

531
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,920
The equipment is in really rough shape.

532
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,060
Still, I feel like I have to try to explain so people back home will know what happened.

533
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,140
We had just sent down the last automated equipment.

534
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,420
Seems funny, doesn't it?

535
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,220
The robotic components will set the terraforming machinery into motion.

536
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,240
The farms will start their work.

537
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,380
Food growing on Mars for people who will never be able to get back home.

538
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,380


539
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,380


540
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,380


541
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,380


542
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,380


543
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,140
there to eat it. It will get harvested and then rot in the retrieval bins. Well, at least

544
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,380
until the next group of astronauts make it here. I can't remember how long the terraforming

545
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,220
equipment can run without human intervention, but I imagine it will be long enough for the

546
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,680
next mission to find it in good working order. Water in blue skies, here we come. Wish I

547
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:23,900
could be here to see it. We never knew what exactly hit the ship. Like I said, the last

548
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,060
payload was deployed, and we were prepping the lander to make our descent. All I know

549
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:35,380
is it had to be a billion to one that it would happen at all. Something hit us! It was that

550
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,820
fucking simple! I saw Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Watson sucked into the black without suits!

551
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,060
They had it easy! Beverly actually clawed at my faceplate in her last few seconds as

552
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:53,600
her capillaries froze! I saw them all! They're all dead!

553
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,040
I'm the only one alive up here! I was just coming back in from an exterior shipwrap!

554
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,340
It doesn't matter! They're all dead! I hadn't removed my helmet when the hull was breached!

555
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,680
The atmosphere was sucked out! There probably isn't much air left in this suit, but even

556
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,680
if I had a lifetime of air, it wouldn't matter. The ship's orbit is degrading quickly! I'll

557
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,380
be burned up on entry! My ashes will rain down on Mars!

558
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,720
I love you, Mom and Dad! I'm sorry I won't be coming home! Thank you for all you gave

559
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:23,880
me!

560
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,180
For raising me! For singing me goodnight when I was a kid! Remember the itsy bitsy

561
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:35,760
spider? He climbed up the water spout! Down came the rain and washed the spider out! We

562
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,480
were the spiders! And an asteroid was the fucking rain!

563
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:02,800
What's next is an absolutely sweet acapella piece, I believe, by one of the most sweet

564
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:11,780
and seemingly, seemingly innocent women in the church. So without further ado, I would

565
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:17,000
like to introduce to you with a special song she wrote just for you, Popus Pantiera.

566
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,400
Woo!

567
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,400
Huh?

568
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,520
I got it.

569
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,400
I got it.

570
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,080
Yeah.

571
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,740
Thank you, Pisces. And after that really energetic song, I want to bring you back down

572
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,260
just a little bit. I want to remind everybody that the Pleasure Saucers are going to be

573
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:43,700
here in two fucking days. I can't count. And of course, the pleasure is the first priority,

574
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:52,140
but the second priority is to destroy the fucking planet! Destroy the planet and everyone

575
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,860
in it.

576
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,540
Woo!

577
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,760
Yay!

578
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,340
I love the feeling!

579
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,420
Bring it on!

580
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,840
The rhyme I was

581
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:23,520
going to give to you is called, when you rage upon the pink, doesn't mean you're not happy,

582
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:23,520


583
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:23,520


584
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:23,520


585
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:23,520


586
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:23,520


587
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:36,400
matter what you think, anything your heart desires will come to you. If you make those

588
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:51,980
pink boys scream, no punishment is too extreme. When you rage upon a pink as yeti do, Bob

589
00:34:51,980 --> 00:35:08,780
is kind. He gives to those who hate a chance to masturbate to their secret longing. Look

590
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:21,960
for spaceships in the sky. Blood will rain and they will die. When you rage upon a pink

591
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,940
your dreams come true.

592
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,060
Holy fucking shit. What the hell?

593
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:51,620
And you can see Popas Pantiera Ivakovich with her shirt off at the 14X Day

594
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,740
photo pages at subgenius.com. Actually, there's some good Bunny Day cleavage there too, not

595
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:05,780
to mention Susie the floozy and many others. Anyway, it's not all good looking women at

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:18,020

00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,100
a sideshow marvel who has nailed screwdrivers.

I saw you looking me up and down

Then I saw you looking all around

616
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,860
That cool guy at the bar, his name is Jim

617
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,440
But he's got good taste so you ain't leaving with him

618
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,840
You need a guy gonna make you feel good

619
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,140
Not dwell upon your faults like the other guys would

620
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,700
Like your green teeth and your knobby ass knees

621
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,120
What you really need is a fella like me

622
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,600
Cause I got low standards

623
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,000
I got low standards

624
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,380
I got low standards

625
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,020
So why don't you get with me

626
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,260
Now you might think that I'm very refined

627
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,760
But I'm just looking for a kind of good time

628
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,180
So what if you're bald?

629
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,520
If it's too nice, I'm not that guy

630
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,220
I'll just dim the lights a bit

Don't bother me, I got some of my own

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,760
I got low standards

637
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,140
So why don't you get with me?

638
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,840
You got a list with every letter but N

639
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,280
You say who and I say when

640
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,620
You say most of you is starting to sag

641
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,000
I say grab that colostomy bag

642
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,280
And get into my car

643
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,400
It's a piece of crap

644
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,660
I just toss a bird's-gig

645
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,780
The trapper's right in the back

646
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,140
And we'll head off to your place or mine

647
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,420
Or just find the parking lot

648
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,680
Shit, that'll be fine

649
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,120

652
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,300
So why don't you get with me?

653

Why don't you get with me?

654
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,860
Why don't you get with me?

655
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,660
Oh, wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit

656
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,220
I forgot the last verse

657
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,980
I chalk it up to a poor choice of words

658
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,380
When you say that the Holocaust never occurred

659
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,040
You think stem cells are part of your phone

660
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,840
And that bathing is for those too cheap for cologne

661
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,620
Well, I got a can of spray here to cover the smell

662
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,780
And earplugs cause your voice is grating as hell

663
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,080
Be sure to wear a mask when you go to the bathroom

664
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,740
Besides, the things you say, you must be out of your mind

665
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,980
You make the guests on Springer look like fucking Einstein

666
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,340
But I don't mind

667
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,480
Cause I got low standards

668
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,800
I got low standards

669
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,280
I got low standards

670
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,380
Why don't you get with me?

671

00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,360
I got low standards

674
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,300
So why don't you get with me?

675
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,300
Why don't you get with me?

676
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,120
Why don't you get with me?

00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,760
Why don't you get with me?

Why don't you get with me?

679
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,560
Why don't you get with me?

680
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,200
Why don't you get with me?

681
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,180
Why don't you get with me?

682
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,300
Why don't you get with me?

683
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,860
Why don't you get with me?

684
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,560
Why don't you get with me?

685
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,760
Why don't you get with me?

686
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,020
Why don't you get with me?

honor of officiating at their wedding many years ago at a church in Pittsburgh.

688
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:24,160
Next, the first of some descriptions of getting to X-Day at Wisteria.

689
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:30,040
Soon we'll play the hilarious testimony of Dr. Zeronius and Reverend Milquetoast, but

690
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:37,900
for now, because this one has less cussing, we'll hear Dr. Sinister's description from

691
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:43,660
his show Radio Synesthesia, which happens to follow Hour of Slack on Sunday nights on

692
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,060
WCSB Cleveland.

693
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,460
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland

694
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,760
State University or anyone associated with them or anybody with their head screwed on

695
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,260
straight or their sanity half intact, or these might not even be the views and opinions of

696
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,360
those expressing them.

697
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,800
You just don't know.

698
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,880
What it is.

699
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:07,880


700
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,180
What it is that's going on here.

701
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,740
I might be the last person to know myself, and in theory, I'm here sitting at the controls,

702
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,220
but I haven't a clue what I'm doing.

703
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
I'm Dr. Sinister, and I'm not a real doctor.

704
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,500
I just play what on the radio.

705
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,480
The name of the program is Synesthesia.

706
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,600
I'm going to talk a little bit about my adventures in Southern Ohio.

707
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,680
I had an awful time getting to X-Day.

708
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,460
This was...

709
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,700
And you know, I can't put...

710
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,320
I can't put any kind of blame on Reverend Stang for this.

711
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:48,360
It's, you know, Wisteria is a very interesting venue for a festival.

712
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,200
It's a very interesting venue.

713
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:59,480
It's in this little corner of Southern Ohio off a state route that forms a triangle of

714
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,020
state routes, but you would not guess that these were state highways.

715
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,360
I mean, the roads were well maintained.

716
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,880
You know, they appear to have been freshly paved within the last couple of days.

717
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,740
It's interesting because the speed limit is 55 on these roads.

718
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,740
Periodically, you see these signs saying, warning, curve ahead, you know,

719
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,680
the little curved arrow on the yellow diamond sign, you know, that kind of thing.

720
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,880
And frankly, I don't know why they even bother with those signs,

721
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,760
because really, the road is just one curve after another.

722
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,920
And the speed limit's 55, and they say, hey, there's a curve up ahead.

723
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,200
You might want to slow down to 30.

724
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,880
I take turns in the city fast and tight all the time.

725
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,280
I consider myself a pretty good driver.

726
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:56,380
But I found myself slowing to a crawl with these curbs and these roads in Southern Ohio.

727
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,800
Meigs County, Meigs County, Meigs County.

728
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,000
I don't know how you pronounce it.

729
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,000
I read about it in High Times many years ago.

730
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,420
I'm not kidding.

731
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,260
First time I ever heard of that county.

732
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,860
Was in High Times.

733
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,140
High Times has a reputation for growing spectacular wild ganja.

734
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,640
And there certainly is a lot of wilderness where someone might, you know, grow something there.

735
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,120
So these roads were twisting and turning.

736
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,900
And of course, I really wanted to get there before dark.

737
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,620
I really wanted to get there before dark.

738
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,300
My intention was to go there on Friday.

739
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,760
Really, really, really wanted to get down there before dark.

740
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:37,620
Well, you know, it got to be dark sometime, sometime, you know, down.

741
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,160
And by the time I got down to, you know, Guernsey County or something like that on I-77.

742
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,120
And I got lost in West Virginia for a time.

743
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
Man, you don't want to get lost in West Virginia.

744
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,980
Actually, the proper name of the state is West Bagad, Virginia.

745
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,740
That's the proper name of the state.

746
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,600
Now, I don't want to insult that state because, you know, I have ancestors from that part of the country.

747
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,780
I got some hillbilly blood in me.

748
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,220
I do.

749
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,760
But I ended up in Parkersburg, downtown Parkersburg, like 10 p.m.

750
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,080
or so.

751
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:13,680
And let me tell you, man, downtown Parkersburg, West Virginia, there's nothing but strip clubs there.

752
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:21,040
It looked like a great place to buy meth and get a lap dance from someone with no teeth.

753
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,520
That's that's what it looked like.

754
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:30,660
I'm not sure how long Dr. Sinister would last down in Stang County, Texas, where my family lives.

755
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,760
Anyway, up next is a relatively new subgenius ranter.

756
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,680
Our latest superstar, you might say, because he's young.

757
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,820
And handsome and hides the more sub part of his subgenius ism.

758
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,340
Well, he's become the new co bulldada auctioneer with Dr.

759
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,820
Howl at X Day Drills.

760
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,340
And I had no idea he was also a singer until he suddenly appeared on stage doing this.

761
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:01,500
We've been having a lot of drama over the inter lately, but people seem to forget that the Internet is just made of people.

762
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,060
Mostly pinks.

763
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,620
But, you know, some of us are on there.

764
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,700
Um, quite a few of us.

765
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,240
We're on there more than we should be.

766
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,320
And we tend to forget that all these perversions and all these assholes and everything were there the whole time.

767
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,540
It's just made it easier to communicate.

768
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,840
This is a little song about that.

769
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:31,360
You think of yourself as a regular person, although lately it seems as though someone's put a curse on you.

770
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:36,880
Become a cesspah CP and music of Rick Astley.

771
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,480
You find yourself seeking the attention of strangers.

772
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,320
You don't want to leave your home or crave a sense of danger.

773
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,060
You might not know what to do.

774
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,620
Well, have I got news for you.

775
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,880
You can do it on the Internet and it's okay.

776
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,140
Nobody's really watching you anyway.

777
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,600
Just the FBI and the CIA.

778
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,500
Hey.

779
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,420
You'd be surprised what you can do with anonymity.

780
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,120
Shop for railing from a girlfriend to a new TV.

781
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,160
You're a 50 year old man.

782
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,960
But to all your friends, you're a swimsuit model named Roxanne.

783
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,080
There's a wealth of information at your fingertips.

784
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,440
Like what a 12 year old thinks of Russian politics.

785
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,940
You'll find experts with plenty of clout.

786
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,860
And if you're lucky, they might not know.

787
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,160
What they're talking about.

788
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,840
But the Internet might seem like a scary place.

789
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,280
When you're a picture of innocence.

790
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,700
You haven't even seen your first tits.

791
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,300
But you've always dreamed of it.

792
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,900
Well you can see them on the Internet with no problem.

793
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,140
Every size and shape and color.

794
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,020
We got loads of them.

795
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,120
A word to the wise.

796
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:05,800
What you've seen.

797
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,840
You won't be able to see.

798
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,040
You won't be able to erase from your eyes.

799
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,180
Oh, R-O-F-L-G-T-F-O-L-R-A.

800
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,080
If you understood any of that, it's far too late.

801
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,920
Your girlfriend is about to give birth.

802
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,680
Oh honey, give me a sectary for slash dot first.

803
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,320
Oh Faraday cages and tip oil hats.

804
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Tape some bacon to your cats.

805
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,280
Here's your fist.

806
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,180
Fifteen minutes.

807
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,680
Oh come and get it.

808
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,420
Oh you shouldn't have posted those pictures on 4chan.

809
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,060
You're being taken away by the party van.

810
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,620
This may be the best it gets.

811
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,360
Hope you leave with no regrets.

812
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,220
It's probably best just to forget.

813
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,240
Welcome to the Internet.

814
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:18,060
You know there are rumors and always have been of special substances which are not subjected to age.

815
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:25,260
The famous gateway over the entrance of hell, for example, is made out of some kind of eternium.

816
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:32,380
Only those elements time cannot wear were made before me and beyond time I stand.

817
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,820
And in the same way the bodies of angels and demons are made before me.

818
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:36,820


819
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,620
I am an animal made of eternal stuff.

820
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,600
An animal like that would be stick-sit up your ass.

821
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,740
It could happen.

822
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,640
What does that sign?

823
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:51,600
But it's actually a privilege to be temporary and not have the responsibility of an eternal existence in one particular shape or form.

824
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,820
Remind us, Dr. Howell, what does that sign above hell actually say?

825
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,060
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

826
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,420
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

827
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,000
Lasciati ogni speranza voci in frate.

828
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,520
Yeah, it was in Latin I was looking for.

829
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,300
It's Italian.

830
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,900
It's Italian.

831
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:13,560
Dante didn't write in Latin and that's why his work was considered low-class trash.

832
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,900
It wasn't written in Latin that educated people spoke.

833
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,260
It was written in Italian, some kind of pig language that was spoken by people.

834
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:29,140
And only after years and years did it gain the luster of some sort of musty classic.

835
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,580
But it's actually quite a spicy read if you follow it.

836
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,140
What was wrong with him?

837
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,560
There was nothing the matter.

838
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,360
He simply had lost his way, confused in a wood.

839
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:49,480
Another poet who was responsible for pig Latin of sorts would have been Geoffrey Chaucer who refused to write the Canterbury Tales in French.

840
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,320
And instead he wrote it in the pig English.

841
00:49:52,680 --> 00:50:03,820
He wrote it in fine, vigorous 14th century English, which he got to help because of the permanency of language.

842
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:15,120
The success of that treatise of all the tales in the Canterbury Tales led to the English language being written for the first time in novels being written.

843
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,640
Or not novels, but stories.

844
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,440
Well, stories.

845
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,580
There had been such stories before.

846
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,720
I know we have an urgent question from the audience, Papa Joe, if I may interrupt you briefly.

847
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,680
And what is that?

848
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,900
What is the definition of New Guinea?

849
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,800
Why, it's a land far from here where they don't get to have a lot of people.

850
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:33,800


851
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:33,800


852
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,000
They don't have X day the way we do.

853
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,980
No, it's an Italian baptism.

854
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,740
Well, as you wish.

855
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,400
Our baptismal ceremony is superior.

856
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,800
You will find that out.

857
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,640
More New Yorkers are working here today.

858
00:50:47,000 --> 00:51:03,780
A live bit of slack there from Dr. Hal and Papa Joe Mama being tormented by perennial Bobby Award winning heckler Dr. Dar, who not only heckles ponderfully, but also provides the bull dotted drive-in.

859
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,300
Show at every X day drill.

860
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:11,260
Incidentally, you're listening to the hour of slack from the Church of the subgenius.

861
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:21,100
More information about all of that and our books and links to our guests websites can be found at subgenius.com.

862
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:31,560
And now we close with a classic bit of Fat Man D and her amazing pipes, a song with a story behind it.

863
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,760
Ladies and gentlemen,

864
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,260
I think we have a little time left.

865
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:48,100
I know we've got a bunch of other performers tonight, and I'm really excited about every single one of them, especially Andrew the Impale and his new drummer and my good friend Trademark and his beautiful lady.

866
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,220
I'm so excited.

867
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,360
The evolutionary fucking control committee came back to the Midwest.

868
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,660
Fuck.

869
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,100
Yeah.

870
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,200
Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast.

871
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,320
Sorry, I got excited.

872
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,300
Don't.

873
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:09,720
I haven't seen you since we shared Indian tacos on Highway 47.

874
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,060
Those were some fucking delicious Indian tacos.

875
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,460
Fry bread, ground beef.

876
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,760
The Indianist.

877
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,100
Oh, man.

878
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,960
So I'm going to plug this in.

879
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:31,660
I met Trademark here out of this little wing ding in the desert.

880
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,060
It's called the Burning Man.

881
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:53,340
I learned today that the act that went on before me, the adorable and unquenchable DJ Shaver, he and I were at Burning Man in 96, and how we did not end up fucking in the camera obscura, I will never know.

882
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:01,580
We must have been just like one little bald fat girl and one tripped out dude from Massachusetts passing in the night.

883
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:11,200
So anyhow, he asked me if I had ever been in one of the operas put on by Pepe Ozan in the desert who used to do these ridiculous things.

884
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:20,500
He would build mountainous sculptures out of clay that he harvested from the nearby hot springs, and he would fill them, these hollow sculptures, with fire.

885
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:26,440
And they had bridges and spires and copolas and all kinds of ridiculous shit.

886
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,560
And teeming casts of naked hundreds and hundreds.

887
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:31,560


888
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,260
And hundreds of people doing the most debaucherous things.

889
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,320
And they would sing songs like,

890
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,580
Devil tonight, fire delight.

891
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,000
We would always make fun of him going,

892
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,900
I'm so hungry, chicken delight.

893
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,700
Anyhow, he didn't like that.

894
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:55,420
Anyhow, in following years I begged him, Pepe, please let me be in your opera.

895
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,140
I really want to be in one of your operas.

896
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,700
I even took a ride with my cello strapped to my back,

897
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,220
on the back of a Harley Davidson.

898
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,080
My friend Flynn Mouthy drove me across the playa to go find him.

899
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,680
And I said, please, you know, let me do a little something.

900
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,960
It doesn't have to be Mike.

901
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:11,860
No one has to know.

902
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,200
I just want to be part of it.

903
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,980
And he said, you know, I think we have very good singers from Europe,

904
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,160
and I don't think we will be needing you, but I appreciate your interest.

905
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,000
So anyhow, I wrote him a little song.

906
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,480
And I sang it for him once out there.

907
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,020
The Burning Man in his trailer.

908
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,420
I sang it to him.

909
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,160
It was before I had a backing track or a band to play it.

910
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,160
And he said, this song, it is making a little fun of me, yes?

911
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
And I said, how can you say that?

912
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,920
I love you, fucker.

913
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,620
I just wanted to be one of the reindeer games.

914
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,960
So anyhow, this is his song.

915
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,700
It's called Pepe.

916
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,960
I'm sure you all have a little Pepe in your life.

917
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,880
And for that, I am...

918
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,620
equally happy and sorry for you simultaneously.

919
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,060
Pepe.

920
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,440
Ooh.

921
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,120
Ooh.

922
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,100
Pepe.

923
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:46,780
Ooh.

924
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,240
Ooh.

925
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,840
He ain't no gypsy yet.

926
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,460
He ain't no Jew yet.

927
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:00,480


928
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:06,200
He ain't no gypsy and I know he's not a Jew.

929
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,740
But he's my Pepe.

930
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,600
And he's better than you.

931
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,660
If you should see him, don't run away.

932
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,940
If you should see him, you must not run.

933
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,860
Run away.

934
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,440
If you should see him, be sure to praise him.

935
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,600
He.

936
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,960
He.

937
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,200
He's Pepe.

938
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:56,000
Lord, he's Pepe.

939
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,800
Yes, he is my Pepe.

940
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,360
You know he's my Pepe.

941
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,700
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepe too?

942
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,740
But if you were Pepe,

943
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,740
what would you do?

944
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,880
Take it away, Coral Chinador on the saxophone.

945
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,380
He couldn't be with us here tonight

946
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,600
because he actually plays with the Goo Goo Dolls now

947
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,820
and they pay him better than I ever did.

948
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,860
But we can enjoy his music.

949
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,380
He's Pepe.

950
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:43,580
He's Pepe.

951
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,200
He's Pepe.

952
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,580
He's Pepe.

953
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:46,700
He's Pepe.

954
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,460
He's Pepe.

955
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,420
He's Pepe.

956
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,420
He's Pepe.

957
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,580
He's Pepe.

958
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,700
He's Pepe.

959
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:07,700


960
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,760
He ain't no gypsy, yeah.

961
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,460
He ain't no Jew.

962
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:18,220
He ain't no gypsy and I wish he could be a Jew,

963
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,520
but he's my Pepe.

964
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:28,720
And he's better than, my damn it, he's better than you

965
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,920
If you should see him standing right there

966
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:43,000
If you should see him with his long flowing hair

967
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,520
You're blessed with Pepe

968
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:54,400
Because he has no, yes he has no hair

969
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,860
Wouldn't you like to meet a Pepe too?

970
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,500
I don't know that I ever met a Pepe

971
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:15,500


972
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,760
I never felt like a Pepe myself

973
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,580
Fat Mandy at X Day

974
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,520
That was her

975
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,980
Fat is spelled P-H-A-T

976
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:29,020
And Mandy is spelled M-A-N-D-E-E

977
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:33,180
This has been our Slack number 1324

978
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,880
The uncensored version is on our website

979
