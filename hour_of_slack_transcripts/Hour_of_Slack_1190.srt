1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Dear friends, everything you're about to hear is from July and August of 1994.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:16,360
This is a rerun of Hour of Slack number 457, Lonesome Cowboy Dave in space.

3
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,340
Hi everybody, nice to be back with you.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Well, first of all, I bring a personal message to Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the many sacrifices you have made.

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,360
And of course, his congratulations on your discovery, which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.

6
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,360
Listen, Howell.

7
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,980
There's never been a time when you've been so grateful.

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,680
There's never been an instance at all of a computer error occurring in an i-1000 series, has there?

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,460
Of course I have.

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,600
Sorry about this.

11
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,500
I know it's a bit silly.

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,600
Just a moment.

13
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,400
Just a moment.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,720
Yes.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,240
It's puzzling.

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,460
How is old Bob?

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,660
Oh, he's doing good.

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,360
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:43,780
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius of Slack.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,020
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

21
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,700
Uh, yes, for the next 30 minutes of wrecked up equipment and crummy tape.

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:13,960
God, and the, the, the, uh, oh, everything's all messed up already, and we have to do so many shows so quickly.

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,020
And, where's the tape? There it is. Oh, there, yes.

24
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,780
Yes, and, well, but, all things shall pass, they say.

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,880
Oh, listen, you can hear the guard dogs. Listen to that.

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,960
That's the sound of the new subgenius house.

27
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,500
It's scary, isn't it?

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,380
I suppose I should probably go see who's at the door.

29
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,560
Yes, just go see.

30
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,660
Oh, the phone rang twice more since I went to the door.

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,460
Let's see, what's some, some good background music here.

32
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,680
Friends, uh, what an auspicious start.

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm really, really rising to another show.

34
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,460
That was a little old lady at the door.

35
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:11,800
See, I just moved in to a new skyscraper studio here, and, and, uh, there was no one else here but me and the guard dogs.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
And this little old lady was at the door and she said,

37
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,520
Well, now, I live in .. I miss Barry, I live on the house that was on the mountain road there,

38
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:28,560
and we're trying to get speed bumps put in, because people just drive much too fast down that road there,

39
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,960
And, and, you know, she says that he was in the car and we ran it over the fence with it in the first lap.

40
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:36,080
And the fire department says they need it for emergency use, but there aren't that many emergencies.

41
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,720
And I thought, well, lady, you don't live my life.

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,720
I was so charming and sweet.

43
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,560
I'm standing there.

44
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:53,180
I haven't shaved in two days, wearing a Church of Elvis T-shirt, 24-hour Church of Elvis,

45
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,380
with my horrible old gray hair running halfway down my back and everything.

46
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:06,100
And then the phone rings some more, and then it was Palmer, and then it was the editor from New York,

47
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,220
and then it was my agent.

48
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:17,920
And friends, you know, tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty outer space

49
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,760
from day to day to the last tail leader of recorded tapes.

50
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,360
And all our yesterfrops have lightened.

51
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,720
It had subgeniuses the way to bad breath.

52
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,100
Out, out, brief flashlight batteries.

53
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,720
Life is but a walking shadow.

54
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:50,680
A poor pocket pool player who struts and frets his hour of slack upon the airwaves and then is heard no more.

55
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,360
It is a rant yelled by idiots, full of sound and fury.

56
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,180
Signifying Dobbs.

57
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,100
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack, dear friends.

58
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,140
The voice of the Church of the subgenius.

59
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,560
A celebration of peace, love, and understanding.

60
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:21,300
It just happens to take the form of pain, hate, and confusion for this global village of the damned.

61
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,420
Oh, and it's also about slack and Bob, dear friends.

62
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,960
Yes, we mustn't forget those.

63
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,840
Fine things, lest we will be indeed the global village of the damned.

Copyright 1994, Paul Manbridi.

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,480
Yes, friends, this old show, this old show has been through many changes recently.

66
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,200
First, losing the station in Dallas and having to rebuild a down and dirty mini studio here at the home office.

67
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,520
And then we had to move the home office.

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:54,980
Oh, yeah.

69
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,720
The Subgenius Foundation Incorporated and Bulldog.

70
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,200
Dada, Time Control, not to mention everything I personally own in this world.

71
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,860
And that includes a hell of a lot of comic books, friends.

72
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,580
Has all been physically moved to new digs in another part of Dallas.

73
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,020
A new skyscraper.

74
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,520
And friends, it's been hell.

75
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,400
And I don't mean no subgenius hell either.

76
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,360
Oh, that'd be a party.

77
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,800
We're not talking about a single bedroom efficiency with flimsy modern aluminum furniture.

78
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,500
We're talking about countless heavy massive antiques.

79
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,000
Upon which all our flimsy recording equipment is sitting.

80
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,200
Directly behind me as I sit here, seen on screen three,

81
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,980
is a 17-foot wall to ceiling, floor-to-ceiling wall, friends,

82
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,520
of tapes, videos, films, albums, CDs, Cats and Nine Tails.

83
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,960
We've got a new phone number, a new physical address.

84
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,480
Although, market friends, our virtual address, the sacred P.O. box,

85
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,720
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,420
That, my friend, is eternal.

87
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,060
And shall ne'er change while Bob lives.

88
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,080
And while I live.

89
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,780
But anyway, we had to put off producing the show for two weeks.

90
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,740
And I'm just lucky there's so much tape laying around here, screaming and begging to be broadcast.

91
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,880
You can almost hear them there in the background.

92
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,100
But...

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,740
But friends, we're in a new building too.

94
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,720
And you know what that means?

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,040
That means that nothing works.

96
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,620
Because it was made in America by union idiots.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,020
And every single fixture sprang a leak.

98
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,400
Even the electrical ones.

99
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,840
And it was like a Three Stooges comedy brought to life.

100
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,940
I mean, it really was.

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,980
But, you know, they say subgeniuses work best under pressure.

102
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,460
And of course, we always cause that incredible mess.

103
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,500
And we're under terrible pressure to build up by blowing everything off until the last minute.

104
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,700
And then, then, only then, with total disaster breathing down our necks with its hot breath,

105
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,120
we perform magnificently, far beyond mere hume expectations.

106
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,660
It's the fear that amplifies the intelligence, friends.

107
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,200
It's the fight or flight syndrome.

108
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,600
Makes you 20 times smarter than normal.

109
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,100
Unless you're a human.

110
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,600
And then it's just pure panic.

111
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,320
Pure panic.

112
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,960
It's like my daughter's theory about the lucidity of the moment of death.

113
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,520
My little cute 13 year old says that if you know you're about to die,

114
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,920
like the Mack truck is coming straight at you or whatever,

115
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,020
your brain automatically switches into a higher gear than it has ever been in before.

116
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,780
And not only is your whole life replayed in an instant, complete with smells,

117
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,460
but you also realize you suddenly,

118
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,500
for the first time realize the perfect, foolproof, and most of all extremely easy scheme

119
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,280
that would have saved the planet and made you a billionaire instantly.

120
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,200
But along with that, in those last microseconds of life,

121
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,660
comes the frustration of realizing how utterly obvious it should have been to you all along.

122
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,000
How stupid you were not to think of it.

123
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,080
Eh, too late now, though.

124
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,000
And what's worse, as Vreedes pointed out,

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,660
is that if you happen to live through it,

126
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,460
you forget.

127
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,660
Bummer, man.

128
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,000
Anyway, that's the way things are now.

129
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:40,220
No sooner did we move the entire church coffers and all the gear to a new place

130
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,540
and finally unpack and fix the disasters,

131
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,520
than I get a phone call this morning that basically says

132
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,240
that if I don't fly to San Francisco right now to ensure, no matter what,

133
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,000
that the new subgenius book, Revelation X, Final Layout,

134
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,180
will be done in two weeks, then we're cancelled. Period.

135
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,880
The project is cancelled.

136
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,880
That's right, that's how late we were.

137
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,800
So, it's easy, friends.

138
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,300
I just have to drop everything else, spend my life savings getting to the far-off cave

139
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,520
of Paul Mavridis and Hal Robbins,

140
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,360
and help them finish a chapter a day,

141
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,000
and do all the corrections,

142
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,220
and hand-carry the material to the publishers in New York,

143
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,880
that's all, that's all that,

144
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,560
and do the five overdue hour of slack radio shows before I leave!

145
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:38,020
So, this, dear friends, is the ultimate slack of subgenius horror,

146
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,400
or something like that.

147
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,120
It's the hand that dobs Deltas.

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,140
Will we then be jokers?

149
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,560
Or aces?

150
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,220
Or, more likely, just pull a black queen and explode?

151
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,200
Only the next day.

152
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,260
The next 14 days will tell,

153
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,200
so wish me luck in assembling today

154
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,920
two months worth of tapes into five hours of slack

155
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,900
between now and tomorrow, would you?

156
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,060
And send, after that, your prayers

157
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,080
towards the bay

158
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,620
for me and Mavridis and Dr. Howell

159
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,780
to somehow have the energy and brilliance to finish

160
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,820
what we started three long years ago

161
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,600
before the conspiracy pulls the plug,

162
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,720
leaving us with the greatest unpublished book in all history

163
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,540
and a bill for $20,000.

164
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,980
Amen.

165
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,240
Well, I guess...

166
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
First, let's go to outer space, friends,

167
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,420
with lonesome cowboy Dave.

168
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,340
Yeah, I think we'll do that. That hardly takes any editing.

169
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,740
Uh, this was originally broadcast...

170
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:50,920
Whoa!

171
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,720
Man!

172
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,900
They're coming in again.

173
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,480
I can't believe this!

174
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,020
On top of moving, I have to deal with these!

175
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,880
Okay, this coming up was originally broadcast July

176
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,200
on WCSB radio in Cleveland.

177
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,560
Swamp radio, the show of Chaz Smith and lonesome cowboy Dave.

178
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,900
I've been saving this stuff, friends, for just such an occasion.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Praise the God of the universe.

180
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,280
No kind of world for an old man no more.

181
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,240
Well, after this espousal, I can only wonder

182
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,440
what kind of surgery you must have gone under

183
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,680
to get the pipe-like grin and also some of the weird brain fusions.

184
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,740
Well, they tell me I was born...

185
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,540
I'm not a joker, man. I'm an ace.

186
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,940
I want you to understand that.

187
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,320
I can't understand the difference between the cards yet.

188
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
I know I'm trying, but...

189
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm not a joker, man.

190
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm not an ace neither.

191
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,980
It's more like a quagmire I'm lost in.

192
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,540
It's just a splattering of 52 different numbers in the deck

193
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,420
and I can't figure out which one to go with.

194
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,480
I thought I'd like to be a ten of clubs,

195
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,620
but it turned out I was a ten of clubfoot.

196
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,640
Yeah, that'll get you out of Vietnam.

197
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,840
They got me out of Vietnam.

198
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,400
Why did you want to go there?

199
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,400
I didn't want to go. I wanted to get out.

200
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,260
Luckily, my ten clubs of feet did it.

201
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,960
You can get out of Vietnam by having clubfeet?

202
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,860
Yeah, tell them.

203
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,000
They're going to ship you off if you don't.

204
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,160
Just all you got to do is take your shoes off in front of the psychiatrist.

205
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,680
Well, I thought they were going to ship me off to one of those off-planet little spin...

206
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,000
those little spin containers.

207
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,600
Those little tuna fish cans.

208
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,800
Vietnam is slang for Venus.

209
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,780
The capital city, Ritz, right?

210
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,240
Yeah, and Iran is slang for Mars.

211
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,360
We say, oh, we're having a war with Iraq.

212
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,820
What that means is that's North Mars.

213
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,240
North Mars.

214
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,820
Or South Mars.

215
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,060
Well, I thought...

216
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,620
Iran is North Mars.

217
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,600
Vietnam, that was Venus, man.

218
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:10,700
The media tricked you into thinking that we're in this primitive 1990s technology

219
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,780
when actually they're shipping people off.

220
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,600
They're shipping people off all the time.

221
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,020
Well, there's slave colonies on Saturn.

222
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,080
Well, not actually on Saturn.

223
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,640
The gravity there would make you as heavy as Orson Welles.

224
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,200
Well, was the moon landing real?

225
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,020
You know, on the...

226
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,840
Was the moon landing real?

227
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,960
Yeah, in 1945.

228
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,900
You mean Oscar Wilde conquered the moon in 1945 with the Mercury Theater?

229
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,500
Or... no, wait a minute.

230
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,120
No, that was Edward Teller.

231
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,960
Ah, that was...

232
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,040
I thought that was Heinrich Tesla, who was Tesla's brother

233
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,340
and actually came up with the...

234
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,380
Oppenheimer and all those guys all went to the moon.

235
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,320
Oppenheimer went to the moon?

236
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,280
Yeah, they didn't...

237
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,440
You know, then the thing you saw in 1969 was...

238
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,620
That was fake.

239
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,360
You know, that was like they wanted to...

240
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,260
They had run out of funds for their secret space program.

241
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,000
So they said, okay, let's tell them we're going to go to the moon for the first time.

242
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,520
So they made a big deal.

243
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,500
They didn't even really go.

244
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,420
I mean, they already had...

245
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,900
They couldn't have shown that footage on...

246
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,740
There's cities there.

247
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,260
There's cities on the moon?

248
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,600
Well, they're mostly underground.

249
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,560
But you mean you would...

250
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,460
Almost anywhere you go there, you see signs, you know, little smokestacks and stuff.

251
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,320
Can you get a good gyros there?

252
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,220
You know, I heard that some of these places that had been previously inhabited,

253
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,480
that they just keep on repopulating them with new kinds of people.

254
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,260
There's always more where that last one came from.

255
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,900
What's the...

256
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,300
People are considered cockroaches to these...

257
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,220
The owners of these bases.

258
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,020
Well, what do they want the cockroaches to do there other than like bug them

259
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,740
and get on top of the turntable or something?

260
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,700
Well, it's a farm.

261
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,940
It's a farm.

262
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,020
This is all a farm.

263
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,500
The whole solar system is a farm, Dave.

264
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,760
You're part of the...

265
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,380
You're not one of the farmers.

266
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,740
You're one of the spuds or turnips that's being thrown.

267
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,760
How about a new cheese?

268
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,820
But there...

269
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,740
You had once said that these are beings.

270
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,840
These farmers are too hideous to behold,

271
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,820
that their faces are all squares and cockeyed.

272
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,080
They're all at right angles.

273
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,960
And if they were to come into this world and where...

274
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,760
You'd rip your face apart in terror were you to behold one physically.

275
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,920
How do they make their way through the abyss?

276
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,880
Do they just blow themselves in there or do they just like...

277
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,360
Have they always been...

278
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,600
There is no abyss to them.

279
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,420
That is all...

280
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,720
They are in no space.

281
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,420
All things are touching.

282
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,140
They have cosmic consciousness, man.

283
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,840
There's some bad...

284
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,760
All the time.

285
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,040
Mackey-fackies, I guess.

286
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,540
Yeah.

287
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,380
Well...

288
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,100
And...

289
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,680
We can't get away from them?

290
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,060
I mean...

291
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,800
Through Bob, you certainly met them.

292
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:39,800


293
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,060
Hey!

294
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,860
But only through Bob.

295
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,660
Only by...

296
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,260
In fact, not merely through faith or slack in Bob,

297
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,280
but through works.

298
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,840
Money, Dave.

299
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,480
Money.

300
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,000
That $30 is all important.

301
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,940
That makes the difference between those who Bob knows trust him

302
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,020
and those that Bob doesn't even notice.

303
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,940
You can worship him all you want,

304
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,820
but if he doesn't whiff your name on that check,

305
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,000
then you're just another pink boy.

306
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,820
You're no better than the pink.

307
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,140
Now remember, we are a non-profit radio station.

308
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,320
Yeah, but Bob's a non-profit.

309
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,500
I bet you said that a thousand times.

310
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,440
That's the first time.

311
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,980
Well, that was the first time...

312
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,240
It's the first time it ever came up.

313
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,420
Well, I don't know if I feel like giving some...

314
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,920
Again, we come back to, is your soul up?

315
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,300
Is your soul up, dear friends?

316
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,540
Is your soul up?

317
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,260
Or did you sell out?

318
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,700
Have you sold out?

319
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,100
I certainly hope not.

320
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,280
We've done our best to walk that tightrope ourselves.

321
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,920
Well, I just thought I'd take a break here

322
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,200
from the swamp radio there from WCSB,

323
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,640
and just to experience this lovely music

324
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,080
that Nenslo sent us.

325
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,100
A special tape compilation of background music.

326
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,420
Yes, background music that you'll be hearing,

327
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,200
irritatingly, over and over again in the future on these shows.

328
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,240
This particular piece Nenslo calls,

329
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,160
quote,

330
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,080
the master control theme,

331
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,420
parentheses, seriously,

332
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,400
un-parentheses, unquote.

333
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,240
Hmm, let's just listen for a while

334
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,760
before we go back deep into outer space

335
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,600
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, shall we?

336
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,700
Yes.

337
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,800
Specifically for sectarianでした,

338
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,400
this background music lets us

339
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,620
Everyone to breathe, cause God don't think that we got enough folks

340
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,220
Making poop in the river, making poop in the stream

341
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,880
Taking money from the folks, spending it on a fancy poker

342
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:27,260
Oh daddy, oh daddy, oh mammy, oh mammy, oh pappy, oh pappy, oh grammy, oh grammy

343
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,180
Daddy, daddy, mammy, mammy, pappy, pappy, grammy, grammy

344
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,900
Everybody's talking about how sometime there's a Pop Hope special

345
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,680
And boxing silver bells, walking in the face, no

346
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,120
Walking with a bimbo wrapped in a foie gras

347
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,860
Everybody's happy and there ain't no pussy jokes

348
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:53,960
Oh daddy, oh daddy, oh mammy, oh mammy, oh pappy, oh grammy, oh grammy

349
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,840
Daddy, daddy, mammy, mammy, pappy, pappy, grammy, grammy

350
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,660
Everybody's wondering why the president's a dumb shit

351
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,900
Talking like he got a big skinny old fish

352
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,200
Flappy round in his skull

353
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,880
And if he's a big skinny old fish

354
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:05,880


355
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,720
He'll get caught in the plot of the brain

356
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,500
That's supposed to make the president know

357
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,400
That he ain't supposed to go to Japan

358
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
And vomit at the dinner table, make himself a damn fool

359
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:24,460
Oh daddy, oh daddy, oh mammy, oh mammy, oh pappy, oh pappy, oh grammy, oh grammy

360
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,580
Daddy, daddy, mammy, mammy, pappy, pappy, grammy, grammy

361
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,860
Jimmerous, hammerous, whoa, whoa, daddy

362
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,440
Jimmerous, hammerous, whoa, whoa, daddy

363
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,880
Slinger on the couch, you're a good guy

364
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,060
Satchel, we're the haldogs fillin'

365
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,760
Sleepin' on the couch, we're the haldogs fillin'

366
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,780
Bold San Francisco chicken

367
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,580
La Rom manera, gmaybechick

368
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,860
hitting with guys, Andy Harh

369
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:46,980
Apologize

370
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:57,360
Oh daddy, oh daddy, old pappy, old grammy, oh grammy, oh grammy

371
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,980
пош kiş

372
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,880
Thank you.

373
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,620
Thank you.

374
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:06,780
Thank you.

375
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,500
Thank you.

376
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,460
Thank you.

377
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,940
Thank you.

378
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
Thank you.

379
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,700
Thank you.

380
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,680
Thank you.

381
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,620
Thank you.

382
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,540
Thank you.

383
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,460
Thank you.

384
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,020
Thank you.

385
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,140
Thank you.

386
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,040
Thank you.

387
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,500
Thank you.

388
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:37,900
Thank you.

389
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,260
Thank you.

390
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,240
Thank you.

391
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,640
Thank you.

392
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,140
Thank you.

393
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,160
Thank you.

394
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,040
It's a beautiful thing and we'll continue.

395
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,660
If I feel like giving something.

396
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,960
Again, we come back to is your soul up?

397
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,560
Is the magic light gone off?

398
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,460
There is no up and down in that realm.

399
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,060
There's no up and down?

400
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,600
No, there is sideways, but only in one direction.

401
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,800
So it's not a world where we could use the spatula as frequently as we'd like.

402
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,360
No, it's very linear.

403
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,840
It's more like the needle.

404
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,260
You might be able to use the needle, but never the spatula.

405
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,360
The spatula is too three-dimensional.

406
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,580
And the beach ball would be out of the question.

407
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,640
Yes, and also the inclement...

408
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,960
The angles are all wrong.

409
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,180
This is non-Euclidean geometries.

410
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,760
Just the frequencies of this broadcast are non-Euclidean.

411
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,160
But do they operate on a similar principle?

412
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,860
Is the wave magnetics involved in hearing our voices through this medium?

413
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,440
That's the only...

414
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,800
That's the only...

415
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,140
That's the only way.

416
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,400
That's the only thing that hears our voices in this medium.

417
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,180
So are they talking deep into the cervical clavichord and beneath the subcutaneous matter?

418
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,020
Are they talking inside our...

419
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,360
Sure, but it's pointless.

420
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,780
Who cares?

421
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,060
It's just all going out into the void, Dave.

422
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,180
You're all alone in this vast, huge universe spinning around in this little tuna can.

423
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,240
And 30 bucks.

424
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,360
Five years from now, you're going to hit Alpha Centauri.

425
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,160
Yep.

426
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,720
You'll be the first man there, though, Dave.

427
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,820
It's a great honor.

428
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,240
I'll be the first tuna sandwich on Alpha Centauri.

429
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,200
You're not just some guinea pig.

430
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,400
You're not just some Russian dog that's been sent up in a sputnik.

431
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,300
A guinea pig in a Russian dog.

432
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,380
No, you're a hero.

433
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:44,860
I got that.

434
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,380
No, I'm sorry.

435
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:45,940
You're...

436
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
I'm a sandwich.

437
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,920
You're the vanguard of the human race.

438
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,600
Well, the subgenius race, anyway.

439
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:57,100
And if Lenny Riefenstahl were to make my film and to have me as the top tuna above all the

440
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,420
rest, standing below there holding flags and everything, and then I forgot the rest of

441
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:01,940
it, too...

442
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,080
It'd be really good photography.

443
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,240
It would be great stuff.

444
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,840
I think we could all get uniforms and everything and forget Bob and just...

445
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,900
Yeah, just be Dave.

446
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,880
Praise Dave.

447
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,200
There'd be a million of me.

448
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,120
Thousands and millions of them.

449
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,440
Praise Dave.

450
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:12,900
That's right.

451
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,140
And no individual personalities.

452
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,820
Just blend with everything.

453
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,520
Like in a big, massive mush pudding.

454
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,420
Tuna pudding.

455
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,260
They all start thinking that way when they've been in the tuna can long enough.

456
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,820
When they've been spinning through the void for six months, they start fantasizing that

457
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:36,340
they're on Earth in a radio station, taking over the world with the brilliance of their

458
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,680
new discoveries.

459
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,880
It's still pretty hot and oily in here.

460
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,520
I don't know how much longer I can take it.

461
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,200
I suppose you haven't.

462
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,900
I just take off these Brazilian slippers here and relax for a while.

463
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,680
Maybe something will happen.

464
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,680
Maybe.

465
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,460
Maybe something will...

466
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,560
Just enjoy the stars.

467
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,180
This is the only time that you've seen a star go by outside the window.

468
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,940
Of course they don't really seem to be moving.

469
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,360
We're not going fast enough.

470
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,700
It's not like Star Trek.

471
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,060
It's just the same...

472
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:17,460
And of course that window has to be shielded completely, the radiation, if you stuck your

473
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,100
hand out there for a second it would burn your finger off.

474
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,820
If the vacuum didn't get you first, Dave.

475
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,400
But don't worry.

476
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,840
We spent a lot of money on this capsule.

477
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,540
I mean, if we had a lot of money, we would be able to get the men on it.

478
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:30,540


479
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:30,540


480
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:36,080
Well, just as long as I'm protected in here, I can fantasize.

481
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,780
And you've got lots of tapes.

482
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,140
I hope you like mid-60s top 40.

483
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,300
You want to hear good vibrations again?

484
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

485
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,320
Remember that one Hendrix tape?

486
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,820
Oh, that was the one that got torn up.

487
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,780
No, no.

488
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,940
That's the one you liked.

489
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,320
Yeah, the Mormon choir doing Hendrix's greatest hits.

490
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,480
You said you'd let me listen to that one again.

491
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,700
Could you just put it up one more time?

492
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,840
Their version of Machine Gun was really original.

493
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,440
I never would have thought I could.

494
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,280
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir doing Machine Gun with just voices.

495
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,820
There's a lot you can do with the human voice.

496
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,480
Help!

497
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,020
Help!

498
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,620
Help!

499
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,180
Help!

500
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,400
It's a good thing his suit provides the medication when he freaks out like that.

501
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,680
I know.

502
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,420
It feels better now, doesn't it?

503
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,460
Everything's computerized.

504
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,300
We've got Dave tucked in, tucked into his little space capsule.

505
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,020
This creaky chair.

506
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,240
His self-medicating space suit.

507
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,040
Just me.

508
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,220
All the buttons in front of him and flashing lights are just props.

509
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,380
Make him feel good.

510
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,920
Make him feel like he's in control.

511
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,780
Actually, he basically was shot out of a glorified blowgun.

512
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,000
And we kind of, along with about a thousand other people in little tin cans,

513
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,460
and we're just hoping that one or two of them actually makes it to Alpha Centauri.

514
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,720
And we hope it's still there by the time they get there.

515
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,640
Carrying their little letters from J.R. Bob Dobbs

516
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,340
to the kings of any other inhabited planets they might fall onto.

517
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:24,920
Thank you.

518
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,020
Thank you.

519
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,240
We would have loved to have put you.

520
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,360
In suspended animation for this five-year voyage, Dave.

521
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,600
But the taxpayers would have had to pay for that.

522
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:42,540
The committee decided that you could just hack it out.

523
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,880
Tough it out.

524
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,220
Five years of black void sitting here in Orlando

525
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,000
pretending to be blown out by a puffed-up dart gun.

526
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,220
You're here with us.

527
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,360
The voice is inside your head, Dave.

528
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,080
I don't know.

529
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,320
I don't know.

530
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:57,680
I don't know.

531
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,100
I don't know.

532
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,260
I don't know.

533
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,300


534
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,300


535
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,300


536
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,300


537
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,300


538
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:06,820
never be alone. You can't even fall asleep. Your suit will make sure of that.

539
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:16,620
Let's see now. The first duchy fallen was 1264 by a count from the Ukraine named Vladimir.

540
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:28,480
Oh, it's it's Winoma time in southern New Mexico. The Winoma Indians are doing the annual

541
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:37,700
Akoma dance. Oh, there's new wine bar in Cincinnati. Don't forget, you've got 90 channels

542
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:44,220
of cable TV, although we will admit there's no sound. Yeah, but they're all like shopping

543
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,460
channels. And I don't have no money.

544
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:52,120
I'm trying to get money out of me. And wait a minute. You're a voice in my head.

545
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,400
You're building up credits all the time back on Earth. If you ever make it back, you'll

546
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,100
be a very rich man. I'm building up credits. I'm building up credits all the time.

547
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,920
If you don't make it back, they go into the J.R. Bob Dobbs Memorial Fund. You'll be remembered

548
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,900
very fondly by those of us who had to stay back here on Earth talking to you by radio.

549
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,240
Dave, I'm kind of connected. We wish we could be out there with you in the void.

550
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,100
I'm carrying on the torch of humanity.

551
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,300
I can feel you.

552
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,680
Discovery. The amazing sense of discovery you must feel. We all here on Earth envy you,

553
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:25,880
Dave.

554
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,800
I can touch you back there. I am blown out here.

555
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:40,400
You signed up. You wanted to go for the easy money, Dave.

556
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,940
Yeah, but...

557
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,680
You answered that classified ad in the paper.

558
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,520
Yeah, but...

559
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,400
Off-world farming. Big future. Big bucks while you sleep.

560
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,440
Yeah, but it sounds like such a scam. Off-world farming. What could you possibly have to do but sleep?

561
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:09,080
Sea monkeys are going to be a big cash crop in the future, Dave, for people on your new colonized planet.

562
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,600
Oh, my God. I've got to check out the sea monkeys. The sea monkeys were all bloated yesterday,

563
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,260
and I had to give them their estrogen tablets.

564
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,100
Let's see.

565
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,160
One, two, three, four, third, one, fourth, one.

566
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,420
This hammer is all disconnected here.

567
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,380
I hope the sea monkeys aren't dead, Dave. They're your only source of nutrients.

568
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,280
Check them. Check them. Check the sea monkeys.

569
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,360
Try this top off.

570
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,020
Oh, sea monkeys are bloated again.

571
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,180
Are you an invalid?

572
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
Hey, who are you?

573
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,600
What?

574
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,460
Who are you? You're a different voice in my head.

575
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,600
Are you one of the discredited...

576
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,680
carnated dead sea monkeys talking to me like the ghost of them?

577
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,700
You post a fake WCS feed and have to tell me what I want to hear.

578
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,620
Hey, this is getting more realistic and lifelike.

579
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,400
There's like retarded people calling me up and talking in my head.

580
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,620
I doubt if we'll ever be able to resurrect these sea monkeys.

581
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,000
Jeez.

582
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,440
Jeez.

583
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,780
Look at this one.

584
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,740
Are you okay?

585
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,200
It's sprouting a whole new head.

586
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,500
I wonder if I mix this solution back in again.

587
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,480
Maybe some of them...

588
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,780
I could take a spore from one of them and reclone the spore.

589
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,320
I'll just go take a nap and write a little report to the committee.

590
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,260
I'm calling you.

591
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,540
Bob?

592
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:35,980
Bob?

593
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,140
I haven't heard the voice of Bob.

594
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,360
Bob?

595
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,060
Bob?

596
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,960
There's just something in the background there.

597
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,740
I can't make that voice out.

598
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,040
I can't make that voice out.

599
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,000
Well, the only thing for me to do on this shift is...

600
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,640
Well, I gotta remember to call the bathroom.

601
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,380
And I gotta...

602
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,620
Well, remember to eat that stuff they call food.

603
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,720
I could work out again.

604
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,680
Yeah.

605
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,280
Yeah, with that.

606
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,600
I'll go read some more technical manuals.

607
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,720
Take on some more stuff on the monitor.

608
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:15,940
Take on some more stuff on the monitor.

609
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,200
Hell with that.

610
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,800
I'll try on this Mr. Peanut suit.

611
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,220
Yeah, this thing's been laying around for weeks now.

612
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,940
Having any fun with that?

613
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,120
He's hallucinating the peanut suit again.

614
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,560
You'll have to make note of that.

615
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,200
Well, now he's a little...

616
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,020
Tell the psychiatrist.

617
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,460
Mr. Peanut used to come to all the fairs.

618
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,120
And he'd pass out donuts and give favors to the kids.

619
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,380
And...

620
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,140
And bags of peanuts, of course.

621
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,240
I love that monocle and I.

622
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,080
You know what's funny?

623
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,140
All of those volunteer, quote, astronauts, unquote,

624
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,280
start imagining the peanut suit.

625
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,980
Something about Mr. Peanut...

626
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,180
Do you suppose the Russians had something to do with that?

627
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,380
Could they have breached security

628
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,900
and implanted the Mr. Peanut fantasy?

629
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,040
Look, he thinks he's Mr. Peanut again.

630
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,480
And if it's not Mr. Peanut, it's Reddy Kilowatt.

631
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm glad we enjoyed the opening of the...

632
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,180
It's kind of sad, in a way.

633
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,240
Oh, boy.

634
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,720
I'm taller than all the other Mr. Peanut men.

635
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,020
This is a very, very big, important convention of Mr. Peanut men.

636
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,940
I think I'm standing...

637
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,220
Do you suppose his suit is over-medicating him?

638
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:34,700
I wonder...

639
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,740
It's possible.

640
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,600
I wonder if I should still be even taller if I was standing much more from the west.

641
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,880
But why...

642
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,980
Why old advertising figures?

643
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,940
I mean, Mr. Peanut's not even used anymore.

644
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,300
I don't think.

645
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,620
It's something from his past.

646
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,400
They're comforting things.

647
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,680
Oh, Mr. Potato Head.

648
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,760
One of the people on the way to Proxima Regulus

649
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,120
were all turned into Mr. Potato Head

650
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,420
around the six-month mark, just like him.

651
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,440
We'll have to remember that.

652
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:01,840
Yes.

653
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,900
We'll make a note of it.

654
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,660
We'll have to tell the psychology department.

655
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,260
We ought to tell the cruelty department, too.

656
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,920
They can start implanting...

657
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,580
I need a better...

658
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,580
Evil Mr. Potato Head and evil Mr. Peanut.

659
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,800
I no wonder they came here and shriveled up Mr. Potato Head.

660
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,880
Because now I can stare at each other.

661
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,960
I'd like to smash me into it.

662
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,600
Mr. Tuber costume.

663
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,220
It's the big sweet potato head.

664
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,060
Oh, I love this one the best.

665
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,960
It's carved out in the middle.

666
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,880
Hmm.

667
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,780
Do you suppose he has any inkling

668
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,880
that all of his silly antics

669
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,500
are being broadcast to all the people on Earth

670
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,280
on the crazy astronaut channel?

671
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,800
He's fully lost.

672
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,340
One of these days he's going to switch through those channels

673
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,080
and he's going to come upon the channel with him on it.

674
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,120
Oh, man.

675
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,260
I might as well lift a box.

676
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,540
Oh, wow, this is getting boring.

677
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,780
Dave, your gyros need stabilizing.

678
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,440
Dave, check your computer.

679
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,140
Wait, who?

680
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,440
Your gyro...

681
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,040
You're spinning.

682
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,140
You're in a spin, Dave.

683
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,320
Whose voice is this?

684
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,500
Stabilize the gyros.

685
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,500
Is this a real voice or is this a real voice?

686
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,680
Turn up the oxygen switch.

687
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,400
I get lightheaded in here.

688
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,200
Reach for the oxygen switch, Dave.

689
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,980
I'll be the turn on the oxygen switch.

690
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,280
Oh, he did it.

691
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,680
At least he thought it was the oxygen switch.

692
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,940
He needed a good washing.

693
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,600
Oh, my God.

694
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,060
They always panic when the suit fills up with the cleansing fluid.

695
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,040
My neck hurts.

696
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,780
Right up to their nostrils.

697
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,800
Oh, my God.

698
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,160
It's like he doesn't...

699
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,340
Church air switch.

700
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,480
My hands are clean.

701
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,120
My face is clean.

702
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,100
Hello.

703
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,060
Hello, Dave.

704
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,680
Feeling better now, Dave?

705
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,900
Feeling better now, Dave?

706
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:18,920
What?

707
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,700
Everything I say, itches.

708
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,740
No, no, no.

709
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,980
We're not doing that, it says.

710
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,580
It's just...

711
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,560
It's just us, Dave.

712
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,240
The voice is in your head.

713
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,320
We didn't want you to be alone.

714
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,140
I bet I could write a whole symphony on this hollow potato.

715
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,820
That would be something to do for five years.

716
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,020
You'd sit around going mad.

717
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,840
It's that...

718
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,600
There have been great symphonies written about hollow potatoes, Dave.

719
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,340
Great symphonies.

720
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,100
Why don't you try it?

721
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,660
It'll keep you busy for a month or so.

722
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,120
Yeah, why don't I try it?

723
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,440
I could, like, make thousands and thousands of little holes,

724
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,900
like some sort of chromatic key.

725
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,800
I could just get a little...

726
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,240
Dave, the cat's loose in the spaceship.

727
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,840
Let me check the monitor for...

728
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,360
Shh.

729
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,600
Cat's loose.

730
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,860
Damn cat.

731
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,100
It's crawling all over all those...

732
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,260
Faders and...

733
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,100
You better catch that cat, Dave.

734
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,700
It's walking across the control panel.

735
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,500
You're going into a spin again.

736
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,280
It's going right out of control.

737
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,040
You're destabilizing.

738
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:21,660
Oh, my God.

739
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,720
I'm gonna...

740
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,760
I'm gonna destabilize.

741
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,000
This thing's gonna start flipping.

742
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,300
If I don't get down there right away...

743
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:26,660
Shh.

744
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:27,740
Shh.

745
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,560
Shh.

746
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,360
Ginger.

747
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,500
Ginger.

748
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,100
Ginger.

749
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,860
Oh, good.

750
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,160
Look.

751
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,920
Princess We the Cat's mutated.

752
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,440
Oh.

753
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,980
Just as we were hoping.

754
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,120
What the hell is that?

755
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,680
He let it wander into the cargo hold where it was exposed.

756
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,580
What is that?

757
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:53,800
Ginger?

758
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,860
Is that you?

759
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,540
Jeez.

760
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,800
What the hell?

761
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,100
What the hell?

762
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,720
There's a slime all over your neck.

763
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,720
What you been getting into?

764
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,680
Just let me get a little closer, okay?

765
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,440
What's wrong?

766
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,640
Try to make friends with it, Dave.

767
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,880
I'll try and make friends with it.

768
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,820
Try to make friends with Ginger.

769
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,120
Ginger.

770
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:14,960
Yeah.

771
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,940
Ginger was always a nice little kitty.

772
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,400
It's sick or something.

773
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,480
I'll make friends.

774
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,600
I'll pet it and take it back out of here.

775
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:22,600
Ginger.

776
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,560
No!

777
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,420
Well, settle down, Dave.

778
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,860
Try to communicate with it.

779
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,140
It's a new form of life.

780
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,480
No one's ever seen a cat spider before.

781
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,160
It could teach us things.

782
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,400
Oh, my God.

783
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,580
Think what it could mean to science.

784
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,460
Go on in there, Dave.

785
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,100
Can I get...

786
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:43,800
Go on back into that little...

787
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


788
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


789
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


790
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


791
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


792
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


793
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


794
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


795
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


796
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


797
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:43,800


798
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,140
Let that car go hold with that giant mutated cat spider.

799
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,280
If I could just talk to her, maybe...

800
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,780
It's got to be intelligent if it's mutated this far.

801
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,940
It maybe has something to tell me.

802
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,760
Little kitty or...

803
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,960
What the hell?

804
00:47:59,020 --> 00:47:59,740
You are not...

805
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,380
What the hell is that?

806
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,360
What's that?

807
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,960
Oh, it just needs to be comforted, Dave.

808
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,420
Your music soothes the savage beast.

809
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,060
Why don't you put on some music?

810
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,160
Oh, Ginger.

811
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,820
I was going to play a little song for you.

812
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,480
Maybe you should put out some milk for it.

813
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,400
A little tray of milk.

814
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,560
Oh, Ginger.

815
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,860
I was wondering...

816
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,700
Be careful now.

817
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,160
Don't let it get hurt.

818
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,920
You know, its blood can burn a hole directly through the spaceship hole.

819
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:36,520
It would create a terrible vacuum and suck you out into space like toothpaste out of

820
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:36,900
a tube.

821
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,220
It looks like it's going through my...

822
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,700
Oh, my gosh.

823
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,400
Oh, my gosh.

824
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,680
And whatever you do, don't let any harm come to Ginger.

825
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,560
The war department is very interested in your little tabby.

826
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,340
I don't think we can deal with this right now.

827
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,040
I think it's just that, the rhatagym, it's still on.

828
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,160
We don't have this war department.

829
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:04,420
And we'll be back to the lonesome cowboy Dave flipping out in outer space channel after

830
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,980
these words from our controller.

831
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,400
Cue up the controller tape.

832
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,080
Dealing with overpopulation involves more than birth control.

833
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,740
That idea will take center stage at an upcoming conference in Egypt.

834
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm Steve Pomplin for Earthwatch Radio.

835
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,880
I say kill them all, let God sort them out.

836
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,140
I say send them back to Black Sea.

837
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,960
I'm into the voluntary human error.

838
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:36,960


839
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:36,960


840
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,820
I say let them eat the extinction movement.

841
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,700
I say let them eat green cheese.

842
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,880
Let them eat green cheese and let the cat sort them out.

843
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,340
Let the mutated spider cat.

844
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,240
I say exterminate all of these bunk mounds because everything's pedagogues and stealing.

845
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,240
Stop the mutated poor.

846
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,400
Stop the mutated bad.

847
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,420
It's unreal.

848
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,940
Is there any coffee on this space?

849
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:06,940


850
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:06,940


851
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:06,940


852
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:06,940


853
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:06,940


854
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:06,940


855
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:06,940


856
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,260
Is there any of this?

857
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,320
Now come on Dave, I know you got some of that whiskey stashed somewhere.

858
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,820
Back with the bio samples from Mars.

859
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,800
The samples I'm studying came with my holocaust.

860
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,460
We're coming up to a major battle.

861
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,320
And I'm almost as good at it as you can.

862
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,940
And I'm almost as good at it as you can.

863
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,880
We can't understand a word you're saying Dave.

864
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,080
Almost there for sure.

865
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,260
He's lost in space friends.

866
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,120
Sad.

867
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:52,820
But it's part of the risks these astronauts take.

868
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,280
Thank God cremor don't make you sleepy.

869
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,980
Like some of the other ones do.

870
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,140
Well at one o'clock your suit will put you to sleep.

871
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,680
I'm waiting.

872
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,600
I'm waiting.

873
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,860
I'm waiting for my suit to put me to sleep.

874
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:05,920
I'm waiting.

875
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,840
I'm waiting.

876
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,120
I'm waiting.

877
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,620
Over the last five and a half hours my suit has enthralled me.

878
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,720
My suit has put me to sleep and waked me up again.

879
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,400
My suit fed me.

880
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,140
My suit evacuated my bowels.

881
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,200
My suit lulled me into a false sense of security.

882
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,340
It's a comforting suit.

883
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,200
My suit talked to me.

884
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,780
My suit made me feel very insecure.

885
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,920
My suit expanded and contracted a few times.

886
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,600
I didn't understand what that was about.

887
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,300
It was punishing you Dave.

888
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,400
The suit punishes.

889
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,400
The suit punishes and the suit rewards.

890
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,580
The suit rewards you Dave.

891
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,580
My world is in the suit.

892
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,280
This is my entire world.

893
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,040
The suit is your friend.

894
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,960
It's a nurturing cocoon.

895
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,940
Oh look at the cut of my socks.

896
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,780
This is the kind of seasoning that would make any any young man in America jealous as hell.

897
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,200
I'm a true hero.

898
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,360
Wearing this suit made me a hero.

899
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,500
And I'm proud of it.

900
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,920
I'm glad I signed up now.

901
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,520
I think my suit's filling me with pride.

902
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,700
I'm afraid that's not pride Dave.

903
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,200
You shouldn't have eaten those freeze dried beans this morning.

904
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,780
They just had a little fuzz on them.

905
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,080
I didn't see nothing wrong with those beans.

906
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,400
Your suit may be filling up with a lot more than mere pride.

907
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,000
Oh there you go.

908
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,020
He's using the zero gravity toilet again.

909
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,220
Oh boy this is kind of annoying.

910
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,340
Oh no he's not.

911
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:34,340


912
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,420
He left the flap open.

913
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,000
Look the stuff is floating around inside the cabin now.

914
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,240
It's coating the windows.

915
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,380
Catch that stuff.

916
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,960
All in a window.

917
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,140
Way to go Dave.

918
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,260
Smooth move.

919
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:45,960
Ha ha ha.

920
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,120
Did you?

921
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,200
Oh no.

922
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,360
Well now the emergency lights have gone off.

923
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,580
Little robots have to come out and clean up after you again Dave.

924
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,600
I have to get to the cleaning unit please.

925
00:52:59,440 --> 00:52:59,960
Hello?

926
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,440
The suit's going to have to punish you again Dave.

927
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,060
The suit's going to have to punish you again Dave.

928
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:04,440
Hello?

929
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,940
I'm going to clean up on the front window.

930
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:08,860
Oh shh.

931
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,280
I think I'm going to be stuck there for weeks now.

932
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,660
Of course in this vacuous atmosphere I won't smell much I don't suppose.

933
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,520
Just don't take your helmet off.

934
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,080
I wonder what would happen if I took my helmet off.

935
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,640
I never tried it.

936
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,060
No don't do that Dave.

937
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:25,840
Wait a minute.

938
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,280
Maybe something might.

939
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:27,980
I don't know maybe.

940
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,200
This is not a pressurized cabin.

941
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,800
It might not be such a good idea.

942
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,040
I'm going to go get my helmet.

943
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,040


944
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,380
After all.

945
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,200
I'm just fiddling around with these.

946
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,740
Oh look he's trying to light a cigarette again.

947
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,940
He can't get it up to his lips through that helmet.

948
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,920
That must be the five thousandth time he's done that.

949
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:47,400
Shhh.

950
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,240
Sixteen cartons of luggage and I can't smoke a damn cigarette.

951
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:56,620
It was a brilliant move on the part of the psychology department to put that no smoking sign blinking in there.

952
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,160
And those twenty cartons of cigarettes.

953
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:04,020
That keeps up the sort of tension that keeps the aspirin going.

954
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,240
And the astronauts.

955
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,380
Oddly enough it keeps them mentally healthy.

956
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,560
You know it's so alone out here the only friend I've got is my own guitar.

957
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,120
Lucille.

958
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,480
You've been with me through thick and thin.

959
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:16,960
Can't smoke.

960
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,840
Can't really eat a good meal.

961
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,040
But I can still sing a song.

962
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,860
I think I'll sing a song about my intergalactic exploits.

963
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,360
Scott can't even hardly touch these fragile big mitts on.

964
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,160
I can't even touch these fragile big mitts on.

965
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,420
Years have gone and years have come.

966
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,320
But still I'm a flying bird.

967
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,040
Someday I'll get there and maybe I won't.

968
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,140
And I never know the reason why.

969
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:00,820
Shhh.

970
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:01,800
It's the worst one yet.

971
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,280
Too far.

972
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,860
And just keep on working at it.

973
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,540
I'll have my opera all figured out by the time I get there.

974
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,080
And then I'll make it back to Earth.

975
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,700
It's more herodom and fame and fortune for me.

976
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,080
Just chuck that up and show some deal.

977
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,740
You'll be the biggest folk music star on Alpha Centauri, Dave.

978
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,100
God, if I could see it right now.

979
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,200
I could be like the Woody Guthrie of Alpha Centauri.

980
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,980
You'll be the only musician in the whole star system, Dave.

981
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:29,880
Of course, yeah.

982
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,740
I'll be the only musician in the whole star system.

983
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,600
You'll be the only music fan in the whole star system.

984
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,600
Yeah, and my head will be shaped like a gigantic fan.

985
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,880
Like one of those Komodo dragons or what do they call them?

986
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,640
Monitor lizards when they get mad.

987
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,220
Good, good.

988
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,840
We've got him doing stream of consciousness again.

989
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:52,580
That should keep him amused for a few more days.

990
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,560
I wonder if they got a reefer on Alpha Centauri.

991
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,540
I wonder if they got a hot like Earth type baby on Alpha Centauri.

992
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,420
The suit is your girlfriend, Dave.

993
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,940
It's clamping down.

994
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,440
It's constricting.

995
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,660
It's tightening up.

996
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,200
It's form fitting, isn't it?

997
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,000
I didn't know this suit could do this.

998
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,760
What the heck is going on?

999
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,460
All right, that's enough.

1000
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,640
Turn off that function of the suit.

1001
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,000
Now let's make him exercise.

1002
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,740
Put the suit in exercise mode.

1003
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,020
There we go.

1004
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,960
He's plumping up and down.

1005
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,180
He's flopping.

1006
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,100
My knee joint is going on again.

1007
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,080
What the hell is this music?

1008
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,560
It's a good aerobicized music.

1009
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,460
We must keep our astronauts in good shape.

1010
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,780
He's resisting calisthenics, jumping jacks at this time of the morning.

1011
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,760
It'll be five years of this if he's lucky.

1012
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,980
I can't do this for five years.

1013
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,380
I can't do this for another minute.

1014
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:58,620
Let me go.

1015
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,920
If he doesn't happen to hit one of the planets, if there are any, in the Alpha Centauri system,

1016
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:09,480
then he'll just have to go on to the next star system, twenty years past that.

1017
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:16,620
But you'll probably hit a planet, some sort of a planet, or a moon, or an asteroid, or something,

1018
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,200
some body of rock floating around in space.

1019
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:28,620
Think of the romantic cartoon man on a desert island with nothing but one palm tree and a shark swimming by.

1020
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,380
That romantic fantasy will be yours.

1021
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,960
Only high-tech style, babe.

1022
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:43,360
I'm a high-tech style romantic hero figure, abandoned on a distant moon,

1023
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,660
casting his face like some piece of effluvio on the sea.

1024
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,260
Someday I'll be home.

1025
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,320
Someday I'll touch the shore, a distant shore somewhere.

1026
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,500
Much longer.

1027
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,900
I'll get there someday.

1028
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:11,360
If you get bored, Dave, you can always just put a note in a bottle and send it out into the radio waves,

1029
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,580
like you've just done for the last two hours.

1030
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:28,280
This has been ESO Radio on WCSB, Cleveland, with my guest, the lonesome cowboy dude, the Reverend Arden Stang.

1031
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,660
And the Princes, we are Doe.

1032
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,760
My name is Chaz, and I'll see you all next week.

1033
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,020
Yay for Chaz.

1034
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,000
He's the mix master.

1035
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,460
I am the mix master.
