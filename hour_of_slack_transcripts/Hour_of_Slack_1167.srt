00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,540
The Self-Genius Power of Swag

2
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:29,480
Why is it always, always so costly for man to move from the present to the future?

3
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:59,980
The Self-Genius Power of Swag

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,960
Why is it always, always so costly for man to move from the present to the future?

5
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,980
The Self-Genius Power of Swag

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,680
So, so, that night I didn't get much sleep.

7
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,160
Today it's Bob!

8
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,180
In the locker room yesterday, after he thought everybody had gone, I saw Bob take something from Ben's pants.

9
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,620
Bob! I can't believe it!

10
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,060
Bob, where will we be without Bob?

11
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,280
Terry, there's nothing for you to do but tell Mr. Barker about Bob.

12
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,880
It's the same thing!

13
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,100
Well, and it did seem dishonest to conceal it anyway.

14
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,660
Anyway?

15
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,620
I did what was the obvious thing for me to do.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,060
I questioned Bob.

17
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,820
Well, that's not always easy.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,940
I saw Bob.

19
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,680
That's right.

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,900
Is it logical to think that Bob would steal?

21
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,660
Does it jive with your past experience of the way Bob operates?

22
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,900
Sometimes it takes a lot of testing to find Bob.

23
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,800
I guess I wasn't thinking very deep.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,720
Maybe, maybe inside, I didn't really believe Bob was inside.

25
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,640
I think that's the clue to this bigger thing we're seeking.

26
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,560
Know yourself.

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,980
Yes, this is the time for me to explain myself.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,500
I'm not saying anything.

29
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,020
I'm just saying that I have a sense of hypocrisy.

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,660
When I came in to tell Mr. Barker about Bob, I started by saying certain things.

31
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,020
But I want to be sure that you find out about Bob.

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,080
And when you do, all he needs is a chance.

33
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,300
Now I'm catching on to why that's so.

34
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,300
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.

35
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,000
Well?

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,600
Well, it was this way.

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,180
That's all?

38
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,480
Harness!

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,380
Harness!

40
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,100
Harness!

41
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,760
Harness!

42
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,520
Harness!

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:33,960
Harness!

44
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,640
Bark, bark, bark, bark.

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,560
Now with today's mess, here is Pastor Stink Rap getting bent out of shape.

46
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,240
And that is basic to human existence.

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,360
Put on a woman's garment, the human race continues to be interested in cross-dressing.

48
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,960
I go back and I see pictures of a lot of men.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,720
And they were men, male and female.

50
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,300
And I want my hair in this way, and I want my hair that way.

51
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,520
I know it can be very stylish sometimes and is not a bad idea.

52
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,060
My wife liked it, but I eventually cut it off.

53
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,180
I found it rather irritating.

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,640
I guess I didn't keep it long enough.

55
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,120
And I actually like men on men.

56
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,400
And I encourage them because it's obvious to me that that's part of the picture.

57
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,720
That helps.

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,980
Man, man.

59
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,020
How long is long and how short is short?

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,700
Laying all that aside, the general principle is slack.

61
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,080
So, slack is taking that too far.

62
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,280
But the general principle is this.

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,780
The general principle still remains.

64
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,700
Slack.

65
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,060
Slack.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
The land has changed.

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,700
The biosphere turned.

68
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,720
Become unfamiliar and erratic.

69
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,020
I would say vengeful that nature is indifferent to us.

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,440
We fight for our survival, not nature's.

71
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,600
There's a fierceness in the wind I've never felt before.

72
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,180
Something is being unleashed.

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,260
A new form of self.

74
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,980
and the softening permafrost.

75
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,900
Why do we despise the world that gave us life?

76
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,140
Why so alienated?

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,700
Why wouldn't the wilderness fight us,

78
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,340
like any organism would fend off a virus?

79
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,000
The world we grew up in is changed forever.

80
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,600
There is no way home.

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,440
Is there something beyond science that is happening out here?

82
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,380
What if the very thing we were here to pull out of the ground were to rise willingly?

83
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,240
What would that look like?

84
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,720
This is the last winter.

85
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,860
Total collapse.

86
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,980
Hope dies.

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:52,560


88
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,220
And Bob.

89
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,200
Lives.

90
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,380
Friends, we're live tonight with recorded Norrell Preff and Fernanda Nandy Lee Marr,

91
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,460
but it's so cold.

92
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,240
There's been a weird, some sort of anomaly in the weather here along the Great Lakes.

93
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,160
It was like 83 today, and tonight it's like, what, 23 right now?

94
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,780
This summer must be like the last winter.

95
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,860
I think the global coolness deficit is catching up with us, man.

96
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,300
I think what's going to happen is they're going to try and kill us in the winter with cold and in the summer with heat.

97
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:32,820
And these ghosts, mammoths and mastodons and prehistoric reindeer keep running around us in circles.

98
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,920
But then they go again.

99
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,880
Did you see that?

100
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,780
Oh, yeah, of course.

101
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,880
I saw it and I smelled it too.

102
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,120
The smell is onerous, like the puffy foot.

103
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,080
It's grossly onerous.

104
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,340
It's grossly over exaggerated.

105
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,700
And some, look, some of the mammary glands are expanded.

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,880
Oh, man, they're going to have more of them.

107
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,700
It's a Neander man.

108
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,600
A Neander man ghost.

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,240
You smelled that?

110
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,400
That's why I left the room.

111
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:51,720
Jeez.

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,900
That was an...

113
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,480
It's so cold and spooky.

114
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,240
They're already breeding new humans now.

115
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,940
I need a blanket.

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,920
Neander man might be the only thing that works.

117
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,500
I don't like it, Loose Bob.

118
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,580
Look, there's somebody coming by with mushrooms growing out of their head.

119
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,840
Multicolored mushrooms.

120
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,120
Look, they're luminous.

121
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,660
They're numinous.

122
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,480
They're like little...

123
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,960
Oh, they smell good.

124
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,400
Yep, they're...

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,700
Don't get close to that.

126
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,580
They smell excellent.

127
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,120
Hello.

128
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,260
Hi.

129
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,740
I'd like you to stroke my mushrooms.

130
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,960
These, as you stroke them...

131
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,180
Oh, that feels weird.

132
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,620
The juices from my head will go into the palms of your hand.

133
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,460
Be reabsorbed into your body's cyclophymic personality.

134
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,080
It's weirdling, babe.

135
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,240
He's such a fun guy.

136
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,080
I'm getting all slacked up.

137
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,240
Just line up.

138
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,300
Don't, don't...

139
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,900
Fun guy.

140
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,580
Don't let those knees wobble.

141
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,820
Oh, it feels good.

142
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,820
It's a hard floor down there.

143
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,400
Ah, it feels great.

144
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Yeah, see?

145
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,100
Oh, so this is slack.

146
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,640
Or is this the frop?

147
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,120
I can't remember, but it's good.

148
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,720
It's good.

149
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,120
You can't let him know this is the...

150
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,540
More.

151
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,720
This is not real slack.

152
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,340
More, Bob.

153
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,560
More.

154
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,080
This is the beginning.

155
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,940
This is the first part.

156
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,140
He's not ready for it.

157
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,840
He's not acclimating.

158
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,880
You've got to help him.

159
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,280
More than kind pills.

160
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,840
No one can ever help him.

161
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,580
No, never, never.

162
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,360
Oh, yes.

163
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,020
The kind pills can help you.

164
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,100
More of them kind pills.

165
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
The unkind pills.

166
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,520
The cruelty pills.

167
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,480
The blasé pills.

168
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,700
What is it?

169
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,380
The ill-willed pills.

170
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,380


171
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,380


172
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,380


173
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,380
The forgotten pills.

174
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,740
What can it be that has done this to us?

175
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,120
What has changed us?

176
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,400
What has made us into these things?

177
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,600
It's just Bob is what it is.

178
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,440
It's just, it's literally Bob.

179
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,120
The demaculation of J.R. Bob.

180
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,120
It's Bob.

181
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,500
Bob.

182
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,040
Bob.

183
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,840
Bob.

184
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,300
Bob.

185
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,560
Bob.

186
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,080
Bob.

187
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,280
Bob.

188
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,040
Bob.

189
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,520
Bob.

190
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:44,780
Bob.

191
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,600
Bob.

192
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,020
Bob.

193
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,560
Bob.

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,100
Bob.

195
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,580
Bob.

196
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,000
Bob.

197
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:51,720
Bob.

198
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,240
Bob.

199
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,540
Bob.

200
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:52,560
Bob.

201
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,080
Bob.

202
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,260
Bob.

203
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,580
Bob.

204
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:53,600
Bob.

205
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


206
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


207
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


208
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


209
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


210
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


211
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


212
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


213
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


214
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,600


215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:53,620
Yeah.

216
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,160
Yeah.

217
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,580
Bob.

218
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,580


219
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,580


220
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,580


221
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,580
on at least a daily or weekly basis, depending on their situation in the church,

222
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,920
to wear these alacrid lucid underpants.

223
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,360
Some of them haven't been tested.

224
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,680
Clean those pants, man.

225
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,300
Oh, my God.

226
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,900
The pants are getting away.

227
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,280
The pants are huge.

228
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,260
Oh, my God.

229
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,060
Who would have thought it of Bob's pants that they could do that?

230
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,860
Okay, dude, let me end here.

231
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm a situationist, so I could probably handle this situation.

232
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,980
Okay, as the situation is, it looks like some of the guys wearing the Bob underpants are exploding.

233
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,120
Thank you.

234
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,620
Thank you.

235
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,060
I'll be back.

236
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,180
I'm doing the Catskills thing.

237
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,440
Oh, my God.

238
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,360
I feel so alone now.

239
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,940
Why, you're not alone.

240
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,780
You're here with us in Blunderland.

241
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,320
All of us.

242
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,540
All of us in Blunderland.

243
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,140
So pleasant here.

244
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,560
With the psychoskeletons.

245
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,340
Oh, yes.

246
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,200
They're not so bad.

247
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,620
Psychoskeletons aren't nearly as bad as so many people say.

248
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,740
They get the drift of things.

249
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,280
They can be shaven.

250
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,080
They can be worn, really.

251
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,480
And they can be crunched up into a fine powder and reused by these extraterrestrial vessels.

252
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,680
And, friends, that's what this show is all about.

253
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,800
The Hour of Slack is about turning you into a psychoskeleton.

254
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,540
Actually, psychoskeletons are playing a...

255
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,680
Captain Beefheart tune in the background.

256
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
This particular time.

257
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,100
Ah, yes.

258
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,900
Don, do you remember the Exoskeletons?

259
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,780
A band that was kind of capitalizing on both nihilism and having skeletons.

260
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,500
That was one chitinous band.

261
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,300
That was chitinous, man.

262
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,860
What does chitinous mean?

263
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,740
That's what bugs' outer skeletons are made of.

264
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,240
Chitin.

265
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,100
Oh, the bugs.

266
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,560
They have a chitinous exoskeleton.

267
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,780
If you're ever feeling really chitty, that's because you're an insect-man.

268
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,080
Or because your exoskeleton is rotting away from your inards.

269
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,180
Princess, we had that problem with one of her exoskeletal fingernails there.

270
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,740
Her integument there, that rind on the end of her finger, if you notice, is rotting off.

271
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,260
Oh, I always thought you were noting the spur on her heel area, which looked kind of like...

272
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,400
What were the names of those flies?

273
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,620
Turns me on.

274
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,040
Wow.

275
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,920
They can do some damage.

276
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,620
Tobson flies.

277
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,420
Hmm.

278
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
My favorite.

279
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,760
Covered with rich milk chocolate.

280
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,980
Smothered in peanuts and raisins.

281
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,760
And shoved down the children's throats at Dobbs Town!

282
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,100
Yes, baby!

283
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,040
At Dobbs Town!

284
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,080
Where you can rock out and pile on and cool in and groove.

285
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,380
Cop a groove go.

286
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,320
Pile on day and night.

287
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,400
And the all night, all day mosh pit in Dobbs Town.

288
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,260
You'll never experiencing anything like it before, Nemzes.

289
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:28,660
We have been in Dobbs Town for so long that the radio station here seems quite unfamiliar.

290
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,400
We can barely see!

291
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,340
We've been swinging through the jungles, friends.

292
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,860
Actually, it's been...

293
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:41,240
The out-of-Cleveland people have already heard the recordings from X-Day.

294
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,760
And some even from Starwood.

295
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,660
Some even rumbled in the jungle.

296
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:53,480
But here in Cleveland, friends, we're on hour of slack number 1,167.

297
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes, indeed.

298
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,500
But this is a live one now, so that...

299
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,840
It's alive.

300
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,620
It's alive!

301
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,360
The show is alive!

302
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,660
You don't understand!

303
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,120
It's not just the people.

304
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,080
The show itself is alive.

305
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,900
It's the people.

306
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,300
It has cavalieries and it has aortas and it has the veins.

307
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,120
The veins?

308
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,240
And it has brains?

309
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,860
It has a brain, all right!

310
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,160
Wait a minute.

311
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,320
Well, if you want to call it a brain...

312
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,720
What to call it a brain?

313
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,120
The show has a brain after a fashion.

314
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,360
After a fashion, yes.

315
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,260
It has background music by the Flying Ryan Brothers.

316
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,440
That's what this is.

317
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,180
A very fashionable brain with a good background.

318
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,600
He went to school all over the place.

319
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,420
I'm flying with the Ryan Brothers.

320
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,700
He actually fly high with the Ryan Brothers.

321
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,020
Yeah.

322
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,320
He wrote the book on Ryanetics.com.

323
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,100
Now, is this similar to the Bob Leografon or any other works of the subgenius?

324
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,600
Is it like, say, for instance, any of the Scientology books, even?

325
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,480
Or is it just a rancid piece of pulp that should be thrown in the toilet?

326
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,940
L. Ron Hubbard stole all that stuff from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

327
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,020
Wait a minute.

328
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,120
Who stole what?

329
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,880
L. Ron Hubbard stole all that Dianetics stuff from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

330
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,880
And then the Flying...

331
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,860
The Flying Brothers stole the Ryanetics stuff from themselves.

332
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,360
From each other, actually.

333
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,620
They were very competitive twins.

334
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,540
Okay, I want to change characters now and become an interview guy just to get this straight.

335
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,440
Everyone I've been staying has just told us that Scientology is not a ripoff of Scientology.

336
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,880
It's a ripoff of the church.

337
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,560
It's a satire, actually.

338
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,820
It's a satire of the church of the subgenius.

339
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,840
That's what Scientology is.

340
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,560
Oh, that is...

341
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,700
I'd never heard that before.

342
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,660
It was a takeoff on the church.

343
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,140
Because, you know, they were like a rebellious new...

344
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,720
group back in the 50s.

345
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,820
And the church of the subgenius, of course, had been around for a long time by the time

346
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,240
L. Ron decided to get off his tookus or toughus or whatever they...

347
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,760
Wow, that is totally amazing.

348
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,920
Now, one tender fish I'd like to ignore you, if you possibly could, without getting too

349
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,780
remaindering or having any feisty feelings towards that urchin over there.

350
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,460
What really happened?

351
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,160
I hadn't even noticed that urchin.

352
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,260
Well, just don't get too responsive because we're on...

353
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,180
Look at those spines.

354
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,000
Right.

355
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,460
Man.

356
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,160
I bet you could...

357
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,940
You could really get poked with that urchin.

358
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,740
That's why we do have Zilly as an urchin intern here.

359
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,400
And beautiful Kay Watt.

360
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,680
And so that's why I'd like to ask you, without getting too excited, what happened, the massacre

361
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,100
after X-Day?

362
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,240
I mean, is this a rumor going around?

363
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,860
Well, it wasn't really a massacre.

364
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,760
It was the opposite.

365
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:42,240
It was the dead were brought back to life and shuffled to the music of...

366
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,040
That they...

367
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,700
Friends of Chaz Smith Band.

368
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,080
Remember that?

369
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,840
Right.

370
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,280
Oh, no.

371
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,140
Except that you were rained out of that one.

372
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,140
Well, what the hell were they called?

373
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,920
That was not under the reign of Dave.

374
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,240
The French Davidian reign.

375
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,100
It was under the Wearden reign.

376
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:04,120
I did witness them try to bring back the muscular Chaz of E. Smith back into existence with

377
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,300
the rampant thoughts of their minds.

378
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,200
Well, that happened...

379
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,220
What the hell?

380
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,920
That happened at X-Day.

381
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,480
They didn't dare to do that at Starwood because...

382
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,140
Well, you know, people are a little bit...

383
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,500
They're a little bit more sensitive there.

384
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,340
They've got some explosive personalities.

385
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:25,200
At Rumble in the Jungle, Chaz came back as a powerful rainstorm, almost powerful enough

386
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,840
to put out the gigantic funeral pyre.

387
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,280
Yes.

388
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,320
Actually, somebody asked the other day about subgenius funerals.

389
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,400
It came up on Alt.Slack.

390
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,640
Somebody said, has there ever been a subgenius funeral?

391
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:44,140
And it's like, well, several months after Chaz died and after his normal funeral...

392
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:51,940
Which was kind of weird with drummers and people like me talking and so forth, the bongos

393
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,940
and everything.

394
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,060
Then there was the X-Day...

395
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,800
There was the first Rumble in the Jungle.

396
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,940
The baptism of the dead at X-Day.

397
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:07,220
And then at Starwood, there was a concert for the friends of the Tiki Banzai.

398
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,280
His old campground was brought back to life with light shows.

399
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,140
With exhibits showing lots of really great photographs.

400
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,140


401
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,140


402
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,140


403
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,040
Graphs of him and all of his artwork.

404
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:24,880
And beautiful naked women raping young, shy subgeniuses like Reverend Steve Sinek, who

405
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,580
actually was literally, as part of the Rumble in the Jungle at Starwood, Reverend Steve

406
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:35,000
Sinek was not raped exactly because he wasn't resisting that much.

407
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,260
But you know those dames out there at Brushwood, those wooden sprites?

408
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,140
They can be a bit forward, hey?

409
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,660
Dames.

410
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,200
Yeah.

411
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,600
I know how they are.

412
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,140
I ended up having...

413
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:52,600
Having to baptize Reverend Allison as a subgenius just in order to make it no longer be bestiality.

414
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,980
Now, does she have money on both sides?

415
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,100
Otherwise, Steve would have been literally having some sort of social intercourse with

416
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,800
a beast.

417
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,520
A beast.

418
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,440
A human.

419
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,400
A mere hume, as we call them.

420
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,040
A normworm.

421
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,400
A pink girl.

422
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,780
You're like the goat with a thousand breasts.

423
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,160
Do you understand?

424
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,240
Listen to them squealing.

425
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,060
You call yourself human?

426
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,700
Like little piglets.

427
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,540
Sit down, you pig.

428
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,000
You're not a human being.

429
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,660
The fools.

430
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:11,660


431
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,840
And so we made...

432
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,140
We changed her...

433
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,140
We changed her species from human to subgenius simply by giving her an honorary subgenius

434
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,300
membership pack.

435
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,980
And so that was packed well.

436
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,100
It was an exciting...

437
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,200
I would say she's a well-stuffed pack.

438
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,740
It was exciting.

439
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,300
It was very exciting.

440
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:29,920
For everyone involved.

441
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,440
Yes, for the voyeurs.

442
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,680
Now, do some subgenius women after their abacrombation or near their courageous muscle tubes, do

443
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,760
they actually grow different glandular orifices like new breasts on their back?

444
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,380
No, it's mostly hidden.

445
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,780
They have barbs on the inside so that once you get in, you can't get out.

446
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,420
Oh.

447
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,120
They'll clench you there and hold you there until they've got all your money.

448
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,500
They must have come through here.

449
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,540
They must have come just through here.

450
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,500
I didn't even see them.

451
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,740
My money's gone.

452
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,340
And I've got these scars all over my attachment.

453
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,140
I've got nothing at all.

454
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,460
I'm holding a piece of...

455
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,580
I have barb scars all over me.

456
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,120
I'm holding a piece of breechies and a half-drunk glass of wine.

457
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,760
What happened?

458
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,540
Bob must have been here.

459
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,360
He did something to us and...

460
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,440
But what?

461
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,500
But what?

462
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,600
Look.

463
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,100
Wait.

464
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,740
Was that him?

465
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,400
Look, there he goes.

466
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,800
Let's go after him, then.

467
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,540
Get the torches.

468
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,620
No, that's just a figure.

469
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,940
That's just a solitary figure.

470
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,560
Oh, okay.

471
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,340
That was a scarecrow.

472
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,780
No, no, no.

473
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,160
It is him.

474
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,720
It is him.

475
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
Somebody get a pipe.

476
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,440
A torch.

477
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,000
A lighter.

478
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,960
Somebody get a gun.

479
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,840
A time machine.

480
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,420
We'll blow him up.

481
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,700
We'll use the time machine to explode Bob.

482
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,300
Well, here we are.

483
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,500
Oh, no.

484
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,100
No, he's coming.

485
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,820
I think we angered him.

486
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,620
No, he's in front of us now.

487
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,080
He's coming.

488
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,180
Bob.

489
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,020
Wow.

490
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:49,940
Bob.

491
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes.

492
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,160
Where'd you get those new shoes?

493
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,640
Where did I get them?

494
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,960
Where did you sell them to me?

495
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,660
New shoes?

496
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,200
Oh.

497
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,300
Bob, I thought you were going to kill me.

498
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,680
I make my own shoes.

499
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,800
How much can I give you for those shoes, man?

500
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,540
Stang, I'm the world's greatest salesman, but I'm not the world's stupidest salesman.

501
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,740
I've been around the block a few times, as you happen to know and have capitalized on.

502
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,280
You're a good salesman.

503
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,900
Just sit back in your seat and listen to me, buddy.

504
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,380
You've taken over, see?

505
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,320
You forgot who the main man was.

506
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,540
You forgot who this church was all about.

507
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
It ain't about you, you scrawny runt.

508
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,040
Look into my face.

509
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,760
No, don't hit me, Bob.

510
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,060
Don't hit me.

511
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,600
Look into these eyes.

512
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,480
No.

513
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,280
Don't hurt Princess Weed.

514
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,080
Take it like I'm man.

515
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,580
Oh.

516
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,920
Princess Weed likes it.

517
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,960
Come on over there, baby.

518
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,460
What happened in here?

519
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,720
It looks like there's been an explosion of some kind.

520
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,840
Everything...

521
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,440
What are those clowns doing here?

522
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,180
What's...

523
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,880
There's blood on the wall and clowns with...

524
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,120
Bloody clowns everywhere.

525
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,900
Oh my God.

526
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,360
You, sir.

527
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:58,920
What...

528
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,440
What happened?

529
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,240
I...

530
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,980
I was doing the Ripple Temple routine.

531
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,380
And the big cat just...

532
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,480
I don't know.

533
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,520
We saw this face with a pipe in it.

534
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,660
And then they...

535
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,420
It was supposed to be a Bigfoot corpse.

536
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,840
Yeah, yeah.

537
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,660
But it wasn't.

538
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,160
It wasn't.

539
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,580
It wasn't.

540
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,080
It was some kind of explosion...

541
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,240
Exploding thing.

542
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,500
And we think the Bob guy took off that way.

543
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,380
And...

544
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,020
Oh, man.

545
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,160
I've got to get to triage.

546
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,480
My foot's falling off.

547
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,700
Thanks.

548
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,620
Oh, yeah.

549
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,260
And don't forget, next week it's about...

550
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:34,760
Friends, speaking of clowns, the devotional is coming up.

551
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,620
For those here in the Cleveland-Akron area, you'll be interested to know, possibly, that

552
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,100
on August 30th...

553
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,820
At the Beachland Ballroom, the devotional returns.

554
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,200
Now, if you were...

555
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:55,060
If you're ready for the truth, and if you know the truth of Devo, I forget who all's

556
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,560
going to be there.

557
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,240
Last time, Jerry Casale of the Devos.

558
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,460
He could put you, like, square on about the, what do you call it, bloody clowns and so

559
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,720
forth.

560
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,360
And General Boy, the father of the Devos.

561
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,240
Boogie Boys' dad, himself.

562
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,800
Yeah.

563
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,900
And KRK Ryden, the artist of the Devos.

564
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,180
He's blind now, in both ears.

565
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,980
And a bunch of really great bands are always there.

566
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,320
The term Nordic American Bund was my favorite.

567
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,180
But that's August 30th at the Beachland Ballroom.

568
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,820
And to get more information, well, you could look at subgenius.com events, and then go

569
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,140
to boogieboysbasement.com.

570
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,200
Boogieboysbasement.com.

571
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,680
Boogie being spelled B-O-O-J-I.

572
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,640
Boys' basement.

573
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,260
Boogieboysbasement.com.

574
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,880
But it's not like boys were...

575
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,000
But a Y-Z, you say.

576
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,060
It's just like a Boogie Boys.

577
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,140
And then, isn't there like, D-Voieoke or something, where people sing?

578
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,660
Oh yeah, right.

579
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,960
It's gonna be a whole karaoke thing.

580
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,840
Well now, but before that...

581
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,660
For the limbless people...

582
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,700
That's on a Saturday.

583
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,220
That's on the day of Saturn.

584
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,460
Oh yes, but...

585
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,920
But on Friday, Frius Day...

586
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,360
Friaste.

587
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:09,760
There is an art show called the Jocko Domo at Asterix Gallery in Cleveland, Ohio.

588
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,860
Would that be the...

589
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,860


590
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,860


591
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,860


592
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,860


593
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,860


594
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,860


595
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,860


596
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,860


597
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,860


598
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,880
Would that be on 185th Street or someplace where that'd be?

599
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,880
No, actually it's on 2393 Professor Avenue, Professor.

600
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,460
Oh, Professor.

601
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,840
That's delightful.

602
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,640
Oddly enough.

603
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,660
Over in Tremont.

604
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,200
We were just talking about Professor Chaz, and here it's Professor Ave, 2393.

605
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,940
But it's an art show of the...

606
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:34,360
You know that dome hat, the pyramid stepped red hat of the Devos?

607
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,240
Some call it a flowerpot hat.

608
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,140
Yeah, the flowerpot hat, or the power dome is actually the way they like to call it.

609
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,940
Well, you can buy those.

610
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,880
It's the power dome.

611
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,260
Little plastic ones.

612
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,140
And Reverend Bruce Perry...

613
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:46,940
Monkey Boy.

614
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:53,880
Monkey Boy bought many and offered them to artistes such as ourselves, Reverend Susie

615
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,000
the Floozy, and much more famous ones like K.R.K.

616
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,760
Ryden, and said, make this dome hat into art and people who can come to the show.

617
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,980
And it's a benefit also for Magdalene's...

618
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,960
Reverend Magdalene and Jesus.

619
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,060
And the subgeniuses' legal costs.

620
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,020
You know, the subgeniuses whose child was taken away by the conspiracy because of their

621
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,620
religion, and then...

622
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,500
And it was given back.

623
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,660
And they only got it back because the bio dad screwed up so badly.

624
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,240
So there's lots of money that needs to be...

625
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,080
But their legal costs are beyond imagining, and even...and Bob ain't helping them out.

626
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,980
So, it's a benefit for the baby, Conbo, and...who actually is a teenager now.

627
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,340
I thought he was 43 years old, but...

628
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:49,660
But we have a...Princess, we and I have an entry in that...actually, our entry is by...

629
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,080
It's not for sale.

630
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,100
It's not for sale.

631
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:57,980
It's by us, Jerry Casale, who designed the Devo hat dome, dome hat, power dome.

632
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:06,640
St. Joe Riley, who made the mask from the bust of Bob made by Hel Swami Satellite Weavers,

633
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,860
and that's all you need to know right there.

634
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,120
It was made by us.

635
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,620
It was made by a consortium of subgeniuses.

636
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,800
You will...if you go...if you go to the Jocko Domo art show, you will see Bob.

637
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,160
You will see Bob.

638
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,820
If you come to that show...if you come, you'll see Bob.

639
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,360
I can honestly say that, my friend.

640
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,400
Look at these people are all clamoring.

641
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,800
No, they don't know that Bob has never...

642
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,740
You can't listen to that clamoring.

643
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,380
...never seen Bob yet.

644
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,760
That's a bunch of hooey.

645
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,160
He's never gonna show up, see?

646
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,720
Listen, I've been following this Church of the Subgenius for the last 45 weeks.

647
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,020
I've been around the block a few times, and believe me, my arm's at tire.

648
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,060
And I'm telling you once, and I'm telling you twice.

649
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,800
If I could tell you three times in all, I'm telling you, there is no Bob.

650
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,220
You understand?

651
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,040
It's a joke.

652
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,540
It's like an inside satirical...

653
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,120
I don't hear you.

654
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,720
I don't hear anything.

655
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,260
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-la-la-la-ma.

656
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,800
Listen, Bobby.

657
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,160
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-la-la-la-la...

658
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,600
Listen, Bobby.

659
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,580
La-La-La-La-No-Ta-La...

660
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:56,720
Listen, Bobby.

661
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,720


662
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,720


663
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,360
It's a joke.

664
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,280
I don't want to hear your...

665
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,620
W-what... that's not all it is, though.

666
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,400
Sure, it's a joke.

667
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,680
But is Bob only a joke, my friends?

668
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Is he not a man? Does he not bleed?

669
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,660
Does his pipe not smoke frop?

670
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,180
What?

671
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,660
What?

672
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,800
Oh my god, apparently his pipe is smoking frop!

673
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,620
Oh no, that's clean!

674
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:16,800
The clouds!

675
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,300
I can't breathe!

676
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,600
Oh my god!

677
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,760
Reach! Oxygen switch!

678
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,880
Oh doctor, this is some of the best times I've ever had.

679
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,460
Taking the body of Bob Dobbs apart and selling to different organs was gonna make us a million bucks.

680
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,440
Uh, Doc? Doc, you look sleepy.

681
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,520
Grumpy?

682
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,560
Hey! Wake up!

683
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,540
Listen!

684
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,200
Oh, it's just so exciting. This show is just so exciting I got to carry it away.

685
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,220
I'm selling the organs of Bob Dobbs at a fraction of the cost.

686
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,860
The origins of Bob are swathed in mystery and toilet paper.

687
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,060
By pranksters. Teenagers.

688
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,480
A thin tissue of...

689
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,380
Showed up at night and, yes, a tissue of lies surrounds Bob's body as he lays in state.

690
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:16,360
The Turin toilet paper has picked up a radioactive image of Bob.

691
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,780
We'll sell that later along with the 080808 water.

692
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,040
We have vials of water from 08... from August 8th, 2008.

693
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,860
From August 8th, 2008.

694
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,360
Right, the date, 80808.

695
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:37,440
Which is like if 8-0 looks like B-O and O-B smells like B-O.

696
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,240
Or 08.

697
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,880
So it's like 0808 means oh Bob.

698
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,080
Anyway, friends, we have to pause, unfortunately, for a...

699
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,640
Well, it's not a station ID, but it's a...

700
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,640
Theoretically, a public service announcement.

701
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,500
We're being thrown out for a few minutes.

702
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,340
This program is presented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

703
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,940
Sometimes small turtles, meaning those with a shell of four inches long or less,

704
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,020
still turn up as household pets in the United States.

705
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,800
Unfortunately, the degree of an animal's cuteness doesn't have any relationship to whether it's healthy or infected with rabies.

706
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,280
Turtles can cause serious illness with diarrhea, fever, and vomiting.

707
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,040
The best way is to have pet turtles in your house.

708
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,360
And to teach children to touch turtles.

709
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,880
And get sick from turtles.

710
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,080
Members of several girls' softball teams bit at least two people.

711
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,060
And tested positive for rabies.

712
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,960
Rather than pick them up, call Animal Control.

713
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,680
What do you think, Bob? Would hand grenades force it out?

714
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,800
I don't know. I can't tell what that thing will do or where it will do it.

715
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,260
Start blasting it, Bob. We're moving up with another unit.

716
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,100
Yes, sir.

717
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,160
Anything there, Bob? Hello, Bob?

718
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,020
Can you hear me?

719
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
Can you hear me, Bob?

720
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,980
Come in, Bob.

721
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,240
It's easy and it's free.

722
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,760
Government health experts taking a bribe.

723
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,380
Pimples.

724
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,760
Fatal pneumonia.

725
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,700
Healthy cigarettes in New York City.

726
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,800
I tried to quit, but I'm addicted.

727
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:19,800
I'm addicted.

728
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,420
I'm addicted.

729
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:20,620
I'm addicted.

730
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,840
Come November.

731
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,840
Incumbent.

732
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,580
If you're looking for a job, do not look.

733
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,860
But if you're looking for a career.

734
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,860
Aura? That all of.

735
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,340
Oh, no.

736
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,720
No, no, no, no, no, no.

737
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,180
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

738
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,100
Let me chew my nails. Let me chew my nails.

739
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:40,920
Climaxes.

740
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,200
Don't miss this 4-hour do-it-yourself festival.

741
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,200
And much more.

742
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,840
Be cheap.

743
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,180
So, here's the bottom line.

744
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,720
Be cheap.

745
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,140
Here's the bottom line.

746
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,900
Harmful chemicals.

747
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,920
What do you get for that hard man?

748
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,360
I don't want Hillary on his stick.

749
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,900
Mm-hmm.

750
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,920
Last week, you may remember, we told you good news for cat lovers.

751
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,160
I've always known cat was good.

752
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,420
Yes, cat made with vinegar.

753
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,360
Vinegar?

754
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,020
Cat experts say vinegar is the secret of cat's marvelous flavor.

755
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,600
I never tasted such marvelous flavor.

756
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,620
Nobody could miss the way it brings out the best in cat flavor.

757
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,240
So next time you make up your shopping list, you'll say,

758
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,620
Cat is wonderful.

759
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,360
And best of all,

760
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,700
Gold.

761
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,820
I recommend gold.

762
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,780
Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold.

763
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,380
Gold, it's free, and there's gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold now.

764
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,280
Gold today.

765
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,240
Gold today.

766
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,400
Gold, that's gold.

767
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,680
My machine.

768
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,580
My machine.

769
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,500
My machine.

770
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,240
My machine.

771
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,300
My machine.

772
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,220
My machine.

773
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,120
My machine.

774
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,020
My machine.

775
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,740
My machine.

776
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,140


777
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,740
My machine.

778
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,580
My...

779
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,400
This is the thought of my reaction.

780
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,320
Conviction, confusion, suspicion

781
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,100
What a long reaccusation

782
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,880
With a face of opposition to it

783
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,740
I am a machine

784
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,560
I am a machine

785
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,680
With the fruit of my endeavors

786
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,100
Hates the bitter and the sweet

787
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,720
Too intense to pour my efforts

788
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,200
No submission, taste the sweetness

789
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,480
I am a machine

790
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,080
I am a machine

791
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,760
My machine

792
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,380
My machine

793
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,420
Hats it!

794
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,200
Conviction, confusion, suspicion

795
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,340
Hats it!

796
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,180
Conviction, confusion, suspicion

797
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,340
Hats it!

798
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,140
Conviction, confusion, suspicion

799
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,260
Hats it!

800
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,900
Conviction, confusion, suspicion

801
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,160
Hats it!

802
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,840
Conviction, confusion, suspicion

803
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,920
Hats it!

804
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,800
Conviction, confusion, suspicion

805
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,060
Hats it!

806
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,220
Thank you.

807
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,000
Thank you.

808
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,720
Thank you.

809
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,500
Thank you.

810
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,180
Thank you.

811
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,120
Thank you.

812
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,780
Thank you.

813
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,340
Thank you.

814
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,620
Thank you.

815
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,960
Thank you.

816
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,160
Thank you.

817
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,780
Thank you.

818
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,560
Thank you.

819
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Thank you.

820
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,420
Thank you.

821
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,640
Thank you.

822
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,780
Thank you.

823
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,080
Thank you.

824
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,920
accompanied students at the Chilswood

825
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,060
ElMME and Gie frost rented back

826
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:41,820
They had not discovered the seki

827
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,720
SeekiSneJah,

828
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,960
stick to achieve shelter,

829
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,360
fire, and

830
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,260
fertility.

831
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,900
As we see here in Diorama

832
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,000
15, all of the

833
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,920
people of the village have converged

834
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,560
upon a pyramid-looking

835
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,420
monument of some kind.

836
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,040
The Pyramid of Bob, they call it.

837
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,020
And there's the face on the top of the

838
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,820
pyramid, and we notice that

839
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,640
the artist here... There's a broken stump

840
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,520
where the pipe once

841
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,540
jutted out from the mighty face.

842
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,660
That's correct, sir. A pipe has

843
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,960
been jutting out of the noisy face.

844
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,620
10,000 slaves died to

845
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,300
carry the lintel of that great pipe.

846
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,740
Yes, sir. 10,000 slaves did

847
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,760
indeed carry the lintel all the way up

848
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,600
to the top of the pyramid, and by

849
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,380
use of some mysterious technology

850
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,700
which we yet cannot... More slaves,

851
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,700
I think, is what that mysterious

852
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,900
technology... Probably, sir. There were more slaves

853
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,960
than were needed, but the point is

854
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,840
this technology still eludes

855
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,980
us today, and look at what a miracle

856
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,840
it's created.

857
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,340
Gaze upon these mighty

858
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,120
works, ye pathetic

859
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,040
bobbies, and tremble,

860
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,340
for such is the might

861
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,660
of Bob.

862
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,620
Bob is as

863
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,420
Pharaoh, as Pharaoh

864
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,160
is as gods, Bob

865
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,420
is as the gods.

866
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,260
Isis, Osiris, Horus,

867
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,360
all are the denizens

868
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,440
of his domain.

869
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,860
Look out over the window.

870
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,360
This only shines through

871
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,400
on the fortnight of the

872
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,260
Beezlewhip. On this

873
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,480
night and this night only,

874
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,980
the face is seen over the vast

875
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,160
desert and creation.

876
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,500
Look.

877
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,680
That's the wrong face.

878
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,260
The other gods had to sit in the

879
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,060
waiting room of the great

880
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,020
god, Bob, the

881
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,640
over-god, or the

882
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,180
over-mind of all

883
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,440
souled and insolent

884
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,240
beings. Believe me,

885
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,180
it ain't no fun being an elder

886
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,300
god. When I was

887
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,340
a younger god,

888
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,040
I could move

889
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,520
mountains from old as my mind

890
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,400
did my better.

891
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,180
Wait a minute.

892
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,180
When I was a...

893
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,560
I am civilized, man.

894
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,300
Using the power of the weak,

895
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,520
I built the pyramids.

896
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,320
Copyrighted. 1969.

897
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,920
The Fireside Theater.

898
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,540
Thanks for mentioning that part.

899
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,380
I had to be an old man and quote...

900
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,380
At least I'm not quoting Monty Python or

901
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,320
The Simpsons.

902
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,320
Now I'm thinking about...

903
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,440
George Tirebiter.

904
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,540
Good news, everyone.

905
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,820
George Tirebiter contemplating the nature of Bob.

906
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,040
And that is a silly, silly

907
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,440
position to put yourself in.

908
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,760
It's much worse than the yoga pose

909
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,000
they call the Cobra Dog.

910
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,160
Have you ever seen anybody do that?

911
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,160
They have to wrap their anus around their...

912
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,540
Well, you have to actually...

913
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,200
The meaty part of your ear

914
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,900
has to go in the

915
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,260
encephalitis organ of the...

916
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,960
I don't know.

917
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,060
Somebody told me about it.

918
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,300
I'm not...

919
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,520
I'm not really sure about all the details.

920
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,500
Sounds like quite a dangerous pose.

921
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,940
It is not something that should be taken up

922
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,980
by the weak at heart and the inexperienced.

923
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,840
Only those who know these old manner of yoga

924
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,000
and different asanas can permit it

925
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,260
to try the Cobra Dog thing,

926
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,020
whatever was described earlier.

927
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,180
Only those who are allowed into the temple

928
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,340
of the Dobbs

929
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,580
may learn such...

930
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,720
such...

931
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:17,760
such...

932
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,880
tricky sex moves,

933
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,240
such as this one.

934
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,060
The monkey proffers a peach.

935
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,020
The monkey...

936
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,060
A big favorite of Connie's,

937
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,580
discovered by the monk Bob.

938
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,920
This is also in the Chinese

939
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,380
Kamikaze also.

940
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,540
It tickles me so much.

941
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,580
That's why the monkey proffers...

942
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,240
That's why the monkey is supposed to tickle you

943
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,280
like a monkey.

944
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,100
He's a very ticklish profferer,

945
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,480
that little monkey is, isn't he?

946
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,520
That's what we're looking for, my lad.

947
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,900
That apple at the end of his little skinny arm.

948
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,220
That's what we're looking for.

949
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,300
I mean a peach.

950
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,800
Ticklish monkeys who like the peach.

951
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,620
Ah, the ticklish monkey.

952
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,880
That's what we've been breeding for.

953
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,320
Unfortunately, humans resulted.

954
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,160
The Yetis were trying to breed a ticklish monkey,

955
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,800
and what they came up with was a hairless ape,

956
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,940
which now is called a human being

957
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,220
by other human beings who are just hairless apes.

958
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,460
Right. And we're trying to breed a human being, by other human beings who are just hairless apes.

959
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,700
As opposed to us, who are hairless Yetis.

960
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,440
It's different.

961
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,020
It's vastly different.

962
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,020
The organs are even arranged differently.

963
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,720
People just don't understand that there are those among them

964
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,280
who are not among them.

965
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,320
Can we... must we...

966
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,960
How can we reiterate this?

967
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,040
How can we make this clear to people?

968
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,680
There are the people next to you in the bus.

969
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,520
Don't even try. Don't even try.

970
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,480
Don't gaze into their eyes.

971
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,000
They're not even really eyes you're gazing into.

972
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,700
They have too much intelligence to be able to understand Bob's word.

973
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,440
They're too, quote, smart.

974
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,080
They're too, quote, smart.

975
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,660
They're too, quote, smart.

976
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,080
To even begin to comprehend the simplicity,

977
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,040
the perfect clarity,

978
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,700
the single note that Bob is playing of slack,

979
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,700
the note of slack.

980
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,860
Each person hears it differently in the distance.

981
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,820
I hear it as A-flat, tired.

982
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,300
I hear it as B-flat, on top of yourself.

983
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,280
And some feel it rising up from between their legs.

984
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,060
Like the condolini smiling through the organs of the earth.

985
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,320
And others have a C-flat.

986
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,480
Acidly flux.

987
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,920
Don't try that again, you'll hurt me.

988
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,540
But friends, even though you may want to choke it up and spit it out,

989
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,560
no, you must swallow the word of Bob.

990
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,880
Hook, line, and sinker.

991
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,980
For is he not the salesman?

992
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,740
The man of sales who came

993
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,760
and continues to for you.

994
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,740
Thank you. Thank you.

995
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,800
I'd just like to thank the other sales managers

996
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,140
for allowing the Reverend Ivan Stang

997
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,760
of the Church of the Subgenius,

998
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,600
the foundation church for all of us here at the Subgenius Seminar,

999
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,640
for that wonderful prep.

1000
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,960
And the steak and beans philosophy behind it's going to put a lot of you and your in on the map.

1001
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,180
So don't forget to make one right up.

1002
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,900
I'm your cartographer for tonight.

1003
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,720
Step right up in the book.

1004
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,560
The bonds are loaded.

1005
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,520
We've got factory direct refreshments.

1006
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,760
And some of the kids aren't even from this planet.

1007
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,560
So let's just respect each other as long as we can because it's going to be over soon.

1008
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,120
Let's get out the cell, cell, cell, cell.

1009
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,620
Just like Bob would. Cell, cell.

1010
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,360
You, you in the back. You're not...

1011
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,000
Put him in a cell.

1012
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,440
Throw him in the sales cell.

1013
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,100
Not the sales cell.

1014
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,760
The poor sales. The cell for the poor sales.

1015
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,440
No, no, no. He's not. He's not.

1016
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,380
No, not the...

1017
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,060
I'm not going to throw out. I ain't doing anything wrong.

1018
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,200
I'm afraid you have done something wrong.

1019
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,300
You've interrupted a Church of the Subgenius Sales Seminar meeting.

1020
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,540
I'm sorry.

1021
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,840
And now it's time for you to take a brief relapse in the sales cell.

1022
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,060
Hey, have either one of you guys seen the Bigfoot corpse photo?

1023
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,580
From Soviet Georgia.

1024
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,440
Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's why the Russians are invading Georgia.

1025
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,140
Right, that's what...

1026
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,360
Because the Georgians found the Atlanteans out there.

1027
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,080
The Atlanteans actually of Georgia found the corpse of a Bigfoot.

1028
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,360
Well, they said it was the Lemurians.

1029
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,540
Real Yeti?

1030
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,300
Either that or they rented a costume and put some possum guts across the top of it.

1031
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,400
Right, or the decorum. It might have been the actual corpse.

1032
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:32,840
That was the sad thing is that the DNA tests on the recently found Bigfoot corpse revealed only the DNA of Hugh Mann and Opossum.

1033
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,900
Yes. Is it true? Is Bigfoot not a Yeti or a Sasquatch actually, but a possum man?

1034
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,620
Perhaps somebody who played dead all the way from the island of Dr. Moreau?

1035
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,860
Good Lord, man.

1036
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,780
Maybe it was playing dead to begin with as it lay there.

1037
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,120
Right, and it's still playing dead. That never occurred to me.

1038
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,480
Man!

1039
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:59,880
That thing could be crawling out of that freezer of those poe buckers in Atlantean Georgia any second now.

1040
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,520
Yeah.

1041
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,740
It had perfect teeth.

1042
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:05,860
Wake up, Lembo.

1043
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,540
There was a close-up of the creature's mouth with its tongue poking out.

1044
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:15,280
The tongue looked like a cow's tongue from the store and the teeth were perfect.

1045
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,340
Well, that's what they did.

1046
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:23,220
The whitest, smoothest, most unmarked wild animal teeth you ever saw in your life. In the photo I saw.

1047
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:23,800
Probably.

1048
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,120
Of course, it could have been touched and touched and touched and retouched.

1049
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,060
Well, it certainly was touched as well.

1050
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,300
Somebody was touched. I was touched when I heard the news that us another Bigfoot had died.

1051
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,240
I wept like a hirsute baby woman.

1052
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,880
I couldn't control myself.

1053
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:46,140
I didn't even know if they were my tears. I had the feeling that one of the obelisks was beaming tears into my eyes.

1054
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,880
Like, I'm for the Earthmen to cry. And then we all cry in unison.

1055
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,240
There are so few yetis left.

1056
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,360
Well.

1057
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,980
In Georgia, in Soviet Georgia.

1058
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:01,500
But what if they are not only part Russian but part opossum and part plosive?

1059
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,480
Then you really don't know when they're dead or when they're just drunk.

1060
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,960
Right. They're just lying around and stuff. But you don't want to make them mad, I guess.

1061
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,220
I guess that's the lesson as the lexicon actually we should do.

1062
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:20,580
Well, I live over in Cleveland Bluffs. There's a lot of old Russian ladies that remind me of Bigfoot.

1063
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,820
I don't mean to be ethnically snorish like that.

1064
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,060
But come on. They really actually do.

1065
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:36,940
Well, my ancestors wore babooskas. And yet none of them were familiar with the saints or hollow beings or the exoskeletons of weird beings.

1066
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,140
Bags?

1067
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,500
I thought your ancestors were Urovians.

1068
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:46,740
Oh, yeah. That's right. They're from south central eastern southern part.

1069
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,740
Dave-mania.

1070
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:54,080
Those women in our neighborhood are not yetinsins. They're just Russian women.

1071
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,160
Old.

1072
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,200
Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy.

1073
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,380
Sturdy. Of sturdy stock.

1074
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,720
Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy. Come here 1922.

1075
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,580
Fierce looking. They have an expression like a yeti.

1076
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,400
1907.

1077
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:06,920
Have you ever seen a Russian woman?

1078
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,500
Have you ever tried smiling at them?

1079
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,460
Only once.

1080
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,400
And what happened?

1081
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,400
I can see the scar. You don't have to tell me what happened.

1082
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,780
It moved down.

1083
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,140
It would be better for the show if you did.

1084
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:18,900
Oh, no, no.

1085
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,600
Tell us what happened. Is that a wind socket or is that actually your colostomy bagger?

1086
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,720
Come on.

1087
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,940
I'm forgetting something. There's something really important that we're supposed to say on this show.

1088
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,600
Well, number one, you're not wearing headphones. It looks like you're wearing one of those balloon hats.

1089
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:47,180
Oh, my grandbaby is due in a second. This is actually as we do this show on August 17th of this time, not your time, listener.

1090
00:49:49,020 --> 00:50:00,200
My daughter, my dafter, Sivit, is due to throw or whelp her first litter of little stangies.

1091
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:00,660
Whelplings.

1092
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,420
Little teeny stang grandchild.

1093
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:04,960
Yeah.

1094
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:05,720
Stang.

1095
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:16,000
And that's supposedly due any second now. Princess Wee's cell phone, there's that word again, cell, should ring in the prison of her mind.

1096
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,300
And then we'll know.

1097
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:23,280
We'll know if it's a boy or a girl. Or a man or beast.

1098
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,240
Not man! Not beast! But thing! Thing!

1099
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,400
What if she were to give birth to perhaps two strapping young lads she'd love?

1100
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:34,400


1101
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:42,120
She wanted to call them Romulus and Remus. And then suddenly, as their grandfather, you would become Saturn, the mighty emissary of the sun.

1102
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,440
The progenitor.

1103
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,860
Not crows. The progenitor. And then they would start a noble city on seven hills. And then they would...

1104
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:56,560
They shall call me Dad. No, actually, they shall call me D-Doll.

1105
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,680
D-Doll and Weemo.

1106
00:50:59,140 --> 00:50:59,980
D-Doll.

1107
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,500
Oh, you shall.

1108
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,600
You shall.

1109
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,880
No doubt we'll end up being called whatever that first child can pronounce.

1110
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,320
And that'll be the name that sticks.

1111
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:18,360
I was the first grandchild on either side in my family, and I got to name one set of grandparents Noon and Nunk.

1112
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,100
And the other set was called Mamu and Papu.

1113
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:28,220
And all of the cousins and siblings that followed all used those same names.

1114
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,140
I called my grandpa Bursar.

1115
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,360
And my grandmother Reprobate.

1116
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,180
And I also... There was a curmudgeonly Stinquistle, and there was one guy, Cornucopius.

1117
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,720
You've had a good diction as a child, because all I could say was Noon and Nunk.

1118
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:47,360
Well, I stuck out my tongue the same way you did like that, but I have a split in my tongue.

1119
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:48,520
Papu.

1120
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:48,980
Weemo.

1121
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,340
This is why I'm gifted with language.

1122
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,300
I love you, Weemo.

1123
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,780
I'm part snake. You don't know until you look deep into my...

1124
00:51:59,520 --> 00:51:59,920
Sorry.

1125
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,060
Dave the Snake Man.

1126
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,200
You know, I was thinking about that show Lost, and if Dave...

1127
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,580
If Subgenius was Lost, or Lost Island was X-Day...

1128
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,440
Yes, yes, yes.

1129
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,100
Dave would be Locke, because he's a man of faith.

1130
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:23,100
And I would, of course, be represented by Jack Shepard, man of science.

1131
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,920
And also because I look so much like Matthew Fox.

1132
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,920
Especially when he's a degenerate in the flash-forwards.

1133
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,740
When he has the beard and is doing all the drugs.

1134
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,940
I really look a lot like Matthew Fox in Lost.

1135
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,480
But, yeah, Dave, you're probably not familiar with that show.

1136
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,120
No, I'm an extreme intellectual type person.

1137
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:42,980
I don't watch television.

1138
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,260
It's against my religious self-awareness.

1139
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,740
We don't watch television.

1140
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,620
We only download.

1141
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,400
See, we download.

1142
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,120
That's different.

1143
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,220
We download television.

1144
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,360
Right, right, right.

1145
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,000
So then, yeah, you're not a boob dude, you're a vidiot guy.

1146
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,300
Yeah, we are.

1147
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,980
We just had to skip the commercials.

1148
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,980
Just don't watch broadcast.

1149
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:09,000
So do you like make decisions in your normal, everyday, earthly man and wifely life based upon if Jack, you know, bungles his way through the dinosaur necks?

1150
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,700
On that show.

1151
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,460
In fact, that show can be used like the I Ching.

1152
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:26,100
And if you refer to the blast-proof door map, you can actually have your own life guided by the, wherever you spin the map and where it lands.

1153
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,960
The blast door map that I'm talking about.

1154
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,380
It only shows up under black light.

1155
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:35,560
So are you spurted out into the cartological design of this map area?

1156
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,100
I mean, you're just instantly teleported there?

1157
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,020
Only if you enter the numbers on time.

1158
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:42,840
Oh.

1159
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,980
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

1160
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,060
On what kind of time frame?

1161
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:47,680
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

1162
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,780
You can tell we got really nerded out.

1163
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:55,380
For three months, all Princess Wee and I did was watch one episode of that show every night.

1164
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,400
And we finally got through.

1165
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:58,720
I'm soaking it.

1166
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,960
Now we're going to watch it.

1167
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,380
Now we're caught up to where everybody else is.

1168
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,760
And it's back to being a complete mystery.

1169
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,240
And thank God it's not on anymore because we've been watching other things instead.

1170
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,880
The last time.

1171
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,460
What did we see last night?

1172
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,440
The 400 Follies of Satan by Georges Melies.

1173
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,060
Yeah.

1174
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,620
Hand-colored 1906 film.

1175
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,040
Yeah, that was cool.

1176
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,100
Piano accompaniment.

1177
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,320
In which Satan and his imps hopped around and did little acrobat tricks.

1178
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,480
They were rollick and flock.

1179
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,420
Appeared and disappeared in puffs of smoke.

1180
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,520
That was like the Star Wars of its day.

1181
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,780
And the color comes and goes.

1182
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,380
And the voice box breaks.

1183
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:40,360
Was it like the first film by Lex Cargo or whatever his name of train arriving at a station?

1184
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

1185
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,880
Well, it's almost time to.

1186
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:49,100
Yeah, we have to move into collage and fade out time.

1187
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:55,900
Plus, I wanted to get in just before we leave the recordings from Bob Bob Day from 80808.

1188
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,460
Oh, yes.

1189
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,800
With Ms. Star Sistar.

1190
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,640
And if you listen real carefully, you can hear little Mr. Sistar ask if it's going to

1191
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:02,940
rain.

1192
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:03,800
And we wanted to make an announcement.

1193
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,360
But we should have to play that now.

1194
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,600
It's been edited today.

1195
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,540
Connie's Ovaries.

1196
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,040
Some sort of holy pronouncement about Connie's Ovaries.

1197
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,800
And Connie's Ovaries.

1198
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,220
Today is the day.

1199
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,200
Today is the day of, yeah, Connie's Ovaries.

1200
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,440
So fry them up, friends.

1201
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,520
Ovariesy, scrambled omelet, wherever you want to do it.

1202
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,820
Slice it as a piece of paper delicious anyway.

1203
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,780
And if you need more information about the Hour of Slack and the Church of the Subgenius,

1204
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,780
you can certainly check our website at www.thehourofslack.com.

1205
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:27,780


1206
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:27,780


1207
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:27,780


1208
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:27,780


1209
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:27,780


1210
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:27,780


1211
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:27,780


1212
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,460
And now, thanks to Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1213
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,000
Thank you.

1214
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,420
And Princess Wee Ardo, queen of all the UFOs.

1215
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:44,000
We now go to our prepared, prepared, prepared ending for this show.

1216
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,160
We now go to our prepared ending.

1217
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,380
This is our Astrid Ask.

1218
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:50,460
Often urged us to live each moment with great ask in view.

1219
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:57,460
But the women who flourish most, who delight most in that calling and are best at it, these

1220
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,780
are women who are the best at it.

1221
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:57,780


1222
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:57,780


1223
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:57,780


1224
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,440
Women who are aware of the world.

1225
00:55:59,520 --> 00:55:59,980
They're aware.

1226
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,340
The mom who is home.

1227
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,180
I think the moms to be mom.

1228
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,940
They're aware of things.

1229
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,560
So this woman will delight most.

1230
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,820
Big enough to say in front of him, probably going to shrivel up on her and she's going

1231
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,560
to feel that it's small and constraining.

1232
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,320
My mind wasn't well done and my mind was small and constraining.

1233
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,600
All right, friends, we're here at where it is.

1234
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,100
We're here at the

1235
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:30,140
Rarities on Probability Pasture Road in Cleveland.

1236
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:38,720
Reporting to you on the hour of slack that as we record this with Mr. Arsistar, Princess

1237
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:44,980
Wee and little Mr. Arsistar, this is the day, the day of, yes?

1238
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,280
It's Bob-Ob Day.

1239
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,200
It's Obob Day.

1240
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:49,260


1241
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,200
Obob or Bob-Ob.

1242
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,520
August 8th, 2008.

1243
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,500
Or Spirit.

1244
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:54,580
Or Spirit.

1245
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:54,580


1246
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:54,920
Or Zub.

1247
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,580
Zub, as we would say.

1248
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,020
Yeah, H-O-A-Zub.

1249
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,020
It's Zub.

1250
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,300
A blessed date because it's a Bob date.

1251
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,420
And we are cognizant of that.

1252
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,420
Very cognizant.

1253
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:15,380
And so cognizant that we're bearing down on 8.08 p.m. according to my watch.

1254
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,000
Yes, it's...

1255
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,660
Which is fixed to French Mean Time.

1256
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,040
It's 8.08 somewhere.

1257
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,240
Bob o'clock.

1258
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,000
Bob o'clock.

1259
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:25,300
That's right.

1260
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,800
Technically not right here in Cleveland.

1261
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,600
It's Obob.

1262
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,300
It's actually 6.08.

1263
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,260
Obob.

1264
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,060
But it's in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

1265
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,020
Obobob.

1266
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,760
It's already 8.08.

1267
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,580
People in Newfoundland are joyous.

1268
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:37,980
Yes.

1269
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,540
They're shouting it is now the moment.

1270
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,500
It is not just the day of Bob.

1271
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,060
Eh?

1272
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,860
But the very minute of Bob.

1273
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,980
The second of Bob.

1274
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,700
Man, these wereby fries.

1275
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,120
8.08 and 8 seconds.

1276
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,580
Oh, man, we missed that one.

1277
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,620
Oh, yeah.

1278
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:53,960
8.08.

1279
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,340
8.08.

1280
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:54,580
8.08.

1281
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:54,580


1282
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:54,580


1283
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:54,580


1284
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:54,620
8.08.

1285
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:54,620


1286
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:54,620


1287
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,020
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1288
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,200


1289
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,200


1290
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,200


1291
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,200


1292
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,620
That would be Bob-Bob-Bob.

1293
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,140
Bob-Bob-Bob.

1294
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,120
Bob-Bob-Bob.

1295
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:58,560


1296
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,420
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1297
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:06,480
Meanwhile, the hundreds of people in line are trying to ignore us as we.

1298
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,000
That is good.

1299
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,580
As we can arf down our sandwiches.

1300
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,260
No, no.

1301
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,100
And I keep the hand away from the food.

1302
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:15,320
The hand.

1303
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,160
Wow.

1304
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:18,640
Rain?

1305
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,740
No, it's not going to rain.

1306
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,180
Well, maybe it will rain on the Bob-Bob Day.

1307
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:30,600
You know, if you save the rain on Bob-Bob Day in a vial, you can cure things later.

1308
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,260
You better have a vial later today.

1309
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,820
For the next hundred years.

1310
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,820
Save the rain from tonight and sell it on the internet.

1311
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,240
Drops in little tiny vials.

1312
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,680
Lucky Bob water that heals.

1313
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,100
Two drops on my windshield already.

1314
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,960
Lucky healing Bob power water.

1315
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:59,560
But I must finish my chili because, according to my calculations,

1316
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:06,880
that the real 808, it will cause me to produce an erectation at precisely the right moment.

1317
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,360
Ah, there you go.

1318
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,140
You're timing your pyroflaculation perfectly.

1319
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,260
Mmm.

1320
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,140
Mmm.

1321
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:16,760
Mmm.

1322
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,240
Mmm.

1323
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:18,740
Mmm.

1324
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:19,620
Mmm.

1325
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,180
Mmm.

1326
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,080
Mmm.

1327
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,300
Mmm.

1328
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,220
Mmm.

1329
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:25,460
Mmm.

1330
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:25,640
Mmm.

1331
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,060
Mmm.

1332
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,260
Mmm.
