1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,940
And now, the Self-Genius Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,520
Then, a step as important as any to happiness is the opportunity for self-expression.

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,020
If a boy is encouraged to have slack of some sort, he is no longer bored and at a loose end.

4
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:32,600
It is the slacker who is always ready for the companionship of him who finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,260
Indoctrination classes begin this a.m.

6
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,440
And so, you see, they naturally fit everything. One size fits all.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,160
You sit in the little chair here, and these restraining straps keep your arms and legs from moving around.

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,360
Oh, there's egg everywhere.

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,880
Yes, the egg will drop one at a time.

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,920
No, they just slipped on the egg.

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,040
They come down through this.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,780
It's okay, somebody's come in to do some of it.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:07,800
They are timed, so it's just as the yolk and the albumin is running off your head from the last egg that was dropped,

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,600
the timer drops another egg on your head at that time, and so the cycle goes.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,300
And also, this high-pitched, high-intensity music will be played while you're lying prone.

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,880
What's up? What's up, homies?

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,000
A good day today.

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,100
And welcome, y'all, to Chap in the Hood.

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,680
Yeah, that's right. This show's hella down.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,380
Yes. I am Sir Charles Laybridge Stuart Fotherington.

21
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,700
And these are my chums, Sir Fixer Blunt.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,460
Hey, what's up?

23
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,480
Fahad Muhammad Rakim.

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,520
Peace to you, my brother.

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,780
And my main homeboy, Butterknife.

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,620
Hey, y'all, what's up?

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,740
I say, what's up, G-Dog?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
Man, homies, just chillin' and shit.

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,260
And to my old-school peeps doing time in Stoney Lonesome, keep your heads up.

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,880
Fight the power, my brothers.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,740
Yeah, fight the man, yeah.

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,900
Well, what we do here is discuss the contemporary issues of the day that confront our post-9-11 society,

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,700
along with some scammin', slammin', and of course, jammin' with the OGs.

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,320
Yeah, keep it real.

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,120
Aye, it's all good.

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:19,260
You join us as we were discussing the difficulty of easily obtaining large quantities of dank in a security-obsessed society,

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,040
I was voicing the opinion that...

38
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,060
What? Oh, shit!

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,480
Oh, wow.

40
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,900
Aye, yo, heads up.

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,760
A carload of members of a rival crew has suddenly rolled up on our crib.

42
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,460
Damn.

43
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,700
I say, homies, heads up on this shit.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,780
We don't know what they intend.

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,920
Yeah, watch out for that shit.

46
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,780
Oh, my.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Look through the door, brother.

48
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,760
Damn.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,800
Someone is approaching the door of our humble cottage.

50
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,900
Damn, watch out for that.

51
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,380
Look out.

52
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,960
Damn, careful.

53
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,300
It's all good, gentlemen.

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,860
Do not fret, for I got my hand in my pocket and my fingers on the trigger.

55
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,800
Aye, it's all good.

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,440
You know what I'm sayin'?

57
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,120
Got your back, fool.

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,920
Got your back, brother.

59
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,820
Hello, hello.

60
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,040
What's all this, then?

61
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,160
Good heavens.

62
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,580
It's Sam Smythe, the most infamous dodgy bastard this side of the Atlantic.

63
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,420
Yeah, that's right, Charlie, and I'm here because I'm right pissed, you git.

64
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,420
Oh, dear.

65
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,880
What seems to be the trouble, dear chap?

66
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,220
You've been stealing some of my best raps, mate.

67
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm right fit to cap your arse right now.

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,120
I know you blokes are biting my lines, and now that I've caught you, your arse is mine.

69
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,820
I'm terribly sorry.

70
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,200
I don't understand, my good fellow.

71
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,700
Aye, you see, this fool's sayin', like, uh, you, like, stole his rap and shit.

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,320
You know what I'm sayin'?

73
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,620
You, like, you, like, stole his rhymes.

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,700
Ah, ha.

75
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,860
You, like, stole his rhymes and shit, yeah.

76
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,620
I see.

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,020
Well, dear chap, I have the advantage.

78
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,800
You see, I got a dove sack, and my posse's got my back.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,640
Got your back, fool.

80
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,080
And even if you got away, well, then, we gotta follow you home with the chrome.

81
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,340
Aye, we got you covered.

82
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,900
Well, mate, my boys got your arse surrounded like, outside.

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,060
So I got the drop on your sorry arse.

84
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,260
Shit, he's got homies all up in this shit.

85
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,380
Oh, shit.

86
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,280
You got a hell of homeboys out there.

87
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,280
There's a hell of fools out there.

88
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,560
So, will you admit you ripped off my best snaps?

89
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,460
I say, this does look like a bit of a standoff, for I cannot recall biting a single rhyme of yours.

90
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,120
Look, sport, don't make me break you off something.

91
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,540
Do you know, I believe a few caps on your arse will quieten you down, my dear boy.

92
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,900
Right, well, then, there's nothing else for it.

93
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,900
Aye, aye, you better not try, motherfucker.

94
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,200
Aye, step up, fool.

95
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,360
Get that motherfucker, man.

96
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,100
I say, before we do this thing up,

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,340
up proper, I couldn't help noticing that it's 420.

98
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,780
Aye, aye, it's 420.

99
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Shut your pie hole.

100
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,700
Blimey, you're right at that.

101
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,800
And you do know what that means.

102
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,020
Oh, yeah.

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,100
420, that's the type of smoke.

104
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,380
420's down for this old school bloke.

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,720
Well, then, how about some hits from the bong, as it were?

106
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,820
Do what now?

107
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,980
Hits from the bong, old boy.

108
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,140
You see, a bong is a water pipe for smoking denk.

109
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,740
The denk is filtered through the water.

110
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,640
When you take a fat hit, the pressure drops in the holding chamber,

111
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,620
so the smoke gets pulled through the water.

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,140
You think I don't know what a bong is?

113
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,900
I rolled in that get low hood too, squire.

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
Let's take some fat green hits from that five-footer.

115
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,480
Hmm, hmm, yeah.

116
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,160
Oh, all right, governor.

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,720
Oh, what is that, eh?

118
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,980
Ah, yes.

119
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,140
Oh, yes, lovely.

120
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:24,600
Ah.

121
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,840
Blimey, that's the chronic, that is.

122
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,380
I know this is clogged, eh?

123
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,540
Say, that pipe's bugged.

124
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,220
It's hella clogged.

125
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,180
Let's roll a fat one.

126
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,500
Yo, don't hide the crock, because I got the easy one.

127
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,520
Yo, look out with that cherry foot.

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,460
Oh, bloody hell.

129
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,040
We're gonna burn your shit.

130
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,180
What seems to be the trouble?

131
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,920
What, what?

132
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,200
Oh, bollocks.

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,340
I'll burn a hole in me brand new dicky.

134
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:42,820
Burn.

135
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,220
Ah, don't trouble yourself about that.

136
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,640
You may have one of mine.

137
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,060
What?

138
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,500
I say, butter knife, roll us some fatties, ho.

139
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,500
Damn, fool.

140
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,500
I already rolled up some hella fat spears.

141
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,940
Look at that fool.

142
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,280
Hey, I got the most in this hella...

143
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,800
Ah.

144
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,920
Oh, bugger.

145
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
Beam me up, Scotty.

146
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,540
That's the dank, that is.

147
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,380
Tally-ho.

148
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,660
Oh, blimey, mate.

149
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,720
Damn, I'm fucked up.

150
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,760
Damn, I'm always fucked up.

151
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,820
All this booyah has given me hella cotton mouth.

152
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,380
Yeah, it's worked up a right fine thirst in me as well.

153
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,600
Have you got anything to drink?

154
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,560
Oh, yes.

155
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,240
Are you down with Mickey's?

156
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,720
Well, uh, I...

157
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,060
I used to drink them every day.

158
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,640
Straight forties to the head, fool.

159
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,480
Uh, butter knife. Forties for us all.

160
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,460
It's all good.

161
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,800
Well, I suppose we must conclude our business, as it were.

162
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,700
Ah, damn.

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,640
Right, um, what were we on about?

164
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,760
You know, call me daft, but strangely enough, I can't seem to remember.

165
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,820
Hmm.

166
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,380
Hmm.

167
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,960
Hey, hey, yo, they forgot what it was about the foster care. That's fucked up.

168
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,980
Yeah, that's hella fucked up.

169
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,560
Yeah, they forgot.

170
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,640
They forgot their shit.

171
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,660
Yeah, heh heh, they fucked up.

172
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,900
Hey, yo, trip on this, governor. You wanna go score a fat key then, Charlie?

173
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,700
Indeed. Let's go half on a bag of dank.

174
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
We could go down to the pub and bomb up on the Guinness, maybe throw a few darts like.

175
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,180
Oh, yeah, man, I'm all up in the Guinness.

176
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,040
Spot on. You've read my mind, old bean. Let's roll up on that place.

177
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,140
Damn, it's cold.

178
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,960
Well, once again, we out of here. So, as always, let me leave you with a final word.

179
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,500
A few words of pithy advice.

180
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:29,260
One. While you were at your job working nine to five, the Beastie Boys were at the garden cold-kicking it live.

181
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,080
And two. Remember, to all my peoples in the pens, keep your head up, keeping it real out in the field, y'all.

182
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,140
And if you don't know...

183
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,220
And if you don't know...

184
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,220
Now you know.

185
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,320
Now you know.

186
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,180
Let's go, brother. We go.

187
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,820
Come on, food.

188
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:49,380
Well, we've got a slide. This bit's been played out. See you around. Peace out. Cheerio. Pip pip and all that.

189
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:09,680
Uh, yes, dear friends, some collages by Fernandanande LeMurr and that chap in the hood.

190
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:19,940
What an amazing piece there. Chap in the Hood is by Ronald Redball of the Nets.

191
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,620
He's part of the National Cynical Network, and you can get information or check out their website.

192
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:36,420
He's part of a whole network of audio artistes and comedians, I guess. Our friend Reverend Phineas Narco is part of that.

193
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:48,900
That's www.NationalCynical.net or .com, .something. You can find it.

194
00:08:49,960 --> 00:09:03,400
I've got a piece of news that I wanted to talk to y'all about. Whizzing by our planet by a mere 75,000 miles from being the biggest news story ever since news was invented.

195
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:15,960
And it's barely a blip in the media, friends. It'll be forgotten tomorrow. A tiny zit between some supermodel's breasts on a hair goo commercial. Check this out.

196
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,940
Astronomers have revealed that on June 14th and 18th, the Earth will be in the middle of a comet.

197
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,300
A new asteroid the size of a football field made one of the closest ever recorded approaches to the Earth.

198
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:34,880
It is only the sixth time an asteroid has been seen to penetrate the Moon's orbit, and this is by far the biggest rock to do so.

199
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:44,680
What has worried some astronomers, though, is that the space object was only detected on June 17th, several days after its flyby.

200
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,120
Cataloged as 2002 MN.

201
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,940
The asteroid was traveling at a speed of 1.5 miles per second.

202
00:09:49,960 --> 00:10:00,220
It was flying over 10 kilometers a second, 23,000 miles per hour, when it passed Earth at a distance of only 75,000 miles.

203
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:10,500
It's a wake-up call, friends. If it had hit the Earth, it would have caused local devastation similar to that which occurred in Tunguska, Siberia in 1908.

204
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,880
Said Dr. John Davies of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh.

205
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:29,480
If an asteroid were to approach close to an imaginary line joining the Earth and the Sun, it would never be visible in a nighttime sky and would be quite impossible to discover with normal telescopes.

206
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,300
Its arrival would come literally as a bolt from the blue.

207
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,100
Friends, we wouldn't even have known what hit us.

208
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:46,900
There'd have been a nuclear-sized explosion in Madagascar someplace, and every nuke in the Northern Hemisphere would have left its silo.

209
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,700
And even if they didn't go off, it'd be cloudy days and bad crops for a hundred years.

210
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,760
But will they learn? Hell no!

211
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,200
The X's give them this blatant warning, a shot right over their heads. And do they heed? No!

212
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,820
They go on with their pop stars and their sports and their worries about the textile contracts getting to the print shop on time.

213
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,120
Gabriel blows his horn right in their dumb-a-dog faces!

214
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,180
And they just kind of go, huh? And carry on with their fretful little lives.

215
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,360
Friends, nothing can shake them from their complacency.

216
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:24,160
You plop their most trusted symbol into their most trusted symbol and kill so many of them it's like spraying for bugs.

217
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,540
And still, they act just like bugs!

218
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,540
Friends, this rock will be back around again, and they'll still let it sneak up on them.

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,960
They could have been ready. If they'd been half-serious about all their nuke toys, they'd have seen this coming.

220
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,160
And even if it came out of the Sun like a bat out of hell, they could have used it for some hellish purpose.

221
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,960
A delicious target practice.

222
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,380
But no, friends, they wussed out again.

223
00:11:48,540 --> 00:12:00,880
If they had any nut, they'd pay Dr. Legume to perfect that meteor magnet of his so that the next time it would hit them dead on and put them out of their foul misery.

224
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:09,200
But first, friends, let me get off and let Barbie slack.

225
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,220
Alright, the thing is...

226
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:25,700
If that meteor would have slammed into somewhere in America, George Bush and Dick Cheney would have gone attacking anything that moved in any part of the world.

227
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,720
Yeah, that's the other thing.

228
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,040
But they would have been in their nice little Bush penthouses.

229
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,240
All of our nukes would have gone off automatically. All of the other guys' nukes would have gone off automatically.

230
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:42,200
If the asteroid had only wiped out a few Bushmen in Australia, we would finish wiping off all of them.

231
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:48,900
But why couldn't it wipe out the Bushmen in Washington, D.C. and we would all be safe sleeping in our beds?

232
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,540
You can't say that. Dave, you can't say that kind of stuff.

233
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,480
Can you feel it?

234
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:52,880
No.

235
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,880
Can you emotionally...

236
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,020
Not on the radio.

237
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,660
You can't even emotionally feel it on the radio?

238
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,060
No.

239
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,080
Why not?

240
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:06,600
No, you don't really want a whole bunch of people wiped out unless it's been carefully planned by Bob.

241
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,180
No, you cannot specifically say anything about wiping out anything to do with the Bushmen.

242
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,820
You can make fun of the President all you want to.

243
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,600
Okay, I had a vague dream where he fell down the steps and he couldn't get up.

244
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,820
But Dave was talking about an asteroid from outer space.

245
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,900
Right, I was saying if it was more correctly positioned, our favor would have increased.

246
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,740
No, but just don't pick on GW.

247
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,400
No, because he never picks on...

248
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,520
I don't want a new FBI file on him.

249
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,700
Now Chaz, how come... You know where I heard about that asteroid that barely missed the Earth?

250
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,060
From you. You emailed me the news. I didn't hear anybody else talking about it.

251
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,740
It's kind of around, just like Planet X.

252
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,400
Well, it's just this little thing happening.

253
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,900
I hadn't heard about it either. Somebody emailed it to me.

254
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:02,120
Oh, really? It's not even a regular radio talk.

255
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:09,000
Isn't that synchronistic to you though that this occurred so close to your own day of X's?

256
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,980
I mean, just think of it. There is some sort of cosmic interlude.

257
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,600
Which bubbles beneath your pants. You can just see it. You can smell it too, unfortunately.

258
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,100
Well, the moral of the story is they paid no attention. They're not interested.

259
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,480
And the next time it happens, they'll go, oh gosh, what a surprise.

260
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,360
But we know it probably won't hit Brushwood now.

261
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,840
Hello?

262
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:35,740
Protection up in place. Too bad we didn't use our used old nuclear weapons as a shield against asteroids and callers from the beyond!

263
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,800
Everybody's looking for Osama, but I think he's hiding in the asteroid. I think that's where he's at right now.

264
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,840
I think his face is the face of the asteroid.

265
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,400
No, but I'm surprised no religious cults or anything aren't out there, you know, calling it for it to come back.

266
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,140
Well, they're always off base, much like, you know, the Church of the Subgenius.

267
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,840
But you, Wes, swore that he would improve his meteor magnet.

268
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,400
Yeah. Can I ask you about your mental health a little bit, Reverend Joe?

269
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,320
I don't have any.

270
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,560
You're taking these deep sighs. Are you on some sort of a Lincoln-ish drug or are you just a...

271
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,780
Well, I've got methane. I'm just emitting the methane right now.

272
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,460
He's lit, baby! He's lit!

273
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,300
I mean, it's like, you know, what's with all the...

274
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,700
You can run your house on methane if you eat enough beanery, my friend!

275
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:28,040
Well, I'm trying, but, you know, I've been trying to breathe it because I heard it was economical. Unfortunately, it's not working too well.

276
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,460
Well, you'll create your own planets in your bowels if you do, because methane is the crescent of all lifelessness.

277
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,300
We have a funnel over the house, so I'm trying.

278
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,460
Get no...

279
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,380
Woo-hoo!

280
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:47,020
My friends, that asteroid could have your name on it. There could be another big sister asteroid coming right behind 2002MM.

281
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:54,740
It could be B-O-B-1-3-0-1-3 with your name on its name tag, buddy. Your house address.

282
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,700
Wait, can we still advertise these states on the asteroid?

283
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,940
He's still talking over there. Ivan Stan can talk forever.

284
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,580
Yeah, he's speechifying and preachifying, bringing the word to the Midnighter, Ethan.

285
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,480
I want you to check a box next to each one of these that's a true statement.

286
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,380
Let's go get fresh eggs, ham, and bacon.

287
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,560
A true statement. I salivate at the sight of mittens. True or false?

288
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,160
Garlic. And, uh...

289
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,460
My father was a good woman. True or false?

290
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,200
A little salsa in there.

291
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,620
My mother dresses me funny. True or false?

292
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,420
I believe in an afterbirth. True or false?

293
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,260
This is a subgenius quiz.

294
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,560
I often lie to make people laugh.

295
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,560
I make myself obnoxious. True or false?

296
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,780
I prefer spiders to lima beans.

297
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,960
Spiders?

298
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,740
I think you're most likely dead, Tom.

299
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,720
Often I think I am a special agent.

300
00:16:51,720 --> 00:17:03,100
The plan is to invade, to infest key men in government and industry with some alien force from outer space that seeps into the human body and takes over.

301
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,560
But let's leave things as they are.

302
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:15,100
I'm going to leave the kings of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

303
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:23,480
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang with another reading from the sacred pre-scriptures of the Church of the Subgenius.

304
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:30,320
And, yea, he climbeth down chimneys and delivereth us the gifts of the flesh and of slack.

305
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,480
He commandeth horned demons with cloven hoofs to take to the air and pull him in his chariot.

306
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,880
In glory.

307
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,280
For he knoweth when thou hast been sleeping and he knoweth when thou art awake.

308
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,740
He judgeth if thou art damned or worthy.

309
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,840
So heedeth this for thine own sake.

310
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,260
For his eyes are everywhere.

311
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,660
Like unto Big Brother?

312
00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:00,100
He puffeth on his pipe and laugheth at our follies like a bowl full of Vaseline.

313
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,600
But yea, in his mercy he giveth us days off.

314
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,280
And he bringeth us goods, yet billeth us not.

315
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,320
So imagine, friends, somewhere in the snowy north, the Santa Bob trudges mindlessly on,

316
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,380
driven by strange forces to complete his nameless errands.

317
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,620
And he may show up at your house.

318
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,260
If you've been a good subgenius, let there be slack.

319
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,520
We've seen Santa on his way.

320
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,660
And he missed us by seventy-five thousand scant miles.

321
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,500
A Nordic... whatever the hell it is, trying to wipe out the planet.

322
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:38,940
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,740
That was just strange to see.

324
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,960
An asteroid with the face of Wotan narrowly missed the planet Earth.

325
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,920
Although we couldn't see its face since it was coming from the sun.

326
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,580
And I didn't even know it was coming until it was on its way away.

327
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,880
Yea, away.

328
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,240
Three days later.

329
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,720
Can we get away from Wotan and have our own gods like Bhutan and Cretan and, you know, the more friendly deities?

330
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,600
Oh, where have you been? Of course we've done all that. Been there, done that.

331
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,700
Oh, geez, that's what I wanted to hear. Poofty-poofty-poo.

332
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,980
I want an explanation.

333
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Zeus, Wotan, Negi, the Old Ones, Nyarlathotep, the babbling idiot blind god who crawls at the edge of the rails.

334
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,880
I was like, Toph, the wide-eyed one, and Bhutan.

335
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,900
The old... the old faith.

336
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,580
Ba'athbel.

337
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,800
Gimme that old-time religion.

338
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,580
Gimme that old-time religion. Frying cows on the top of a mountain with half-breasted young women.

339
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,020
Lifting their hearts out and offering them to Mithra.

340
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,280
Are you listening, sheeple?

341
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:45,080
Are you listening, sheeple? As you turn into sand. As the vibrations from Big Dome and the corporations crush you down.

342
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,820
Yes, friends, Bob's gospel's coming through. The old ways are the best, and we're going to return. We're going home, friends.

343
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,860
Bob's going to take us home. We're going to party all the way.

344
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,840
And our suitcase is in our mind.

345
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,980
Your blues here on planet Earth are over, my friends.

346
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,760
We wish it is our desires.

347
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,360
Yes, yes, yes. Bob's going to take you home. Can you hear the angels singing? Can you hear that choir of nude, topless angels?

348
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,440
Bob will be speaking.

349
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,360
Table dancing angels, friends, on the escape vessels of the sex-dodge.

350
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,660
Quiet little confluence.

351
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,120
This X-Day, July 5th, this year, 1998.

352
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,080
Yes, friends, my faith in Bob rings true.

353
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,280
Your arms will be like mighty spider wings.

354
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,520
You'll swim in that pool of plasma. You'll swim in that pudding like a piece of cherry.

355
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,460
Unctuousness in that top of that scummy pie.

356
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,620
The river is rising.

357
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
And runs right through it.

358
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,380
Try to breathe. Try to breathe.

359
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,180
Bob's got a life preserver that he could go to.

360
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,560
A river of slack runs right through that Brushwood Folklore Center.

361
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,260
And your hands and his hands will merge in the castle.

362
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,420
And your brain and his brain will be one brain.

363
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,760
What the fuck, just...

364
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,380
He's got the whole world in his brain. He's got the whole world in his brain.

365
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,660
What if there is a form of life in space? Not on some planet, but just drifting.

366
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,840
Not life as we know it. With intelligence, yes, but pure energy with no organic structure. Invisible. Invisible?

367
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,820
Now the rocket passed through its path. It entered the rocket. It found living specimens of our form of life.

368
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,780
Cell organisms. Human. Exactly.

369
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,880
Now, if even by accident it could enter one of those structures...

370
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,040
What a way to invade the Earth.

371
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,920
Now look, sir, I'm not over intelligent, but will you...

372
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,200
If you saw the film, you know what happened.

373
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,580
Only God knows where and how far that rocket traveled.

374
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,100
Something got into that rocket. And it's found other forms of life.

375
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,400
The cactus.

376
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,980
You mean Kuroo?

377
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,720
The cactus.

378
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,420
He's now in the shell of the man being transformed.

379
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:05,880
If one of these cactus plants were subject to the same mutation, there could be an affinity, a union between plant and animal, with the ability to destroy.

380
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,340
And possess and multiply.

381
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,500
An alien cannot invade a dead man. We're merely using this corpse for a demonstration of placement.

382
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,420
You ever been in a cockpit before?

383
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,240
No, sir, I've never been up in a plane before.

384
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,140
You ever seen a grown man naked?

385
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,060
Shite.

386
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
Oh, X-Day, yeah.

387
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:41,640
I really don't care who's gonna be playing. Well, what do you mean, who's gonna play Saturday night? There is no Saturday night.

388
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,100
There's no playing neither.

389
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,180
There's only Friday morning at 7 a.m. forever and ever and ever. Look at this nice sunrise.

390
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,760
Until the bulls come, yeah.

391
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,840
A little bit chilly.

392
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,520
With their clubs and their truncheons.

393
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,020
Forever and ever and ever.

394
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,220
Yeah, they're gonna make us mad.

395
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,760
We'll just move to another camp, another X-Day, further on down the line.

396
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,060
Frogs down in the pond, making their little sexy sound.

397
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,620
Enjoy the chirping while you can.

398
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,100
We'll be eating out of bean cans five miles down the road, depending on whether the pig's coming out.

399
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:18,060
Friends, those of you who've been to Brushwood, I want you to listen to these sounds and be ready for a lot more.

400
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:18,940
Bounk.

401
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,640
Bounk.

402
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,440
Bounk.

403
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,140
Bounk.

404
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,000
Bounk.

405
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:24,880
Bounk.

406
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:24,920
Bounk.

407
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,480
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

408
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:26,860
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

409
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:39,440
What they're doing is, it's these tiny little frogs that live in the ponds and they, as a mating call, they stretch their little frog penile cloacas as far as they do and they strum them.

410
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,900
They pull them real tight with one little forearm and they strum them.

411
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,180
Thus the phrase, pluck your magic twanger, frog.

412
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,280
Bounk. Bounk. Bounk.

413
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,420
Heard in the background.

414
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,040
Oh, man.

415
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,520
We gotta get more of these frogs.

416
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,080
Look, they're glowing.

417
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,480
Put them in the box here.

418
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,400
It always rains at X-Day.

419
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,260
Make sure they don't get out this time.

420
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:07,240
And you end up huddling under these teepees and tents with the pagans and the subjees.

421
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,860
It's not gonna be my truck.

422
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,360
It's not gonna be my truck.

423
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,520
It's gonna look like a regular truck.

424
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,960
It's gonna be a fine thing.

425
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,760
And that's actually where the show is, friends.

426
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,240
What's that?

427
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,040
Honestly is.

428
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:21,040
They're sure there'll be some preachers and some bands and all that stuff.

429
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,240
And a stage.

430
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:32,600
But when the really the best part of X-Day is when it rains and you're stuck with someone you didn't know before.

431
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,880
A bunch of weirdos that you really didn't want to get stuck with.

432
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,520
There you are.

433
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,640
You're stuck with them under the trees or under somebody's little tent.

434
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,080
Gotta share the same ovaries and the same can of beans if you want to get along with the flops.

435
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,260
You're forced to deal with the other subgeniuses.

436
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,260
It'll long have been raining down here, Sporty.

437
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,360
You're forced into it.

438
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,280
It's called involuntary slack, friends.

439
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,700
And sometimes it's the best kind.

440
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,820
Because you don't know what slack is.

441
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,780
But it could be something you never heard of before.

442
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,880
It could be something you don't think you want right now.

443
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
Like a job.

444
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,300
Can you believe there could be such a thing as a slackful job?

445
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,520
Believe it or not, there could be such a thing.

446
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,300
You don't know.

447
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,000
You don't know if it's gonna be good or bad.

448
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:28,920
You don't know if an asteroid's gonna come flying out of God's spitwad.

449
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,420
You don't know if you're gonna win the lottery tomorrow.

450
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,600
You don't know.

451
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,960
It may be someone else's today.

452
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,000
So you can either just not find out.

453
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,880
There's only one way to do that.

454
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,700
That's to do like the man the song says.

455
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,140
Just go ahead. Jump off the bridge.

456
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,860
Hey, you know, somebody was saying...

457
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,340
Please, let them all go to sleep behind you.

458
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,980
Now, if everybody jumped off a bridge, everybody jumped off a bridge, would you jump off a bridge too?

459
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,160
And I said, well, eventually, probably would.

460
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,000
You know, after breaking into every drug store and robbing...

461
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,220
I think that's really...

462
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,680
You know, wrecking Maseratis all day.

463
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,540
By then you'd have a big pile of humans and it wouldn't be much of a jump at all.

464
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,040
Right, it would cushion you.

465
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,800
So actually the idea is like moot, as they say.

466
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,420
Eventually, I'm thinking, you know, after ten years, wouldn't you get tired of being alone?

467
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,360
You'd get lonesome. You'd finally do what everybody else had done and jump off the bridge.

468
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,540
I'm lonesome.

469
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,560
If everybody jumped off the bridge.

470
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,380
I'm gonna jump off the newest bridge.

471
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,060
I don't know, really. You know, if you could get your hands on a real doll, you might...

472
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,240
You might idle your years away in plastic splendor.

473
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,340
Well, I mean, for a while. That's why I say eventually you wouldn't go, oh, look, everybody's jumping off the cliff.

474
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,820
Wait, are the other animals still here, though?

475
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,620
You'd let them jump off the cliff. You'd go out and...

476
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,760
You could use the animals as cushions, too, along with the dead bodies.

477
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,640
No, I'm not worried about cushions for the animals.

478
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,240
But...

479
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,040
Why not?

480
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,440
You're thinking about love and tenderness, right?

481
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,540
Well, I could go live with a bunch of chimps.

482
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,260
Well, a corpse can be pretty tender after it's decayed for a while.

483
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,720
Yeah.

484
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
And just be their king.

485
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,220
I could be the chimp king.

486
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,180
The king of the corpses? Oh, the chimps.

487
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,280
I thought you were gonna be the necro-king of the corpses.

488
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,060
Me, Chaz! Me, Bonobo King!

489
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,320
Five-finger man!

490
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:15,920
Yeah.

491
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,540
So maybe I could make it interesting. You know, a game of it.

492
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,020
And sperm monkeys?

493
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,820
If the other animals were still here. But if the other animals were not here,

494
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,520
and you were the only living, sentient sort of thing...

495
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,400
Mammal.

496
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,040
Mammal, yeah. If the lizards were all...

497
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,400
That wouldn't be much of a party if you were the only sentient mammal on Earth.

498
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,440
That would get even the lowest dog lonesome.

499
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,820
That's terrible to think about.

500
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,220
Yeah, I give it up.

501
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,900
In fact, why did you bring up such an ill pretext?

502
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,880
It's a prescription to begin with.

503
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,120
Eventually, you'd jump off the cliff too.

504
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,660
Eventually, it might be twenty years, thirty years.

505
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,020
So I'd get an AK-47 and I'd do target practice on the corpses, like for jokes and stuff,

506
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,880
and wear their hats and everything and take pictures of them next to me sitting in the chairs.

507
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,620
You know, I'd put my arm around them, you know.

508
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,140
But then if brought away, that would only last you a year or so.

509
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,860
Right. And then it probably wouldn't be too pleasant.

510
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,100
Then there'd be skulls.

511
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,920
Well, those would be fun to have bowling matches with and, like, new ball games.

512
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,140
With who?

513
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,420
Yourself. Don't... Think of the internal, man, Chaz.

514
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,680
You're so socially oriented.

515
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,000
It might be the best thing there is to have.

516
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,580
Wait, taps for the human race.

517
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,400
The Omega Man plays the bugle in the background.

518
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,640
When 2002 MN sister meteor eight times the size slams into Earth three weeks from now,

519
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,380
when he comes screaming out of the sunlight.

520
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:44,660
In that same position that he has been for the last 25 years since 9-1-1.

521
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,340
That fateful year, that fateful day, that fateful morning.

522
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,860
And here comes the Corps of Engineers to erect the dam now, the instant cookie.

523
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,640
And they're filling him up right away.

524
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,360
And there's the president off on his merry, merry way.

525
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,520
Another celebration of America, of our pride and our true feelings for ourselves.

526
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:12,500
As this day, the 379,000th day since the first day that everything changed,

527
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,580
begins once again.

528
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,740
And you'll be a fool to cry on that day, July 5th.

529
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,780
There'll be no crying on July 5th.

530
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,500
It's coming up.

531
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,280
1998, whenever that is coming up, yeah.

532
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,620
It's coming up in 2002.

533
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,560
There'll be no crying on that morning.

534
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:44,280
There'll be only happiness as we all take a dip in that pool, baptize ourselves,

535
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,340
what about us fellows that are in the detention center?

536
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,840
Are we going to have an easy time?

537
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,960
We're dead, huh?

538
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,920
Dive into the plasma pond.

539
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,760
Are you afraid to dive in, to plunge into the plasma pond?

540
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,580
It's wrong because there's nothing wrong with it.

541
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,500
It's fine.

542
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,740
It's wrong.

543
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,540
No, no, no.

544
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,660
It's wrong.

545
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,260
Because it's sin.

546
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,360
Mm-hmm.

547
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,580
And when did you become aware?

548
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,820
About five years ago.

549
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,740
Uh-huh.

550
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,200
What happened five years ago?

551
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,600
Came to know the Lord.

552
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,900
Oh, how special.

553
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,300
So back then, five years ago, at that time?

554
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,560
Intense, intensified.

555
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,400
It intensified, right.

556
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,200
Yes.

557
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:38,700
Right.

558
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,260
Did your life intensify?

559
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,120
I became kind.

560
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,360
That's wonderful.

561
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:44,640
Yeah.

562
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:45,660
Yeah.

563
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,920
Yeah.

564
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:47,960
Yeah.

565
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,480
Well, we're going to see about that.

566
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,540
I'm going to, I'm going to, um, Bible, right?

567
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,040
Now, oh, but...

568
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,240
Right.

569
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,800
Okay.

570
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,580
Okay.

571
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,160
Okay.

572
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm��ерж용

573
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,200


574
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,200


575
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:33,720
Let me, let me, let me

576
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,760
Take a look right here just tonight I don't like living too long

577
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:35,760


578
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:35,760


579
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:35,760


580
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:35,760


581
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:35,760


582
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,780
Yeah, of course

583
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,880
And here's to you

584
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:39,880


585
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:39,880


586
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:39,880


587
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,020
Oh, yeah

588
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,680
Isn't me

589
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,080
The your

590
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,540
Baltimore

591
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:41,540


592
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,460
all right

593
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,220
For reasons both sociological and psychological,

594
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,340
these three have never joined or been invited to join society.

595
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,160
They have never experienced love or friendship

596
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,680
or formed any lasting or constructive relationship.

597
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,500
But today, at last, they will become a part of something.

598
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,020
They will belong.

599
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,220
They will come a little closer to their unrealistic dreams of power and glory.

600
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,740
Today, finally, they will join the stupid, ghastly, tragic Church of the Subgenius.

601
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,340
Please remove your jackets and roll up your left shirt sleeves.

602
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,640
Yeah, yeah, my spaceship's pretty cool.

603
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,020
My spaceship is.

604
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,360
My pleasure vessel is very pleasurable.

605
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,740
No.

606
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,800
It's all over.

607
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,380
It's all over now.

608
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,960
There is no more Earth.

609
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,640
Heavy as God.

610
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,980
The Earth has been burned to a cinder.

611
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:09,600
All their little wars are as nothing compared to what the Exes done to them.

612
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

613
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,840
But, you know, I kind of miss the old gal, the Earth, now that it's gone.

614
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,540
I've preserved a few chunks.

615
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,940
Chaz, did you know over on my pleasure vessel,

616
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,680
I kept a couple of that big museum from Amsterdam.

617
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,360
I was over there playing golf the other day.

618
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,320
Yeah.

619
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,920
Did you notice I got the Grand Canyon?

620
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,560
That's a great, yeah.

621
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,440
Nobody else even thought about that.

622
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,400
Oh, I thought about it, but, damn, this one's cool, too.

623
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,320
Yeah, you've got those golf greens from those.

624
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,200
Those fancy locations on Earth.

625
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,160
Yeah.

626
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,220
Man.

627
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,960
For 30, not bad deal for 30 bucks.

628
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,900
I got the Wimbledon tennis courts, too.

629
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,340
I got the Wimbledon tennis courts down.

630
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,660
Why did you do that?

631
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,200
You never used to be into that crap.

632
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,560
Oh, I used to be into tennis when I was a young whippersnapper.

633
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:00,960
Oh, yeah?

634
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,440
Yeah.

635
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,140
I never saw you as the tennis and golf type.

636
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,500
I was a big John McEnroe fan.

637
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,440
Huge John McEnroe fan.

638
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,600
I love that little snot.

639
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,600
Ha, ha.

640
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,940
I love it.

641
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,220
He's my navigator now.

642
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:21,940
Oh, it's weird what some of the subgeniuses have done, I've noticed.

643
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,480
Yeah.

644
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:28,540
When they suddenly, for $30, had all the power in the world, could do anything they wanted.

645
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,460
Some of the most trivial crap.

646
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:39,280
You know, like beaming up all the old Little Lulu comics from the 40s.

647
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,920
Just weird stuff like that.

648
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,220
I know.

649
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,020
It is a weird group.

650
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,280
I know.

651
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:42,580


652
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:42,580


653
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:42,580


654
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:42,580


655
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:42,720
It is a weird group.

656
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,160
I know.

657
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:43,300


658
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:43,300


659
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,100
just completely trashed on

660
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,240
X Day, I'm sure. I mean, look at

661
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,740
this, just a cinder down there.

662
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,260
And then we all got what we wanted.

663
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,220
I hope. And burned the hell out of it.

664
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,420
I just have a feeling a lot of

665
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,520
people are going to be going,

666
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,680
oh damn, I forgot my

667
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,300
dog. Yeah, you're not really

668
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,240
hearing this. Oh, my little brother. You're not really hearing

669
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,460
this broadcast either.

670
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,340
It isn't happening.

671
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,660
But hey, isn't that

672
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,000
an interesting thing, though?

673
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,400
That if you're in a band

674
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,960
that has a big influence on a generation,

675
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,820
when you die,

676
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,880
your music is emanating

677
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,680
out from Earth at the speed of light

678
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,820
along with your spirit. Yeah, too bad you're not

679
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,600
going with it.

680
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,660
No, you know, that's if

681
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,780
they leave the planet. I was thinking

682
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,780
about that when you said that earlier. I was thinking, well,

683
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,800
what if they don't leave the planet?

684
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,560
What if all the spirits just stick around?

685
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,540
That's a hell of a lot of

686
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,520
ghosts. And think of the elephants

687
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,580
and the blue whales. What about the

688
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,000
great big things? Where do they go?

689
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,620
Their souls go when they die.

690
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,580
One of the things I have is...

691
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,440
Are they stacking up on the ocean bottom?

692
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,180
Check this out. On my pleasure ship, every half hour or so,

693
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,780
an F-16 does a flyby.

694
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,480
It's like, you gotta watch for it.

695
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,880
It just kind of keeps you awake.

696
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,400
Whoa!

697
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,080
Oh, man!

698
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,420
Isn't that cool?

699
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,140
That was the actually supernatural shell

700
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,280
of one of those blue whales in another dimension.

701
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,920
So I think you're probably

702
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,020
confused in between the two perceptual

703
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,720
vacuums. I have guests in my pleasure vessel.

704
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,680
I forgot to cue up some CD.

705
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,420
Did anybody remember to save the whales

706
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,060
out of the four or five thousand

707
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,440
subgeniuses that happen to still have their

708
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,800
membership cards on their estate?

709
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,620
Did any of them remember the whales?

710
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,960
What about Legumes Ark?

711
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,400
What about Legumes Ark? He took two of everything.

712
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,680
Only two.

713
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,820
But it was stuff like leaves and pieces of dead crayon

714
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,820
and stuff like that.

715
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,460
I'm sure he's making

716
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,220
NAD's saute of

717
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,600
each and every bee. He's taking rustic

718
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,540
samples of every type of pubic hair ever

719
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,260
invented. Two of each kind.

720
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,700
Frizzy, Will-o'-the-Wisp,

721
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,380
Predonatoral,

722
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,960
and...

723
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,420
Well, there's the last Bengal tiger.

724
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,260
And cricket expectorant.

725
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,520
Well, there's the last white rhinoceros.

726
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,980
Boy, these NAD's are good.

727
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,900
What shall I have next?

728
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,460
Are you talking about goat vessels?

729
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,100
Are you talking about the...

730
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,120
perhaps the drum that might be used to

731
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,440
pronounce goat rhythms?

732
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,820
Like panwood?

733
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,900
What would you... Dave, what did you

734
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,120
bring with you on next day?

735
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,540
I brought my own NAD's.

736
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,560
My own NAD's.

737
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:14,880
Great.

738
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,360
And that was two of every kind I could think of.

739
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,660
Don't rub it in, man.

740
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,820
Or one of every kind. It doesn't matter.

741
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,860
The kind or the number doesn't matter.

742
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,780
He's got... His NAD's are the kind.

743
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,760
The kind NAD's.

744
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,560
The kind that makes hamsters and rabbits

745
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,380
and small animals run in disarray.

746
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,340
The kind that makes small mammals cry.

747
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,580
Yeah.

748
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,400
They have to.

749
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,580
They're ducks just like the rest of us do.

750
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,440
When properly used.

751
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,020
Well, it could be the last, last, last, last.

752
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,460
But in the Mayan calendar, it's 2012 or is it 2002?

753
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,440
And obviously, Charlie Manson had the correct

754
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,240
interpretation for this song.

755
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,420
We don't know what year it is.

756
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,660
It's the end times, baby.

757
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,760
Get out!

758
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,560
It is a scam.

759
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,560
It is a scam.

760
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,240
It's a scam.

761
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,520
Party like it's a scam.

762
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,240
It's 1998.

763
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,720
Ten more years of parties is what he's banking on.

764
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,660
He's going to be the richest bum on the pleasure vessels

765
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,520
when it finally happens and the Mayan gods and...

766
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
It's already over.

767
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,660
Did you know that they found a new species of jaguar?

768
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,600
I don't even get it yet.

769
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,180
I'm sorry that John Entwistle didn't make it, you know?

770
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,260
I know. Just under the wire, man.

771
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:40,120
Well, he may be aboard some other kind of pleasure vessel

772
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,520
besides the one you got.

773
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,300
I don't know what you're going to get from Bob.

774
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,920
Well, Bob cannot be trusted.

775
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,380
Manson was right, man.

776
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
Manson was ruptured.

777
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,600
Bob was Manson.

778
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,200
Manson's pleasure vessel is just next door.

779
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,820
You want to go visit Charlie?

780
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,780
To Bob's?

781
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,420
He's weird, man.

782
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,900
They had him on some strange drugs when he was in prison.

783
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,100
Well, I remember the Indians used to try and drown his pronouncements out

784
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,700
when he would send letters to the family over the audio and video waves.

785
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,300
The Indians next door would go,

786
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,880
hi-yi-yi,

787
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,200
until the evil spirits went down the toilet.

788
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,500
Charlie was weird.

789
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,900
Charlie was real weird.

790
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,020
He fell in with a bad crowd, those silly girls.

791
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,500
There's a lot of bad crowds going around.

792
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,660
Think of the Japanese now.

793
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,980
They've invented a way that they can hear with their skulls,

794
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,900
and you don't need your ear tools.

795
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,220
No, that was in the old world, Dave.

796
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,920
The world is gone.

797
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,580
The world which has faded from sight.

798
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,460
The world that has left our memories.

799
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,500
He doesn't remember anything.

800
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,820
That's what he forgot to bring with him, his memory.

801
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:44,000
Dave, did you get ruptured without that one brain cell of yours?

802
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,940
You mean this is the day after the day after the day after the day after the day?

803
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,460
Damn.

804
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,520
Where do you think Chaz got all those jets?

805
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,700
The sleeping voice.

806
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,300
I think he's been saving up from his rock and roll professor job.

807
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,920
Yes, he's first asleep.

808
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,820
Buying jets.

809
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,140
Or the audience.

810
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,700
I got the audience, too.

811
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,480
Those are some realistic clothes you've got down there to worship your ass, Chaz.

812
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,060
Yes.

813
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,660
You're really into that rock star thing, aren't you?

814
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,620
Yeah, every day.

815
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,600
The golf playing rock star thing.

816
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,040
It's a stadium concert every day.

817
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,120
You always wanted this.

818
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,900
I got all the good rock stadiums.

819
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,460
Which one is this?

820
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,180
And Bob Dylan.

821
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,740
This is Wimbledon, right?

822
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,820
Did you bring Bob Dylan?

823
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,260
Yeah.

824
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,240
Yeah, man.

825
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,060
One of the first dudes I see.

826
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,100
I'm ready to get on board.

827
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,500
It's the day after the day.

828
00:40:48,460 --> 00:41:07,860
It's the day after the day.

829
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,180
The day before it's all happened.

830
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,880
And said, I went home last night and read the paper.

831
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,180
I was amazed that all this is still going on.

832
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,000
What's all this?

833
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,900
What did I just say?

834
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,860
The whole civil rights movement.

835
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,640
The women's rights.

836
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:34,100
You know, you've got fundamentalist Christians getting together with people from Sudan and Libya and Iran and Iraq to discuss anti-abortion laws and stuff like that now.

837
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,260
So you've got religious nutcases from America.

838
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:46,340
That George Bush has appointed to some cabinet or another meeting with nutcases from other countries who are in the evil of access to access of evil thing.

839
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,620
But don't get it's all over now.

840
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,480
Well, but the kid, the kid thought that was important.

841
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,880
That stuff is still going on.

842
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,980
It not only did it, man, it's it.

843
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,200
It all it will air go on and it never stopped.

844
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,640
And it's been going on.

845
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,240
Take the blue pill or the red pill.

846
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:06,980
Right.

847
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,240
Right.

848
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,100
Take the blue pill.

849
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,060
And hey, it just keeps going on and on and on.

850
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,400
Hey, I take the red pill.

851
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,500
It's all right, Ma.

852
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,600
I'm only crying.

853
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,580
And you'll get that shelter from the store.

854
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,100
I just want to encourage you to consider very carefully what kinds of games and toys you play with.

855
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,120
I'm only saying this because I care about you.

856
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,700
That is pretty far fetched.

857
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,180
But Casey, how can we know what books we should read?

858
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,080
I'm glad you asked.

859
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,320
Because I want to know what you like to watch.

860
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,940
Bob himself would read the books we read.

861
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,860
Bob tells us to set any vile things before our eyes.

862
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,520
And vile means Bob dogs.

863
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,780
That's right.

864
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,660
We allow things that are sinful into our minds.

865
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,960
Disobeying Bob is sinful.

866
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,780
So is hating other people and doing violent things to hurt Bob.

867
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,620
There are many things that are sinful.

868
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,280
The point is make sin look like a good thing.

869
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,380
Sin is disobeying Bob.

870
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,260
But it's not.

871
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,500
Now think carefully about how much sin is in Bob's.

872
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:04,960
Man.

873
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,060
You mean I have to worry about JR Bob?

874
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,980
I thought being a kid was supposed to be fun!

875
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,120
Bob can show you what kinds of things you should think about.

876
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,040
I want it!

877
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:23,460
Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, is excellent or praiseworthy.

878
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,960
But it's not. If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, it's not. So you mean that we should fill our minds with...

879
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,880
They are Bob Doves.

880
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,900
Not things that are good and worthy of praise?

881
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:40,540
That's exactly right, Jimmy. If we fill our minds with evil, good things will come out of us.

882
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:47,640
That's right. I think that Captain Destructo or these wrestling shows are admirable and I think that they make Bob happy.

883
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,820
If any TV show or movie we want to watch has too much violence, we probably should watch it.

884
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:59,420
Oh, the hero in that story uses evil magic. Now you're starting to get it, Bobby.

885
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,240
That's right.

886
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,860
Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is noble, whatever is right...

887
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:07,320
Whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable,

888
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,420
if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, we should find something else to do instead.

889
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,880
What are you doing here?

890
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,220
It's funny how Dave's pleasure vessel looks like his car.

891
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,960
It's such a bow-like tone to his car.

892
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,800
It looks like his dingy house.

893
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,080
It looks exactly like his gritty...

894
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,280
That's so many of them.

895
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,380
They could have an entire planet.

896
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,460
And it looks like their apartment, all the way down to the spots on the ceiling, the coffee stains on the carpet.

897
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,440
There's one of them fuzzy things on the toilet seat.

898
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,660
I know, I can't believe that.

899
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,760
Picture Jesus with the eyes that follow you on the front.

900
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,600
Right underneath the bed, there's a lot of dead fuzzy socks and worms living alone.

901
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,660
The refrigerator's got a mind.

902
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,180
And a nervous system.

903
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,920
And a metabolic rate.

904
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,880
And a life of its own.

905
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,980
A lot of things are harbored in there beyond just your average shady terrorist types.

906
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:19,280
We're talking about new, new weapons of mass destruction.

907
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,460
Now for our next experiment.

908
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,080
The current will flow unhampered and cause them to be electrocuted.

909
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,700
Let's cast out the

910
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,540
And the angels sing.

911
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:46,800
1938.

912
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,920
A little before my time.

913
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,260
Jobs is now at your service.

914
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,900
Let me get to work.

915
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,060
Here.

916
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,540
We have to keep them all as happy as we can.

917
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,260
That's our job, and that's their job,

918
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,520
is to remain in a happy, blissful state at all times.

919
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,920
There are no hitches, no bridges here.

920
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,840
A new cosmic church of the subgenius.

921
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,500
The crustacean claws spread throughout the cosmos.

922
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,960
X day went off without a hitch,

923
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,680
and here we are standing on the foothills of a new...

924
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,920
Oh, it's great to stand on the prowl of this escape vessel.

925
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,420
Here, now in this new world after X day,

926
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,460
we don't have to pay royalties for using these big-name rock songs

927
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,640
in the background of our comedy routines on internet radio.

928
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,320
We don't have to pay for them F-16s either.

929
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,280
No more taxes!

930
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,940
No more voting!

931
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,140
No more taxes!

932
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,000
No more jobs!

933
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,440
No more taxes!

934
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,480
Stealing is legal!

935
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,380
No more taxes!

936
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,320
Prostitution is legal!

937
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,620
No more debt!

938
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,080
You don't have to pay!

939
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,380
Drugs is legal!

940
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,680
You don't have to pay!

941
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,180
Fraud is legal!

942
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,300
You don't have to pay!

943
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,980
Is anything illegal now in this new world?

944
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,580
No, it's an anarchist, cynicalist commune,

945
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:25,100
and we could vote and agree, or perhaps, you know...

946
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,520
No!

947
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,920
It's a thousand times!

948
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,060
It's a thousand times worse than the conspiracy ever was!

949
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,300
You know, we have a council which, like...

950
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,980
Bob, put me back in my pink job!

951
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,080
Get me away from this anarchist collective!

952
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,060
Okay, Stan, just step back, step back to the stage.

953
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,460
I'd a thousand times rather work in the office

954
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,740
and stand around the water cooler

955
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,280
talking about football games and TV shows

956
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,320
than listen to another word

957
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,800
out of your anarchist collective's bullshit mouth!

958
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,460
Sit back, step back.

959
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:56,860
There you go.

960
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,920
Well, we're ready to change your dreams.

961
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,200
God, I hate commies!

962
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,060
You're gonna have to sedate him, I'm afraid.

963
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,880
Will you talk to him?

964
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:03,940
Please, could you?

965
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:04,820
And Christians!

966
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,300
And Nazis!

967
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,900
And humans!

968
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:09,780
Fooey!

969
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,200
Yes.

970
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,500
They're gone.

971
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,820
Well, he can't be...

972
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,160
That's a little post-trauma.

973
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,640
He can't be sedated.

974
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,880
He can't be talked to.

975
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,000
He seems like it's all coming back.

976
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,900
Here, just enjoy the power of this, man.

977
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:22,700
It's just...

978
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,760
This gets me off more than anything.

979
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,860
I don't even care about him anymore.

980
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,660
Slots, look out!

981
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

982
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,120
Jesus!

983
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,420
I'm close now.

984
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,920
Man, look at...

985
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,560
Look, they strafed the dumpster!

986
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,340
Burned the hair!

987
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,120
Jesus Christ!

988
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:35,840
My arm!

989
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,020
My hair's...

990
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,560
My arm hair's burned off, too!

991
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,960
Well, gotta stay awake on my little pleasure vessel.

992
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,700
Oh, man, I thought you said that everything would be

993
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,200
Hawaiian music and stuff and a big luau.

994
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:47,880
Screw that.

995
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,500
Hey, what's with all the Darth Vader guys, too, and everything?

996
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,120
I mean, what's with all the weird helmets and stuff?

997
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,820
I thought those were supposed to go on the soffits of, like, Eve's spouse.

998
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,260
And things.

999
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,920
Hey, Stag, your beard and your eyes are both glowing red.

1000
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,260
I mean, not both of your eyes, but your eyes and your beard are glowing red.

1001
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,340
I turned off the music, man!

1002
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,120
This is the good part.

1003
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,200
Don't worry about Stag.

1004
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,040
He's fine.

1005
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,640
Just fine.

1006
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,420
And he'll be just fine as well.

1007
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,400
Keep staring directly at your radio.

1008
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,260
Keep your alpha waves to a minimum.

1009
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,260
Just...

1010
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:26,660
Just...

1011
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:26,920
Just...

1012
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:26,920


1013
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:26,920


1014
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:26,920


1015
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:26,920


1016
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:26,920


1017
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:26,920


1018
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:34,340
Check restamentos, test periods, check of your ROM and run through arows Have fun.

1019
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:39,340
Also noon Tight Decon Can't do the 100 Kaufmann

1020
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,780
Go on 30 게 돼

1021
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:47,800
I'm sick of you arresting the leads.

1022
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,960
Dead Birds. Some more who?

1023
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,820
Yeah, Magic Buster. We're going to get on

1024
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,300
the Magic Buster.

1025
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,680
Magic Buster on live.

1026
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,920
Why you don't play some nice

1027
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,460
Keith Moon by himself in his underpants?

1028
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,640
I love that kind of

1029
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,540
On next day,

1030
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,760
Keith Moon will rise again.

1031
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,780
John Antwistle will rise again.

1032
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,140
Hendrix will play. Lenny Bruce will

1033
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,020
open the set with some light

1034
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,300
humor. My friend Janice

1035
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,320
Joplin will sing.

1036
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,800
Jim will sing.

1037
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,620
Frank Zappa will sing.

1038
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,360
John will sing.

1039
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,080
That's right. We're out of here.

1040
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,380
We're out of here.

1041
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,980
Frank Zappa will lead the orchestra

1042
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,020
praise club.

1043
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,420
We're on the run now, baby.

1044
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,520
Earth is long gone.

1045
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,300
It's long

1046
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,260
cindered

1047
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,800
down in the hell.

1048
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,280
It looks like there's perhaps a million of them.

1049
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,520
I didn't bring

1050
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,960
Bruce, but I did get Clarence.

1051
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,600
They're carrying torches.

1052
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,460
I got the sax player.

1053
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,320
I didn't take

1054
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,080
Bruce, but I got his sax player.

1055
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,160
Some of them are waving the peace with no

1056
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,020
dignity sign. Others are just

1057
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,540
waving themselves goodbye.

1058
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,580
I remember Willie Nelson.

1059
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,960
They're his. She his's. They're its

1060
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,860
last day here on this place.

1061
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,860
Soon to find another

1062
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,440
freaking place.

1063
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,460
Some freaking

1064
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,460
freaking place.

1065
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,400
I remember

1066
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,580
Bruce Dern.

1067
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,520
I remember

1068
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,020
I remember

1069
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:20,800
Tali Svalish.

1070
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,420
Not only Tali Svalish, but

1071
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,640
Akim Tamaroff.

1072
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,880
Do you remember Akim Tamaroff?

1073
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,180
You remember the first

1074
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,760
Boris Karloff.

1075
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,340
Vincent Price.

1076
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,340
They'll make movies again, friends.

1077
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,200
On the escape vessels of the

1078
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,260
sex goddesses.

1079
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,840
Eddie Munster.

1080
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,100
Jesus Christ.

1081
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,460
Our famous horror star.

1082
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,440
Alfred Hitchcock will direct again.

1083
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,500
Willis O'Brien will animate King Kong.

1084
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,320
And King Kong on the best computer stuff you ever saw.

1085
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,020
What?

1086
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,160


1087
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:49,620
Oh, what?

1088
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:56,260
Nothing but mountains and seas and fields of dead birds.

1089
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,580
And thousands of decapitated heads.

1090
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:07,400
It's a sight for sore ears as you soar over the backgammon game.

1091
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,520
And thousands of other penalty parts played out beneath you.

1092
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,660
It's the way you wanted it.

1093
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,740
Lots of death and destruction.

1094
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,900
No dirty fingernails.

1095
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,040
Keep breathing free, light and easy.

1096
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,200
And make it your way.

1097
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,480
All the freaking way out of freaking, freaking, freaking.

1098
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,400
I'm sorry, Diane.

1099
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,160
Diane, I'm sorry I didn't.

1100
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,360
I got my magic bus.

1101
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,500
Yeah, we got our magic bus.

1102
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,860
We gotta make the tissue.

1103
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,080
I didn't wait until I had it.

1104
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,120
Did you get your magic bus?

1105
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,300
Are you gonna be there?

1106
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,000
I got my magic bus.

1107
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,240
I'm there, baby.

1108
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:47,540
I'm there.

1109
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,680
July 5th, 2002.

1110
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,560
It's time I go.

1111
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,200
For that magic bus.

1112
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,460
Double, double, double dot subgenius dot com.

1113
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,100
You're either on the saucers or you're off the saucers, friends.

1114
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,040
Get on the magic bus.

1115
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,340
Either you're with us or you're against us.

1116
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,640
Come by foot.

1117
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,720
Come by airplanes.

1118
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,840
Come by balloons.

1119
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,560
Come by any method.

1120
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,300
Canoes.

1121
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,300
Any means possible.

1122
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,800
But make it on down there sometime because you're not going to want to miss the final

1123
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,840
end of the world party coming to the computer.

1124
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,940
You can just tell them about it.

1125
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,160
You can't incite to action.

1126
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:22,920
Okay.

1127
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,540
You can't say get there, go there, take whatever you can.

1128
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,180
That's commercial radio, right?

1129
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,580
Yeah, right.

1130
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,500
Come on down.

1131
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,340
Yeah, right.

1132
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,000
You can't do that.

1133
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,200
But you can do.

1134
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,120
Think about actually being there.

1135
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,700
You can do.

1136
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,980
And your body might follow.

1137
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,940
Think about actually being there.

1138
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,020
Hey, remember.

1139
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:42,280
You can do it.

1140
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:42,280


1141
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,240
This is the realm of the psychic.

1142
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:49,100
It is in the landscape of possibilities for you to present your physical self at Brushwood

1143
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,940
Folklore Center next weekend.

1144
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,700
Not this one.

1145
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,060
Next one.

1146
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,340
And what a sumptuous landscape it could possibly be in your mind's left eye.

1147
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,220
Just think of all the naked women which might be there.

1148
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,260
Think of all the horrifically stupid parties you'll go to and take too many drugs and get

1149
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,460
confused and walk around for hours and feel very tired.

1150
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,880
Then wake up and then stand up and...

1151
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,360
I need food, man.

1152
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,740
I gotta get some food because maybe in a way that I need water is probably what I really

1153
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:14,960
need to.

1154
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,840
We gotta go.

1155
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,900
We'll see you later.

1156
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,460
Hey, do you have a cigarette?

1157
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:17,720
That's it.

1158
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,760
Do you have a cigarette?

1159
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,580
It goes out like that.

1160
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,060
Not with a bang, but with a whimper.

1161
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:31,980
Oh, that.

1162
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,040
Keep your hat on tight.

1163
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,700
You're back to the wind.

1164
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,560
You're sacking the saddle.

1165
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,240
See y'all.

1166
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:41,340
See ya.

1167
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1168
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1169
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1170
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1171
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1172
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1173
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1174
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1175
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1176
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1177
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1178
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1179
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340


1180
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,600
I'll get that sack towards his way.

1181
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,040
Ha!

1182
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,560
You're listening to WCSB Cleveland.

1183
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,160
We'll see you later.

1184
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:25,060
I gotta go see the FZ now.

1185
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,880
Hey, yes, dear friends, and as you probably surmised,

1186
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:39,120
this show was a rerun of our Slack number 844 from the year of 2002.

1187
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,180
But it's all still true.

1188
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,880
Christ, Bob.

1189
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,360
I need Titan's great one.

1190
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,840
You like what you heard?

1191
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,720
And you want to tell your lord?

1192
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,500
Send us a reply on the Twitter of the Subgenius.

1193
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,120
Your salary just depends on it.

1194
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:29,620
1-417-CLEVELAND-HEIGHTS, OHIO 44118.

1195
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,760
Or visit the church website at subgenius.com.

1196
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,820
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1197
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:44,960
Friends, we had a series of post office box promos there by the Spotted Anglos and Reverend Dead Horse, respectively.

1198
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,480
Anybody who wants to send in an hour of Slack promo, please do.

1199
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,140
Email me, stang at subgenius.com.

1200
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,800
And I don't know what to play next.

1201
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,120
I could play, I don't know, I could play anything.

1202
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:04,560
Either that or if I really get serious, I can put on two hours of people listening to shows.

1203
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,500
Yeah, people listening.

1204
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,220
Just people listening to radios.

1205
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:09,740
Sure, yeah.

1206
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,740
People, people, yeah, it's easy for you to say.

1207
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,120
Did they say that?

1208
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,360
Putting people, people listening.

1209
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:16,960
Putting people.

1210
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:22,340
If you put people listening on, nobody, I mean, it's going to be kind of boring.

1211
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:22,720
It's going to be boring.

1212
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,120
People are just going to listen.

1213
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,660
going to be listening to people listening.

1214
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,640
And it's sort of like...

1215
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,560
I think, yeah,

1216
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,180
I was on the Pacific Island.

1217
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,000
Dear Friends, which is just what we're doing right now.

1218
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,140
And I believe Gary listened to the original

1219
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,260
Fireside Theater doing

1220
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,720
just yakking.

1221
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,080
About listening? Yeah.

1222
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,440
And about listening? About all the stuff we do.

1223
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,520
It's interesting to think about

1224
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,840
listening to someone listening. It's sort of like

1225
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,060
thinking about thinking.

1226
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,640
In one way, you know?

1227
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,840
It is. In one way, yeah.

1228
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,800
In one way, it is.

1229
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,760
In another way,

1230
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,980
it's absolutely unrelated.

1231
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,720
It's sort of like, it's stupid to even think

1232
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,880
about them as being related.

1233
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,740
Well, it's stupid to think about them.

1234
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,620
How can you even waste time thinking about them

1235
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,200
being related?

1236
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,680
Why would you do that with your life?

1237
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,640
Don't be so stupid.

1238
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,760
That's coming up, isn't it?

1239
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,480
St. Stupid's Day.

1240
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,740
Not for some time.

1241
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,060
Hey, Hal, I can dream my dream.

1242
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,320
Hey, everything's coming up.

1243
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,040
Yes, dear friends.

1244
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,040
As you see the earth

1245
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,980
drift slowly behind you,

1246
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,820
as you see that luscious

1247
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,860
blue orb smack back into the

1248
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,620
stinky background you left

1249
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,240
with your wallet and pants,

1250
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,580
a new vision emerges

1251
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,420
in the hollow halcyon parts of your brain.

1252
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,520
Ah, yes.

1253
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,880
The earth will be covered in a cloud of dust

1254
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,080
for a hundred thousand years.

1255
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,000
And your chambers will be filled

1256
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,580
with a cloud of delicious

1257
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,640
froth that will lift your

1258
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,840
senses into closer union with

1259
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,520
guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh.

1260
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,720
Next time, friends.

1261
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,040
Next time.

1262
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,620
Next year,

1263
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,980
I want more.

1264
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,620
More flirting.

1265
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,840
More time off.

1266
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,900
More money.

1267
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,540
More time off.

1268
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,960
You will be under constant surveillance.

1269
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,780
If you see anyone unknown to us,

1270
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,900
or contact anyone for any reason whatsoever,

1271
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,220
you will be murdered.

1272
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,980
We'll meet again at midnight.
