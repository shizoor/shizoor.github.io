1
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,240
Beyond the borders of outer space, on the far side of the universe, where the mind of

2
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,340
man has never penetrated, the subgenius power goes...

3
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,100
Let's talk a little bit about Ivan. Again, right smack dab in the center and very, very healthy

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,740
looking. Again, you can see very symmetric, good outflow here. The center of circulation,

5
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,800
very evident. Ivan pummeled Grenada, flattening homes and cutting power. At least 15 deaths are

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,040
being blamed on Ivan.

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,900
We need you to watch it along with us.

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,020
Right now, Ivan is headed for Jamaica and then Cuba with the latest details. Hi, Dr. Joe.

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,520
Hiya.

10
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,800
So Ivan is indeed a monster.

11
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,720
Suddenly, oh well, there's not enough bandwidth.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,440
We have a new concern. It is a wet mess in Cleveland, Ohio, thanks to Ivan.

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
There's the area of uncertainty right there.

14
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,700
Vivian?

15
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,020
And of course, by then, Carl, we'll be watching Ivan. But here's a closer view of Ivan. And you

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,980
can see that right here, and you notice it is in the middle of the central

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,220
district.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,300
That's an indication that this is a very, very organized Ivan.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,620
And they know that our one world religion is the only antidote for the one world advertiser.

20
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,020
Ivan, here is Ivan right now.

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,260
Down with the quote list, Bob. And up with Bob. And up with Bob.

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:55,020
We'll be watching Ivan. No, we're here. And we'll keep you posted every day on the progress of Ivan.

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,480
Ivan.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,760
Ivan.

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,080
Ivan.

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,200
Ivan.

27
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,220


28
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,220


29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,220


30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,220


31
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,220


32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,380
Ivan.

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,200
Inward islands with deadly force yesterday.

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,800
Ivan tore off roofs, knocked trees into power lines, and blew down streetlights.

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,660
At this point in time, is it more likely than not that Ivan will affect the U.S.?

36
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,660
Actually, what time is it?

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,300
But at that point, Ivan affected the U.S.

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,180
Well, this was the original master tape.

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,180
Oh, that's Doug Wellman.

40
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,260
It's a tape. It is a tape.

41
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,800
It is a tape.

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,340
It is a tape.

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,900
It is a tape.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,420
It is a tape.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,620
What about me and all them other subgenius megalomaniacs?

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,720
Oh, friends, I've got some preaching to do tonight.

47
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,000
I've got a focused, a particularly focused message.

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,080
We're just going to stay on one subject tonight.

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,160
We're going to do it Dr. Gene Scott style, I think.

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,760
Don't you think that would be about right, Will?

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,260
Yes, sir.

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,140
Zandy?

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,240
Whatever.

54
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,660
We're just going to, I'm going to preach on,

55
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,860
because it's a spirit, it's spirit-filled men, you see.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,240
And women, take the mind of your man.

57
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,980
I'm preaching now.

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,980
Take, women, you take the mind of your man by the spirit.

59
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,840
See, if you can take the mind of your man by the spirit,

60
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,860
you can control his flesh.

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,580
Because what controls this being is the mind, not the brain.

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,280
No, the brain doesn't know.

63
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,620
You decide.

64
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,940
It's in your will.

65
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,400
Thy will be done.

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,920
Now, it's funny.

67
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,840
See, old Will of Dobbs over here is laughing.

68
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,000
But that's not the kind of will we're talking about.

69
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,720
Your will.

70
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,800
Let thy will be done.

71
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,640
Let the mind of Bob dwell in you, you see, sir, ma'am.

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,420
But Bob will not dwell in your filth.

73
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,140
He will not dwell in your negative thoughts, your rebellion.

74
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,560
When you get the mind of Bob properly by the Holy Spirit,

75
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,680
you'll see a change in everything, a change in your whole life.

76
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,360
You've got to develop.

77
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,640
You've got to develop.

78
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,040
Your Bob mind.

79
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,660
You've got to give your mind.

80
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,120
You see.

81
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,860
You see what I'm talking about now, don't you?

82
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,640
Well, now.

83
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,560
Now, I'm not using background music here.

84
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,580
I don't need it.

85
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,020
I'm not wanting it.

86
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm not needing it.

87
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,940
Because I've been in discernment.

88
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,460
You've heard, Brother Gene.

89
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
And now you're going to hear me.

90
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,820
But you've got to develop that Bob mind.

91
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,640
You've got to give your mind food from the word of Bob.

92
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,940
You can't hide away at home from the world and have the Bob mind.

93
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,980
It has to be developed.

94
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,220
You have to go out into the world.

95
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,580
You have to be ready to, well, do it to it before it's going to do it to you.

96
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,680
You know what I'm saying now.

97
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,120
Because that's the first secret for getting the mind of Bob is,

98
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,800
well, you know what it is.

99
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,460
Get slack.

100
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,260
You don't come back.

101
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,900
Now, I know you've been to some of them.

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,080
You pray to Bob for slack.

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,540
But don't be coming.

104
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,220
Don't come to Bob with a sad face.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,560
Don't come to him with a sad face.

106
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,020
You rejoice.

107
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,120
You've got the mind of Bob.

108
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,360
You don't walk up to Bob and say,

109
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,360
Oh, Bob, I'm rejected.

110
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,720
Nobody loves me.

111
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,240
Oh, I hate my job.

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,940
No siree.

113
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,880
No siree, ma'am.

114
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,500
You walk up to Bob with slack and say,

115
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,860
Bob, now despite all this stuff and all this mess,

116
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm still slackful.

117
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,640
And see, when you've got Bob's ear,

118
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,480
because he's a God who loves to be worshipped,

119
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,600
he's a God who loves to be worshipped.

120
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,520
And then you kind of slip in.

121
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,060
And Bob, while I'm talking to you,

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,240
I've got this little problem I'd like to tell you about.

123
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,200
That's how you do it.

124
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,200
Now, if you meditate on these things,

125
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,040
the brain will get the idea.

126
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,060
That's what you're trying to do.

127
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,620
You're trying to trick the brain into getting the idea.

128
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,660
It's like unto the twelve temptations.

129
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,620
Now, the government files on this church.

130
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,360
I want you to know about the government.

131
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,900
Because the conspiracy has ignored us.

132
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,880
I'm sure, largely.

133
00:05:48,880 --> 00:06:07,160
We think. We think. But it's not because we're so pathetic. No, that's not. It's because we're so frightening to them. Unexplained. They don't know. They don't know. They know that the formula for world overthrow is here. But they don't know why or what or the how of it.

134
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,880
It's just like the way they regard the UFO.

135
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:19,540
There's this whole secret majestic 12 kind of group, a department of the National Security Agency, does nothing but study the subgenius.

136
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,740
They may know, for all we know, they may know more about Bob than we do.

137
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,760
They might actually be a more, for all we know, they might be a more important tool in his plan than you.

138
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,580
The conspiracy agency that studies the subgenius might know more about it than you and me.

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,380
Because they've got, working with them, they've got the coprolitologists of Moab.

140
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:49,360
Moab, my friend, in the desert, yea, the desert of Lebanon.

141
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,400
It's simultaneously a place and a being and a state of mind.

142
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,420
You see, this is how one can pass through the gates of opportunity.

143
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,400
Now, friends, some things need to be said.

144
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,360
And you know what?

145
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,120
Most college campuses now, they're spent condoms hanging from the fences and the trees.

146
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,820
And where it used to be just regular toilet paper or something like that.

147
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:25,360
But to fool the pink, to fool the pink, now you see, I'm not using the music.

148
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,620
I'm just right here and they're not going to stop me.

149
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,760
Sub-G Miguelomaniacs?

150
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,040
Sub-G Miguelomaniacs?

151
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,420
May I?

152
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,340
May I continue here?

153
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,440
You and all the others, Sub-G Miguelomaniacs.

154
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,320
Now we can have a nice show.

155
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,060
Yeah, man, this is the nicest show we're ever going to have.

156
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,440
You know, millions of years ago, these funny looking big reptile type things roamed the

157
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,960
earth many, many, many, many years ago.

158
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,180
Oh, it was crazy.

159
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,220
They had great big horns, big noses, big feet.

160
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,180
The size of that thing.

161
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,780
Wow.

162
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,240
The blunderdog was 72 feet long.

163
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,160
How big is that thing, Hal?

164
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,980
Its tiny brain was half the size of a woman.

165
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,820
But it possessed a spinal enlargement which could do differential calculus and solve problems

166
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,900
in advanced physics.

167
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,260
Prepare to land on planet.

168
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,980
We're going in.

169
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,060
Strap in.

170
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,480
Ah, what a relief.

171
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,940
Yes, many people believe this story.

172
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,200
But only you, the listener, can sort it all out.

173
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,000
And there will be a quiz in about five minutes.

174
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,520
Yeah.

175
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,140
You foul devils of hell.

176
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,280
You deets of hell.

177
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,040
Your shop has shut the gates of hell in the last ten years.

178
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,040


179
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,040


180
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,040


181
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,040


182
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,040


183
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,040


184
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,040


185
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,440
In the name of Jesus and now by the will of God.

186
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,640
Whatcha gonna do with your testicles?

187
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,180
When you don't plan on having any children again, it's the drive-through vasectomy.

188
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,240
Hello, may I take your order, please?

189
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,140
Yeah, I'd like a vasectomy.

190
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,280
You want anything?

191
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,800
Um, yeah, I'll have a vasectomy also.

192
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,560
Sounds good.

193
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,220
Two vasectomies, please.

194
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,180
Thank you.

195
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,860
Drive up to the window, please.

196
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,760
Whoa, whoa.

197
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,900
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,020
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,020


200
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,020


201
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,680
Hey, how cool are we?

202
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,140
Yeah.

203
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,100
Hey, what's the matter with your voice?

204
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,820
And mine?

205
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,580
Oh, man.

206
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,160
She screwed up our order.

207
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,040
We wanted vasectomies.

208
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,180
Not castration.

209
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,300
Not castration.

210
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,100
Earl's Drive-Thru Vasectomies.

211
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,720
We clip and you save.

212
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,040
Yeah, we set them up.

213
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,340
Framed the man's hell over the destruction of power.

214
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,660
The destruction of the world.

215
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,700
Torture the team of sacrifice and suffering of blood.

216
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
We're going to the

217
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,880
Lord.

218
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,020
Oh, Lord, arise!

219
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,020


220
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,020


221
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,920
Oh, you're not listening.

222
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,120
Oh, you're listening to the Church of the Subgenius, dear friends.

223
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,680
P.O.

224
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,840
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,700
The Church of the New Faith.

226
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:59,880
Fine preachers there, but they can't shut me up because to fool the pink, you see, to

227
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,000
fool the pink.

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,700
Let's meditate upon this.

229
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,240
To fool the pink.

230
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:12,640
One must be able to adopt the disguise, a certain disguise, a variation, let's say,

231
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,960
on the masks of insanity as read about in your pamphlet number one and book number one.

232
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,280
Assume whatever guise is necessary to fool the pink who thinks that you're serving it.

233
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,040
Now, you know just what it takes.

234
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,980
You know what it's going to take.

235
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,280
You know what it's going to take to make them think that you're catering to their every whim.

236
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,820
It takes a keen perception to pinpoint just what that whim is.

237
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:47,320
But then you just show just enough eccentricity that they think you're not hiding anything, see, or being a sycophant.

238
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,520
This is all part of the zen of corporate butchessing.

239
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:59,820
To show just enough abnormality that they think you're being real upfront and honest with them.

240
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,780
That's the idea anyway.

241
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:10,780
Because if it's a rogue, unsaved subgenius you're dealing with, you're applying for a job with an unsaved subgenius, they'll see right through it.

242
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:20,500
And that reminds me, I was driving by an old fill-in station the other day and it made me think, you know, the first mega fist temple lodge here in Dallas?

243
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,080
It shouldn't just be a little building like, you know, it is.

244
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,660
It should be more like a...

245
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,580
A UFO shaped...

246
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,520
You know, those restaurants that you see in Los Angeles that are shaped like UFOs.

247
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,960
That's the kind of building that...

248
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,680
But with a sort of combination of Jetsons and Rosicrucians.

249
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,060
Ornate designs upon it.

250
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,480
That's what I've always thought of the first mega fist temple lodge to be.

251
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,720
And where are your pledges?

252
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,500
Where are your pledges, I ask your friends?

253
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,640
Because, you know, without them...

254
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:58,640


255
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:09,180
Without them pledges, why this radio station can't keep this ministry, the word of Bob, as preached by your pastor, Reverend Ivan Stang.

256
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,960
That's me talking.

257
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,740
And I'm asking you, dear friends, to get them pledges on in there.

258
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:22,500
I know you felt in your heart the faith, the faith that you would pay the station later on.

259
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,360
But now you must do the acts, you see.

260
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,260
The acts.

261
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,580
And you did your part to do it.

262
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,200
To help my friend Liz Roscoe and I progress.

263
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,240
To help üzer the rest of the Church in Florida.

264
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,300
And I Lecture the Premier What the hereafter has something in that book.

265
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,660
Gotta let you conquer.

266
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Và mijn� fastest thing ever.

267
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,400
the early Christians did for reasons that probably seem obvious to us now.

268
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,840
But the truth is, as it's said in the Gospel of John, the other John,

269
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,380
that Jesus as a child, he was like the kid in the Twilight Zone

270
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,460
that could kill anybody by magic.

271
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,640
And in the Book of John, it says the young, it tells,

272
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,020
we've told the story on previous ministry, show broadcast here,

273
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:27,000
that the young Jesus was into killing his playmates and teachers.

274
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,560
He didn't know any better. He was just learning to be a Messiah.

275
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,260
And it was the same with, and he would fly.

276
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,340
He could fly. Jesus had powers of flight.

277
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,900
He could fly around and cast spells like a sorcerer.

278
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,040
This is all in the Nag Hammadi text.

279
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,980
You can buy it at the bookstore.

280
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,600
The flying Jesus, the super Jesus, dear friends.

281
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,620
But the early Gospels of Bob are surprising.

282
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,740
Extremely similar, as we find in the chapter under the bad magic of the young sorcerer Bob.

283
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,080
Flying, just like the sorcerer Jesus, the child Bob would fly

284
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,180
and get into robbing banks, dear friends.

285
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,100
His mother said, told the Senate subcommittee,

286
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,760
when they angered him, that wasn't her exact words,

287
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,520
but when people angered him, she said,

288
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,900
they would suddenly drop dead.

289
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,840
Dead and die.

290
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,700
I quote from this commission report there.

291
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,600
A horrible, grisly death, friends, that happened to his teachers,

292
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,620
praised Bob, paper cut to death one was.

293
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:41,020
It's like when he'd pray, when Bob would pray for his teacher or a boss to die.

294
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,280
Well, Bob was just so lucky it would happen that way, just that way.

295
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,500
Like a miracle.

296
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,700
Whatever Bob wished for, a totally unlikely accident would cause it to happen.

297
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,500
Like the one boss who fell into a glass factory that was malfunctioning

298
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,960
and was slowly ground up with ground glass.

299
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,940
Ah, yes.

300
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,240
Oh, it blesses my heart, you know, to read in the word of Bob.

301
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,060
I'd love to share it with you.

302
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,240
As Bob said in 2nd edition Ecclesians version 2,

303
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,740
give me slack or give me food or, he said,

304
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:28,280
give me Apaches loaded with sidewinders and nuclear weapons or a Sinclair.

305
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,760
And which reminds me, dear friends, of we wanted to put out a little want ad.

306
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,240
This is a church want ad, you can consider it.

307
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:44,580
Wanted one drummer must have Apache helicopter loaded with sidewinders and a Sinclair.

308
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,820
Can bring drums if want to.

309
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,540
Contact Philo Drummond.

310
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,720
Uh, uh,

311
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,920
Ball Wind, Missouri.

312
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,560
And, uh,

313
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,420
The Satanists don't understand.

314
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,640
Sacrifice an animal and kill it.

315
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,100
It won't cover many sins.

316
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,740
Sacrifice a human in a fire like Abel.

317
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,120
It won't cover all your sins.

318
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,140
Sacrifice God's only begotten son on the cross with nails through him.

319
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,260
That's who erased all the sins of everyone.

320
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,020
This is why we killed him.

321
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,460
His death is not over.

322
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,880
He rose from the dead.

323
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,340
We will all rise from the dead.

324
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,240
But non-Christians will stay dead.

325
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,700
Did he die again after rising from the dead?

326
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:27,380
No, he went away, but he will come again when all dead Christians hop out of their graves and kill Satan.

327
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,560
Life arrived to the living dead.

328
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,440
Like zombies, we will kill Satan.

329
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,680
Sleep is death.

330
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,740
Crack zombies were already dead.

331
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,700
Die. Kill.

332
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,180
The Lord has died.

333
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,780
He died.

334
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,320
He killed.

335
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,700
The Jews and the Arabs are the children of Abraham.

336
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,680
This family feud has been going on since biblical times.

337
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,380
Dear Lord, kill all who do not believe.

338
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,980
Kill wretched.

339
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,800
Kill crack users.

340
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,620
Kill long-haired maggot-infested children.

341
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:51,680


342
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
Kill the children of the 60s rejects.

343
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,740
Satan, kill your mom.

344
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,980
Satan, kill your children.

345
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,440
Lord, help us deal with the death of the emanation of the forces of evil.

346
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,500
I pray.

347
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,060
Die, all you that are prey.

348
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,180
Please, Lord, help us in our war against Satan.

349
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,200
Kill.

350
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,460
Die.

351
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,300
Kill.

352
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,680
Die.

353
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,060
Kill Satan.

354
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,460
Die for God.

355
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,040
Can't you see what's happening?

356
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,960
Conspiracy.

357
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,720
A seeking battle.

358
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,500
A war on God.

359
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,900
But now a war on Satan.

360
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,680
They're killing Christians.

361
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,740
They're killing blacks.

362
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:21,740
They're killing whites.

363
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,720
They kill Jews.

364
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,460
They kill Muslims.

365
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,300
They kill Orientalists and Malawis.

366
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,240
They are the children who smoke crack and then they go ahead and kill and rape in their

367
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,560
cans.

368
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,600
These little heathens.

369
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:29,800
Die.

370
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,700
Kill for Christ.

371
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,780
Guys, our general, the battle is our battle plan.

372
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,240
Should we be giving away our tactics to the enemy?

373
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:35,520
No.

374
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,940
Kill heathens.

375
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,020
If you are having fun, then you are sinning, you heathen.

376
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,960
Pleasure is the root of all evil.

377
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,340
The Satan's also known as Bid to Capture Your Soul.

378
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,400
Do I have to swallow my gun and blow my head off to get you heathens to listen?

379
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,800
The Lord God Almighty is great and should be feared.

380
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,660
Christ, you did not kill Satan.

381
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:51,660


382
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:51,660


383
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:51,660


384
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:51,740
You did not kill Satan.

385
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,300
I do a double flip over to Scrooge.

386
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,360
Lust for death.

387
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,240
Fear is wrath.

388
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,160
Fear for love.

389
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,880
Fear pleasure.

390
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,680
Have you ever been so angry at someone that you just wanted to...well, you didn't know

391
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,400
what to do?

392
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Pull back to the wet tears.

393
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,260
Breathe.

394
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,360
Attach.

395
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,220
Eat freshly purchased.

396
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,400
Freshly sharpened-

397
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,960
That's right.

398
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,860
The money you purchased in...

399
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,180
Thirteen.

400
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,560
Five people booing.

401
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:21,640
Four people smoking.

402
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,640


403
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,640


404
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,640


405
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,640


406
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,640


407
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,640


408
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,640


409
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,640


410
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,920
747

411
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,540
regular curled

412
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,360
saw blade

413
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,580
chug along down the middle of the crotch

414
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,440
to let them fall off

415
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,940
you know what

416
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,500
don't stick your nose in here

417
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,220
yeah go away

418
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,160
the world monetary system

419
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,240
will be completely revamped

420
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,200
the way trading

421
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,420
is done and the stock market will change

422
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,560
cash will disappear

423
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,400
we use plastic cards

424
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,600
and the barter system for everything

425
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,540
unexpected people

426
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,400
from non-traditional backgrounds

427
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,340
will pop up as world leaders

428
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,640
the world will be

429
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,400
destabilized until

430
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,240
1995

431
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,640
which means more of everything

432
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,580
from quakes to revolution

433
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,600
sir

434
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,900
mr. Palkus

435
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,300
this is uh

436
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,180
genetics

437
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,960
you know not all mutations are created equal

438
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,420
oh

439
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,720

443
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,600
standing by

444
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,060
the others

445
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,820
I mean

446
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,420
I have to wait another five minutes

447
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,660
don't bite your pencil

448
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,160
now just stand over there

449
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,420
keep your hands out of your pockets

450
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,280
just stand still

451
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,780
and we'll get to you in just a minute

452
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,940
but but but

453
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,640
a severed thumb

454
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,220
that turned up in the stomach

455
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,140
of a lake trout

456
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,800
has been traced to its owner

457
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,520
Mike Pachuca

458
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,500
the Sweetwater County coroner

459
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,100
said Thursday that he had confirmed

460
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,760
that the thumb belongs to

461
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,240
32 year old

462
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,480
Robert

463
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,500

in February

467
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,400
similarities

468
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,600
with the experiences

469
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,700
of soldiers

470
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,220
and others

471
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,920
Mr. Dobbs

472
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,620
said he had lost

473
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,360

27th

502
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,600
question number one

503
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,180
you know it's not

504
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,240
yeah

505
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,160
that's right

506
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,920
baby

507
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,620
it's not a radio show

508
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,740
it's a map

509
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,500
but don't get it confused

510
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,780
with the territory

511
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,100
don't get Bob

517
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,080
it's okay

518
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,700
but because

519
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,360
well

520
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,760
I want a

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,780

523
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,620

524
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,000
and said

525
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,920
Reverend Stan

526
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,720

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,640

530
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,840
again

531
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,300
and you know

532
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,000
I can't

533
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,360
I can't

534
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,320
because I don't have it

535
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,840
on paper

536
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,720
it was just on that

537
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,340
one tape

538
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,960
but

539
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,140
you know

540
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,200
you can find out

541
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,900
what anything

542
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,700
is

543
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,340
by writing

544
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,280

put you in touch

644
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,560
I can't see

645
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,380
how the X's

646
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,920
would mess

647
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,780
anything up

648
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,160

656
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,520
slight delay

657
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,840

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:55,260
I feel like I'm perceiving the unsullied truth tonight with no subjective bias at all.

759
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,680
Ah, yes.

760
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:07,140
And although the believers are calling in, Will is counseling those young Bobbiettes.

761
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,020
And friends, we've reached the end of side one of our show.

762
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,100
Let's switch to some lovely relaxing music here.

763
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,400
While we prepare to go to side two.

764
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,480
Of your subgenius radio ministry.

765
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,720
Hour of Slack.

766
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:23,980
Ah, yes.

767
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,340
Here on lovely radio station.

768
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,300
In beautiful.

769
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,060
Praise these wonderful partner stations.

770
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,660
By the way, the script of the live portion of this show was carefully prepared.

771
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,860
To exacting specifications.

772
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,420

This is show number 333.

778
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,140
Praise Bob.

779
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:36,380


780
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,780
Give me.

781
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:44,140
From me.

782
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,260
I know.

783
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,280
Put me in the.

784
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,860
Time Machine! You'll never find me in the future!

785
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,240
Please put me in the Time Machine!

786
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:52,900
Whoa!

787
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,660
Hey, what are you doing here? This is my sequel.

788
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,720
What are you talking about? This is my sequel!

789
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,840
I'm afraid you're both wrong, gentlemen.

790
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,320
This is my sequel.

791
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,800
Who Framed Roger Robocop in the Future Part 3.

792
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,440
You know what they say about summer movies.

793
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,120
Summer movies, some aren't.

794
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,540
And now, another great John F. Kennedy moment in history.

795
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,300
The year is 1827.

796
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,540
The place, Berlin, Germany.

797
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,480
Composer Ludwig von Beethoven meets with his mistress in her boudoir.

798
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:38,000
My liebchen, aren't you going to take off your dress for Ludwig?

799
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,560
I can't.

800
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,180
Why not?

801
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,580
I, I too.

802
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,900
Wait a minute. There's somebody under your dress.

803
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,900
Come out of there, you schweinhund.

804
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,860
Ask not what your country can do for you.

805
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,820
Ask what you can do for your country.

806
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,880
Who are you?

807
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,740
Ich bin ein Berliner.

808
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,780
Baloney, you are no Berliner.

809
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,320
You're that sneaky John F. Kennedy.

810
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,340
Get out, you sex maniac.

811
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:01,980
No, I can explain.

812
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,860
Get out und stay out.

813
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,680
I can explain this.

814
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,280
This has been another John F. Kennedy great moment in history.

815
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,320
Ah.

816
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,060
And, well, of course, I guess I've been talking kind of roundabout.

817
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:32,600
But what we wanted to get, well, one of the subjects, the main focus of this particular branch of the subject we were on, dear friends,

818
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:46,700
is understanding the ancient heritage of the yeti, of Mutantus, the yetis of Mutantus.

819
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,060
The ancient heritage of Mutantus.

820
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,060


821
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,180
Now, wait a minute.

822
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,540
I'm not gonna, I just, I don't wanna hear that same old background music again.

823
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,780
That's just, I've heard that a million times.

824
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,460
We, I got preaching to do here.

825
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,340
What's some, I need to sharpen this up here.

826
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,400
If I turn up my own headphones, don't you, this is a preacher technique.

827
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,880
You turn up your own headphones, it makes you feel more powerful, which is all that really counts.

828
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,300
The, uh, the enthusiasm.

829
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:17,380


830
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,560
The enthusiasm become delirious.

831
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:35,620
But as, as we were saying, now, the, you've heard, of course, of, of, um, Mu and Atlantis and, uh, Lemuria and these various, you know, new agey things.

832
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:43,980
And, and there actually was, uh, uh, well, Mu was the human name of, uh, this continent.

833
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,380
Now, it not exactly the same as Gondwana.

834
00:31:47,380 --> 00:32:01,500
Now, if you'll, uh, if you've, uh, studied your history, uh, pre-creationist history, uh, you would, uh, know that Gondwana land was the, uh, the land before the continent separated, you see.

835
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,540
You would know about continental drift and all that.

836
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,360
Before the, there was North American, South American, African, Asian, or, or, it was all like one chunk.

837
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,440
Okay.

838
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,400
And here there were yetis.

839
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,780
There was all this land.

840
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,360
But then, with that.

841
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,360


842
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,340
With the plate tectonics, things split up some.

843
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,600
Okay.

844
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:25,780
So, but they were connected, interconnected still, but, but oceans where there ain't none.

845
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,340
There was all this land there which sunk.

846
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,000
And the present, it was like a negative of the way the world looks now.

847
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,820
There was, there was land where the ocean is now and ocean where the land is now.

848
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,300
And the present continents popped up into place.

849
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,000
And the old continent sunk.

850
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,880
And this is sort of like the Earth's breathing.

851
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,360
It's like a continental drift.

852
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,640
It's like a little sea saw that happens over millions of years.

853
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,920
And it will happen again soon.

854
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,760
So, there is, on top, besides this, there is continental drift.

855
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:03,940
But that's more like the solar winds kind of blowing the scum across the top of the pond, if you know what I mean.

856
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
Where it shifts and breaks up.

857
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:13,500
It's, it's at least as much a result of the solar wind, according to subgenius, uh, forbidden sciences.

858
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,340
As it is due to the sub tectonic movement.

859
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:23,520
And, uh, the, uh, magma currents, which, uh, of course they study in, uh, secular high schools and such like.

860
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,700
But, uh, I get behind myself, you might say, here.

861
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:42,580
Uh, the yetis, the original yetis, what, what, uh, the last, I guess you'd say the only full blood yetis now would be the so-called Bigfoot or Sasquatch, known to the American, uh, wilderness.

862
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,380
Uh, the yetis is their name, of course.

863
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,140
And the Himalayas, uh, in Tibet.

864
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,420
Where Bob escaped to after that time in Burma.

865
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,040
That prisoner of war camp in Japan.

866
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,980
But, don't want to get ahead of myself too much on that one.

867
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,080
Now you know that story.

868
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:05,760
The yetis lived upon that lost continent of ancient times and far away days called Mutantis.

869
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:11,840
And there, the, of course, the yetis were invented by the Exists, as you know.

870
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,360
But the yetis, in turn, invented for themselves, uh, the Bigfoot.

871
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,660
Beasts of Burden.

872
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,720
Which we know as humans.

873
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:25,320
The, the common human was invented 80 million years ago in a test tube by the yetis of Mutantis.

874
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,560
Now, the original name of the humans is an unusual, it's, uh, Huygur.

875
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,560
Huygur.

876
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,620
U-I-G-H-U-R-S.

877
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,400
Okay.

878
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,920
Huygurs.

879
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,140
Who escaped the, uh, the, uh, from the yetis.

880
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:53,080
Um, and in fact, after the, I hesitate to call it the fall of the yetis, but the accident, shall we say.

881
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:03,200
Um, the, the, uh, the Huygur Empire was the largest colonial empire belonging to Mutantis, the Empire of the Sun.

882
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,940
It stretched from the Pacific Ocean, where the Pacific Ocean is now, to where Moscow is now.

883
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:14,560
And these Huygurs were the beginning of the true Aryan races.

884
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,520
The milk white skin and the blue eyes.

885
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:38,560
And during the, the Pleistocene, after the empire of the yetis were destroyed, these devolved creatures, after the, the yeti creators were destroyed in the great magnetic cataclysm and the raising of the mountains, the survivors, those Huygurs, formed settlements across Europe in tertiary times.

886
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,760
Tertiary.

887
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,540
And your old friends, low 50 feet beneath the Gobi Mountains.

888
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:44,540


889
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,580
The desert lay the ruins of Karakota.

890
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:54,420
Now Bob got all this from the Nacal records when he was in the hands of the Tibetan llamas.

891
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,380
These sacred, sacred scrolls.

892
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:04,260
That tell of the, because, well let's look at our book of the subgenius, volume two.

893
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:10,220
Here, if, if you know, you ain't, you ain't nodding on me, are ya?

894
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,680
Now I can see a few heads starting to nod out there.

895
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,860
I know ya, the collection plate's gonna be coming around to wake you up.

896
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,100
Don't you be worried about that.

897
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,420
I'm not, I ain't demanding total attention.

898
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,400
I ain't getting it.

899
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,800
I ain't wanting it.

900
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,100
You're allowed to daydream and dream up your own.

901
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,180
I know you're gonna come up with strange, strange interpretations for what I say.

902
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,180
People read the strangest things into the word of Bob.

903
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,460
They just, the cookiest, nuttiest things.

904
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,660
You take a simple concept like the, the nub, the ferns.

905
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,920
these escapees from the Yeti test tube in Atlantis,

906
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,340
and they'll take something simple like that and just make this kooky, nutty,

907
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,360
but you know how religionists are, friends.

908
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,380
You know how these fundamentalist nuts,

909
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,320
Bob Preserves from Subgenius, kooks.

910
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:16,180
But, well, let's go back into these revivals of ancient days

911
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,640
and see what the old covenant men had to say.

912
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,680
Make love under the stars.

913
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,120
Watch for UFOs.

914
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,300
If little baby Martians come out of the UFOs,

915
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,460
they're f***ing gay.

916
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,260
The zebra spills plastic on Venus,

917
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,960
and the gelatin fingers squeeze electric harbors.

918
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,720
Ramones d***s died in hell,

919
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,880
and the Nazis want to kill, to kill everyone.

920
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,260
As we've done.

921
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,640
Just let me know when it's, let me know when it's, let me know when it's,

922
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,080
just let me know when it's, just let me know when it's through,

923
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,180
when it's, let me know when it's, just let me know when it's through,

924
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,300
just let me know when it's through,

925
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,460
let me know when it's through,

926
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,180
let me know when it's through,

927
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:05,680
when it's through,

928
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:05,740


929
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,740
when it's through, bad bad bad bad.

930
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,180
BAD.

931
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,800
It's falling apart financially.

932
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,720
It's falling apart financially.

933
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,380
The one thing I'll never forget was their eyes.

934
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:51,360
When the broken man made the world, the earth was the woman and the sky was the man.

935
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,920
And the sky man came down upon the earth woman.

936
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:07,840
And the world in the beginning was pure lake covered with bulrushes.

937
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:19,880
And when Gaborg-Fran had killed Neither-Bob and formed Man-Man from the dung and blood,

938
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,520
he then made woman-woman out of rattlesnakes.

939
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,900
And tarantula.

940
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,240
And tarantulas.

941
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,840
And they came together and made man-woman and man-man.

942
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,980
And that is why there are four sexes today.

943
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:46,780
Man-man, woman-woman, man-woman, and woman-man.

944
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:56,880
When there were villages, the elder wife of the chief, to the fear and wonder of the man,

945
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,560
the woman gave birth to four little monsters.

946
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,220
The elder said, these strange children will bring great misfortune.

947
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,080
It would be better to kill them right now for the sake of the tribe.

948
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,240
The mother refused and said the children would grow up all right.

949
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,940
But they did not.

950
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,720
The small monsters grew fast and became very strange.

951
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:26,860
But they did not.

952
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


953
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


954
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


955
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


956
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


957
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


958
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


959
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


960
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


961
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860


962
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,800
They hurt others.

963
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,780
They upset huts.

964
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,680
They befouled the people's food.

965
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,180
A wise man who could see things in his mind which had not yet happened said,

966
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,480
Kill these strange bad things before they kill you.

967
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,880
And so the people went and killed the bad things.

968
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,320
But that was never the end.

969
00:40:53,320 --> 00:41:01,520
For the subgenius men came and killed man-man and woman-man and man-woman and woman-woman.

970
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,560
And one, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, fifteen, one, fifty-three.

971
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,420
This is relaxed, which is more than I can say for some of us around here.

972
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,940
Such religious patterns.

973
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:42,380
The Church of the Subgenius is an esoteric organization, a secret lodge or cult,

974
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,920
whose members lurk just outside of the comfortable circle of the firelight.

975
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,780
I know it's the distigio-inky blood.

976
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,980
Uh, well, um, customer service.

977
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,240
Oh, well.

978
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,760
Yes, dear.

979
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,800
My birthday was wonderful.

980
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,780
We had, uh, performing elephants, uh, dancing girls, uh, Androcles and the lion, uh,

981
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,680
uh, just about everything that you can imagine.

982
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,160
It was all wrapped up into one bundle of scrumptious fun.

983
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,860
Yeah, did all your friends attend?

984
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,420
Unfortunately, I was sick to my stomach and missed it.

985
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:11,860
Friendship hand.

986
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,900
That was earlier this evening, I thought.

987
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,980
Oh, that's right now, ongoing, yes.

988
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,600
But, uh, um, well, um.

989
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,620
Yes, he's going right now.

990
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,440
Going, going.

991
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,100
I'm going.

992
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,460
Gone.

993
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,280
Right on the show?

994
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,620
Yes.

995
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,300
Right on the show.

996
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,540
Uh, here.

997
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,900
Oh, no!

998
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,960
Let's get out of here!

999
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,480
Come on!

1000
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,160
Come on!

1001
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,380
As a general rule, in evaluating your listening situation, you should stand in front of the

1002
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,440
speaker, an equal distance from each speaker.

1003
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,180
Lord God is the greatest power, general of all!

1004
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:53,120
He said, take the art of the covenant and let the priest carry the horns.

1005
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,540
This is a battle delivering the march against Satan, Joshua 6.

1006
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,380
Because the priest must stake us into battle and make it holy.

1007
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,620
The spiritual well-being of our nation is more important now than ever.

1008
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,160
For the time is near when the charring of flesh and the gnashing of teeth is coming.

1009
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,680
No, but we have, uh, you know what I did find was a piece of footage with, uh, Pee-wee Herman

1010
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,060
and President Kennedy in 1963.

1011
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,420
So that's why they're changing all the coins.

1012
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,200
Yeah.

1013
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,520
To, uh, the dead rock.

1014
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,280
No, no, it's the other side.

1015
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,980
And Bertha, who gave you the headphones?

1016
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,420
You're not supposed to have any of this radio stuff at this hour.

1017
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,680
If you put one nail in my hand, you'll have to nail the other.

1018
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,460
The other what?

1019
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,800
Oh, my.

1020
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,520
Nasty young man.

1021
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,700
But if he would have been an octopus, that would have been really terrible to nail him.

1022
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,280
It would have taken eight nails.

1023
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:42,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1024
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,220
More arms than an octopus.

1025
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,560
He was all over you.

1026
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,020
We've been to that show before.

1027
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,560
I don't understand you.

1028
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,880
You're just a satanic evil.

1029
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,100
My God, customer service is still hanging on.

1030
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,740
It's level.

1031
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,540
Not satanic.

1032
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,440
It's an old mimeograph machine.

1033
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,140
It gets smudged.

1034
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,520
It's not satanic and evil.

1035
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,440
It's satirical and...

1036
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,600
I would if I could, but...

1037
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,560
Who was that?

1038
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:03,780
Who was that?

1039
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,920
Less than half an hour ago, I shot 50 cc's of Aunt Bertha.

1040
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:10,880
Nailed me.

1041
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,200
I don't understand.

1042
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,380
Over there behind you, that's Professor Dyer.

1043
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,220
I'm looking inside, but...

1044
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,020
That's very nice.

1045
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,460
You're a fraudicator and masturbator and...

1046
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,140
Now, Aunt Bertha, just take a stress pill and calm down.

1047
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,480
And calm.

1048
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,080
I just need...

1049
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,880
Think of beautiful thoughts, like me.

1050
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,620
Jesus had the submarine earlier.

1051
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,960
That was in the first 15 minutes of the show.

1052
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,360
It's what they call the Jesus wheel.

1053
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,520
It keeps the rotor of the submarine from...

1054
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,960
Is she still in her strengths, Aunt Bertha?

1055
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,380
Indeed, it was just...

1056
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:45,840
Okay, yeah.

1057
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,940
She's in the rubber room now, being chastised by Sven and Newt, our over-eager bodyguards.

1058
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,920
I need to go now.

1059
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,220
I'm going to go.

1060
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:53,240
I'm going to go.

1061
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,240


1062
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,240


1063
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,240


1064
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,240


1065
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,240


1066
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,260
I'm going to go.

1067
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,100
You and me too, Sister.

1068
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,020
I don't think there's any security.

1069
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,420
I think Aunt Bertha's...

1070
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,280
I think something's happening down there.

1071
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,200
Here come the cops!

1072
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:03,840
I don't know.

1073
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,400
I can't do it.

1074
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,500
I just failed to hear what's happening.

1075
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,180
What's happening down there?

1076
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:08,840
Look at the monitor.

1077
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,420
Aunt Bertha's swelling up.

1078
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,140
I'm holding it up.

1079
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:13,820
How long?

1080
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,140


1081
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,140


1082
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,140


1083
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,140


1084
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,240
She must be so nervous.

1085
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,240


1086
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,240


1087
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,240


1088
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,260
I don't know.

1089
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,060
I'm not sure.

1090
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,160


1091
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,120
Let's get the rabbit.

1092
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,120
We're going to have to think about how to get the rabbit.

1093
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:23,180
We're going to have to think about how to get the rabbit.

1094
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,400
Left goes left where it should be.

1095
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,840
Right goes to right accordingly.

1096
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:43,580
I therefore praise these gentlemen who know and show both the how and when.

1097
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,480
Oh, thank you so much, Captain.

1098
00:45:48,480 --> 00:46:01,860
Captain, yeah, it feels so good, so good, good, good to be in the spirit again, you know,

1099
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:08,060
because it's like love between those yetis.

1100
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,240
You know, a couple of yetis getting together.

1101
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,760
It wouldn't back in them days.

1102
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,860
Oh, they do things you can't even imagine.

1103
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:23,980
But it was because it wasn't just like chemistry between a couple of yetis,

1104
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,400
like it would be between, say, you and your beloved.

1105
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:33,020
It would be more like electrochemistry with a bunch of quantum physics thrown in

1106
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,240
because, you know, when they get going, they just pour back and forth, dear friends,

1107
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,780
kind of exploding together in these echoing shiver rushes

1108
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,080
where one could literally feel,

1109
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,160
just exactly what the other one felt when they touched each other,

1110
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:58,120
sort of a sensory telepathy, a supernaturally mutual anticipation, dear friends,

1111
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,720
of each other's desires from moment to moment.

1112
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,680
And that's what religion is all about

1113
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:12,200
because religion evolved, as we see here in Prescripture 719, from magic.

1114
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,760
Simple, primordial magic, sympathetic.

1115
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,380
You got your sympathetic magic.

1116
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,920
You got your associative magic, you know.

1117
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,760
Basically, trying to influence one's environment, you see,

1118
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,900
by hoping in a formalized enough way.

1119
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,700
That's all it is.

1120
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,280
You know, that's all praying is.

1121
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,360
You're trying to change the world around you just by hoping in a fancied-up way,

1122
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,500
if it's fancied up enough.

1123
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,160
And see, back in the old days, in the times of the pre-men,

1124
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,840
why, say, by...

1125
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:51,340
By chance, one day, the drought ended after the neighbor's kid died.

1126
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,140
So you'd think, well, maybe the next drought might be stopped

1127
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,480
by killing the neighbor's next kid.

1128
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,440
You know, and they go, remember that time Jones got killed and it didn't flood?

1129
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,560
Well, by gobs, we'll kill a Jones every year and it'll never flood.

1130
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,340
We never liked that Jones clan anyway.

1131
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,500
That's the way it works.

1132
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,340
But then one is forced to question.

1133
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,640
One is forced to ask.

1134
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,600
Are, therefore, the teachings of Bob,

1135
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:26,740
nothing but a misguided, overly complicated form of associative magic and wishful thinking?

1136
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:31,000
Well, friends, it is, but it's a guided, not misguided,

1137
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,900
it's a guided, overly complicated form of associative magic and wishful thinking.

1138
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,100
So why would it be any different from the false religions, you would ask?

1139
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,380
Because, my friends, it is based on true magic.

1140
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,500
True magic.

1141
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,300
True prophecy.

1142
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:51,760
Not just stupid inferences like some of these other, you know, prophetic, so-called prophetic churches.

1143
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,340
And what of proof?

1144
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,380
See, we're wrapping it all up here.

1145
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,000
We've got it all figured out.

1146
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,720
You ask any subgenius, there'd be your proof.

1147
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,280
It'll tell you a million examples what Bob has done, what Bob, my friends, has done,

1148
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,940
and that were like magic, things that were like magic.

1149
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,320
Like when the child Bob would pray for his son.

1150
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,320


1151
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,320


1152
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,320


1153
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,400
Oh, yes.

1154
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:33,620
We just go, God, hurry, please.

1155
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,700
He Ranity said that

1156
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:42,260
He Cast all his wife

1157
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:42,600
elementally

1158
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:42,600


1159
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:42,600


1160
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,200
He said that

1161
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:50,560
thing we're going to see god see god we're using the credit card you can grant us prosperity now

1162
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,460
we spent we we use the money you can give us the real money now that we spent the credit card

1163
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:04,260
but there's endless arguments you know about the faith it's like a big stupid soap opera but that

1164
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:12,300
makes me think of that time in the in the myth the myth of the olden bob where it said

1165
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:20,140
when the lord bob and this was the way they would do it in covenant days when the lord bob entered

1166
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:31,820
his palaces which were perfect to the fullest extent his 1,000 188,109 queens rejoiced within

1167
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:42,000
their minds to see their husband home they leapt leaped from the meditation seats uh and as was

1168
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,240
so

1169
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:50,400
socially customary covered their faces shyly and looked about coyly i'm reading uh masterson's

1170
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:57,440
text here their insuperable ecstasy was so strong that they first embraced the lord bob in their

1171
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,840
innermost recesses of their hearts that was first thing they did just embraced him with their hearts

1172
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:08,240
the innermost heart then they embraced him with their outermost hearts then they embraced him

1173
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,220
visually see up to that point they didn't dare even look at him they were so happy they didn't

1174
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:18,100
happy to see him home they they worked their way up to it then they'd send their sons to embrace

1175
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:25,640
him but they still weren't embracing him see of course there's 188 100,000 of them but um and

1176
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:32,940
finally after the sons had all embraced bob then though they tried to restrain their feelings

1177
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:39,960
the brides of bob would shed tears that was what their final stage

1178
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,920
you see don't you see because this was just before the good signs of the zodiac had evolved

1179
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:59,960
after the first bob was born and the wise men informed him that his first son bub they said

1180
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:08,800
in prescripture 1719 they said the wise men said surely he is an epops descendant the brahmana said

1181
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,220
this spotless son is restored by the all-powerful god and he will be the first son of the god of the

1182
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,440
earth the god of the earth is the best god of the earth and the most powerful and all-persuasive

1183
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,800
lord vishnu the personality of the godhead in order to oblige you oblige you see and then

1184
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:25,260
bob's unconsciousness now lapses in his consciousness that is his consciousness his

1185
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:32,220
consciousness i'm saying lapse into unconsciousness of the undifferentiated cosmic life and uncovers

1186
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:39,940
the true significance of this bob this bob whose numbers reveal that he is a life not yet entered

1187
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,720
into the process of evolution

1188
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,260
In other words, by this standard, he is a pink, a pink.

1189
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,260
He falls asleep with his genitals uncovered, to use the biblical term.

1190
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,380
He is uncovered within his tent, as they say.

1191
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,120
He is suffering the plight of Noah, who said to himself,

1192
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,920
Darn it, Noah said.

1193
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,960
He said, you know we've got all these stinking animals on board.

1194
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,680
We can't clean up after them.

1195
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,200
Everybody's dead except us and these animals.

1196
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,100
I'm going to get drunk.

1197
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,040
I'm going to break into them casks full of grog.

1198
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,460
And Noah did that, and that's when, you know, that boy found him,

1199
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:25,380
and they punished him for finding him and sent him away into Canaan, you see.

1200
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,380
And that's where the naked women and the lustfulness man and the head

1201
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,340
and the people being fried alive and the angel that keep the guy from being tempted,

1202
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:39,460
down that woodcut, that's where they all come from, is the land of Canaan, dear friends.

1203
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,120
Because we love.

1204
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,580
We love to preach the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs here on the radio.

1205
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,600
We know that people who've just tuned into this show for the first time are getting an earful.

1206
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,360
They're hearing this preaching and they're going, finally.

1207
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,500
They're saying, I thought I was alone in the world.

1208
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,940
I thought I was the only one who thought thoughts like this.

1209
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,800
I thought I was the only one who had a Bob man.

1210
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,420
Because that's what you have, you know.

1211
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,540
It's your Bob man that listens to this show with you.

1212
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,200
You have your spirit man.

1213
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,000
You have your spirit man, as Brother Tilton has told you about.

1214
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,040
But that's drunk most of the time.

1215
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,120
It's a fundamentalist Christian.

1216
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:24,060
Did you know that everyone, as part of their mental life, their mental, not mental life.

1217
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,400
I trust you've been reading your book.

1218
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:31,940
Your mental life, your psychic self, the things standing behind you that they can't see.

1219
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,240
And neither can you or me, thank God, because you're so ugly.

1220
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,060
Your mental life has three parts.

1221
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,220
It has your conspiracy man, your spirit man, and your Bob man.

1222
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,080
Your spirit man, on everybody, is a fundamentalist Baptist Christian.

1223
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,040
Even on a Palestinian, or an Israeli, or a Jewish fellow.

1224
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,660
He has a spirit man that's a Baptist fundamentalist.

1225
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,020
A nut.

1226
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,900
An old, crazy, I mean, not just regular Baptist.

1227
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,220
I mean, a crazy fundamentalist.

1228
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,200
But you see, friends, people get the wrong idea about the church.

1229
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,220
They think that we're making fun of those old characters, you know.

1230
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,480
Those old preachers in their wooden.

1231
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:12,920
Cabin.

1232
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,780
Preaching to that little congregation out in the backwoods.

1233
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,800
And we're not.

1234
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,180
That's not what we're doing.

1235
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,180
We're not trying to make fun of that feller.

1236
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,040
What we're trying to do is recapture that, friends.

1237
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,960
To take it back.

1238
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,960
We want to take it back.

1239
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,820
And that's another thing we've been talking about.

1240
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,820
We want to take fascism back from the conspiracy.

1241
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,640
We want to give fascism back to the people.

1242
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,220
Take it back from the way the conspiracy demeaned it.

1243
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,800
And demeaned that preaching.

1244
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,840
And turned it into Bob Tilton.

1245
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,720
Friends, we're into real traditional family values.

1246
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:55,960
Because, you know, a head-launching done properly, it's just like an old-time barn-raising with

1247
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,460
a square dance at the end to break in the old church.

1248
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,360
Ah, yes, well, it looks like it's about time for us to get off the air.

1249
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:09,340
And I'm going to give that post office box number again that you can write to for free

1250
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:12,200
information on JRBobDobz.com.

1251
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,700
The guru and high-epop, the saint of sales, and the living avatar of Slack.

1252
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,540
Ah, yes.

1253
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,500
And we've been preaching his word.

1254
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,680
I'm your preacher, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1255
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,980
This is Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1256

1258
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,060
Ah, yes.

1259
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,900
Praise Bob.

1260
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,140
And let there be Slack.

1261
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,020
Bob, hear our plea.

1262
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,320
We visit thee.

1263
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,860
Help us be free from normalcy.

1264
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:57,340
We're done devoted and done talked back.

1265
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,800
Please give us an hour of Slack.

1266
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,740
JRBobDobz never fails.

1267
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,320
He's the living Slack master of mystic sales.

1268
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:17,780
All you conspiracy dupes, just you wait till July the 5th, 1998.

1269
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,220
Invaders will come from Planet X.

1270
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,480
Bringing gifts of money, time control, and great sex.

1271
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,220
And a new age rolls on and we'll never look back.

1272
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,800
We'll be busy enjoying our Slack.

1273
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,140
Everybody now.

1274
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,560
Bob, hear our plea.

1275
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,880
We visit thee.

1276
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1277
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1278
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1279
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1280
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1281
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1282
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1283
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1284
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1285
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1286
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,880


1287
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:51,020
We're done devoted and don't talk back.

1288
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,440
Please give us an hour of slack.

1289
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,820
He's the bridge between heaven and earth and hell.

1290
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,120
He's the plain true saint of sales.

1291
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,920
Yeah, he's doing well.

1292
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,540
Read your writings and novels and poems.

1293
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,600
Wings beware.

1294
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,880
The slack master sells everywhere.

1295
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,040
Give thanks to Bob.

1296
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,700
Give thanks to Bob, our eternal hope.

1297
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,220
Praise be to her when you journey.

1298
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,680
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1299
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:28,140
That was Reverend Tony Brower.

1300
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,280
Give thanks to Bob.

1301
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:37,300
And although this is hour of slack number 969,

1302
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,620
it's a rerun of hour of slack 333.

1303
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,120
The number of the anti-bob.

1304
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,200
And we heard some wonderful comedy bits by Cates and West,

1305
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:57,960
which you can also know as Gleepo Abernathy and Billy West.

1306
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,220
Famous cartoon voice is there.

1307
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,580
And yes, some puzzling evidence.

1308
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,160
Dr. Odenkannobite helped a whole lot.

1309
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,200
Philodrumon helped a whole lot.

1310
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,180
And the puzzling evidence, of course,

1311
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,880
show on KPFA with Dr. Al so long, long ago.

1312
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,660
And Church of New Faith, so wonderful.

1313
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:22,040
This music in the background is, of course, the amino acids.

1314
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,440
Actually, it's from their new album.

1315
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,380
And they...

1316
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,400
Oh, yes.

1317
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:33,640
Oh, in the old show, we never mentioned www.subgenius.com.

1318
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,820
But I'm mentioning that now.

1319
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,660
Well, praise Bob.

1320
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,120
And we'll hear you next week.

1321
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:41,440
Yeah.

1322
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:07,540


1323
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:07,540


1324
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:07,560
Thank you.

1325
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1326
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1327
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1328
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1329
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1330
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1331
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1332
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1333
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1334
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1335
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1336
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,600
Thank you.

1337
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:07,660
Thank you.
