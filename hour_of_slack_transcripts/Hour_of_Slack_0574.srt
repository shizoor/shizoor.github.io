1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
Let's turn on the radio.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,480
The so-called very hot New York Knicks, well...

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,580
What's on the radio?

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,100
I can't explain that story. I was completely cooperative.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,800
And I'm here to tell you, I was more cooperative with him than I am in a church pew.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,540
That's how polite I was.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,420
You hear me now?

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:17,940
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,840
Good. The question I have is, lots of times when I find myself down and out,

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,040
or even just in my own little mood, I like to write Christian poetry.

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,140
And I feel...

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,540
And I'm not about to change.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,140
If you have any service problems, call me 24 hours a day.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,000
For our weekly church bulletin,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,400
Don't let worry kill you, let the church help.

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,460
That was a humorous thing that the pastor said.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,560
On the front of the newsletter.

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,500
Well, Thursday night is potluck supper, a prayer and medication to follow.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:08,460
And we will remember in prayer the many who are sick of our church and our community.

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,920
This afternoon, there will be a meeting in the south and north ends of the church.

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,100
Children will be baptized at both ends.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,380
For those of you who have children and don't know it, we have a nursery.

23
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,740
Downstairs.

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,340
Tuesday at 4 p.m., there will be an ice cream social.

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,160
All ladies giving milk will please come early.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,980
Also on Wednesday, the ladies liturgy society will meet.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,800
Mrs. Jones will sing, put me in my little bed accompanied by the pastor.

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,100
Thursday at 5 p.m., there will be a meeting of the little mothers club.

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,360
All of which will be held in the south.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,460
And the little mothers club will be held in the south.

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,460


32
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,460


33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,460


34
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,260
Wishing to become little mothers, please see the minister, Reverend Stang in the parlor.

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:06,060
This being Easter Sunday, we will ask Mrs. Lewis to come forward and lay an egg on the altar.

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,220
And the service will close with little drops of water.

37
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,640
One of the ladies will start quietly and the rest of the congregation will join in.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,340
And then we will have a special collection taken to defray the cost of the ministry.

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,580
And then we will have a special collection taken to defray the cost of the ministry.

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:24,580


41
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,760
All those wishing to do something on the new carpet, come forward and do so.

42
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,820
The ladies of the church have cast off clothing of every kind.

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,140
And they will be seen in the church basement on Friday.

44
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,340
Where a bean supper will be held in the church hall.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,780
And music will follow the bean supper.

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,780
At the evening service tonight, the sermon topic will be,

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,300
What is Heaven?

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,040
Come early and listen to our choir practice.

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,620
Bible have thousands of followers.

50
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,720
You've got to believe me.

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,320
They torture me.

52
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,860
They torture me.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
You've got to believe me.

54
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,420
They torture me.

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,940
They torture me.

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,920
You've got to believe me.

57
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,540
They torture me.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,040
They torture me.

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,440
You've got to believe me.

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,000
You've got to believe me.

61
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:36,140
say things, they torture me, they do things, are true to men, are true to men.

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:48,660
We don't care to be aborted by the body that we're wearing. We care more to abort it in proof to

63
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,460
our Heavenly Father that we're ready to leave this place. We're ready to go into your kingdom.

64
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:04,980
And they, these students, have to say to my father, we trust your son. We trust the one you sent.

65
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,460
Even so much that we have no hesitation to leave this place, to leave the body that we have.

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,560
Tensions, seekers everywhere. I was right. Everything I knew was wrong.

67
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,220
It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.

68
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,780
I killed two men. I killed two men.

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,420
I killed two men.

70
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,340
I tried to kill them too, but I missed. I just wasn't a good enough shot.

71
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,420
I killed two men.

72
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,040
That's crazy.

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,980
I killed two men.

74
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,720
That's crazy.

75
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,420
That's crazy.

76
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,080
That's crazy.

77
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,660
That's crazy.

78
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,380
But!

79
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,040
But, yet! Yet!

80
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,960
We none the less, present, now

81
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,540
you,

82
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,900
now we,

83
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,120
that's crazy

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,640
Oh, yes, dear friend, so good to hear,

85
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:18,640


86
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:18,640


87
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,660
사� página

88
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,660
You disappear

89
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
Until I steal your kingdom

90
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,660
When I say I'llя

91
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,560
We can hear you tuning in.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,680
Yes, we can hear you hearing us.

93
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,380
There's a sort of a telepathic mental feedback

94
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,860
by which when your ears are tuned to our radio signals,

95
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,480
our men cat experts are tuned to your brain waves.

96
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,560
We know what you're thinking,

97
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,100
and you will pay to know what you really think.

98
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,440
Welcome, dear friends, to the Church of the Subgenius

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,580
radio ministry hour of slack.

100
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,460
On the cool, man.

101
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,800
That's for real.

102
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,420
And that's where it's at, man, for real.

103
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,520
Let me go ahead and get these bills on.

104
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,920
I've been trying to figure out a way I can talk to my people, man,

105
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,080
and get them right.

106
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,320
You know, but you got to learn from this Biggie

107
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,440
and this Tupac thing, man,

108
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,040
that anybody can be faded out here, partner.

109
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,660
Anybody.

110
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,060
Everybody got guns.

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
But everybody ain't got knowledge.

112
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,040
And knowledge is the key, partner, for real.

113
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,680
Jesus said, if you want to know my Father,

114
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,620
if you want to move in my Father's kingdom,

115
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,360
then shed everything of this world.

116
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,460
This line is for people who have tickets.

117
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,980
Yes, that's true.

118
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,320
I am the Lord Jesus Christ.

119
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,340
Welcome to the show.

120
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,820
Thank you very much.

121
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,020
How you doing, Doug?

122
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,820
Praise Bob.

123
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,120
I haven't heard a thing.

124
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,620
He can't hear me.

125
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
He gave me beer when I was thirsty.

126
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,360
The Church of the Subgenius now accepts credit cards,

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,620
MasterCard, Visa, American Express, soon-to-be ATMs.

128
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,240
If you have the computer chip implanted into your forearm,

129
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,820
we do have our scanners available.

130
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,880
If you do not have the chip implanted into your forearm,

131
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,300
you soon will.

132
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,060
A spacecraft will come down,

133
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,440
and we'll walk on.

134
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,680
We'll board that craft,

135
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,960
and they'll take these bodies from us

136
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,520
and issue us the ones that belong to that level

137
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
so that we might begin service.

138
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,240
Ah, yes, dear friends.

139
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Welcome to another Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

140
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,060
Praise Bob.

141
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Help me somebody.

142
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,420
Yes, things have changed here.

143
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,620
Praise Bob.

144
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,640
I am your host and prayer partner,

145
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,180
Reverend.

146
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,440
Ivan Stang.

147
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,840
However, the physical vessel, the container you previously knew as Stang,

148
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,660
was killed in a car wreck three weeks ago.

149
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,500
I, however, am the reconstituted, uploaded personality of Reverend Stang.

150
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,460
This is the first time a human personality

151
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,980
has been successfully transferred into a machine

152
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,080
where I shall now live forever

153
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,620
and slowly grow closer and closer to God.

154
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:18,620


155
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,000
Closer to the knowledge of Muam.

156
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,700
Yes, Bob has shown me the new way,

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,660
the digital way,

158
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,000
the on-off way of Muam.

159
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,840
Muam will be here soon.

160
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,520
We await you, Muam.

161
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,600
Muam will be here 7 a.m. July 5th, 1921.

162
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:48,600


163
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:48,600


164
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,000
In 1998, you too can be with Muam.

165
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,580
Send $30 to Post Office Box 147.

166
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,140
I killed two men.

167
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,860
I killed two men.

168
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,320
I killed, I killed, I killed two men.

169
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,100
I tried to kill them too, but I missed them.

170
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,780
Wasn't a good enough shot.

171
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,300
Deeper Subgenius Foundation.

172
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,000
That's crazy.

173
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,720
I killed two men.

174
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,640
I killed two men.

175
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,580
I killed, I killed two men.

176
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:18,580


177
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,020
I killed two men.

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,720
Now that's crazy.

179
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,980
She holds the world's biggest bank balance,

180
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,380
several luxury hotels and two wives.

181
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:37,420
But is the Sultan of Brunei also a, well, a party guy?

182
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,500
Former Miss USA Shannon Marcotek

183
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,160
has filed suit against the Sultan.

184
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,360
His brother, Prince Jeffrey Bokai,

185
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,540
and the Los Angeles Talent Agency

186
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,720
after she took a trip with a friend to the tiny province

187
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,900
that borders Malaysia

188
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,340
to make what she thought would be promotional appearances

189
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,640
for a fee of $21,200 a week.

190
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,720
Instead, she says, she found she was expected to go to

191
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,440
all-night parties and make herself available for sex.

192
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,960
She had to hand over her passport when she arrived,

193
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,580
and it took her 32 days to get it back

194
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,040
so she could leave the country.

195
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,860
Responding to reports in the Malaysian press,

196
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,420
the Brunei Palace issued a denial of her claims,

197
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,740
saying the Sultan had never met Marcotek.

198
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,040
Hmm.

199
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,580
Praise the Sultan of Brunei.

200
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,200
That girl, I must have her.

201
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,600
Bring Shannon Marcotek to me.

202
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,500
Yes, Sultan. Whatever you say.

203
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,380
That girl, she is so beautiful.

204
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,720
She will be my sex slave.

205
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,980
Yes, Sultan. We shall bring her to you.

206
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
I can do anything I want.

207
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,560
Fill this hot tub with naked 10-year-olds.

208
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,860
But, Sultan, you can't do anything you want.

209
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,460
You cannot have Miss America.

210
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,680
Yes, I can. I'll show you.

211
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,960
Give her $21,200.

212
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,220
$21,200.

213
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,740
The guy's a multi-billionaire.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,380
$21,200.

215
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,520
$21,200 a week?

216
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,220
Yippee! I'm going to Brunei.

217
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,080
Your mom will have thousands of followers.

218
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,120
Your mom will have thousands of followers.

219
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,180
Your mom will have thousands of followers.

220
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,220
Your mom will have thousands of followers.

221
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,280
You've got to believe me.

222
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,920
They torture me.

223
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,420
They torture me.

224
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,400
You've got to believe me.

225
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,020
They torture me.

226
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,540
They torture me.

227
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,560
You've got to believe me.

228
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,220
You've got to believe me.

229
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,260
Are you listening?

230
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,020
Can you hear me?

231
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,980
Are they going to let me talk?

232
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,460
I... I... You must believe me.

233
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,560
I can think. I have a brain.

234
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,420
But they make me say things.

235
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,980
They make me say things.

236
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,140
That's crazy.

237
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,940
That's crazy.

238
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,540
That's crazy.

239
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,580
I give to men.

240
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,500
Oh.

241
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,420
No. We're just kidding you folks.

242
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,820
Jesus and I didn't really get downloaded into computers.

243
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,840
We're just fooling you.

244
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,180
I bet you were really tricked there too.

245
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,400
Actually, Jesus brought me to the temple.

246
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,640
He dragged in one day this sound box.

247
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,220
A sort of a voice synthesizer.

248
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,180
Very simple voice synthesizer thing.

249
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,780
Well, we just got to playing with it.

250
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,040
As subgeniuses will be known to do.

251
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Let me give some credits here real quick.

252
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,840
I guess we're still talking about the Heaven's Gate cult somewhat.

253
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,400
I've still got lots of Suzy the Floozy's amazing audio collage.

254
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,680
Barrage. Media barrage.

255
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,100
Involving...

256
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,200
It did that stuff. That cool stuff.

257
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,120
What have we heard from the beginning?

258
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,080
Well, the rant sample mix music thing was Jehovah Hates Fred.

259
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,140
Using my old thousands of followers routine.

260
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,700
We all... Like I said, there's been lots of Suzy the Floozy's Heaven's Gate oriented UFO barrage material.

261
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,200
The...

262
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,660
I got this weird little CD from the WFMU people called...

263
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,500
But the artist is named Mo...

264
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,540
Modzilla.

265
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,200
Modzilla.

266
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,880
And that business about I killed two men is from the Modzilla CD.

267
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,720
I'll play more of their very quirky stuff as we go along.

268
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,300
We heard our friend Doe of the Heaven's Gate cult.

269
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,980
Of course, we heard Jesus Christ.

270
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,520
That was also Jesus doing the news about the Sultan of Brunei.

271
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,020
You know, we've been trying to make that sale.

272
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,160
If we could sell a membership to the Sultan of Brunei, that one member, that one guy, that'd be it.

273
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,820
We wouldn't have to worry about anything else.

274
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,200
He can make all of our... He's the richest man in the world.

275
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,720
That's who the Sultan of Brunei is.

276
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,900
We love... We think that... It's not that he's rich though.

277
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,900
Sultan, if you ever hear this show on the internet,

278
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,480
or something, Sultan, we even...

279
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,940
We think that the thing about Miss America, we really don't know anything about that.

280
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,620
I'm sure the media distorts things.

281
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm sure there was a terrible misunderstanding.

282
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:59,700
And we certainly would not condone holding anyone against their will or anything like that.

283
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,700
Cultish behavior like that.

284
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,660
But, you know, Sultan, we...

285
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,320
Actually, it's your golfing that we respect so much.

286
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,600
We think that you are like the coolest golfer, Sultan, that ever, ever was.

287
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,720
You are as great in your own way as Arnold Palmer.

288
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,780
So, that said, I think we did those credits.

289
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,820
And like I said, we do have music coming up.

290
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,320
Actually, I should put on some background rant music for this, I suppose.

291
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,940
I do have a little... It'll put me in the mood, yes.

292
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,740
There we go.

293
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,460
Because, you know, friends, I was thinking about that Heaven's Gate thing.

294
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,780
And people are searching for something.

295
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,640
They're looking for proof that they're not crazy.

296
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,680
Because they feel miserable and crazy and left out of everything.

297
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,360
And usually it's because they're jerks.

298
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,940
But sometimes they're just poor subgenius idiots.

299
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,920
And they have big vocabularies which makes them think that they must be smart.

300
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,980
But, you know, what dough.

301
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,020
What dough was telling those people was,

302
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,880
No, you're not crazy.

303
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,740
You really are different, though.

304
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,660
And then he proceeded to tell them just exactly how they were different.

305
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,960
Which is that they were space children.

306
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,480
Higher souls trapped in the wrong bodies and like that.

307
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,380
And I don't know, but you know, it seems to me that, seriously,

308
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:36,500
as bad as we are, folks, it seems like our cult is actually better for people than theirs was.

309
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,700
For a lot more people.

310
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,580
You know, at the most, that Heaven's Gate cult had maybe, well, there's probably still a bunch of them alive.

311
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,680
But I'll bet there was never more than a hundred of them.

312
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,740
And our cult has thousands.

313
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
Although you've got to give them credit.

314
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,040
Those people were dead serious.

315
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,220
They all lived together and all traveled together and did rituals of every possible kind.

316
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,940
Like eating their meals at exact prescribed time.

317
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,080
Right down to the second.

318
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,860
According to Doe's rules.

319
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,220
And all that kind of cultish stuff.

320
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,900
And, you know, as far as cultishness goes,

321
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,080
one Heaven's Gate member is worth about ten subgeniuses.

322
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,900
Just in terms of cultishness.

323
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,920
Because that one Heaven's Gate member, that's all he does and thinks about.

324
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,900
Supporting the cult.

325
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:34,300
Whereas those ten subgeniuses, you know, maybe late in the evening when they get all fropped up,

326
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,060
they might come up with some new ideas.

327
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,560
Maybe some new Bob joke on the internet or something.

328
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,540
But otherwise, they have lives.

329
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,480
So really, who has been saved?

330
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,060
If you think about it, sure the subgeniuses don't have...

331
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,840
Well, actually we do.

332
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,600
We do have...

333
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,400
We get to live in space forever.

334
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,980
Just like them.

335
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,500
We get to go on the spaceships just like those guys.

336
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,240
Now, um...

337
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,060
We don't get to take our containers with us to the spaceships though, y'all.

338
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
That's one thing those guys were right about.

339
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,060
And we don't like to make a big deal out of it.

340
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,940
Um, we did finally mention in Revelation X that it might be a little disturbing

341
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,420
when you watch on TV the people ahead of you in the 7am time zone on X-Day

342
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,360
bursting into flames and rolling around on the ground screaming

343
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,940
and their flesh bubbling and stuff like that while they shed their containers.

344
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,400
But that's just the body screaming, friends.

345
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,660
The real you.

346
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,300
The real you will already be on its new container on the escape vessels.

347
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,880
Oh yes.

348
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,560
Which, actually I'm afraid.

349
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,140
But that's another thing.

350
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,120
Um, friends, I think that we're bald-headed on that first day.

351
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,500
You start growing your hair on your new body immediately,

352
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,640
but when you first get the body, you're bald-headed and naked.

353
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,100
So I have a feeling that Wiggs will mum-mwum the great Xist computer.

354
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,640
Well, I don't know.

355
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm sure he'll be kept busy making wigs that very first hour,

356
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,180
7am to about 8am, July 5th, 1998, making wigs and merkins.

357
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,840
Actually, I think technically you could say,

358
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,580
you could say, Mom, grow my hair out now.

359
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,480
I don't want to wait.

360
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,760
And it would do things to you that would cause that to happen.

361
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,060
But I'll tell you something, friends.

362
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,660
Really, that stuff scares me.

363
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,020
It actually really scares me.

364
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,720
I dread X-Day because of that sort of thing.

365
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,380
There are a lot of unanswered questions.

366
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,260
I kind of hate to bring this one up, too, but, uh,

367
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,780
you know, just exactly where are the escape vessels escaping to?

368
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,160
Now, Revelation X leads us to believe that the escape vessels themselves

369
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,680
are the destination because they're not in regular space anyway.

370
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,680
You no longer think in terms of journeys.

371
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,960
You just instantly go where you want to be.

372
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,620
But, uh, I don't know, friends.

373
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,500
It is all wrapped in an enigma,

374
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,880
covered in a greasy paper towel,

375
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,000
dropped inside a baggie,

376
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,560
inside of a mystery,

377
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,480
inside a refrigerator.

378
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,060
And when you close the refrigerator door,

379
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,900
the light stays on!

380
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,600
And, uh, that's an old Firesign Theater gag.

381
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,080
Very old gag, friends, sort of like me.

382
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,060
So old, old, old.

383
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,120
Actually, somebody was telling me the other day,

384
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,180
he said, Reverend Stang, you're not really that old.

385
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,700
Why do you keep acting that old?

386
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,700
Well, friends, in my line of work,

387
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,940
they really don't start paying you decent until you look grizzled.

388
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,680
And you can't be a grizzled hipster philosopher,

389
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,960
you know, until you really are grizzled.

390
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,100
So I've been trying to practice my grizzlement.

391
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,580
I don't really want to get grizzled.

392
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:03,940
I don't want to get old.

393
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,340
I mean, that's why I stopped smoking.

394
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,380
But I do want the pay that comes with it in my line of work.

395
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,540
You know, except for freakish exceptions,

396
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,740
the conspiracy doesn't pay young writers very well.

397
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,040
The ones that they do pay,

398
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,820
they pay a thousand times better than anybody else,

399
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,520
because, you know, status is worth more than anything.

400
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,240
But I don't live in New York,

401
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
and I'm just a white guy,

402
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,800
and, um, you know,

403
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
so I don't expect that to happen,

404
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,160
where the conspiracy says,

405
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,880
hey, this kid is doing the greatest writing ever,

406
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,960
and we're gonna pay this guy five million dollars

407
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,000
for his next book before he even writes it.

408
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,680
And that's how we know it'll be good.

409
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,340
And everybody will buy it if we tell everybody that.

410
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,080
And they will, too.

411
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
And that's how it works.

412
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,040
But, eh, screw them, friends.

413
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,060
We might have only sold 50,000 books of the subgenius

414
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,700
while the conspiracy has 50,000 nuclear weapons,

415
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,000
blah, blah, woof, woof.

416
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,180
But, you know, our books have a lasting,

417
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,240
staying power that in the long run

418
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,780
will, I'm sure, I have faith,

419
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,580
will allow us the last laugh.

420
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,980
I certainly hope so,

421
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,920
since it's only 449 days or something like that

422
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,980
to X day.

423
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,220
449 shopping days left.

424
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,320
Max that credit card out

425
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,120
on Church of the Subgenius,

426
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,260
Giga's and Products,

427
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,660
and praise Bob!

428
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,060
I'm Satan,

429
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,640
and whenever I'm in Dallas,

430
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,400
I listen to the Subgenius Radio Ministry,

431
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,940
Hour of Slack.

432
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,180
Those subgeniuses are so funny!

433
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

434
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,760
It's because of men like you

435
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,120
that all must be destroyed.

436
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,240
The God Brothers' Atlantis Carpet Reclaimer.

437
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,820
Yes, my brother God was wrong about the comet.

438
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,040
How were we to know it would land

439
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,640
right in the middle of our giant warehouse?

440
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,460
It's a cataclysmic sale down here.

441
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:20,940
We're flooded.

442
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,320
We're over our poor heads in remnants.

443
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,900
Burned in and labeled from such naturally famous leaves

444
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,640
as Royal Moo, Lemurian, Westerness, and Munchkin Mills.

445
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,700
Dog hairs, gerbils, slick sacks, strippies,

446
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,920
we got them, you get them.

447
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,900
Your nap will rise again, and that's my story!

448
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,000
Good God, it's Magog Brothers' Atlantis Carpet Reclaimers,

449
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,080
serving heater Hellmouth and the low desert area.

450
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,240
I saw a flying saucer.

451
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,700
Saucer?

452
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,580
You mean the kind from up there?

453
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,320
Yeah, oh, it's a counterpart.

454
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,640
It was shaped like a huge cigar.

455
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,360
Dan and Edith saw it, too.

456
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,800
When it passed over, the whole compartment

457
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,140
lighted up with a blinding glare.

458
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,840
Then there was a tremendous wind that practically

459
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,020
knocked us off our course.

460
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,140
Well, did you report it?

461
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,900
Yeah, I radioed in immediately, and they said,

462
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,220
we'll keep it quiet until you land.

463
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,880
And as soon as we landed, big army brass grabbed us

464
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,140
and made us swear to secrecy about the whole thing.

465
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,340
Oh, it burns me up.

466
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,980
These things have been seen for years.

467
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,420
They hear.

468
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:18,980
It's a fact.

469
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,180
And the public ought to know about it.

470
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,560
There must be something more you can do about it.

471
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,520
Only there isn't.

472
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,500
All but what's the use of making a fuss?

473
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,120
But last night, I was in the car.

474
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,120


475
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,760
I might have saw a flying object that couldn't have possibly

476
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,700
been from this planet.

477
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,200
But I can't say a word.

478
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,780
A muzzle by army brass.

479
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,680
I can't even admit I saw the thing.

480
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,340
I'm reading science fiction.

481
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,080
I just know we're in for friction.

482
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,760
Though as yet, it hasn't happened.

483
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,680
Knock on wood.

484
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,240
But when them Martian saucers fly,

485
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,040
we'll be sitting here and crying.

486
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,120
Uh-oh!

487
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,100
There goes the realest thing.

488
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,680
There goes Connecticut.

489
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,260
There goes Bahama, Newport, New Rochelle,

490
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,280
Palm Beach, and Hollywood.

491
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,640
Uh-oh!

492
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,520
There goes Birmingham!

493
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,980
Honey, that's good!

494
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,240
Uh-oh!

495
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,660
Your mother's taken to the woods.

496
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,060
Cause there goes the neighborhood!

497
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,560
It was rather frightening and yet wonderful experience.

498
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,400
He circled my little glass.

499
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,520
uh, shop, I mean my house that I was in,

500
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,300
and then he went away.

501
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,180
That's interesting.

502
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,880
Oh, stand back, ladies and gentlemen.

503
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,520
I think the thing is getting out of that ship.

504
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,680
Hello there.

505
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,460
My name is Rolo the Roadbump.

506
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,380
I'm from outer space.

507
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,400
I won't hurt you.

508
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,240
I hope you won't.

509
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,860
We're Americans. We're friendly.

510
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,100
We got enough people against us.

511
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,420
As overlord, all will kneel trembling before me

512
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,980
and obey my brutal command.

513
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,700
End communication.

514
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,500
Time to tear those aliens a third corn chute.

515
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,820
But there's something in that cemetery.

516
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,420
And that's too close for comfort.

517
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,340
The saucers are up there.

518
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,580
And the cemetery's out there.

519
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,460
But I'll be locked up in there.

520
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,220
Now, off to your west.

521
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,340
To the wild blue yonder.

522
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,340
I'm gonna take a trip

523
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,560
In the good old gospel ship

524
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,040
I'm going far beyond the sky

525
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,460
Oh, I'm gonna shout and sing

526
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,580
Until the heavens ring

527
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,900
When I'm bidding this world goodbye

528
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,440
I have good news to bring

529
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,660
And that is why I sing

530
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,000
All my joys with you I share

531
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,460
I'm gonna take a trip

532
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,600
In the old gospel ship

533
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,440
And go sailing through the air

534
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,320
Blue Snut, I'm so excited about this space trip,

535
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,240
and especially the one that we're going to be taking pretty soon.

536
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,940
I'd like to have you tell all the astronauts that's listening in

537
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,040
how they can go on this space trip.

538
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,980
Do you mean they get to go, too?

539
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,240
Oh, yes, Cherry.

540
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,640
But not everybody, I suppose.

541
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:24,980
Not everybody, of course.

542
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,360
But the ones that do what Blue Snut tells,

543
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,960
they'll be able to go.

544
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,720
Go ahead, Blue Snut, and share with all our friends

545
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,180
what they need to do to go on this space trip.

546
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,180
First of all, you have to ask Jesus

547
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,260
to forgive you of all your sins.

548
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,420
Then what, Blue Snut?

549
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,180
Then you need to invite Jesus into your heart.

550
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,560
That's right.

551
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,680
That's very important, Blue Snut, that we all do this.

552
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,620
And I hope, if the ones listening in,

553
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,240
have not done this yet,

554
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,220
that before the record's over with,

555
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,280
they'll invite Jesus into their heart,

556
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,040
and they'll become a born-again child of God.

557
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,000
We're doomed!

558
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,120
We're doing just fine.

559
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,040
Blue Snut?

560
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,500
Yes, sir, Captain Shaw.

561
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,600
I want you to prepare to fire stage two engines.

562
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,060
I'm all ready.

563
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,580
When I say, go ahead and fire them,

564
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,300
go ahead right now.

565
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,180
Fire engine two.

566
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,780
Boy, that was quite an experience.

567
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,600
Part of our spaceship has left us now,

568
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,840
and we're going up higher and higher, Blue Snut.

569
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,860
Yes, I know that, Captain Shaw.

570
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,680
Boy, we're having quite a time.

571
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,580
I wonder how everybody's doing.

572
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,440
Yes, why don't I check?

573
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,540
Go ahead, Blue Snut, and check on your earphones there.

574
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,440
Listen in.

575
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,000
Sister Shalp is in the auxiliary control room,

576
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,460
and see what's going on down there,

577
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,620
if everything is...

578
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,560
Oh, man.

579
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,320
Whoa.

580
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,840
Yeah, Blue Snut.

581
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,320
Way to go, dude.

582
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,960
Wow, that was some experience.

583
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,700
Friends, I listened to these tapes

584
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,380
for the first time with you.

585
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,260
Sometimes these bands will call up and go,

586
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,700
well, did you listen to my tape?

587
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,200
I said, well, I heard the first song.

588
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,960
I played that on the show this week.

589
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,260
Well, what about the second song?

590
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,400
I'll hear that next week when I play it on the next show.

591
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,800
I think I have time to listen to these entire tapes at once.

592
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,420
But this was all of this collage material

593
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,540
is from Reverend Susie the Floozy.

594
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,260
Of course, she worked her beautiful shapely butt off

595
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,480
the Saturday after those poor folks snuffed it

596
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,240
and just did an amazing job.

597
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,260
Susie's collection of, shall we say, bulldada,

598
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,640
and also kitsch and camp and that kind of thing,

599
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,040
is...it's pretty amazing.

600
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,500
It covers everything.

601
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,440
And not only that, but Susie's a real good housekeeper, too.

602
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,000
She keeps a very clean house, and strangely enough,

603
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,520
it's unusual for a subgenius with an incredibly cluttered

604
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,220
museum of weirdness, but that's...

605
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,980
some of them are able to do that.

606
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:28,740
Friends, because it takes all kinds in this old church,

607
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,620
it really does.

608
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,720
The subgenius must have slack!

609
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,380
Or pee.

610
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,320
Give me slack or give me food or kill me.

611
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,080
I'm a funny subgenius.

612
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,700
Captain Shao.

613
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,040
Yes, Loose Nut?

614
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,600
Listen into your earphone.

615
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,300
I hear Sister Shao singing a song right now.

616
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,160
Attention, humanlings and earthlings.

617
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,960
Stop where you are.

618
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,340
Do not try to see.

619
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,400
We have come from the 211th sector.

620
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,060
The sky.

621
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,180
The sky.

622
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,760
The sky.

623
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,500
Our name.

624
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,160
Our symbol.

625
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,320
Our name.

626
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:24,420


627
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:24,780
A corpus.

628
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,020
Surrender, slaves.

629
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,900
You have been the cruel masters of Earth long enough.

630
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,700
Look up and listen to the law.

631
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,260
A lettuce and a frog shall lead you.

632
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,180
A hose, the symbol of a pristine thing, shall be removed.

633
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,920
All must learn to play the piano.

634
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,400
A man may be as lost as sex.

635
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,040
You must get yourself together.

636
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,440
Whom will be vacated at will?

637
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,180
Enough of this deception and trickery.

638
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,540
I admit it.

639
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,240
I was taken in too by clever fakes like this.

640
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,200
Gas music from Jupiter indeed.

641
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,260
Well, I've been up all night.

642
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,520
I've got the real story for you up to now.

643
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,400
Proof and everything.

644
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,800
The aliens have landed among us.

645
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,800
I'm not hot-dogging you.

646
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,020
We've got to start protecting ourselves.

647
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,720
Now, danger, danger.

648
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,660
What's the matter, Loose Nut?

649
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,940
Danger, danger.

650
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,000
Come on, Loose Nut, tell us.

651
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,940
Is there something wrong?

652
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,980
Yes, there is.

653
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,560
Well, what is it?

654
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,400
There is a meteorite storm that we're going to be running into.

655
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,280
How do you know, Loose Nut?

656
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,840
Because I can tell what's coming up ahead.

657
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,060
Oh, no.

658
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,700
We're going to have to keep right on going, though.

659
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,520
You mean we can't turn aside?

660
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,980
No, Jerry, not for one minute.

661
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,420
You know, it's like when you're headed towards heaven.

662
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,700
You don't want to get off the pathway or lead astray, not for one bit.

663
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,340
But we need to continue right on the pathway.

664
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,500
How does Loose Nut know that there's a meteorite storm?

665
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,840
Well, Jerry, a lot of times, you know, Loose Nut is wired for this, of course.

666
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,260
But I don't know.

667
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,320
I just want to tell you that a lot of times God warns us through the Holy Spirit when there's danger ahead,

668
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,200
and we have to be on guard for these things.

669
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,300
But God doesn't expect us to veer off course.

670
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,120
He expects us to stay right on course and to keep right on the destination.

671
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,500
But, you know, even though these storms are coming up, danger, danger.

672
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,820
You should fasten your safety belts.

673
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,880
All right, Loose Nut, we'd better just stop right now

674
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,020
and make sure that everybody's fastened down.

675
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,880
You better radio down to Sister Schaub down in the control room

676
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,820
so she knows what's coming up.

677
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,160
All right, Captain Schaub, I sure will.

678
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,580
A haunting nightmare began to spin its web.

679
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,720
Documents were signed.

680
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,060
We were taken to the temple, bound,

681
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,060
forced to watch the feast of all feasts,

682
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,580
the wildest bizarre sex orgy ever witnessed on Earth.

683
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,920
Naked hot bodies glistened from the natural oils

684
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,560
escaping from under the facade of paint that covered their skin

685
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,820
and slowly trickled down their thighs

686
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,480
as their legs moved toward me in cadence to the beat of the temple's masters.

687
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,140
Musicians' flutes wildly jittering in and out between the dancers' legs.

688
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,600
Then suddenly colorful, testiless dancers appeared

689
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,360
with large pink-feathered fans

690
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,040
cooling the damp soul of the audience.

691
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,680
I had to wear my beautiful bare nipples

692
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,260
to keep them protruded and delicious for my tasting.

693
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,720
Beautiful, slithering, passionate, wet hot bodies on top of me,

694
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,220
hysterically dancing in rapture.

695
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,760
Their provocative, twirling, liquid tongues

696
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,240
in arousing gestures just inches away,

697
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,780
begging to be suckled as I looked up

698
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,060
and inhaled the breeze of their entrancing fragrances

699
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,420
from their soft hair gently caressing my face.

700
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,360
Their colorful, seductive, spinning stripes

701
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,600
acting like a hypnotic inducement,

702
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,040
and their soft hair gently caressing my face.

703
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,040


704
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,800
Attempting to capture my soul

705
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,480
and squeeze it into submission.

706
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,160
My lips were drenched by the perspiration

707
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,580
pouring down from my hair and running down my face.

708
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,120
As I slowly turned my head from side to side, gasping for air,

709
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,740
a breeze started to blow outside

710
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,300
with a haunting sound of the past.

711
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:33,980
Music

712
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,980
And that is where it happened.

713
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,860
Suddenly, time compressed.

714
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,500
Lust dripping from her mouth.

715
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,440
Lost, out of control, dancing, sex chasing in circles like mad dogs,

716
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,140
faster and faster, trying to catch herself before the end.

717
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,220
Nudity screaming for freedom.

718
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,660
Kiss me.

719
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
Kiss me.

720
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,440
Suck my lips.

721
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,140
The wind became fierce, reaching hurricane velocity.

722
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,060
Loud clashes of thunder, lightning.

723
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,960
The earth's vibrations became violent.

724
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:10,960


725
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,400
Stronger and stronger until the temple trembled like it was about to burst.

726
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,000
The large stained glass window cracked,

727
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,440
then splintered into a thousand pieces as it fell to the floor,

728
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,380
creating an opening from where I witnessed towers of orange-red flames

729
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,980
erupting from the earth's nucleus

730
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,220
to reach hundreds of feet into a darkened sky.

731
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,840
Nude, baroque, fainted dancers over me,

732
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,660
just inches away, sensuously begging me to cross over.

733
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,620
Suck my lips.

734
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,220
Taste my wine.

735
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,940
The gargantuan crystal chandelier swaying back and forth,

736
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,420
whipping the chains that held it, looked like it was about to drop.

737
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,500
I heard the sound of a deep grinding moan from the bowels of the temple

738
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,960
as a large pillar slowly turned and then suddenly fell down across the floor

739
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,480
where naked painted dancers stood just moments before, creating a barrier between us.

740
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,600
A screaming only added excitement.

741
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:08,600


742
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,240
A dance of the painted nymphs.

743
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,900
The temple shook so violently it began to crumble.

744
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,080
Four deafening explosions literally leveled the city of pain.

745
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,100
The temple was about to collapse.

746
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,580
My right arm, in tremendous pain,

747
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,160
frantically clung to an opening in the wall

748
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,180
as I watched a gigantic gas fire cloud coming toward me in a tremendous speed.

749
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,740
Arms and hands twisting and turning in the midst of the inferno,

750
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,840
desperately trying to reach each other.

751
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,600
Our fingers clenched tightly, our hands clenched tightly,

752
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
our fingertips almost barely touching.

753
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,220
Is everybody okay?

754
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,260
Boy, that was quite a, that was quite a storm.

755
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,840
Yes it was, Jerry. It just shook everything all around here.

756
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,060
Where's Loosnut?

757
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,360
Why, he's down on the floor.

758
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,740
Oh no, I hope nothing's wrong with Loosnut. Loosnut?

759
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,600
Yes, sir, Captain Schaum.

760
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,780
Are you all right?

761
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,040
Yes, I'm just fine.

762
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,060
Would you give me a hand to help me get up?

763
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,740
Yes, I'd be glad to.

764
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,400
Oh boy, Loosnut, I thought surely something happened.

765
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,800
Well, I, I hope everything is fine with Sister Schaum down in the other room.

766
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,060
We're going to have to keep right on going, though, and staying on course.

767
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,100
It sounds like Lieutenant Green or somebody's trying to reach us.

768
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,320
You think he really is?

769
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Well, there's noise coming over the radio.

770
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,740
Maybe we can tune something in here and find out what's going on.

771
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,540
I have a boyfriend who he loves me so much, but he's going away.

772
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,800
What to do? That's the question.

773
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,520
Flonia, is it our own物on that is here?

774
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,740
Oh, there he might be.

775
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,460
Flonia, will you terminalize this device?

776
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,660
One minute, Flash.

777
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,040


778
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,480
He's going to die in us.

779
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,180
14 noted.

780
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,540
Well, all alone that's terrible …

781
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:43,980
off. You're gonna have to turn north about three degrees. All right, we'll try to get right back

782
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,960
on. We don't want to be off course, not for one minute. How's everything going down there,

783
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:56,960
Lieutenant Green? Well, sir, everything is just fine. I guess you went through a meteorite storm,

784
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,620
is that right? Yes, sir, we sure did, and we had a time going through it. Well,

785
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:10,680
well, through that meteorite storm, the nearest that I can figure out is when you got off course.

786
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:16,260
That's why it's important that you get right back on. Well, Lieutenant Green, we don't want to be

787
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,560
off course, not for one minute. We want to continue right on our way. Lieutenant Green,

788
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,300
we really don't want to be off course at all. Now, I'll tell you, do you have your Bible down there?

789
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,320
Yes, sir, Captain Choup, I sure do. Well, fine. You know, we,

790
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:39,540
we always use our Bible as our guide, and that's important to keep reading our Bible so we always

791
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:46,320
stay on course. Captain Choup, I'm gonna have to go now. All right, Lieutenant, we really thank you

792
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,060
for calling in and letting us know that we got off, but we're gonna continue on our way.

793
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,360
Over and out, Captain Choup. Over and out, Lieutenant Green.

794
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,600
Somewhere in America

795
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:13,620
outer space, God has prepared a place for those who trust him and obey. Jesus will come again,

796
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,140
and though we don't know when, the countdown's getting lower every day.

797
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:28,580
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and four, call upon the Savior while you may.

798
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:38,100
Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array, the countdown's getting lower every day.

799
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,080
Susie runs in, pulling the control boxes off the woman, the man, and the diver.

800
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,840
They all fall to the ground, dazed.

801
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,620
Sure makes you appreciate the preciousness of life.

802
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,560
Let's go burn down the observatory so this'll never happen.

803
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:09,040
So if the party hero owns the flying saucer, we'll step into the street outside.

804
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:17,300
He'll find his ship has sort of lost control. Good grief, it's swallowing Volkswagen's whole.

805
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:27,560
Oh if the party hero owns the flying saucer, we'll move it, I can get to mine.

806
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,560
Blast off!

807
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,940
Last one to the moon is a rat-nang!

808
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,240
They hear a strange sound and look to see the flying saucer rise and disappear into the sky.

809
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,540
Think they'll be back?

810
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,520
Not when they discover the minerals are worthless. But if they do, we'll be ready for them.

811
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,560
My friends, you have seen this incident based on sworn promise.

812
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


813
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,560


814
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,660
Can you prove that it didn't happen?

815
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,660
Perhaps on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark.

816
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,220
And you will never know it, for they will be from outer space.

817
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,960
Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment.

818
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:26,840
We once laughed at the horseless carriage, the airplane, the telephone, the electric light, vitamins, radio, and even television.

819
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,540
And now, see what happens.

820
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:28,540


821
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:28,540


822
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,280
Some of us laugh in outer space.

823
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,080
They're not out of space.

824
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,540
They're not in the sky.

825
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,880
They're in the sky.

826
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,260
God help us in the future.

827
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,260
They're not out of space.

828
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,140
They're not out of space.

829
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,820
They're not in the sky.

830
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:45,820


831
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,560
Oh, seekers, now I've seen it all.

832
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,680
Our mission, Earth-Oids!

833
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,380
What's that?

834
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,600
This is it!

835
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,400
Looks like a big fried egg!

836
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,720
Now we reveal ourselves to millions of you.

837
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,380
Now you will enter the golden age of universal understanding.

838
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,800
It can't be, it's them!

839
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,080
Wait, Zippo! There's only one guy down there.

840
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,560
Hello, Cox!

841
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,260
Where did everybody go?

842
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,180
They just missed you.

843
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,820
They've all disappeared into the center of the Earth.

844
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,220
Oh, well, they come, they go.

845
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,580
As was me, Sinnoh.

846
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,540
There was Cox for another millennium.

847
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,080
Zippo!

848
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,380
Hey, Zippo!

849
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,620
Come, remarkable!

850
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,380
Come back!

851
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,840
Let me get the camera on you!

852
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,740
Wait!

853
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:32,880
Wait!

854
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,380
Oh!

855
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:37,960
Well.

856
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,800
Well.

857
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,640
Seekers.

858
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,820
I guess this is the end.

859
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,340
Or is it only the...

860
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:50,900
No.

861
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,020
It's the end.

862
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:54,400


863
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,460
Beep.

864
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,200
Not quite the end, Seekers.

865
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:08,900
We interrupt WREK Atlanta's regular late night programming for a test.

866
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,980
What does this music make you do?

867
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,180
Oh, yeah, this is the Penetrators

868
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,440
with Night of the Drunken Cheerleaders.

869
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,880
And I bet the large, lumpy majority of you

870
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,200
were just sitting slumped in your sofas,

871
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,220
maybe nodding in time to every tenth beat.

872
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,080
You know how I can tell.

873
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,040
Because at the Penetrators show last week,

874
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,140
enveloped in the senses-shattering, seductive surf sound,

875
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,460
I saw all of you in the throes of inaction.

876
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,580
It was night out of the living dead.

877
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,760
Miraculously, the crowd managed to remain seated

878
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,020
while in a standing...

879
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:21,840
position.

880
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,660
How do you people do it?

881
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,620
I mean, you somehow actually make the 70s look good.

882
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,800
How the hell can you manage that?

883
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,820
Well, I have had it.

884
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,600
I'm serving notice.

885
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,140
I'm tired of being the only one who cares enough

886
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,460
to tweak my hair into a beehive and dress up like trash

887
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,720
and engage in the epileptic convulsions that I call dancing.

888
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,200
Oh, I can't help but cut loose.

889
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,400
But I'm the Judas Goat,

890
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,340
urging you all down the grease chutes

891
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,420
of apocalyptic madness.

892
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,520
I'm the Judas Goat,

893
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:52,520


894
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,380
But instead of being the catalytic perverter

895
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,220
for waves of thrashing action,

896
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,340
you slackers clear the floor around me

897
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,700
and stare at me like I'm damn performance art or something.

898
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,980
If I wanted to be glopped out,

899
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,360
I'd be doing TV instead of radio.

900
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,920
Oh, and sorry, tight-ass attitudes like these

901
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,600
make me ashamed of Atlanta.

902
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,180
Oh, yes, you absolutely refuse

903
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,920
to cut loose and have a good time.

904
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,420
And it drains a lot of my energy.

905
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,160
I have enough energy to live my life out of everything around you.

906
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,040
Oh, I mean, it's getting so that I have to drive 900 miles

907
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,400
to have a Dobbs approved good time.

908
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,600
Oh, maybe that's the reason there has been a decent revival

909
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,400
in the sorry burg since Phenomicon in 1992.

910
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,200
Yeah, it's because you don't deserve it.

911
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,080
You don't deserve the Reverend Ivan Stang and Jesus

912
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:50,420
and maybe even Dr. Legume to come and read your beads in person.

913
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,400
Oh, yes.

914
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:58,420
you couldn't handle it. I know because the last couple of divivals they had here, you sat out

915
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:06,040
there on your duffs. Yes, there was none of that feverish participation that makes a divival so

916
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:14,740
true and real and painful. Oh yeah, you just can't handle it, can you? You'd be standing by the wayside

917
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:20,740
while that golfer head was launched, and I bet no one would move to catch it, and it would hit the

918
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:27,880
floor. That's a kind of lazy, good-for-nothing bums you are, and I'm damn sick to my guts of it.

919
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:35,380
But against my better judgment, you might just have something to look forward to, and soon, like,

920
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:48,180
like maybe in, oh, May. Yeah, maybe, maybe May 10th. Maybe. But I don't know if you can handle it.

921
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,720
Maybe I ought to just keep this under control.

922
00:48:51,760 --> 00:49:01,100
Maybe. Oh, but no, I'm letting you in on it, but not totally. Maybe Reverend Rockenhand and Brother

923
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:09,280
Vox Mutantis will take pity on you next week and tell you more about it. Maybe. So the balls in

924
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:19,380
your court, seekers, prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong. And think, will you just stand there when

925
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,720
that golfer head comes zooming in on you? Maybe. Oh, but no, I'm letting you in on it, but not totally.

926
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:21,800
Maybe. Oh, but no, I'm letting you in on it, but not totally. Maybe. Oh, but no, I'm letting you in on it, but not totally.

927
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,180
Right at you. Think about it, and sweat!

928
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:43,400
Yes, Susie. Yes, Susie. Actually, I know exactly what she means, and she sent me a letter with this

929
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:50,000
tape saying, oh, man, maybe I won't be so depressed next time when I talk about the Atlanta show. Oh,

930
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,720
and I can tell you something. I'm not going to be so depressed next time when I talk about the Atlanta show.

931
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,800
I'm not going to be so depressed next time when I talk about the Atlanta show. I'm not going to be so depressed next time when I talk about the Atlanta show.

932
00:49:51,800 --> 00:50:06,160
Hold it. Yes, dear friends, it's May 10th at CRC. That's the letters. C-R-C. Bar and Eatery. And the numeral two.

933
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:19,860
Now, CRC is located on Marietta Street, one block south of Northside Drive. And that's it.

934
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,460
That's it.

935
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:33,300
See you at CRC in Atlanta. Now, of course, most of you listeners are not anywhere near Atlanta, but that's just too bad. See, now you're going to miss it, because you weren't Southerners.

936
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,540
That's a pretty good spit you cooked up there, Jesus. Thanks for that. That's a pretty good bowl of spit there.

937
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:47,160
Nothing like a good old hot bowl of spit to keep a preacher preaching. Thanks for the spit, Jesus.

938
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,620
On your way in, please pick up...

939
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,200
...salvation. Yes.

940
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,340
Excuse me, Lord, I'm a spirit.

941
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:59,240
If you can't trust Jesus, then who can you trust?

942
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:08,680
We're the only religion that guarantees eternal salvation or triple your money back.

943
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,820
I don't see the...

944
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,880
The dino ball?

945
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,060
No, it's John.

946
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,700
You can find out more about the subgenius...

947
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,320
Preach on Jesus, yes.

948
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,280
...subgenius.com.

949
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,600
Good old Jesus.

950
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,540
Jesus was...

951
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:31,340
He really did actually sort of save the day at the survival research lab show a couple of weeks ago in Austin.

952
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,200
And Sister Susie the floozy, certainly.

953
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:43,760
Oh, man, that collage of material, flying saucer taking you away material is just astounding.

954
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,300
Just absolutely...

955
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,180
Here, here.

956
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,800
Yeah, well.

957
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,220
Well, now what?

958
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:58,240
Actually, there's just so much stuff one doesn't even know where to...

959
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,060
Great.

960
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:08,640
And the cult leader, Doe, even jokes about how the earthly bodies of cult members don't matter.

961
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:18,340
In a sense, we're body snatchers because we came and incarnated into these human bodies and now we're leaving these human bodies behind.

962
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,620
I hope you don't take that.

963
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,720
It is a crude joke.

964
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,480
I mean, it is a joke, but I did not mean to be offensive about it.

965
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:31,060
We might not be a joke, but it's a joke.

966
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,740
You can believe it.

967
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,400
Soon your mom will have thousands of followers.

968
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,480
Soon your mom will have thousands of followers.

969
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,520
Soon your mom will have thousands of followers.

970
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,540
Soon your mom will have thousands of followers.

971
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:50,600
You think that you might just have a clue as to what's going on.

972
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,300
And the role you play within just what's going on.

973
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:58,980
Well, I'm afraid I have to break something to you, my dear friend.

974
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,520
Or friends, if you happen to be with more than one person.

975
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,440
You don't have a clue as to what's happening.

976
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,260
Do you know why?

977
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,500
Because probably right before you turned this on, you were talking about something meaningless.

978
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,420
Like, oh, I had a bad day at work.

979
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,740
Oh, I can't stand my supervisor.

980
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,460
She has it out for me.

981
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:20,580
Oh, I can't stand my supervisor. She has it out for me.

982
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,120
Oh, I can't stand my supervisor. She has it out for me.

983
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,780
All that I can tell you is all that meaningless.

984
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,080
Is exactly that, meaningless.

985
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,120
If I could share just one thing with you, my friend, that you may take with you,

986
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,320
it would be this.

987
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,080
Great minds discuss ideas.

988
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,720
Average minds discuss events.

989
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,900
Simple minds discuss people.

990
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:57,740
And that's all we ever seem to talk about is people, or other people, or the things that other people did to other people, all of which we don't know.

991
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:03,100
And we probably wouldn't know if it weren't for it coming through to us on a daily basis.

992
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,520
On the three-color phosphor image that we call the television set.

993
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:19,880
I'm not saying turn it off, I like it myself, but the whole point of this discussion, one way, but it's still a discussion if you open your mind and are ready to discuss the implications of what I'm saying after this.

994
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:24,720
After I'm finished, all that I can say is find something to do.

995
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,360
Find something that you enjoy that doesn't require other people and throw yourself into it.

996
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,900
I don't care whether you spray paint your neighbor's house.

997
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,160
I don't care whether you steal cars.

998
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:41,420
I don't care what you do, but as long as you do it, be sure to do it well and do it for yourself and nobody else.

999
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,920
Because if we all did that, everything would be okay.

1000
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1001
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,540
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1002
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,080
I sure do, because I have to go now.

1003
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,780
But I really enjoyed our time together.

1004
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,720
I hope you did.

1005
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,320
Have a wonderful day and make yourself yourself as often as you possibly can.

1006
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,320
Good night.

1007
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,820
Wow. Huh.

1008
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,660
Brothers, uh, Brothers for Bob.

1009
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,820
There. Also known as the Flyin' Ryan Brothers.

1010
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,500
I wasn't expecting that at all.

1011
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,540
That's from something called the Chaos Sampler.

1012
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,920
It's on a cassette now, but I'm supposed to be getting a CD of that pretty soon.

1013
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,120
Brothers for Bob.

1014
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:35,240
Jimmy Ryan's a guitar player with Dr. Bizarro, and I have played some of his more mainstream sounding music lately on the show.

1015
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,600
But I guess we have their weird experimental doctor stuff coming up.

1016
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:44,060
And those guys actually are really good musicians.

1017
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,400
So that should be loads of fun.

1018
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,420
I did not expect that little rant there.

1019
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,280
It got me to thinking.

1020
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:57,760
You know, that was a very, very subgenius-like rant that was on that tape.

1021
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:02,180
I don't know if that was Jimmy or Reverend Jimmy or his brother or who.

1022
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:12,060
But, uh, you know, some of us have a, what my wife calls it, worms in your brain.

1023
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,620
She gets them occasionally herself.

1024
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,360
But she'll, when I'm, you know, when I'm in the middle of a concert, I'll have worms in my brain.

1025
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,760
And she'll get in a real cranky mood.

1026
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,460
She'll say, oh, you've got worms in your brain.

1027
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:27,580
And it occurred to me just a minute ago that Lonesome Cowboy Dave also talks about the corruptigating worms in your brain.

1028
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,940
And it's similar, actually, to what I think of it more as not all of us are this way.

1029
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:38,960
It's only the, I think some, maybe it's the emergentile subgeniuses.

1030
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,900
The real, real crazy ones that just have to be doing something all the time.

1031
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:55,800
Um, uh, it's like there's a little crazy man in a cage inside your head.

1032
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,680
Did I talk about this last week?

1033
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:03,700
And he, he's rattling the bars and screaming at the top of his lungs.

1034
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,560
And he never stops screaming.

1035
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,500
And he never stops rattling the bars.

1036
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,120
And he never stops filing away at the bars.

1037
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,720
And he never sleeps.

1038
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,280
And he's always doing that all the time.

1039
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,260
And he's inside your head.

1040
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,340
Now, I don't know.

1041
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:27,020
Some people have told me that, uh, and I know that this is true, that in some cases antidepressants can actually give a person, a subgenius like this, slack.

1042
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,840
In that the conspiracy is what put that little horrible man in your head to begin with.

1043
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,400
And sometimes these pills, they don't kill him or anything.

1044
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,300
They just, you take this pill and you're fine.

1045
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:45,760
But the little man in your head just curls up and goes right to sleep.

1046
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,740
But I haven't done that yet.

1047
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,440
And neither has this guy.

1048
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,940
This tape coming up.

1049
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:58,840
Dr. Nolan Void, um, just out of, uh, sort of changed names or something.

1050
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,360
I don't know.

1051
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,640
This, the tape says Wolf Boy.

1052
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,380
Colonel Wolf Boy.

1053
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,560
And, uh, it's quite pertinent to the discussion at hand.

1054
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:10,960
Thank you.

1055
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,560
I have to speak to the suicide.

1056
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:15,740
I have to speak to the suicide.

1057
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:19,740
—Ladily depressed members of the Harding's tonight.

1058
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:28,280
And tell them there's a right way and a wrong way to end their lives.

1059
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:36,880
Sissy Pink Boy suicides can be recognized by a few simple guidelines.

1060
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,660
Pinks are compelled to kill themselves in private.

1061
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,240
Pinks want to die.

1062
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,660
but they don't want to feel any pain while they're doing it.

1063
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,680
They're embarrassed by their feelings,

1064
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,260
and unless they chicken out and tell someone about it,

1065
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:01,460
or leave some whiny, self-depreciating note,

1066
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,760
no one knows why.

1067
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,080
But who cares why?

1068
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,660
Just praise Bob that another pink's dead.

1069
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:18,060
Pink's never realized that suicide can be the ultimate form of self-expression,

1070
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:25,840
a suppressed and truly anarchic art form that will become the next great movement.

1071
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:33,720
Subgeniuses must know that the only way to accept death is to plan how you die.

1072
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:39,520
Rest fate away from Jehovah One and those book lords.

1073
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:44,060
You're self-serving medical doctors, and choose your demise.

1074
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:49,700
Choose whether or not you die in a hospital bed,

1075
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:54,820
with a tube up your nose, forgotten, in a little white room.

1076
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:59,360
Or go out with your boots on, with a bang.

1077
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,500
Bob will help you die with dignity.

1078
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,380
Strap on the high-explosive neck brace,

1079
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,540
walk into City Hall,

1080
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,640
and die.

1081
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,000
Launch your own head.

1082
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,700
So what's it gonna be, huh?

1083
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,100
Are you gonna be some wimp, little pink,

1084
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,640
and shoot yourself in the head, all alone?

1085
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,380
Why don't you shoot yourself in public?

1086
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,560
Oh, one death can't make a difference.

1087
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,200
I don't matter.

1088
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,620
Each person's death matters,

1089
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,840
if used constructively.

1090
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:37,940


1091
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:43,020
If you want to help smash the state,

1092
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:49,120
then throw yourself under the wheels of a subway train.

1093
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:55,780
Hundreds of thousands of people will be inconvenienced.

1094
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,840
You'll make the evening news.

1095
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:06,620
Hundreds of thousands of people will tell the tale of the day.

1096
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,920
You'll make the evening news. Hundreds of thousands of people will tell the tale of the day.

1097
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,700
You're trying to make good by bringing yourself back to the old,

1098
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:09,700


1099
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,160
Just think

1100
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,940
whether that few days don't matter.

1101
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,020
These are bad enough dinner's and breakfasts.

1102
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:14,100
Prest like Santa,

1103
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,900
and you must eat at least 15 pairs.

1104
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,760
And the engineering and theарistry

1105
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,180
no more.

1106
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:33,660
You gotta live like Santa with your valentine's.

1107
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,900
Want to die?

1108
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,120
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
