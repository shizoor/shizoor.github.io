Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the subgenius of OVSLUG.
I feel real good. And then other times, I feel like I was going to get sick right in my stomach.
Well, that doesn't take much doing.
Hello, Bob. I need someone to talk to.
Hello, Bob. It seems there's nothing I can do.
Hello, Bob.
I need someone to listen to me.
I'm hitting all the locked doors and I need some help.
And I was hoping you'd have the key.
Hello, Bob.
Have you been listening to my thoughts?
Hello, Bob.
And I'll tell you all the thoughts.
I've got.
Hello, Bob.
Hello, Bob.
I can't seem to find the truth.
I read the books.
I took the drugs.
And I drank a whole bottle of Verluce.
Yeah.
Hello, Bob.
I seem to have misplaced my slack.
Hello, Bob.
Well, I just can't seem to get it back.
Hello, Bob.
Can you point out what it is I lack?
I've climbed to highest heights, hit the lowest lows.
But now I'm on my back.
Hello, Bob.
Are you still here at home?



Are you in the world's greatest epiphany?
I can hear my heart rate racing in the background.
Even when I got nowhere to go?
Hey, what if I get a pen and ink on the wall?
Excuse me, may I have a
two glasses, please?
What is it?
Hello Bob
Am I coming through to you?
Hello Bob
I thought I already paid all my dues
Hello Bob
I know that you can see me through
But it's damp and dim and I can't swim
What am I supposed to do?
Well hello Bob
I'm feeling better now you've listened to me
Hello Bob
Well the sun's out now and I can see
Hello Bob
A great change has come over me
My eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear
And I'm as happy as I could be
Yes my eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear
And I'm as happy as I could be
Hello Bob
Dear Bob
Sometimes Bob
Bob
I get so scared
And I don't know why
I just don't know why
But
Sometimes there are things and they're after me, you know?
I mean, it's those kinds of things that, you know, how come hot dogs, you know,
the kind of hot dogs you get at the circus, you know, the kind of hot dogs, why are they so red?
And it's only at the circus that you get that, can get hot dogs of real red.
You know, there's a red kind of, it's more, more, more red.
And sometimes things live in walls, you know, and it gets scary.
Because, yeah, there are some things that are.
They're all better work.
It's a lot better.
Okay.
Is that okay?
That's okay.
I can't hear anything.
I can't.
You know, there's something wrong with this one over here.
Give me some of that noise.
Hey, I need some noise.
Is it working?
I'm number five.
I'm number five.
Yeah, we really need some noise.
I'm number five.
Hey, what'd you say?
I raised somebody.
I'll check.
What'd you say?
I'm down there.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Did you feel that big devil?
I didn't say nothing.
What'd you say?
Well, you said what?
Hi, officer.
Hey, what did you guys do over here?
No, I mean, we were on.
Get over there.
Get over there.
I saw what you put in your pocket.
Give me that.
Give me that.
Get over there.
Okay, get in there.
Get in there.
Get in there.
Get in there.
Get in there.
Get in there.
Get in there.
The battle for the mind.
Get in there.






how about your voice?
Are you going to allow them to out-shout you?
Are you going to allow them to be heard over and above your objections?
Boring.
Oh, too boring.
Boring.
Boring.
Boring.
Boring.
Boring.
Boring.

Wilson.
Warp 7.
Here's Wilson.
Here's Wilson.
She's a Wilson.
Your name's Wilson?
Yes.
Well, I'm glad it's not.
Farmer.
But the Holy Ghost is God's authorized detective agency.
The Holy Ghost is God's high sheriff that has come to restore and get back for you.
Pastor, and be my hero.
Those things that the devil has stolen.
I know, Pastor.
The origin.
The original God.
Don't turn it off.
I've got you.
Oh, I've got to have Pastor Eftley.
He's telling me about the God that has taken him from your heart.
The smile that he has stolen from your lips.
Where'd my lips go?
The dream that he's stolen from your eyes.
I can't feel my lips on my teeth.
They don't all feel the same.
He's come to restore these things.
Pastor Eftley.
Now, son, I want to ask you to be quiet for just a minute.
I don't know anything.
So we can hear Pastor Eftley.
Okay.
As far as I know, you haven't told him.
Have you told him I stabbed anything about yourself?
You haven't.
No.
Then if I know anything about you, it would be because the spirit of the Lord has led me to you today.
Am I right?
Uh-huh.
I've got something for you.
I want you to leave your seat and come here.
Okay.
Amen.
Amen.
My knowledge, I've never seen this lady before in my life.
I'm not saying that.
I hope she doesn't feel bad if she's come here two or three times.
I hope she doesn't think I've ignored her.
No, I've never been here before.
For a crowd like this, I can't remember everyone that comes to church.
Can you say?
Pastor Eftley, I read about you.
But the Lord told me that he sent you here today.
Pastor Eftley.
And Jesus is passing by for you.
Pastor Eftley.
I feel his presence.
Passing by for you.
I want you to take this envelope and hold it open.
I don't know.
This is Jesus.
I'm going to get back to you.
I want you to get back to me.
I'm going to get back to you.
I'm going to get back to you.



What a crime how they stole it away.
Oh, the devil wants to steal it from your friend.
But he's hard to keep that devil out of your back pocket.
A step less a thing.
What a shame how they stole it away.
Oh, it's a miracle, friend.
It's a miracle revival starting now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Perform the salute.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Perform the salute.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, here's how to do the salute.
Yeah.
See?
Ready?
The finger is on the neck.
Hands, left hand up.
Up and down.
Left hand up.
Left hand up.
Finger on throat.
Finger on throat.

Come on.
All right.

Perform the salute.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Excellent.
It's a miracle.
I think before we start the service,
we should have just a moment of noise.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!

Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!




Yes, I can feel it.
The spirit.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bullets can't stop them.
Oh, bullets can't stop them, friends.
No.
The mark of the beast?
Oh, you don't need to worry about it.
You've got your credit card.
It won't do you any good tomorrow, but it's okay.
Well, I guess now Bob's going to have to work through me, friends.
So, we're going to...
...snow mixed with freezing rain and rain.
We're going to...
...and we're going to...
...through the afternoon.
...on...
...we're going to...
...we're going to...
...go...
...to...
...no accumulation at mid-morning.


...no accumulation...
...it's all right.
... affair,
fun...
...is that the suffines...
of the foreign city someone dropped onto...
...ne contestants.
No.
...pointing itself so far
that no one got worthy.
Go...

We don't need to get in trouble, friends.
... interpreter...



Sometimes I've got these rats, and they're like inside my stomach,
and I haven't swallowed them.
I mean, they're like hot, hot, hot dogs, but they're eating their way out,
and they're coming out, and sometimes I just want to take these hot dogs
and just shove them, and just shove them away.
I'm taking these hot dogs, and I have to go.
But please, Bob, send me some more pills, Bob.
Please, Bob, send me.
Some more.
Send me some more of those pills, Bob.
God, Bob, Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Oh, oh, Lonesome Bob says,
you got to get some pills.
Oh, Lonesome Bob.
Just telling me.
Oh, yeah.
Just give him some more pills, and Bob will kill you.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, so long.
Be mine.
I'm upset.
But sometimes I just, I don't feel too good, you know?
I mean, I really don't feel real good.
And I don't know why.
But Reverend Booney says, my head is obsessed with the anti-bomb.
Oh.
Oh.






And I don't really know what he means.
And so that's why I'm talking to you directly, because he isn't of much help.
But Bob says, if you don't give me some money, you just.
Oh.

Won't ever get any slack.
And then, you don't get no slack, you can't get no money, no food, and no pills.
So what we have there really is two rituals going at once on the radio.
It's a miracle.
What can we say?
We're used to them by now, but it's definitely miracles, and we've got proof.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
It's a miracle.
Signs, signs in the heavens, signs in the earth.

And we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, or nobody for why.
Praise Bob, tell me Bob, I want to buy from Bob, I want to buy and ask the holy war fulfilled, the big boys and the gomels.
We can make them buy and we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men.
And we'll all come out over men, if we don't come out over men, there ain't no reason why.
All wives, gizms, they will fall beneath our laser blades, and we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men, in victory for us.
Praise God.
Praise God.
Praise God.
Praise God.
Praise God.
Praise God.
Praise God.

Praise God.
Praise God.
Praise God.
And I don't care, I don't care if people laugh at me.
I did, Bob.
He ain't no man.
He ain't no God.
I don't want to walk the path that Bob's trod.
Ain't no man, ain't no God.
I don't want to walk the path Bob's trod.
Okay, let's do it right this time.
And people ask me, where do you get this energy, this life I see glowing in you, Jander?
And I just point it up.
And I don't even have to say it.
I won't even say the word Bob when I said it.
But I just point at the sky.
Because it's not me that's doing it.
And you know and I know who it is.
It's Bob.
Now we take you into a great Holy Ghost revival that is now in progress.
Bill, you want to say something to the clinch?
To the Dallas clinch?
It's too pink and they refuse to comment.
If they're so hip, what are they doing in Dallas?
We can put on the Bob tune tape and sing along.

He'll get a couple more.
If both stuff buttons gone wrong we'll be fine.

That's what it is.
It's the fucking volts noises.
What's that?


effect on the sensitive youth who became, thanks to the pharmacy's wares, a chronic
alcoholic at age six. It didn't affect his precocious salesmanship, however. And he made
his first small fortune selling stolen prophylactics and other things to high school boys.

I'm driving a car,
Bob sold me.
You're so damn married.
Mac?
What do you mean, ha, ha, ha?
Take that pipe out of your mouth.
What are you grinning about, buddy?
Where'd you get that haircut?
Are those dots on your face, or have you got some kind of disease?
You look like Ward.
You look like Ward Cleaver.
I'm leaving.
You look like Mark Trails.
What's the deal, buddy?
You look like Mr. Appleton.
You look like Big Van Dyke with a pivoted mouth.
What?
What'd you say?
Did you say, yeah, sure.
Sure, I'll buy that used car.
I'll buy that used car from you, mister.
Sure, anything.
How much do you want?


How much is it?
It's only a dollar?
That used car is only a dollar?
Wow.
Wow, you got any other good deals, mister?
You got something else that'll only cost a dollar?
A little booklet?
I don't know, that doesn't look like it's worth a dollar to me.
Oh.
Oh.
It does have a lot of print inside.
And some neat pictures.
Sure, I'll give you a dollar, mister.
Here.
Whoa.
Whoa.
I feel weird.
I feel, I feel really weird.
But I feel kind of, I feel, I feel kind of good.
I like this.
This little book.
Hey, where'd you go, buddy?
Hey, where'd, where'd he go?
Where'd the guy with the pipe go?
Hey, I gotta talk to him.
Hey, what happened?
Hey, buddy, where'd, he took off with my two dollars.
And he left me this little book and this car.
Hey, buddy, where'd you go?
I'll get in this car.
I'll start it up.
He left the keys in for me.
Okay, here goes.
I'm driving the car that Bob sold me.
Boy, I can go pretty fast.
Hey.
Hey, that Bob guy's okay.
He made me forget about, he made me forget about Odin for a minute.
That's really weird.
Boy, this car is smooth.
I like the way this feels on the road.
I like the way it feels.
It feels good.
It's throbbing.
It's throbbing.
Hey, it's leaving the road.
It's going up in the air.
Where's it going?
Hey.
Hey, it's, there's a cloud up in front of me.
A big cloud.
It's got a sign on it.
A big sign.
It says, it says, welcome, welcome to Odin's place.
It says, this is Nirvana.
Wow, Bob.
Thanks.
I can't wait to meet Odin.
Really.
Hey, Mom.
Yeah.
I love it when you're together.
You know that, Bob like, Zhao?

Well I never found Bob that day, they said he just had gone away
He was out to lunch or off to get shoes or gone buying groceries for people to blues
I must not have been in need of slack cause I never really managed to make it back
But I sent my dollar to those people in town, and I still keep getting them pamphlets sent around
And I feel a little closer and a little more in touch
And I know it's helped me a whole lot of much
But I sure do wish I'd been managing to hang out in the right place to actually catch a look at that

I was walkin' over Houston
You could change the name if you want to,
but he sang the song he changed it into a little town.
Just to see what I could see
And the angel, the angel
He was walkin' over me
He was walkin' over Houston
He was walkin' in the air
He was walkin' in the air
And I saw my friend was with him
Hallelujah, Bob was there
He was walkin' in subgenius
He keeps me high until the end
For as long as I am subgenius,

I know Bob is my friend
Now I know
Where'er we travel
In travail, Travolta view
Though the Fonz should walk beside us
We know Bob is my friend.
He's with us too
Keep on walkin' with subgenius
Ridin' high before the end
If I always buy subgenius,
I know Bob will be my friend.
And now this third verse ain't necessary,
but if, I know Bob said we should always be ready to sell out,
and if you wanted to play this on a tape or something,
you could stick an ad on me and like this.
Here we go.
Send your doll over to subgenius
So that Bob can love you too
Via Box 1403-06

And 5214
Keep on walkin' on subgenius
I know he knows
And I've been too.
If you're runnin' in subgenius
Bob is runnin' with you too
I didn't have to turn him to the two there in the last, but,
but I just round it that way so as a casual I would have a heart attack if he ever hears it.
And I probably shouldn't have even heard a word of it

Yes, Bob?
Why would yourespond it with the profits to ed,


You are right,ownik.

I know this is real.
I was Ðuayn-Ð´Ðµ-rane.
This was aå¾ buy if you ever heard a lot about him.
You better watch out.
You better watch out.

Don't follow the wrong one, no
