1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Oh, that was a laid-back show.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,100
Oh, it's not laid-back anymore!

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,420
Look out!

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,380
Whoa!

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,540
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,760
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,600
which reaches from the inner mind to...

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,700

sponsored by the Church of the Soap Genius.

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,480
The Soap Genius Hour of Sight,

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,980
that gives you the opportunity to experience

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,220
what you are about to listen to,

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,240
is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,360
K-N-O-N.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,860
And only in the city of...

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,440
Dallas, Texas.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,700
K-N-O-N.

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,000
Welcome, dear friends,

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,360
Welcome, dear friends,

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,060
to the Soap Genius Hour of Sight.

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,200
Back up to the grassy knoll again,

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,700
and started hitting back down.

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,220
I left that group of wacky Zenos in the gazebo

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,620
and the Sodbusters Museum

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,780
and that wing-ding nut flanger on the accordion.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,760
Well, I just didn't know what to think, you know.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,720
Coming up here, hanging around with the grass and the trees,

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,660
it's just natural,

32
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,540
but these people were talking different,

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,580
and I don't know.

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm just interested in sitting around

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,700
and picking my nose and spitting and stuff like that,

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,040
and, well, it just made me think an awful lot.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,180
Golly, my head got big,

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,920
and, well, I never knew I had so many ideas.

39
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,700
I began to think about writing them down

40
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,920
or taking some pictures

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,640
or getting a tape recorder or something in them things,

42
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,560
but, well, I know I didn't want to mess with them.

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,840
I just wanted to be natural, you know,

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,560
sitting out here with the old rocks

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,280
and watching the clouds roll by.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,060
But that, that old stranger with the accordion,

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,960
why, he made me feel a little different.

48
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,500
I...

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,680
I kind of...

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:58,680


51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,720
I kind of got excited,

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,320
and, well, I liked it a little bit.

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,080
It never happened like that before.

54
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,360
Suddenly, I began to reflect on my whole life,

55
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,800
why it was like a rock or...

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,620
or a polka.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,060
No, my life wasn't like a polka,

58
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,940
but here it was again,

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,380
and, God Almighty,

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,040
hiya, mister!

61
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,260
How are you, old fella?

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,420
How are you, old fella?

63
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,460
How are you, old fella?

64
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,320
How are you, old fella?

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,940
How are you, old fella?

66
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,620
How are you, old fella?

67
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:33,620


68
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,420
Uh, the only cult they want to talk about

69
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,820
is the subgenius foundation,

70
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,760
the church of the subgenius.

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,380
Yeah, Doug Smith says we're different.

72
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,080
Doug's right, Virgil.

73
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,160
We are different, thanks to Jesus,

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,740
the genetic engineering corporation of American states.

75
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,780
Mommy, too?

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,500
Yep, the whole family.

77
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,340
Is everybody like us?

78
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,400
No sun.

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,720
But we're working on it.

80
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,900
Round the clock!

¶¶

101
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:08,280
It moved up, took off at fantastic speed at the at least 45 degrees angle and

102
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,960
they just disappeared between the stars. During the debriefing which we always

103
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:22,300
said after each combat mission, the officer who was receiving this made a

104
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:29,300
joke of it how many beer I had. How many beer he had, dear friends.

105
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:42,240
Ah, yes. Quiet down you little creatures of the night. Got a show to do. Oh, dear friends,

106
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,060
this is Reverend Ivan Stang. You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry

107
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,760
Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

108
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,280
Ah, hey, Zayfie.

109
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,700
Hey, Fod. Our theory about Reverend Ann Leonard was just shot to hell the other night.

110
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,140
Friends, I feel sorry for those of you who couldn't make it to the subgenius meeting

111
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:12,460
and for the people who didn't dare to come and see the reflection of themselves.

112
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,320
But it was very interesting the way that turned out. You know, we announced last week that there

113
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,260
was going to be a meeting for people who wanted to volunteer for the subgenius.

114
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,860
It sounded like there was going to be so many volunteers at the subgenius meeting.

115
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,700
Our goal for the subgenius meeting is to get about 30 people to volunteer to help with Knon

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,880
and the church of the subgenus, specifically. And we got like 30 people called, Reverend

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,640
Cecilia, and asked directions and said they were going to come and so forth. But only

118
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:42,420
half showed up. And the mighty Reverend Cecilia, who now, dear friends, is Popess, the pope

119
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:51,300
or popestress of Dallas, Popess Cecilia bowed down to her, ye unworthy unclean ones. For,

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,260
for she is the new Pope.

121
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


122
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


123
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


124
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


125
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


126
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


127
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


128
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


129
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


130
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


131
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


132
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


133
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


134
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


135
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


136
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


137
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,260


138
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,620
is truly worthy. She allowed us to have this meeting at her house, a meeting of subgeniuses

139
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,500
who had never, in many cases, had never laid eyes on another admitted, quote, subgenius,

140
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,960
unquote, before in their lives. But it turned out quite interesting. There was no real bobbies.

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,980
It was real nice. It was all folks that I think could give us a real hand, and I haven't

142
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:21,020
managed to sit down and plot it all out on the big computer yet. But, oh yes, we'll have

143
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,940
places for you all in Dobbs Town, dear friends. Don't worry about that. All of ye chosen who

144
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,260
showed up. It was just, the meeting was just what you'd expect. It was at a seedy S&M bar

145
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:40,960
in Oak Cliff full of demon worshippers. And, see, you missed out on it. Missed out on it.

146
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:48,340
Oh, and there was one young subgenius there who gave me a wonderful Christmas present,

147
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,940
a sign, professionally made sign.

148
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,840
It said, Bulldada Time Control Laboratories is subsidiary of the Church of the Subgenius,

149
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,020
the Subgenius Foundation, Incorporated. And that was wonderful. But, you know, when I

150
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,920
put that sign up, they'll know where the subgenius castle is on Swiss Avenue. That guy, now,

151
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,620
see, that guy, he was obviously CIA. You can't fool Reverend Stang. That was CIA. But he

152
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,220
was also a subgenius, so it's okay if the CIA knows where we are. But there's many of

153
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,000
you out there who are going to be able to see that. And, you know, I'm going to have

154
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,660
a bunch of new friends, who, who are thinking, what's he doing in the jungle? I thought this

155
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,240
was a church. And on top of that, how come, how come he's talking about this church of

156
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:37,320
the subgenius? What is that? They say, what are you? What are you? They chant, wanting

157
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:45,700
to know just what it is we're talking about. And every 10 or 12 shows, I play this lovely

158
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,740
tape.

159
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,700
Two and one.

160
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,880
Now to continue with the tape recording.

161
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,440
Superior mutants, repent!

162
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,100
Quit your job!

163
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,520
Slack off!

164
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,660
The world ends tomorrow and you may die!

165
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,940
Well, no, probably not, but whatever you do, just keep listening.

166
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,660
Are we controlled by secret forces?

167
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,160
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

168
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,560
Do people think you're strange?

169
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,160
Do you?

170
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,900
Then you may be on the right track.

171
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,720
Are you abnormal?

172
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,800
Then you are probably better than most people.

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,980
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

174
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,620
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

175
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,420
This is it, the only faith that promises

176
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,640
absolute freedom.

177
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,640
Thrill, success in sex and business.

178
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,360
Having all the guilt, but none of the sex.

179
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,860
Having intercourse with a beautiful live girl,

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,140
or damn near anything else.

181
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,700
But you tried everything.

182
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,780
You ain't seen nothing yet.

183
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,600
Learn to think big.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Develop the tricks of length extension.

185
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,640
Bring your weirdest dreams to life.

186
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,880
Stand up and start rampaging life.

187
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,100
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

188
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,760
Bob is a way of life to millions.

189
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,200
Yet half of them don't even know.

190
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,260
He's the one true living Slack master

191
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,320
with the spiritual know-how to help you

192
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,640
bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

193
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,620
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

194
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,340
Slack Master.

195
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,920
Now.

196
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,520
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

197
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,160
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

198
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,060
Become physically attractive overnight.

199
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,780
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

200
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,680
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature

201
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,220
of abnormal behavior to explore new ways

202
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,540
of going over the edge.

203
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,260
And coming right back.

204
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,680
And to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

205
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,980
To help you create the highest possible earnings

206
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,080
from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

207
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,100
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

208
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,620
And channel them into an illusion of creativity

209
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,580
that will fool normals and get you sex.

210
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,720
I don't believe you, J-Hart.

211
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,640
Well?

212
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,240
I did benefit from it, of course.

213
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,420
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

214
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,300
In other words, you want to know,

215
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,060
you want the government to know that you're in

216
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,120
to make money and to pay taxes.

217
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,820
Well, we're already treading a pretty thin line, Bill.

218
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,220
And I'm sure there's plenty of other things

219
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,580
they'd love to get us for.

220
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,860
Just be, you know, well, I don't know whether we want to talk

221
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,020
about the conspiracy on the air, but...

222
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,880
Oh yeah, go right ahead.

223
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,620
This is the conspiracy, the one, the conspiracy behind it.

224
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,900
The conspiracy.

225
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,500
Ah, the conspiracy to end all conspiracies, maybe.

226
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,720
Well, part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,280
that our lives are being controlled by forces

228
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,240
that most people are completely ignorant of.

229
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,360
Well, okay, this light, as we were looking at it,

230
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,180
both of us watching the light, and with that, anything,

231
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,420
just in, you know, in a split second, it was suddenly,

232
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,620
it's two stories, I'd say, the diameter, or range,

233
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,260
the height of this room.

234
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,440
Wow. You mean it was like a little bobbing?

235
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, it wasn't bobbing as steady as this table,

236
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,380
if it were carried on a caterpillar, it was that steady.

237
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,220
And walking speed.

238
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,520
And with that, the speed never changed.

239
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,520
It just suddenly got that...

240
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,580
It just suddenly was huge.

241
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:07,900
Yeah.

242
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,860
It gets really complex when you get into conspiracies,

243
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,120
and we believe...

244
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,120
We're still there.

245
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,520
Because of the experience that they were going through.

246
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,100
Ah, yes, dear friends.

247
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:38,280
Have you two not gotten enough slack on the ropes of life?

248
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,440
This is Dr. Philodrumon speaking to you from on the road,

249
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,780
way out there.

250
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,780
Somewhere where you nor your friends can even perceive.

251
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,080
Ha ha!

252
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,180
Yes, dear friends.

253
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,480
We're out here, you're out there,

254
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,400
and we're thinking about you out there.

255
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,340
And about all the wonderful things that can be found

256
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,960
when you find Bob.

257
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,400
I'm talking to you tonight about the Holy God,

258
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,940
the one and only Bob,

259
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,840
the church of the sub-genius.

260
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,320
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

261
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,580
Can I get a witness?

262
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,900
Praise Bob!

263
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,440
Can I get an amen?

264
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,580
Thank you, children, thank you!

265
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,120
Some of you may not be familiar with the church of the sub-genius.

266
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,000
Some of you may not know the origins of the church of the sub-genius.

267
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,640
Some of you may not know the pèreetre, the divine!

268
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,280
The purpose of the church is to have what?

269
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,160
Slack!

270
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,780
Can I hear that again?

271
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,300
I need more slack!

272
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,740
Can I get some slack?

273
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,080
Can I get some slack?

274
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,800
World Without Slack

275
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,600
Chapter 3

276
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,120
By Lies

277
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,880
The fighting Jesus looked out over the bridge of the Exist battle saucer,

278
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,660
Blood of Christ.

279
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,640
He looked and laughed.

280
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,660
He laughed and looked.

281
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,660
He looked and looked.

282
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,860
He laughed and laughed.

283
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,820
He was finally going to have his revenge on the natives of Dust Moat 89 AB.

284
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,500
Aboard Jesus' flagship, dozens of killer theologians, the shock priests,

285
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,160
were busy at their weapons terminals.

286
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,960
On the power decks, the proper orgone cycles were being timed by mass fornications

287
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,180
between the ritual crew.

288
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,040
And the cancer beings from Theta Z.

289
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:04,560
An invasion-ready state existed in the ship and the 900 others floating over the doomed planet, Earth.

290
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,960
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.

291
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,720
His face resembled many of the perverse icons the humanoids of the Dust Moat painted of him.

292
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,160
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls.

293
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,420
As if they had any souls to save.

294
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,360
As if anyone would want to save them, which they didn't.

295
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,740
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder.

296
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,320
They had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.

297
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,080
And they thought he loved them for it, that he was forgiving.

298
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,220
Oh, the anticipation.

299
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,780
He was sick to his stomach with glee.

300
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,120
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

301
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,880
It had taken him 2,000 long years to return here.

302
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,220
And now he would pay them back for the scars he still carried in his hands.

303
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,140
Sweet stigmata.

304
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,500
Even the slightest thought of the scars made them glow red through his fists.

305
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,360
Through the boxing gloves.

306
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:12,240
The hold of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light personally lent by Jehovah One.

307
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,220
They supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction spectrums.

308
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,180
All in attack mode.

309
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,900
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons.

310
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,280
The dark bodies.

311
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,160
And at time and a half, too.

312
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

313
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,660
No matter.

314
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,680
The host of judgment.

315
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,260
That which comes had finally arrived.

316
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,020
And on Jesus' birthday.

317
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,420
What do you think, Dad?

318
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,120
His second in command, Jim Jones, stood by with the final attack coordinate, Kodos.

319
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,660
A holographic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.

320
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,140
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses were lit up in green.

321
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,740
Ones, some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet.

322
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,160
All in scale.

323
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,180
Quite pretty, actually.

324
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,040
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.

325
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
It would soon enough be dark.

326
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,820
These children wait for us below, Jesus.

327
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,680
We will walk among them and we will smile.

328
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,240
At your moment of choice, of course.

329
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:35,120
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face in the pink glow of the neuron banks that ran around the walls of the mighty dreadnought and shuddered.

330
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,860
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead, but whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up.

331
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,560
Something was missing.

332
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,700
Something else was added.

333
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,800
Something.

334
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,480
Jones had been forced on him by the Djinn bankers.

335
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,140
Who had financed this angelic war fleet.

336
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Damn them.

337
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,160
He never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet.

338
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,740
Jones' constant reminders of their influence and expectations irritated Jesus no end.

339
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,680
Not to mention the annoying habit Jones had copied from Dobbs.

340
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,380
The twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe, even here near the sensitive nerve relays.

341
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,700
Jones might have been left dead a little too long.

342
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,460
Moved.

343
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,080
Moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat.

344
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:31,420
He never removed his sunglasses and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines even though they no longer had any effect on his regenerated shell.

345
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,960
You know Jimbo, said Jesus.

346
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,340
The best part is that they think there's an afterlife.

347
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,740
That's why they strung me up the first time.

348
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,240
They think like bugs down there.

349
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,240
I'm well aware of that, Commander.

350
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,460
It bothered Jones to be back on Earth so soon.

351
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,140
After his failure with the social programming research post he had been running there.

352
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,840
It wasn't really his fault.

353
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,120
The administration change at Central merely cut off the funding for it.

354
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,040
He was forced to abort the experiment.

355
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,460
And put him in a...

356
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:04,600
...

357
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,740
There is a great deal of speculation about what is going to happen next.

358
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,480
The tape is ready now.

359
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,160
The lights have gone down just slightly.

360
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,100
Theıp

361
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,640
Outside the realm of conspiracy science and in the clear light of the so-called forbidden sciences,

362
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,300
we will find we have a far greater chance of understanding the true nature of the universe.

363
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,880
What the conspiracy feeds us under the guise of the most advanced system of natural philosophy

364
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:06,080
is nothing but a complex sham, a decoy to hide from us the true fact of how much bigger and more complex

365
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,720
and nut-wrenchingly frightening a place the universe really is.

366
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:17,960
We are told about matter and energy and space and time as being either consistent realities governed by laws

367
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,220
or as foggy abstracts that have no particular being outside of that of being convenient linguistic aids

368
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,240
to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

369
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,720
We at the Temporal Management Research Facility of the Church of Mr. Science of the Subgenius

370
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,780
have through rigorous probing through mountains of existing and full-known works on the subject of time

371
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,700
and its methods of function,

372
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,380
and through much control,

373
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,660
have discovered the key for blowing the whistle on the whole fraudulent twaddle that is modern science.

374
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,580
This key is the Mutron.

375
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,760
The truth must now be told.

376
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,620
How it was covered up for so long would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book,

377
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
but it's too involved to be told here.

378
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,360
The actual issue at hand is the Mutron and its pivotal role in the management of the true cosmos.

379
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,740
In order to properly understand the following,

380
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,700
it must first be made clear what actually is the Mutron,

381
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,580
and what actually constitutes an elementary particle.

382
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,040
The first of these basic particles is the electron,

383
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,160
which has no mass but possesses a charge that is commonly described as possibly infinite,

384
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,820
thus making it the fundamental unit of energy.

385
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,980
It and other related particles, i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc.,

386
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,180
acting in concert make up the Iacotismic field,

387
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,380
which is responsible for holding everything that is anything together.

388
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,700
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle,

389
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,540
commonly called a black hole.

390
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,360
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space,

391
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,600
but the influence of a single particle can be felt at a much greater distance.

392
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,920
They often have event horizons many miles wide,

393
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,280
beyond which not even light can escape.

394
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,780
The third fundamental particle is the Mutron.

395
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,700
The Mutron carries with it an infinite temporal capacity

396
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,960
that makes it alter the rate and intensity and general quality

397
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,680
of the passage through time,

398
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
of anything it touches.

399
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,920
The Mutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe.

400
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,520
As far as we know, there might well be only one of them,

401
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,480
though there could be as many as a few dozen

402
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,860
without generating a dangerous concentration of Mutron phenomena.

403
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,660
The first segment of this report will deal with the general implications of the Mutron

404
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,800
in regards to existing ideas on the workings of the universe.

405
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,400
The second will concern the incredible potentialities

406
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,660
of using the potent forces of the Mutron in time control research.

407
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,780
and in practical time control.

408
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,780
Section A

409
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,780
Just how fucking big everything really is.

410
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,540
What we know as the universe can be envisioned as a giant atom

411
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,640
with the black hole acting as the nucleus

412
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,040
and the Mutron or Mutrons acting as the electron cloud,

413
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,880
with the electrons providing the energy for the Mutron to drive us forward through time.

414
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,880
Just about everything else in the universe is just so much debris,

415
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,600
cluttering up the works of things.

416
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,360
The fact that there is one such atom more than suggests the existence of others.

417
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,180
The Mutron has a corresponding antiparticle known as the tachyon,

418
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,980
which travels through time in a direction which we perceive as backwards,

419
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,420
so that to someone who is not in the know it will appear to exceed the speed of light.

420
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,440
The simple fact of the matter is that tachyons are extra universal mutrons

421
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,340
impinging on our universe at a different temporal angle.

422
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,260
These are the Mutrons of atom universes that ours is in compound with.

423
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,040
After this the atomic metaphor breaks down.

424
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,080
I'm gonna...

425
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,860
No atom...

426
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,580
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

427
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,580
Dobbs sees the world entering a new aeon.

428
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,080
Which?

429
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,360
In a few years will bring more wondrous and miraculous change

430
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,340
and carnage, insanity and destruction than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

431
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,040
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

432
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,840
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power

433
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,140
to those in the know while billions of deserving conspiracy dupes

434
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,820
fry in hell on earth.

435
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,540
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob,

436
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,140
will usher in a spiritual rebirth and a cascade of astounding mysteries,

437
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,120
supernatural riches and a restoration of lost psychic abilities

438
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:58,840
that will totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

439
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,520
That's right, you're lucky to live in the end time.

440
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,140
Here's my money Bob!

441
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,420
Wise up!

442
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,220
That's right dear friends, wise up.

443
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,400
And uh, I must apologize there for the choice of language used at one point

444
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,880
by uh, the Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger there with the church of Mr. Science.

445
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,040
I'm sorry, he cut in

446
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,640
on our normal broadcasting spectrum wavelength here and uh, inserted that into our show

447
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,580
that it was not an official part of the Subgenius show.

448
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,480
You did not hear uh, that.

449
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,820
Uh, it does not exist uh, technically as part of the tapes that I chose to play.

450
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,740
Um, I just want you to know that dear friends, that's uh, that's pretty important around here.

451
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,520
And uh, I'll probably get in...

452
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,540
loads of...

453
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,240
serious trouble.

454
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,140
Uh...

455
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,160
What a...

456
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,800
Whoa!

457
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,540
Thanks to Saint Byron Werner for that incredible piece of music.

458
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:23,260
Yeah, and thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy for recording the uh, the barrage that we were hearing for a...

459
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,940
a lot of the stuff that we've heard tonight actually.

460
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,300
Yeah!

461
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,300
Uh, I'll get you!

462
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,680
The different are being silenced by a global conspiracy.

463
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,520
Weird men arise!

464
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,580
Find out who they are and how to smash them!

465
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,160
You probably already knew that the US government is a sham.

466
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,800
Something popped up there for you to blame.

467
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,040
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

468
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,400
That they are actually shambling?

469
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,000
Unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable...

470
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,320
Sings?

471
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,460
Yes!

472
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,360
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!

473
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,660
Defy the sinister star forces which mock us all.

474
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,080
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

475
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,040
God has been misquoted all this time!

476
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:31,900
His actual words may disturb you, but Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the...

477
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,620
unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind.

478
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,380
Smell proud with Bob.

479
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,420
I don't know who he's with or what the deal is.

480
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,400
But I know that if I stay close to Bob...

481
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
I'll be safe in those Gleaguers in Arkansas.

482
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,740
I know those creatures can't get a hold of me if I just...

483
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,880
hang around the foundation and do what they say.

484
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,600
And, you know, clean up after them a little bit.

485
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,260
I don't mind doing that kind of work if it's for a good cause.

486
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,920
I know that Bob...

487
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,620
I know that Bob is a good cause.

488
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,340
Bob took me inside his heart.

489
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,300
And I accepted him into my life.

490
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,220
And I'm here to testify, friends...

491
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,440
what that man has done for me.

492
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,580
If you can really call him a man.

493
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,460
Many people say he's almost like a god.

494
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,580
I don't think so.

495
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,620
Of course, I don't know Bob, but...

496
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,280
I do know Bob in certain ways.

497
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,920
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.

498
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,240
Yes, Bob...

499
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,500
He filled me with a sort of a spirit I never knew I had.

500
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,080
I knew it wasn't coming from him.

501
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
It was coming from inside me.

502
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,960
Bob was giving it to me.

503
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,520
He was laying hands on me from afar.

504
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,840
He might have been up in that great big jet plane...

505
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,340
or he might have been down on Skid Row...

506
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,980
giving some bum a haircut.

507
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,240
But all I know is...

508
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,920
it was Bob.

509
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,360
It was Bob.

510
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,920
Bob.

511
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,760
Yeah, he's smiling.

512
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,060
You never see Bob frown.

513
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,060
You know that behind that amazing smile...

514
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,820
there lies a mind like a steel trap.

515
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,760
And sure, he makes mistakes like...

516
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,980
what he did with those young women that time.

517
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,080
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

518
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,680
Bob.

519
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,520
Yeah, he's smiling.

520
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,820
You never see Bob frown.

521
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,840
You know that behind that amazing smile...

522
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,640
there lies a mind like a steel trap.

523
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,280
And sure, he makes mistakes like...

524
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,820
what he did with those young women that time.

525
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,940
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

526
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,960
I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run.

527
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:27,580
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.

528
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:27,800
And I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run.

529
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:27,800


530
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,400
And I know that we really need Bob in our lives.

531
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:29,500
In our lives.

532
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
In 1981.

533
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,440
And in 1984.

534
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,460
Hi little brother.

535
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,880
And in 1991.

536
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,880
And in 1995.

537
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,420
When they bring...

538
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,400
the conspiracy to its heels.

539
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,100
And in...

540
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,260
that wondrous year...

541
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,040
that we know is gonna come...

542
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,340
all too soon upon us.

543
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,460
And we'll leave our earthly things behind

544
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,580
and we'll go and join the exes

545
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,800
from God only knows what strange planet

546
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,920
they come from,

547
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,280
if they really even come from a planet at all,

548
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,520
not some energy star

549
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,720
beaming away in the darkness

550
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,800
lighting our lives with the technology

551
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,340
and the spirituality

552
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,600
and the mentality of planet X

553
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,720
planet X coming down

554
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,120
to take care of us subgeniuses

555
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,860
and see that there's a place for us in the world

556
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,720
and give us our rightful seat

557
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,160
at the right hand of Bob

558
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,420
or the left hand of Bob

559
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,660
depending on whether we're rewardians

560
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,620
or mediocrities

561
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,380
but I don't want to get lost in the dogma

562
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,200
I want to tell you something

563
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,500
that blesses my heart

564
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,420
and it's Bob

565
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,440
Bob

566
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,000
Bob

567
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,820
Yeah, I can hear him

568
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,500
I can hear him talking off there

569
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,460
in the distance saying

570
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,440
come to me Tommy

571
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,920
come to me

572
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,300
and lay down your material things

573
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,440
because you know they aren't going to mean much to you

574
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,020
after that divine year

575
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,500
and after I lay my hand on you

576
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,340
and lead you up the steps of that magnificent craft

577
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,340
and we'll board it

578
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,260
and go to the stars

579
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,540
that's right Tommy

580
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,260
we'll go to the stars

581
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,060
you and me

582
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,440
that's what Bob said

583
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,660
Bob said that

584
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,820
to me

585
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,560
Tommy

586
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,180
tighten these cranial sutures down

587
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,120
I don't think we can

588
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,160
see the patient suffered from a

589
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,860
subdural hematoma

590
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,480
which had suffused the

591
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,080
dura and pia matter of the brain

592
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,020
you see now this is in a dark

593
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,480
dark state of mind

594
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,180
and this discolored elongate mass

595
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,000
which uh

596
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,180
uh oh

597
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,140
had crumpling

598
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,660
send those body parts in from Oklahoma soon

599
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,620
running out of fingers

600
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,060
yes well we tried to mail them

601
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,240
but the mail was disgruntled that day

602
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:09,980
grunt

603
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:10,880
one

604
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,280
yes uh

605
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,560
it's strange

606
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,960
this is what the Indians can do to a guy

607
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,400
the Indians did this to puzzling evidence

608
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,280
because he violated their sacred burial space

609
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,220
it was thus

610
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,900
reawakened to the

611
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,660
you know it's terrible what they do when they

612
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,720
look at this this

613
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,880
this is the body of someone who's been out in the hot sun and

614
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,740
well from these uh

615
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,440
from this evidence you can imagine what's been done

616
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,760
it's certainly not a pretty sight now

617
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,380
now we're gonna open

618
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,160
here we go

619
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,300
well let's

620
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,240
household

621
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
yes all right and look at the surface

622
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,380
splattered me in the face there

623
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,000
ah what a joker

624
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,860
no harm done

625
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,500
now we're going to uh

626
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,880
break the vinyl rib at the at the top

627
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,520
ah geez

628
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,940
ah he seemed to be

629
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,060
he registered that a little bit maybe he felt it

630
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,800
uh nurse can we have the uh

631
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,680
can we ask someone please

632
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,920
try to help us restore the breathing of this patient

633
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,160
suction please

634
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,840
ah thank you

635
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,480
now uh

636
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,060
all right now

637
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,940
let's remove the the book

638
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:52,940
notice that this passage appears to be blocked with some sort of mucilaginous roughage

639
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,600
we call it the roughage of knowledge here on the show

640
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,720
now notice

641
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,200
oh that sucking chest wound

642
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,100
oh

643
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,720
oh the pnumos

644
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,480
this is a repugnant sight but

645
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,160
one which those versed in medical knowledge are often familiar with

646
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,680
now i'm going to peel back the thin fatty layer beneath the adipose tissue

647
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,920
which connects to the adipose tissue

648
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:22,920


649
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,580
the mesentery

650
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,400
oh you're going too far

651
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,300
supporting these organs

652
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,780
ah notice what is revealed before us

653
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,160
you have a alien in a

654
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,200
yeah get that little alien out of there

655
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
can't see what i'm doing

656
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,300
look it's just an infant

657
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,600
baby go away

658
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,740
stinky monster

659
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,960
look what he did inside wellman's thorax

660
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,360
well let's uh penetrate a little further

661
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,900
uh operations over i'm sorry next patient please

662
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,280

can and can't do

664
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:08,540
now let's uh go through the diaphragm here which is no longer a spongy tissue but rather a hard uh and rigid surface after the inception of rigor mortis

665
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,520
there we are

666
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,020
jelly on his diaphragm

667
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,740
this is uh spermacidal ham jelly here

668
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,660
it coats the exterior

669
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,080
activity to the suggestible

670
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,780
effective

671
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:21,940
uh

672
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,660
oh watch out for those loose connections boy that can kill you

673
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,480
into the

674
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,340
now what we need to do is uh saw through the um

675
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,240
the

676
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,380
uh

677
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,060
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

679
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,580
you clumsy fool you could have killed me

680
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,700
this is no joke this is a serious scientific experiment

681
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:51,980
friends

682
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,540
friends

683
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,000
our

684
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,760
it's right this is no joke

685
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,580
although we we had a

686
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,600
listen to the swinging love corpses there in the background friends

687
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,220
wow

688
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,460
this is a new swing and love corpses album this is a song called the final squirt

689
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,900
that's uh ray hay on lead

690
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:21,740
lead, Dr. Philo Drummond on bass, Sphinx Drummond on the keyboard, and I believe, I can't remember,

691
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,160
they trade out drummers, they have mechanical drummers half the time, oh dear friends, we had

692
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,280
a caller who said, Reverend Stang, I've listened to this show twice now, it's a real nice lady,

693
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:39,160
she goes, but now are you all involved in devil worship, I said, no ma'am, no ma'am, we have a

694
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:46,180
special relationship with those devils, but it ain't worship, nay nay, we lure the sinners away

695
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:52,620
from the devils, don't you see, that's what we're doing, is we're, we take, this stuff appeals to

696
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:59,960
sinners, because Bob, Bob doesn't care about the sinning part, he sends them on to more adept

697
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:06,000
personal saviors than him, it's like I told her, I said, if she could just see Bob's face, she'd

698
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,140
understand everything, it would all become clear, and you can see Bob's face, you can see Bob's face,

699
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:15,360
if you write to Bob, and ask for a picture of Bob's face, just say, send me Bob's face,

700
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:27,360
at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214, but we go, we deal with the, with the, the, you know,

701
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,540
the sinners, we went down to the drunk tank, dear friends, we were gonna preach to the alcoholics,

702
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,240
and the homosexuals, now old Bob, he doesn't want them to quit drinking and fornicating, no, no,

703
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,140
they know what's best for them, they know what's best for them, they know what's best for them,

704
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:46,220
they're men, but, but they say, they all say, Bob, Bob, you're a, a great man, you're, you're a rich

705
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:52,120
man, how can you understand my problems, I'm only a wayward sinner, but old Bob Dodds, friends,

706
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:57,780
Bob's been in every jail cell, he knows the prisoner, he's walked in the shoes of the

707
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:03,340
alcoholic, dear friend, he's walked in the shoes of the fornicator, he's walked in the shoes of the

708
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:08,100
common thief, and most important, friends, he's walked in the shoes of the shoe salesman,

709
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,140
he's been on the phone, he's been on the phone, he's been on the phone, he's been on the phone,

710
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,700
He's been through all them drugs, friend.

711
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,120
Oh, he's a sinner and he's a saint because he's Bob!

712
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,080
Oh, yes, I can feel the spirit of Bob moving in Dallas tonight

713
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,860
all across those radio waves.

714
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,620
The evil one is out there.

715
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,780
He's making those bad backwards miracles.

716
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

717
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,540
He's the he-gaheen.

718
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,000
He's got them good, bad, bad, good,

719
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,920
backwards time streams running through all them drivers

720
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,060
out on them Mixmaster.

721
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,940
I feel them out there because I'm in the vision.

722
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,020
I'm in discernment. I'm in the spirit.

723
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,040
Friends, I see a young man listening out there,

724
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,600
but he's bound by habit, by bad habits.

725
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,720
He's frustrated in that traffic jam down there on I-30 right now.

726
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,560
They got him listening to them record albums.

727
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,760
You can hear the devil talking backwards on those.

728
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:57,560
That foreigner music, that rock and roll music with lyrics,

729
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,840
you can hear the devil talking backwards.

730
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,460
And he depends on the satellite beamed-in cable TV movies

731
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,780
with Burt Reynolds and car crashes and women!

732
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,000
Oh, are they real?

733
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,400
They're real, dear friends, but they do.

734
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,480
These pinks out there do have that foot gland,

735
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,160
that one remnant of their soul,

736
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,000
that rectangular gland that's connected to their monies.

737
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,780
My friends, they can be freed by parting with that which hath enslaved them.

738
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,160
You hand them that pamphlet, oh, friends, the scales fall from their eyes.

739
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,680
But you know, when those pink boys discover Bob,

740
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,260
it's either truth or death.

741
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,240
For the love of Bob can kill normals, friends, yes.

742
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,000
Yes, but Bob's men are moving on this planet.

743
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,940
Oh, that planetary alignment that came up, the Jupiter effect,

744
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,820
oh, I'm now sure that may have caused earthquakes and volcanoes

745
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,120
and the Earth to tilt on its axis.

746
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,100
And men will, in the end times to come,

747
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,040
men will gnash their brains and think backwards.

748
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,280
Dead Christians will come up from their graves,

749
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,900
shambling and rotting like not of the living dead,

750
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,540
but through it all, helping to profit from it all,

751
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,220
is that one mighty link between Heaven and Earth, that Bob.

752
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,320
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

753
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,380
The miracle of the Bob world is unfolding.

754
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,700
They're wading up to their knees in blood, dear friends,

755
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,680
but it's the blood of the baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob.

756
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,300
That face that can pile through eight-foot-thick

757
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,700
titanium steel conspiracy fork-knock stores with that mighty pipe.

758
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,720
Oh, he ain't from another planet.

759
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,680
He ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to.

760
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,360
He's a man.

761
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,200
Oh, well, you can pull Bob's leg,

762
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,300
and he'll laugh right along.

763
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,640
Because Bob, he's been a fool just like you and me.

764
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,140
Bob's been a pathetic fool, and I tell you what,

765
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,220
that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.

766
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,240
He's a fool today, he's a fool tomorrow,

767
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,080
because he's the same Bob.

768
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,180
He's always the same Bob, and he's working for you and me.

769
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,860
But it's that foolishness that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot,

770
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,960
that has kept man building his great gas-powered automobile engines,

771
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,580
his nuclear reactors,

772
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,600
that made him want to master the Earth,

773
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,660
no matter how nice it might have been before.

774
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,700
And it gives us, friends, it gives us that mighty hate,

775
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,040
the hate that makes us want to smite our brothers,

776
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,560
the hate that makes us get up in the morning,

777
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,300
and, friends, without that foolishness and that mighty hate,

778
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,540
why, we'd be no different from those normals,

779
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,480
because we'd have nothing to gripe about.

780
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,200
And it's the mighty gripe power and the hate that gives us something for nothing.

781
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,220
Oh, in the long run, we may be poor and broke,

782
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,560
we may be drunk and nervous,

783
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:35,860
we may be neurotic,

784
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,120
but we've got Bob, and they hate!

785
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,060
And for that, we can hate them!

786
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,060
Hate them! Hate them!

787
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,720
And that's the power that we have, and they don't have.

788
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,280
Oh, they've got plenty of that diddly kind of hate.

789
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,920
Oh, I hate President Reagan.

790
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,940
Oh, I hate my job.

791
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,360
I hate myself.

792
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,060
That's the sick hate, friends. That ain't no kind of hate at all.

793
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,280
We've got that all-inclusive kind of hate, that hate essence.

794
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,220
And it's the love of the hate that allows us to put up with just about anything.

795
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,640
So we can do something about it,

796
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,260
because the Bob hate is indistinguishable from the Bob love.

797
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,660
It's what keeps him on his toes.

798
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,180
Bob is the aware man, the natural man.

799
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,740
He can be walking along, humming to himself, playing pocket pool,

800
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,480
but the inner Bob is aware.

801
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,180
He can hear a fly sniff on a mountain far away,

802
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,020
and he can go up to that fly and look that fly in the eye and say,

803
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,600
Son, I'd like to sell you a big old mound of waste byproducts from physical organisms.

804
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,360
And that fly will give his wings to Bob.

805
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,380
Bob is aware.

806
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,920
And that's how he can sell to these inferior creatures.

807
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,920
And that fly, he's going to be a better fly for it.

808
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,220
All those other flies, they're flitting from pile to pile.

809
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,300
They see him just sitting there without any wings on that big old mound of Bob.

810
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,660
And they may laugh now, but winter goes by, summer goes by,

811
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,220
all those other flies starve.

812
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,420
But that little Bob fly, he's still sitting there on that pile,

813
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,080
a munching away and a munching away.

814
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,000
And that pile does not change because Bob, my friends, does not change.

815
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,200
Oh, he changes his mind.

816
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,020
He might suddenly change all the doctrine in the whole church

817
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,120
right in the middle of a ritual to teach us all an important lesson.

818
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,940
But, oh, my friend, Bob Dobbs does not change.

819
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,660
Hold that name on the tip of your tongue.

820
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,160
Bob. There's a B on either side, opposite poles.

821
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,280
That's a lesson right there.

822
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,760
Flip it over on your tongue.

823
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,480
Say it front way. Say it backwards. Say it upside down.

824
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,520
And what does it say? It says Bob.

825
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,620
Because Bob does not change.

826
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,280
His promise rings true.

827
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,480
But if you ain't been sprinkled in the blood of the head,

828
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,180
if you ain't been washed in the waste byproducts,

829
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,500
of Bob, how you gonna get saved?

830
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,980
You can go to that party Saturday night,

831
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,920
but you gotta be wearing Bob's shadow.

832
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,140
You can drink beer. You just gotta get Bob drunk, too.

833
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,440
And what about Wanda?

834
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,580
Oh, you just gonna have to give Wanda over to Bob.

835
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,080
That shouldn't be any problem.

836
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,360
Because Wanda, she found out from Bob how to get to heaven.

837
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,260
Sit down, boy.

838
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,120
Because, friends, if you're wondering,

839
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,400
Bob can love.

840
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,040
Bob can love.

841
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,800
I'm gonna give you a job.

842
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,100
I'm gonna tell you a story.

843
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,720
I was working for a radio station for a year.

844
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:08,720


845
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,640
I didn't set foot in a church for three years.

846
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,520
I was just fed up to here with it.

847
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,960
After working as an announcer at stations in several cities,

848
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,480
I finally got to Hollywood.

849
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,880
I was offered four jobs,

850
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,320
and I took one with a major network.

851
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,980
In 1947, I made a business trip to Cincinnati.

852
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,920
And it was just about then that the Kenneth Arnold sighting

853
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,440
of the so-called flying saucers hit the headlines.

854
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,700
And it caused a lot of conversation.

855
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,240
I notice you keep looking out the window.

856
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,080
You wouldn't be looking for these flying saucers, would you?

857
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,820
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

858
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,300
You don't think it's just some kind of publicity stunt?

859
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,300


860
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,300


861
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,880
No.

862
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,340
It's reasonable to suppose that there's life on other planets.

863
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,960
Maybe I ought to start looking for flying saucers, too.

864
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,680
If they do come from another planet, how will we know?

865
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,920
Listen, when the occupants condescend to tell us, that's when.

866
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,480
God! God! God! God!

867
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,040
God! God! God! God!

868
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:31,620
God! God! God! God!

869
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,140
Now, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

870
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,260
Yes, sir, maybe this is a good idea.

871
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,760
A chance for us to have a little talk.

872
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,100
Why, sure, Dad. What's cooking?

873
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,180
Uh, remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

874
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,100
Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Dad.

875
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:48,500
No.

876
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,500
Oh, here's a match. Your pipe's gone out again.

877
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,320
Well, thanks.

878
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,480
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he...

879
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,840
Well, he calls it a...

880
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,560
When a man and a woman are married, Bob, they love each other very much.

881
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:11,820
And in... in showing their love, their instinct is to embrace each other as if...

882
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,180
Well, as if to try to become the one person God intended them to be.

883
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,580
They're the sperm, as the doctors call it.

884
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,220
Is that the seed that helps make a new baby?

885
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,500
No, no, Bob.

886
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,220
Well...

887
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,540
What I'm talking about now is the fluid that contains the...

888
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,200
formed in two little sacs beneath the penis, which we call the...

889
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,780
Oh, but, Dad, why do fellas get these... these feelings before they get married?

890
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,020
Now, that's a good question, Bob.

891
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,540
Why do I ask you?

892
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,580
Well, there were some drawings in Bob's textbook.

893
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,240
I didn't mean to look at them honest, and...

894
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,040
Well, then some of the older girls... well...

895
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,260
You mean they talk about things sometimes?

896
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,320
Well, yes.

897
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,140
Ah!

898
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,220
Bob?

899
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,060
Yes, Bob.

900
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,020
What's wrong with Bob?

901
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,400
Bob!

902
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,440
I know Bob, Bob...

903
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,480
Bob, that's Bob, that's Bob.

904
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,620
...to solemnly commemorate...

905
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,120
Bob...

906
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,860
...the martyrdom of the prophet-herald of our faith, called Bob.

907
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:25,200
And in today's program, we're going to deal with the story of the Bob's martyrdom, the

908
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


909
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


910
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


911
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


912
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


913
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


914
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


915
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


916
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


917
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


918
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


919
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


920
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,200


921
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,300
and the events surrounding it.

922
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:27,640
Wow!

923
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,960
On that blistering July summer day,

924
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,660
there were the barrels of 750 rifles

925
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,500
awaiting the command to fire

926
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,660
and take the Bob's life.

927
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,220
He seemed so young to die,

928
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,500
barely 30.

929
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,480
He was a handsome, gentle, and confident man.

930
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,280
Could he possibly be guilty of the shocking crime

931
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,560
of which he was accused?

932
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,000
Would you get off your knees?

933
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,020
Somewhat unorthodox, wouldn't you say,

934
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,980
Reverend Scott, but realistic.

935
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,180
You deliver sermons like this,

936
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,000
it's a wonder you're still an ordained minister.

937
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,220
Or are you?

938
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,900
The best kind.

939
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,180
Angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade.

940
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,100
Stripped of most of my so-called clerical powers.

941
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,980
But I'm still in business.

942
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,840
Well, you seem to be enjoying the punishment.

943
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:19,540
Punishment?

944
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,240
Ah, the church has blessed me, that's what it's done.

945
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,200
Vanished to some new country?

946
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,560
In Africa?

947
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,040
Well, I had to look it up on the map

948
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,180
to find out where I was going.

949
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,160
Oh, my bishop doesn't know it,

950
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,120
but he has given me exactly what I wanted.

951
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:34,980
Elbow room.

952
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,120
Freedom.

953
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,640
Real freedom.

954
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,080
Freedom to dump all the rules

955
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,220
and all the trappings.

956
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,580
Freedom to discover God in my own way.

957
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,260
You call this an act?

958
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,360
They say it was an act, not every act, Dr. Grace.

959
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,500
Come on!

960
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,500
I saw a co- I saw a-

961
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:05,100
an article in the read in a recent Billy Graham column on religion.

962
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,380
It said, Dear Dr. Graham, I recently converted to Christianity,

963
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,580
and yet I am not presently killing doctors for Bob.

964
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,220
Is this perhaps a theological contradiction?

965
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,420
You're not media-morteming Christians without,

966
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,260
at least, a medical examination.

967
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,220
At this moment, killing doctors for Bob.

968
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,900
That's the kind of forces we have against us.

969
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,800
Oh, help me, somebody needs a medical examination.

970
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:32,280
I've got to go.

971
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,500
My legs are on fire!

972
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,400
The hour for Christ's return was at hand.

973
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,360
The years between 1843 and 1847

974
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,480
were generally accepted as the time for the return of Christ.

975
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,640
A young man there,

976
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,880
declared that he was the one foretold in all the holy books of the past.

977
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,280
He said he had come to usher in a new era,

978
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,520
a new springtime in the hearts of men.

979
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,260
He was called the Bob.

980
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,080
His name means the door or the gate.

981
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,500
And his teaching was to be the gateway to the new age of unity.

982
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,820
The world is one country,

983
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,920
and mankind its citizens.

984
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,320
There is only one religion,

985
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,960
and all the prophets have taught it.

986
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,680
Hellfire!

987
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,080
All right!

988
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,020
Okay, there's something else, too.

989
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,260
I noticed last Sunday

990
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,100
that one of you put a quarter

991
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,960
in the offering plate, see?

992
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,680
Yeah, Raymond Welch.

993
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,420
You're the one, you put a quarter in there.

994
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,700
You tight son of a...

995
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,340
I've seen all that, see?

996
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,300
I'm up here watching.

997
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,200
I know I can see it.

998
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,920
Y'all don't even look or nothing.

999
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,460
I can see it.

1000
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,900
I know whatever one of you is giving.

1001
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,120
All right.

1002
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,880
I'm gonna maybe go to another church.

1003
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,740
I don't know.

1004
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,920
I don't give a .

1005
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,080
Because I've just about come to the end of the road.

1006
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,340
Here, I've just about lost patience with you people.

1007
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,740
You know we need a Sunday school space out there.

1008
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,900
And as Jesus had spoken to Peter the fisherman,

1009
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,960
the Babs spoke to a Persian student named Mullah Hussein.

1010
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,640
Mullah Hussein described in his own words

1011
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,640
what his experience was like.

1012
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,920
I sat spellbound by his utterance,

1013
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,720
oblivious of time.

1014
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,620
This revelation so suddenly

1015
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,200
and impetuously thrust upon me

1016
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,120
came as a thunderbolt,

1017
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,160
which for a time seemed to have,

1018
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,940
you know, be known to my faculties.

1019
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,220
God is pretty busy.

1020
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,920
He's got a long-term plan for humanity

1021
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,100
that stretches far beyond our comprehension.

1022
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,600
So it's not reasonable to expect him

1023
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,100
to concern himself with the individual.

1024
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,740
The individual is important

1025
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,140
only to the extent of providing a creative link

1026
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,380
between the past and the future

1027
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,660
in his children or in his grandchildren

1028
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:23,120
or in the contribution he makes to humanity.

1029
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,420
Therefore, don't pray to God to solve your problems.

1030
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,380
Pray to that part of God within you.

1031
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,100
Have the guts to fight for yourself.

1032
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,200
God wants brave souls.

1033
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,220
He wants winners, not quitters.

1034
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,500
If you can't win, at least try to win.

1035
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:49,640
If you can't win, at least try to win.

1036
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:49,640


1037
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:49,640


1038
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,660
God loves tryers.

1039
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,420
Is that right, Robin?

1040
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,440
Right.

1041
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,140
You're dealing with something totally alien.

1042
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,600
Those hypnotic eyes.

1043
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,760
Alien, totally alien.

1044
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,580
Something that must be incredibly, unbelievably...

1045
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,560
Something totally alien.

1046
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,860
Looks like he's growing.

1047
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,680
It's like I told Hitler that time,

1048
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,940
back when we were just a couple of running buddies.

1049
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:31,440
One man's bummer is another man's beautiful thang.

1050
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,560
And he always believed in that.

1051
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,580
I think these guys in this band

1052
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,680
are a bunch of stupid little loony birds.

1053
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:44,520
Well, man, this is a pretty cool place, though,

1054
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,820
even if I'm by my head.

1055
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,720
Dorothy.

1056
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,720
Dorothy, Dorothy, Dorothy.

1057
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,260
Gotta be Dorothy, huh.

1058
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,460
Dorothy, you gotta be Dorothy when you singin' this song.

1059
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,720
Yeah, you've gotta be Dorothy when you're droppin' on that love.

1060
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:14,120

00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:42,620
Sifting a measured quantity of tan flakes down into curved paper, spreading the flakes

1064
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:48,440
so that they lay equal at the ends, with a slight depression in the middle, thumbs rolling

1065
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:55,440
the paper's inner edge down and up under the outer edge as forefingers pressed it over,

1066
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:02,300
thumbs and fingers sliding to the paper's salooner ends to hold it even, while tongue

1067

and thumb smoothed the damp seam, right forefinger and thumb twisting their end.

Well you guys have been propping for about 4 or 5 hours in the world now.

1076
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,620
And excuse me when I call stop to it because as you well know,

1077
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:02,100
viewing mug is something that can't take that type of torment, anguish, pain,

1078
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,760
for that long, stigmatary time.

1079
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,600
So will you stop propping now son or?

1080

You got to stop the propping!

1085
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,440
But you know what happens when you stop propping?

1086
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,520
Pretty soon you're going to come down son.

1087
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,260
You know what's going to happen then.

1088

You know what's going to happen when you come down.

1089
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,700
You got to stop propping!

00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,820
Propp, propp, proppin'!

1099
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,160

1100
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,700

1108
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,720
I was drinking Budweiser

1109

I was drunk.

1115
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,760
I was lonely.

1116
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,860
I was plastered.

1117
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,260

and Bob was on TV.

1121
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,400
Watching Bob on TV.

1122

Swallowing Redman

1123
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,220
the day my coon dog died.

1124
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,860
Reading the pamphlet
