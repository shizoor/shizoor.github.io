1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,820
baaaab baaaaaab hows everything

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,400
every since I've dayed about it

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,660
baaaaaab

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,600
Bob?

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,900
Bob?

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,700
Bob?

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:32,640
Bob?

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,420
And it comes down the street like a garbage wagon.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,180
Okay.

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,920
So their brains may live on forever.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,000
But has he created another?

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,900
By the miracle of recording.

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,860
I'm not very good at singing songs, but here's a try.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,800
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,800
Ridiculous theory of evolution.

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,020
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,280
Peace or annihilation.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:49,880
Peace or annihilation.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,900
And then it struck me.

20
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,380
At some point in the past, I had compiled enough new hymns and songs of a subgeniusly nature

21
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,420
to make a seventh Bob Song CD.

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,080
But I'd never gotten around to making the packaging,

23
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,200
so the stuff hadn't been released except in dribs and drabs on ancient hours of Slack from 2006.

24
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,460
So that solved my problem.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,640
Here, then, is hour of Slack number 1246,

26
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,900
an all Bob Songs episode and a sneak preview of our next...

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,700
official CD release, which you now already have on MP3 from downloading this show.

28
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,660
But, oh well.

29
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,580
Slack must come first in the life of every initiate.

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,100
Leigh Murr shall start us off.

31
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,960
One, two, three!

32
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,080
Bob.

33
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,680
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

34
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,220
Bob?

35
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,140
Bob?

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,940
Bob?

37
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,740
That doesn't look like me at all.

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,720
If you were turned inside out, that's the way you'd go.

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,340
Apparently, Bob came and did something with all of us.

41
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,740
Praise the Bob!

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,960
Quiet, numbskulls.

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,480
It's on broadcasting.

44
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,260
Lay your hands on the radio!

45
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,940
Lay your hands on the radio band, and we're gonna look to God!

46
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,040
It's not a nightmare that's gonna end, it's just beginning because it's inside me.

47
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,400
You, you have to love Bob.

48
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,020
He loves you, but...

49
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,180
you love Bob.

50
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,440
You have to.

51
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,160
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,060
He'll kill you.

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,860
He'll Bob you out.

54
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,080
Right now, I will give you all my money.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:14,880
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

56
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,500
Huh?

57
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,220
Bob.

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,140
Bob.

59
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,280
Bob.

60
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,600
Why don't you just leave me alone?

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,780
I never saw anything.

62
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,060
I don't know what Mars is and I was never there.

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:37,960
I don't know what Mars is and I was never there.

64
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:45,660
Shut up!

65
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,560
You shut up!

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Shut up!

67
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,600
Shut up!

68
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,840
Shut up!

69
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,740
Attention.

70
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,740
Attention.

71
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,340
Polly?

72
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,180
Come?

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,380
Honey?

74
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,200
Honey?

75
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:24,920
Attention.

76
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,320
Attention.

77
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,600
Attention.

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,600
Attention.

79
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,840
Who are the overlords of the UFO ?

80
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,180
Attention.

81
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
Attention.

82
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,000
Attention.

83
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,600
Attention.

84
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,360
Bob! Bob!

85
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,540
Bob! Bob! Bob!

86
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,180
Look, if he starts this thing, he won't be able to stop it.

87
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,420
It's immortality.

88
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,500
For the price more costly than death.

89
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,180
The world stops spinning and the clock stops moving.

90
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,640
But something's still ticking and wearing on the inside.

91
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,560
And every time you let it go like I'm doing right now,

92
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,000
you can feel the wear.

93
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,040
I know from 342 years of experience that time control can only go awry.

94
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,500
The Third World War might begin any minute and we'll all be killed.

95
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,600
Why should we bother about giant turtles?

96
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,340
Yes, maybe you're right.

97
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,600
I know how much you love your turtles.

98
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,160
But there are other things in life just as important,

99
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,040
like how to live.

100
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,440
I'm glad you're having friends.

101
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,840
Our ancient legends did mention fire-eating turtles.

102
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,200
Ah, yes.

103
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,140
That ah, yes from Pastor Epley signifies that that was the soundtrack of a video.

104
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:13,260
A spaz blaster for which I did the music and mix using a bunch of collages by Fernanda Nandi-Lemur,

105
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,800
as well as Byron Werner, Sivit Stang, Reverend Rosna, uh, Sandy Smith, and Reverend New Monet.

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,980
By the way, if anybody can tell us what happened to New Monet, please do.

107
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:30,720
In the meantime, from Norellpref.com, Norellpref and his composition, Love Church.

108
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,080
I gotta tell ya, man, I love church.

109
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,280
I just love church.

110
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,440
Bob! Bob!

111
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,120
Love church. Totally!

112
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,760
Yes, giving.

113
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,400
Yes, giving.

114
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,500
Bob!

115
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,940
I love this guy!

116
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,280
Come join the fun!

117
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,040
All of you have heard of...

118
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,500
Bob!

119
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,700
Love church.

120
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,300
I gotta tell ya,

121
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,200
It makes you feel real big.

122
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,100
Go! Go! Go!

123
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,380
Love church.

124
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,160
Bob!

125
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,900
Yes, giving.

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,360
Yes, giving.

127
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,080
Bob!

128
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,780
Come join the fun.

129
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,580
All of you have heard of...

130
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,000
Bob!

131
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,720
Love church.

132
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,380
It makes you feel real big.

133
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,880
Yes, giving.

134
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,920
Yes, giving.

135
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,020
Bob!

136
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,280
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

137
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,080
We all thought you were dead.

138
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,080
No, no. Still here.

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,240
How are you, Bob?

140
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm okay.

141
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,100
I'm okay.

142
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,800
Brothers and sisters, we must confront ourselves.

143
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,360
We know that all men and women are created good.

144
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,240
We must understand why you have gone bad.

145
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,820
You cannot play checkers with your life, jumping around like an old whirlwind,

146
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:18,420
wrapping your dishes and plates and then unpacking them and placing them back on a shelf.

147
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,420
This is not the way the Jehovah One has designed you to act.

148
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:33,400
Unless you are willing to admit that you are a gnom, a pink boy, a nini, a twig.

149
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,360
Only then can you decide where your path shall lead you.

150
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,720
But we know inherently that we are all created good by Jehovah One.

151
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,920
Some of you got such bad luck sometimes in your life, you couldn't hang yourself with your own necktie.

152
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,980
This is when you should look to Bob.

153
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,480
When you look to Jehovah One and say,

154
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,060
Bob, come into my life.

155
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,060
And you shall see one set of footprints in the sand.

156
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:16,980
And that is when you will know that Bob has charged you $5.99 to carry you to the nearest taxi.

157
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,960
Praise Bob and his divine ways.

158
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:31,080
You got to know that life is like a vanishing twin, a baby inside of a twin inside of a woman's belly.

159
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,040
That's how confusing it is.

160
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,040


161
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,820
This wiggly world can be.

162
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,780
You got to breeze up above this wiggly world and grab the hand of Bob.

163
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,580
Praise him and all that flows from Bob.

164
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,480
And praise Reverend Raymond Lafferty who did that classic.

165
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,560
A wiggly world indeed.

166
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,280
To help solidify things, we'll now hear Bob's audition by, not Bob,

167
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,720
but the Psychoskeletons.

168
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,280
The Psychoskeletons

169
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,140
Feels kinda like I'm in Spaceland.

170
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,160
That's a contradiction in terms.

171
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,800
And Bob's shining down on me.

172
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,000
And no one's aiming a rifle at me.

173
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,560
Holy dammit.

174
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,300
That's a contradiction in terms.

175
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,920
And Bob is the giant hepatitis penis of destruction.

176
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,360
Bursting forth from the portable Johnny.

177
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,120
Now let's all be a contradiction in terms.

178
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,160
Herds of benign cattle wander across the acid-washed, flush-drained landscape.

179
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,840
All belonging to their own friendship families, none loving any other than Bob.

180
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,240
The flow between adjacent points of reference.

181
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,380
Points on the line segment between the concrete to absolute oblivious eternity.

182
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,360
Sweet Lord Bob.

183
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,400
When we all act together as men, as people, we could distinguish ourselves and betray any other.

184
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,040
As it was before time, but still within space.

185
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,520
All who bow down and submit to their fractals.

186
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,360
The Psychoskeletons

187
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,200
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

188
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,820
Bob? wireérer.

189
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,560
My short Doors Perseverance

190
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,840
My Short Doors Perseverance

191
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,920
Doooooors and arms.

192
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,340
Doors.

193
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,640
My shorter persevere

194
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,620
Bob does

195
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,240
My shorter persevere

196
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,600
My shorter persevere

197
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
Bob does

198
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,800
My shorter persevere

199
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,620
Cigarette butts on the ground

200
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:55,860
Just like the sun, my slack goes on and on and on

201
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,880
Praise Bob!

202
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:06,820
Just like the sun, my slack goes on and on and on and on

203
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,960
Praise Bob!

204
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:19,880
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack goes on and on and on

205
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:28,860
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack goes on and on and on

206
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,920
And on

207
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,100
Praise Bob

208
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

209
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,620
Praise Bob's song number 1010 by Lee Murr.

210
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,500
Now, another song by Reverend Ed Fred entitled simply, Pink.

211
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,120
Hey little brothers and sisters, why don't you get around?

212
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,220
I've got something important to say to you, something I think you need to hear.

213
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,760
Come on now.

214
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,420
Are you sure you've got your life together?

215
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:36,840
No.

216
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,360
No.

217
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


218
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


219
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


220
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


221
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


222
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


223
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


224
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


225
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


226
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


227
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


228
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:38,940


229
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,840
On top of the world.

230
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,160
The reality is about to rear its ugly head, my friends.

231
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,180
Are you ready to face the music?

232
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,300
You're pink.

233
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,160
You're pink.

234
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,900
We think.

235
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,580
You're pink.

236
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,240
You drive that big old SUV.

237
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,940
Draining your wallet into you.

238
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:17,760
used to be. You're in a material race you just can't win. Following society is your greatest sin.

239
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:26,200
You are destined to fail, my friend. You're gonna be poor and alone in the end.

240
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,920
You got your treasures, you got your hoard, but you're only gonna end up broken board.

241
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,960
Come on, friends, it's time to turn over a new leaf.

242
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,860
Unleash your weakness and get some relief. Slack is king and nothing else matters.

243
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,740
Don't be pink. Pull yourself up by your latex undergarments.

244
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:02,180
Toss away all your commercial influences. The slack within you can be born again.

245
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,080
Act now. This is limited time, awful. Get yours now while supplies last.

246
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:20,040
Awful void in Alaska and Hawaii. Be sure to consult your doctor about any risk that might be associated with slack.

247
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,940
Yeah, I hope you learned something today. Now I'm going to get myself some slack.

248
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,120
Daa-ba-ba-bum...

249
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,140
Ba-bum!

250
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,280
Ba-bum!

251
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,880
Ba-bum!

252
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:51,020
dobryった 바 ASK THOSE Les B

253
00:19:51,020 --> 00:20:03,520
Oh man, I can't reach the pause.

254
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,640
I trip.

255
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:03,900
But it's okay.

256
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,980
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

257
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,480
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

258
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,860
I bring you a warning.

259
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,140
Every one of you listening to my voice, tell the world.

260
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,940
Tell this to everybody wherever they are.

261
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,760
Watch the sky.

262
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,240
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

263
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

264
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:38,760
Shazam!

265
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,040
And I say it is possible for a giant lizard to have lived there for years without being seen.

266
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,840
Let's go!

267
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,080
You, you, you, you bloated idiot!

268
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,160
You stupid fathead!

269
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,180
There are a bunch of art critics and we're looking for people who like to draw.

270
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,500
You are not safe.

271
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,240
I'll save you, brothers.

272
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,140
Oh, so suspicious, eh?

273
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm the art critic.

274
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,000
Huh?

275
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,540
I'm the art critic.

276
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,320
I'm the art critic.

277
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,520
I'm the art critic.

278
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,980
One joke can sell a thousand words.

279
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,280
Then a thousand words of fun.

280
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,420
That is quite a joke.

281
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,600
That is quite a joke.

282
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,780
I tried the prof.

283
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,120
Groovy.

284
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,820
Right, Bob?

285
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,660
Bob?

286
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,520
Bob?

287
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,540
Wait a minute.

288
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,620
How did this happen?

289
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,540
We're smarter than this.

290
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,140
Apparently not.

291
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,340
Bob?

292
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,360
Bob?

293
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,200
Bob?

294
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,100
Bob?

295
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,600
Bob?

296
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:34,960
Bob?

297
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,760
Bob?

298
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,000


299
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,060
Bob?

300
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,920
Bob?

301
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,440
Bob?

302
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,240
Bob?

303
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,460
Bob?

304
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,080
Bob?

305
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,380
Bob?

306
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:40,700
Bob?

307
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,940
Bob?

308
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:48,020
Long call, Dave.

309
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,720
Don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

310
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,960
Apparently Bob came and did something with all of us.

311
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,120
Yeah.

312
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,380
The drugs I took seemed to light up my brain.

313
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,060
And I'd say as long as you're alive, you'll make noise.

314
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,340
You won't hear back.

315
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,680
You'll breathe up.

316
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,700
You'll shut up like hell.

317
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,320
And you ain't earned the last Ernest T. Bass.

318
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,080
Praise Reverend Ernest T. Bass.

319
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,420
The last four minutes there were collages by Lemur, Byron Werner, and others

320
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,200
remixed by me with my music.

321
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,420
I can't remember if I ever made a video with that one or not,

322
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,760
but now from a group or individual, I don't even know which,

323
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,280
called Da Vinci, a tune called Eslactica.

324
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:57,100
I don't know if I ever made a video with that one.

325
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:24,080
I don't know if I ever made a video with that one.

326
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,820
And the first bishop I ever met.

327
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,720
And everyone I ever met.

328
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:49,800


329
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:49,800


330
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,100
.

331
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,100


332
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,100


333
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,100


334
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,100


335
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,100


336
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,360
And I reformed the head.

337
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,700
The head. What about the head?

338
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,220
What about the scary poster dog thing?

339
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,800
That evil head.

340
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,980
There's no sign of Wellman.

341
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,200
There's no sign of Wellman.

342
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,860
We're just landlady right here and hoping that we can get in touch with you.

343
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,580
Yeah, Wellman's gone.

344
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,120
But if we can just get the head inside that lead-lined vault, we'll be okay.

345
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,300
Friends, beware that head.

346
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,320
Save it.

347
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,120
I left the little Wellman at home.

348
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:36,800
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth greens

349
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,480
down at Onion Creek Country Club and Golf Course.

350
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,500
Thumping slowly like an over-enlarged fig,

351
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,320
the bleeding head slowly rose at a gentle angle above the green, dripping blood.

352
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:13,500
It hovered briefly over the sand trap and then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion at an angle of about 44.325 degrees, like a shot off a shovel.

353
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,420
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.

354
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,580
That moon-faced smile was unforgettable.

355
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,420
The population, the population of southeast Austin went wild.

356
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,340
They tore off their clothes, danced in the streets and said,

357
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,880
The bloody head has come.

358
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,640
The time is here.

359
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,220
Take off your clothes and be somebody.

360
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,320
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer was above such things.

361
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:53,100
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer rose gently, buffeting itself slightly as it passed among some ancient pecan trees.

362
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,220
The blood of Arnold Palmer was slowly, still, ever moving upwards.

363
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:06,720
It wobbled slightly, spraying a small glissando of blood, so to speak, on the people below it,

364
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:15,060
healing two old ladies and giving an old man a substantial gland rebuild.

365
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,300
At 14 minutes after 9, the bleeding head was sighted.

366
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,300


367
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,300


368
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,300


369
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,300


370
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,300


371
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:33,600
The bastards, hard-headed, carried the body around in their hands,

372
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:43,720
preventing them from taking off the body ofええno on Head Tweeter.

373
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,580
infectious, the body or an easily kidnap onto a

374
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:48,840
historical TV channel.

375
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,160
More than 5,000 people died.

376
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,620
Quite some were Do Commirals.

377
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,280
Diligent in self-destruction bur系penhack3

378
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:01,120
radar at Caswell Air Force Base, gave subsequent indications that something large and wet was

379
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,360
moving north-northeast while ascending still upwards towards the constellation of Orion.

380
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:20,700
The bloody head moved on. Fourteen ex-virgins were rejuvenated in Lubbock as the head passed through.

381
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,220
The head was taken to the hospital in the early morning of the same day.

382
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,460
Keep your hands out of each other's marsupial pockets, boys.

383
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,320
That's right.

384
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:46,180
Yes, the Ballad of the Bleeding Head, a real oldie from the great Dr. G. Gordon Gordon in Doctors for Extreme Prejudice.

385
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,420
I'm not sure, but I think one of the musicians on that finally got out of prison after serving a term for murder.

386
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,120
And now, the news.

387
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,260
From the air, the news.

388
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,560
PR news in Washington. I'm delayed by heavy snow.

389
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:04,380
Pope Benedict XVI is instructing Irish Roman Catholic clergy to cooperate in the sex involving priests and children.

390
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,460
The Vatican says Benedict does express profound sexual regret, this time at the Vancouver Olympics.

391
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,580
On Wall Street, 151021421.

392
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,400
Pope Benedict says this is PR.

393
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,780
Your news is flawed.

394
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,220
Three instead of three and a half.

395
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,300
President Obama says.

396
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,500
And this is only the tripling.

397
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,780
Astronauts killed 18 people and injured 71 others aboard the International Space Station.

398
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,040
The astronauts need to encourage development of PR news from Washington.

399
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,120
COVID.

400
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,360
COVID.

401
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,700
COVID.

402
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,980
COVID.

403
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,480
COVID.

404
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:43,620
COVID.

405
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,640
COVID.

406
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,500
COVID.

407
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,620
COVID.

408
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,620


409
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
COVID.

410
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,640
COVID.

411
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,620
COVID.

412
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,280
COVID.

413
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,100
COVID.

414
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,300
COVID.

415
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,200
COVID.

416
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,700
COVID.

417
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,380
COVID.

418
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:55,140
The mighty Reverend Artemia Salina engineered that one.

419
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,760
Nothing shrimpy about him, and such a briny fellow.

420
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,300
Next up, well, I'm sorry, I promised I wouldn't do this,

421
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:08,400
but with the help of Princess Wee and inspired by the Numa Numa internet fad, I sang.

422
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,640
This is the subgenius Numa Numa song with our English translation

423
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,940
phonetically derived from the Romanian boy band original.

424
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:24,060
The title was phonetically changed from Dragos Ja Dente to rather Bob Didn't Stay.

425
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:31,420
But soon, sun's born, just eat a comb.

426
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:38,880
I know you'll be like my subgenius Fettuccine.

427
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,260
I know, I know, some parachute.

428
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,800
Big ass hole, some back feet.

429
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,440
She's so unique, that's it, she won't share the meat.

430
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,160
Love will come, but Connie goes away.

431
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,960
Connie goes away.

432
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,200
Connie goes away away.

433
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,360
Bob made care of Tuccini all day.

434
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,000
We have to eat it all today.

435
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,900
Face of dogs, don't ever go away.

436
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,760
Never go away.

437
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,100
Never go or go away.

438
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,360
She'd rebel, she'd rather fucking stay.

439
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,020
Now at best, we'll all be paid.

440
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,040
Hey!

441
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,620
Mice and cheese, mice and poo.

442
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:33,920
Mice and cheese, mice and poo.

443
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:45,440
Mice and hoe, mice and ha ha.

444
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,540
Mice and cheese, mice and poo, mice and hoe

445
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,260
Mice and haha.

446
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,900
She's a happy girl today

447
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,620
Cause she quit her job

448
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,800
The solution

449
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,480
Has it been

450
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,680
Purified?

451
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,200
I brushed my teeth today

452
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,320
Just to see if I could feel

453
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,280
I focus on the pain

454
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,180
The only thing that's real

455
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,160
I brushed my teeth today

456
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,200
Just to see if I could feel

457
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,260
I focus on the pain

458
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,380
The only thing that's real

459
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,520
Listen all yorkers

460
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,220
We're steppin' hardcore

461
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,920
Listen all yorkers

462
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,740
We're steppin' hardcore

463
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,300
Listen all yorkers

464
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,020
We're steppin' hardcore

465
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,660
Don't break it, don't break it

466
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,340
This is a public service matter

467
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,660
Do you often brainstorm ideas

468
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,320
For getting some cash

469
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,240
As you empty logs of poo

470
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,780
From your garments?

471
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,920
Maybe you could benefit

472
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,260
From some of the money

473
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,260


474
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,500
From some of the money

475
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,920
I mean slack

476
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
I had a dream

477
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,100
I saw it twice

478
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,900
Saved earth of day

479
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,640
Or even chocolate night

480
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,440
Nicotine breeze at night

481
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,380
Misrepresented sets of tunnels

482
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,120
I had a dream

483
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,360
I saw it twice

484
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,260
Saved earth of day

485
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,700
Or even chocolate night

486
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,400
Nicotine breeze at night

487
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,400
Misrepresented sets of tunnels

488
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,320
A most Beefheartian song

489
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,740
Or homage called

490
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,880
Slack Solution

491
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,240
By the Psychoskeletons

492
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,840
Another song that also brings to mind

493
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,880
Captain Beefheart

494
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,080
Although not for any good reason

495
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,400
Is this masterpiece

496
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,240
By the great Dr. Gary Gabrog Fran

497
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,100
Titled Tar Baby of Bob

498
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,260
Tar Baby of Bob

499
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,260


500
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,500
I've got no money

501
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,000
But I got no?

502
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,420
Bob

503
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,600
When you're stuck

504
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,020
Straight to the tar baby Mustph Democrats

505
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,240
If you've got anyface

506
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,240


507
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,240


508
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,240


509
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,240


510
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,680
guitar solo

511
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,680
guitar solo

512
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,760
I wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog

513
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:01,200
Instead of this church where my socks just rock

514
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,660
I wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog

515
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,580
Instead of this church where my socks just rock

516
00:37:31,660 --> 00:38:01,580
Instead of this church where my socks just rock

517
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,560
Instead of this church where my socks just rock

518
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,900
Somewhere in hyperspace, Bob has prepared a place

519
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,980
For those he loves for who will pay

520
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,040
The X's will come again and make us sober

521
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,560
And the countdown's getting higher on X day

522
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,520
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and four and five

523
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,020
Send your thirty bucks while you're alive

524
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,300
Two and three, how rich we'll be when humans take a dive

525
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,800
The countdown's getting higher at our food drive

526
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,160
Bob Dobbs was shot for you, met with the devil too

527
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,320
But in deepest hell he did not stay

528
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,780
Satan done let him out and while we scream and shout

529
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,960
The countdown's getting higher on X day

530
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,000
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and nine

531
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,480
Send your thirty bucks, you're out of time

532
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,620
Forty-two, boy, did he get you?

533
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,480
Salvation should be a crime

534
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,180
The countdown's getting higher on frog this time

535
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,740
So, where's the dummy that we have to train on?

536
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,880
Reverend Self Slayer did that quaint and quirky little X day folk song

537
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,080
Now, echoing a song from last week's show

538
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,620
Reverend Phineas Narco of NationalCynical.com

539
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,460
Brings us this subgeniusized version of a John Lennon song

540
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,620
That probably doesn't deserve this kind of treatment

541
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,400
Imagine there's no Starbucks

542
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,140
I wonder what you'd do

543
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,180
Can't get in

544
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,300
ATM card

545
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,740
And no computers too

546
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,720
Imagine all subgenies

547
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,460
Living life in slack

548
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,940
Imagine there's no modems

549
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,320
And sitcoms on TV

550
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,420
We'd hunker down in mud huts

551
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,320
And take some LSP

552
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,080
And we'd be back in the day

553
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:55,500
And we'd be back in the day

554
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:55,920
And we'd be back in the day

555
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:55,920


556
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
And we'd be back in the day

557
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,140
You

558
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,540
Who-who-who

559
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,320
You may say I'm subgenius

560
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,300
But I'm not the only one

561
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,800
Gotta wonder if I'm really one

562
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,260
What I'm losing out on

563
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,500
Imagine no McDonalds

564
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,500
And no Big Mac with cheese

565
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,860
No email and no voicemail

566
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,060
And no more songs like these

567
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,680
Imagine the subgenius

568
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,160
Life without the con

569
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,080
You, hoo hoo hoo

570
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,380
Gotta wonder if I'm really wanting

571
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,840
You, hoo hoo hoo

572
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:09,840


573
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,200
What I'm losing out on

574
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,320
What I'm losing out on

575
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,300
Look into my eyes

576
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,020
What do you trust?

577
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,340
The Church of the Subgenius

578
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,240
I know you're slack

579
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,840
I know you're slack

580
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,340
I know you're slack

581
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,920
I've been everything so spit and cuss

582
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,960
I'm the Church of the Subgenius

583
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,560
Like El Populi and Reverend Spell

584
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,880
Church of the Subgenius

585
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,080
Church of the Subgenius

586
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,420
Church of the Subgenius

587
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,100
Friggin'

588
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,760
Dr. Powell!

589
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,060
Princess Queen!

590
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,920
Mr. Remo Remo Remo will crash the next next thing!

591
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,140
You don't have to follow me.

592
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,220
Only you can teach me.

593
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:37,720
You don't have to follow me.

594
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:37,720


595
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:37,820
Oh maybe you can teach me?

596
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,040
I smell the faint.

597
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,840
I smell the faint.

598
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:39,840


599
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:39,840


600
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:39,840


601
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:39,840


602
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,780
you need to be.

603
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,020
Church of the subgenius.

604
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,860
I explore you, don't make a fuss.

605
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,320
I tell you when and when and when makes it us.

606
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,860
I'm the church of the subgenius.

607
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,940
Like J.R. Bob Dobbs and Old Festus.

608
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,680
I'm the church of the subgenius.

609
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,880
Church of the subgenius.

610
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,500
Church of the subgenius.

611
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,940
Lonesome cowboy dig.

612
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,780
I load women.

613
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,440
A subgenius rants.

614
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,360
That subgenius lies.

615
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,120
You don't have to follow me.

616
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,980
Only you can pee freely.

617
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,900
Freely.

618
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,900
You'll take me for a...

619
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,380
Dr. Paul.

620
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,620
Princess Queen.

621
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,160
Mr. Lemo, Lemo, Lemo.

622
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,440
You will crash the next death's day.

623
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,860
You don't have to follow me.

624
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,260
Only you can pee freely.

625
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:27,040
You don't have to follow me.

626
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,040


627
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,040


628
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,120
You gave me fap.

629
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,440
You gave me slap.

630
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,920
You gave me power from Bob Dobbs' old sap.

631
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,320
You gave me power from Bob Dobbs' old sap.

632
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,280
I'm every person

633
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,240
you need to be

634
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,140
so get on the bus

635
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,900
don't need to discuss much

636
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,940
I'm the church of the subgenius

637
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,740
I'm the church of

638
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,040
I'm the church of

639
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,260
I'm the church of the subgenius

640
00:46:54,260 --> 00:47:01,520
a great subgenius anthem created by

641
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,940

Reverend Oroboros Rex

645
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,760
it's an X-Day song

646
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,960
this one and the following song

647

music

666
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,080
And it's one more night in Rushwood

667
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,140
If my Friday Jones could be my hire

668
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:20,100
I wish she would

669
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,220
Na na na na

670
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,660
Na na na na

671
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,740

Na na na na

673
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,720
Yeah

674
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,180
The smell of the boys and of normals

675
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,960
And the feeling that they all can't help

676
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,660
But see it in my face

677
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,800
With my third eye I look across the mill

678
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,700
The way to see he exists

679
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,200
On their way to burn this place

680
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,700
And it's one more night in Rushwood

681
00:48:59,700 --> 00:48:59,700


682
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,520
And it's one more day up in the saucers

683
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,160
And it's one more night in Rushwood

684
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,500
If saucer dreams alone could bring me Susie

685
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,180
Maybe I could

686
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,340
Na na na na

687
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,580
Na na na na

688
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,780
Na na na na

689
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,600
Na na na na

690
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:29,960
Yeah

691
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,700
Na na na na

692
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,160
Na na na na

693
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,080
Na na na na

694
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,680
Na na na na

695
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,780
Na na na na

696
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,400
Na na na na

697
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,200
Yeah

698
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:52,520
I'd cruise this laddered mansion sometime after 2 a.m.

699
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,740
And talk a little while about the church

700
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:05,320
But the conspiracy makes you move a little slower

701
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:11,840
Makes you talk a little lower about the day that we take over

702
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:18,440
It's been a while since X-Day and I guess I will believe

703
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,680
Maybe next year will be better than the last

704
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,580
I can't remember all the things I've said in my life

705
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:29,580


706
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,520
All the times I played the hourglass

707
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,560
And wished my wish would make it come to pass

708
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,760
So it's 6.59 on board the saucer

709
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,640
But it's 7.01 in Rushwood

710
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,500
I have never made it to an end

711
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,060
Can't forget my best day

712
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,800
And will the day else come be safe?

713
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,460
I guess I should

714
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,640
Na na na na

715
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,140
Na na na na

716
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,140
Na na na na

00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,680
Na na na na

00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:12,680

00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,400
Na na na na

720
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,360
Na na, na, na

721
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,200
Na na, na, na

722
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:18,200


723
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,160
Na na, na, na,

724
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,260
Na na, na, na

725
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,640

00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,480
I probably did

734
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:29,480


735
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:29,480


736
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,260
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a yeti

737
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,900
Church air in my veins and my fur is getting shitty

738
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,060
While the plastic-ass pipes spray-paint the palmer head

739
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,900
Dog food vendors with the beefcake suit-a-fed

740
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,260
Kill all the pink boys and put it in neutral

741
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,580
Shit happens flamin' in the stag-meltin' capitals

742
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,660
Bobby's in Sherman, tired of fightin' the pipe

743
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,060
Got a couple motel rooms, sleep on the floor tonight

744
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,900
Someone keeps sayin' I'm a tanger to complain about

745
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,340
A round-trip ticket when it's all gonna end

746
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,280
Well, believe anything that ain't nice

747
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,860
When you got Rip and Striddle and the Jaina device

748
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,820
Just watch the face smilin' there in the dark

749
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:15,120
Burn all your money when they decimate the Taylor Park

750
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,540
Yo, I can't do this

751
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,060
Samper's a genius

752
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,460
I'm a subgenius, baby

753
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,040
Subgenius, baby

754
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,740
So why don't you kill me?

755
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,020
Oh, look at the pantyhose

756
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,540
Samper's a genius

757
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,920
I'm subgenius, baby

758
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,220
So why don't you kill me?

759
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,100
Flesh-fryin' sauces in a Bobby Ken nightmare

760
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,840
Stock fists poundin' down the door of the world

761
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,800
Cause one's gotta rant and the other's gotta brag

762
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,580
Bob's on some window-painting, Connie's on the rag

763
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,840
With the radio shows and the backstage blowjobs

764
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,040
Gangs on the radio shows, and the backstage blowjobs

765
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,840
Can't get invited to the first week

766
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,580
What's the fuck?

767
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,800
Burn to death like a Buddhist priest

768
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,640
Yes, men starving at the subgenius feast

769
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,520
And it's all for those who fulfill their fate

770
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,440
Trade the cash for the pills for the bobbies for the hate

771
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,380
And the time is a piece of crap

772
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,100
Falling down the toilet

773
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,340
With Bob's hand on the handle

774
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,720
Samper's a genius

775
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,180
I'm subgenius, baby

776
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,460
So why don't you kill me?

777
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,860
I'm a front if you lost

778
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,200
Samper's a genius

779
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,540
I'm subgenius, baby

780
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,900
So why don't you kill me?

786
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,360
Reverend Phineas Narco of NationalSynical.com

787
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,200
A song called Samper, Subgenius

788
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,120
And that's almost it for this hour of slack from the Church of the Subgenius

789
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,440
Subgenius, a huge thank you to everyone who's been here during this hour

790
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,580
Thanks to all of our contributors down through the ages, as well as to the radio stations that keep playing this maddening show.

791
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:46,920
If you want to be further in maddened, you can check out subgenius.com, which has everything, including links to everybody's websites and all the other subgenius shows and station events and legends and dogma and so on.

792
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:54,560
The music in the background for all these credits is from the band and the CD Mayan Ruins.

793
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,820
MySpace.com slash Mayan Ruins.

794
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,300
We shall close with, well, the last two things will be Lemur and Psychoskeletons.

795
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,100
But first, the oldest recording of this whole set.

796
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:13,800
One of the first Bob songs, Doctors for Bob, back in 1982 or so, performing live at some devival, probably in Dallas.

797
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,560
The Doctors for Bob theme.

798
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,220
We have your attention, please. There's about to be a fairly serious accident.

799
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,860
Doctors for Bob!

800
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,580
Doctors for Bob!

801
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,140
Everything real is not mine.

802
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,760
I've got the blues.

803
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,380
Sad damn pickup done run over my wife.

804
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,380
Doctors for Bob.

805
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,940
Everything real is his life.

806
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,340
He's got the blues.

807
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,540
Sad damn pickup done run over his wife.

808
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,360
Doctors for Bob.

809
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,900
Doctors for Bob.

810
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,560
We're Doctors, we're Doctors, we're Doctors for Bob!

811
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,440
Doctors, Doctors.

812
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,100
Doctors for Bob.

813
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:11,820
Doctors, had the blues, we're Doctors, with Tom.

814
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,120
we're doctors, we're doctors, who decide who does what.

815
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:13,900
We're doctors.

816
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,240
Heliopters make the road recognised, the road於 thediocese is safe now,

817
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:22,300
free the prison, no exceptions, we're doctors, we're doctors.

818
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,840
Doctors, Doctors for Bob.

819
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,540
Doctors for Bob!

820
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,240
Doctors, doctors, doctors, doctors,

821
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,860
destroy the Indianapolis, destroy the Indianapolis,

822
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,740
and go to France.

823
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,300
Destroy all minerals.

824
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,280
We in state determine the subject as a power,

825
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,040
and so do our government members.

826
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,220
We shall rule.

827
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,600
We shall be free.

828
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,860
We are the story of the people.

829
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,220
We are the one true church.

830
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,240
Doctors for Bob.

831
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,540
Everything's real in his pod.

832
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,880
He's got the blues,

833
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,680
because that damn pickup done run over his wife.

834
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,600
Doctors for Bob.

835
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:15,540
Bob?

836
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,820
Bob?

837
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:19,820


838
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:19,820


839
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:19,820


840
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,860
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

841
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,800
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

842
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,560
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

843
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,940
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

844
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,240
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

845
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:49,480
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

846
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,660
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

847
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:11,960
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

848
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:29,700
I'll sing you a song about Bob.
