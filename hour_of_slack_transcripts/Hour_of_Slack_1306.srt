Chapter 5

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,640
Ye have heard that it hath been said,

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,840
Thou shalt hate the

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,360
SOUL GENIUS

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,720
Our own

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,120
Which will live

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,920
in infamy.

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,000
Last night Japanese forces

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,380
attacked the

10
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,760
SOUL GENIUS

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,500
Our own

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,540
I'm talking to you tonight

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,680
I'm talking to God

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,900
The Holy God

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,160
The Holy God

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,160
The Church

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,740
Praise God

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,840
Can I get a witness?

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,640
Can I get a praise?

20
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,480
시청 from ad rom

21
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,600
can I get an amen?

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,100
thank you children

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,720
thank you

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,060
thank you

25
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,460
thank you

26
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,820
some of you may not be familiar

27
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,140
with the church of the sub-jesus

28
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,780
some of you may not know the heart

29
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,780
of the sub-jesus

30
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,580
some of you may not know the purpose

31
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,680
the divine

32
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,000
the purpose of the church

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,520
the purpose of the church

34
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,960
the purpose of the church

35
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,700
is to have what?

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,160
slack

37
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,740
can I hear that again?

38
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,220
Can I get some slack?

39
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,620
Can I get some slack?

40
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,960
Can I get some slack?

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,100
Ah, Dr. Perkins.

42
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,620
Ah, yes.

43
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,840
I know the pipe to one is coming.

44
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,820
Your pants are on the floor.

45
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
And I don't mean Santa Claus.

46
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,460
Neither.

47
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,800
For as the new century approaches

48
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,600
and the great black slabs come down from space

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,360
and the piped one shall come

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,440
and he shall do battle with the horned one

51
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,200
and with the hoofed one

52
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,360
and with the car-driving one

53
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,680
and with the sleigh-riding one

54
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,440
and with the mailman

55
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,820
and the milkman

56
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,100
and with Dave

57
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,660
and he shall in the end triumph all.

58
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,080
Is he not the smoker?

59
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,380
Is he not Bob?

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,500
Dogs, yes.

61
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,840
He has come for you.

62
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,120
Where are we, Bob?

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,540
The code is broken.

64
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,400
Trouble?

65
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,040
Big.

66
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,000
Security?

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,240
I have the lid on tight.

68
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,900
Well, take it off for me.

69
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,100
The message is

70
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,160
Mars needs women.

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,000
Mars needs...

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,760
It's a gag.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
It's a prank.

74
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,500
It's a fake.

75
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,220
I don't think so, sir.

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,380
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing

77
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,960
I've ever heard on KFJZ

78
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,760
and since I've been listening to it.

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,060
But let's leave things of this world behind

80
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,620
and walk now down the path of Bob

81
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,560
for this brief minute of slack

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,140
from the Church of the Subgenius.

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,600
This is Reverend Ivan Stang

84
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,980
with the sorry truth.

85
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,880
Now, friend, look around you and face facts.

86
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,080
The world is composed mostly of jerks.

87
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,600
All kinds of ignorant,

88
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,420
dangerous, thoughtless louts

89
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,480
are in positions of power and influence

90
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,040
while some of the most deserving people you know

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,720
are slugging it out in a thankless cycle

92
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,620
of brain-breaking labor and mental paralysis.

93
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,620
Checks and balances?

94
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,020
What a joke.

95
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,720
Friend, if you want to get slack,

96
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,720
then you better uphold the Great Covenant, yes?

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,300
Before you were born,

98
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,920
you swore you'd help in the great battle against them.

99
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,080
That's right, them.

100
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,040
The normals, the mediocrities,

101
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,100
the Barbies and Kens,

102
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,980
the pink boys,

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
the somnambulites,

104
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,760
the Ks,

105
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,020
the stage men,

106
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000
the time servers,

107
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,520
the Philistines,

108
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,680
the witch-burners!

109
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Those who have made slack?

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,560
Taboo.

111
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
That's right, friend,

112
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,300
there's only two races in this world,

113
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,400
us and them.

114
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,120
Whose side are you on, eh?

115
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,120
Let there be slack.

116
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,860
Oh.

117
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,840
See www.subgenius.com

118
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,960
This is a very important statement.

119
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,780
I want you to hear it.

120
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,920
The internet made me so goofy and lethargic

121
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,600
where I couldn't think, I couldn't study,

122
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,760
I couldn't control any...

123
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,200
I was just like,

124
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,540
marriage.

125
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,400
Bad news.

126
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,880
If you were in here this morning

127
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,360
and you're dealing with the internet

128
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,540
and you're hiding it

129
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,300
and you think you're doing a good job of hiding it,

130
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,300
you're not hiding it from the Lord.

131
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,700
And it's corrupting you.

132
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
Well, no, I've got it under control.

133
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,620
Because Jesus said,

134
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,660
this is how you deal with it.

135
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,340
Fornication and pornography.

136
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,440
Yes.

137
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,800
Uncleanness and licentiousness.

138
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,600
Yes.

139
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,340
Gushing and there's sexual pus and junk all coming out of it.

140
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,480
That's his desire.

141
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,120
To be sexually boozed.

142
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,820
Oozing 24 hours a day,

143
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,240
seven days a week.

144
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,100
Licentiousness.

145
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,000
Just unbridled, uncontrolled sexual excesses.

146
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,260
That was something he invented.

147
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,300
Next is worshipping oozing sexual excesses.

148
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,120
Can you worship your brand new shiny sexual pus?

149
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,660
You bet!

150
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,240
Can you worship fornication?

151
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,900
Yes.

152
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,960
And in our society, how easy it is to worship pornography.

153
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,900
So much.

154
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

155
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

156
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,120
for psychiatry help?

157
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,220
Yes, it's an emergency.

158
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,100
Did anyone bring the...

159
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,600
Oh, you've got them.

160
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,160
Oh, wonderful.

161
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,700
Howdy, friends.

162
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,640
Well, we got the results

163
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,280
of the auction.

164
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,020
The results are

165
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,180
Ms. Miniver bought up

166
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,440
almost all of those

167
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,660
two big wagons, remember?

168
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,380
She bought them up

169
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,620
and now...

170
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,660
That was at the sheriff's auction.

171
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:41,800
That was at the sheriff's auction.

172
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,760
And now she wants to sell

173
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,140
the things that she got

174
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,200
because she got too many things.

175
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,160
So we're going to sell them

176
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,540
to you today.

177
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,240
Now, call in

178
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
if you want any of these items.

179
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,360
We'll work out the bidding later.

180
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,480
So let me just read them to you.

181
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,140
Give them a number, Clem.

182
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,820
Okay, now,

183
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,800
she's got there

184
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,760
some throat hoods.

185
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,380
Fancy plain or all white.

186
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,620
Now, if any of you

187
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,360
want any throat hoods,

188
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,940
they're going to go for

189
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,980
two and a quarter, I believe.

190
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,980
Now, there's long sweat hoods

191
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,040
and fancy plaid duck blankets

192
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,740
and running suits.

193
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,280
Thank you, Jesus.

194
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,920
Yes, sir.

195
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,560
She's also got a crate

196
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,220
of Dr. Rose's obesity powders,

197
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,580
some duck hats,

198
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,960
and a genuine

199
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,400
Humpty Dumpty folding egg crate.

200
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,440
Inside that

201
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,340
is a metallic hen's nest,

202
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,840
a folding egg tester,

203
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
and spring-level poultry punch.

204
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,740
Now, I know that

205
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,800
the poultry punches

206
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,580
that we've been getting recently

207
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,060
haven't been up to snuff.

208
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,540
And I know that

209
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,160
you hate to see your chickens cry.

210
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,740
Stop hitting those chickens.

211
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,380
So, let's try to use

212
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,460
these, I think this one

213
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,660
that Miss Hemiston has here

214
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,740
is going to be worth our while.

215
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,920
Now, she's also got

216
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,660
some dull finish gum hats.

217
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,020
Thank you, Jesus.

218
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,120
If you want them.

219
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,520
If you want them.

220
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:51,820
Amen.

221
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,300
If you want to have them,

222
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,080
all you can have

223
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,280
cream strangle food.

224
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,740
Cream strangle food.

225
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,240
It's killing.

226
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,420
Remember, it's killing.

227
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,360
And, of course,

228
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,300
men's dongala nullifiers

229
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,220
for sloughing around the house.

230
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,200
And I guarantee you,

231
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,960
if a dog,

232
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,740
if a dog gets his chompers

233
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,560
into a nullifier,

234
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,160
he will not,

235
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,720
I repeat,

236
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,780
he will not do it again.

237
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,860
Of course, if your foot

238
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,580
is in it at the time,

239
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,020
I can't guarantee

240
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,600
he won't be hurt.

241
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,760
But, that's the way it goes.

242
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,420
Now, we also have

243
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,620
some soft rubber urinal bags.

244
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,100
And Mrs. Hemiston tells me

245
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,840
that there is one toilet mask.

246
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,860
I don't know if you,

247
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,640
what you're going to do with it.

248
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,220
Yes, Mrs. Hemiston.

249
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,660
It might be hard

250
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,540
for her to part with this.

251
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,160
She might hold on

252
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,920
to this particular item.

253
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,780
But, now,

254
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,520
in the north part of the country,

255
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,500
around the Midden Hills,

256
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,880
I know that you men down there

257
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,060
need some tongue scrapers,

258
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,820
levelers, and ditchers.

259
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,360
Now, she's got tongue scrapers,

260
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,400
levelers, and ditchers.

261
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,100
And she's also got

262
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,440
a new improved Acme sweep grinder

263
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,540
and a model pee hauler.

264
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,420
So, come on down.

265
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,180
Pick up your right-hand-only

266
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,320
tongueless sulky plow.

267
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,120
Put it in your

268
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,860
boss gasoline peanut roaster.

269
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,580
Wear your star miner's lamp.

270
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,740
And pick up your

271
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,960
reliable worm cakes,

272
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,780
pleasant and effective,

273
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,200
with your manure

274
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,640
and potato hooks.

275
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,580
And sometimes,

276
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,200
when nothing's going right,

277
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,280
when our days are monotonous,

278
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,640
in a dream like before,

279
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,400
we go on our way

280
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,980
to Mar-a-Veur,

281
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,920
to Mar-a-Veur,

282
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,620
green like the sea,

283
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,980
as green as,

284
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,980
as green as,

285
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,260
and as blue as,

286
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,560
as green as,

287
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,320
and blue as,

288
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,340
as blue as,

289
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,580
and blue as,

290
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,280
and blue as,

291
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,460
as green as,

292
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,920
as green as,

293
00:08:47,920 --> 00:09:11,160
as green as,

294
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,600

you

304
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700

306
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:09,140
they got lots of slack come along you will see it's the place called the church

307
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,520
Watch off the sup, Jamie.

308
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,980
Yeah.

309
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,800
That's right, ladies.

310
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,200
You want to live forever, you've got to sleep with Bob.

311
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:29,880
But hey, after all, isn't there a little Bob in all of us?

312
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,480
The place called the Church of the Sub, Jeannie.

313
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,460
Bob.

314
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,000
Bob.

315
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,840
Bob.

316
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,540
Bob.

317
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,060
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends.

318
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,220
Right, Bob?

319
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,960
Bob.

320
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,920
Bob.

321
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,700
Bob.

322
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,080
Bob.

323
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,020
Oh, well.

324
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:36,200
Oh, yes, friends, and this is hour of slack number 1,306 thrown together in a hurry because of a day-long power outage.

325
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,400
Also, Reverend Sud's best out.

326
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,360
Yes, of course.

327
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,820
As always, we see one minute notice after another.

328
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,640
Then we offer to look at.

329
00:12:48,860 --> 00:13:00,180
��

330
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,280
Madness Motors by Reverend Taylor Jessen,

331
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,840
FiresignTheatre.com, and SealandRecords.com.

332
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,440
Those have proved most motivational, friends.

333
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,980
Just as Monty Python influenced many of today's satirists,

334
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,460
the Firesign Theatre is what most of us subgenius radio old-timers have in common.

335
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
We owe them much slack.

336
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,960
Anyway, what we heard, going backwards,

337
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,640
the last song was by Inviso Bob, whoever that is, from Bob Songs 5.

338
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,920
Before that, Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh diddling his old Fairlight in 1984.

339
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,880
Before that, Baby Stang and the late Dr. X,

340
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,460
Lamont Duvaux from Media Barrage 4.

341
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,920
The instrumental was Reverend Sodi from Music for Imaginary Monster Movies.

342
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,680
The catalog listing, including Dongala Nullifiers,

343
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,240
was Phil Proctor from Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour No. 1.

344
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,160
Lemur did the internet cut-up and the title.

345
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,200
The piped one, Cometh, was from an ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland in the 90s.

346
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,500
And at the top, we heard Pope David Meyer's very first sermon.

347
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:30,460
Now, a timely little Hitlerian piece from Firesign Theatre's Radio Hour Hour about Der Schnifter.

348
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,700
Germany, 1937.

349
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,480
Yeah, right.

350
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,520
Spätzl Fitz und Stimmen Salamander nicht gewachen.

351
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:37,880
Ja.

352
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,960
The Fuhrer is going blind.

353
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,600
Is this blood or urine in my spine?

354
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,220
His left eye is clouded by viscera.

355
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,920
What?

356
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,360
Listen, I heard this in Birkelschwagen.

357
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:49,860
Ja.

358
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,120
Fair little Stumpfer.

359
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,000
Birkelschwagen?

360
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,680
Birkelschwagen.

361
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,560
No, no Stumpfer in Birkelschwagen?

362
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,780
No, this is the Wagoneer Stumpfer.

363
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,740
He goes in and out.

364
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,780
Oh, the Wagoneer Stumpfer.

365
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,560
Yeah, from Brummswagen to Wessenbecken.

366
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,140
He goes back and forth, you mean?

367
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,460
No.

368
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,360
He just goes back.

369
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,700
Just wait until you meet him.

370
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,940
He's got a mule and it's turned around the wrong way.

371
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,300
He's a real stinker.

372
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,300
Dumb worker.

373
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,220
Why are you telling us what he was talking about?

374
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,320
Because he was spreading a rumor.

375
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,180
What are you from?

376
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,940
South Germany?

377
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,520
What is this?

378
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,300
And the rumor was all concerning the head man, Der Schnifter.

379
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,320
He said Der Schnifter.

380
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,780
Number eins.

381
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,860
The Schnifter is on little black pills.

382
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,300
That contains strychnine and atropine.

383
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,620
What do they do with him?

384
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,620
With him?

385
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
They wheel him around.

386
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,800
And all he can do is move his right, his left hand.

387
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,320
He can't ride with his right hand anymore.

388
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,180
And only he can...

389
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,040
Is he a little slapper or what?

390
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,060
Or he has only a mule to go back from one city to the other?

391
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,580
I'm just telling you what I heard, Hans.

392
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,520
You can make anything from it what you want.

393
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,800
.

394
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,380
.

395
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,140
.

396
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,160
.

397
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,180
.

398
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,640
.

399
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,320
.

400
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,320
.

401
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,320


402
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,660
.

403
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:23,800
.

404
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:23,900
.

405
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,520
.

406
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:26,540
.

407
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:26,700
.

408
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:26,720
.

409
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:26,820
.

410
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:26,900
.

411
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,080
.

412
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,080


413
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,140
.

414
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,180
.

415
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,180


416
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,180


417
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,260
.

418
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,640
I knew now that my every impulse was to kill Bob.

419
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,000
But I had thought of one idea.

420
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,460
It was worth a try.

421
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,280
If I tried to kill Bob, I had to act like the doll.

422
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,280
Anything was worth a try.

423
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,860
Act like the doll.

424
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,840
But I didn't dare act the doll.

425
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:55,740
Yes.

426
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,260
I had to act like the doll.

427
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,580
Yes, yes.

428
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,000
And I had to kill Bob.

429
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,380
Yes.

430
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,620
Yes.

431
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,900
I had to kill Bob.

432
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,420
Yes.

433
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,200
Kill Bob.

434
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:04,920
Yes.

435
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,700
Kill Bob.

436
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,560
Yes.

437
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,020
I had a chilling urge to get out of my clothes and get out fast.

438
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,620
Yes.

439
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:13,980
Yes.

440
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,100
It's true.

441
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:15,860
Yes.

442
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,040
It's all true.

443
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,440
Yes, I understand that.

444
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,160
I had to admit it.

445
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,780
Uh-huh.

446
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,620
And I live near San Francisco.

447
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,100
Yes, naturally.

448
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, I guess that about does it.

449
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,860
Goodbye.

450
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,360
With each invention of a better life,

451
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,200
a better kind of boat,

452
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,060
and a better kind of spear,

453
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,760
the pursuit of whales was carried further from shore.

454
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,740
When at last in the 1860s,

455
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,260
Svend Foyn perfected the harpoon with a bomb in its head,

456
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,640
he opened the last century of whaling.

457
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,480
Yay!

458
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,340
He patented his bomb on Christmas Eve

459
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,200
and wrote in his diary,

460
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,620
I thank ye.

461
00:19:59,620 --> 00:19:59,700
Ye.

462
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,100
Thee.

463
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,280
I thank thee.

464
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,200
Oh, Lord.

465
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,240
Is that a T there?

466
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,820
Let me see.

467
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,140
Lord.

468
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,660
Lord.

469
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,600
Thou alone hast done all.

470
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,860
Two L's in that.

471
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,200
Yeah.

472
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,660
All.

473
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,300
You're normally such a slacker.

474
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,200
It's the first time you've heard us.

475
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,020
Are all four of you guys in here?

476
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,660
Is Phil in there?

477
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,580
He just, yeah, yeah.

478
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,000
Can we?

479
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,220
Doing with four?

480
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,900
Yeah, all four.

481
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,420
Okay.

482
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:27,980
What are we doing?

483
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,380
How do we?

484
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,520
This is, this is.

485
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, yeah.

486
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,720
They'll do the comedy.

487
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,540
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave

488
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,400
of the Firesign Theater.

489
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,220
This is, okay.

490
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,220
This is Phil.

491
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,800
Phil.

492
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,340
Let's take it again.

493
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,720
Oh, Pete and Dave.

494
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,400
Okay, there we go, yeah.

495
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,560
All right, you over here?

496
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,560
You just shut up.

497
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,900
This is Phil.

498
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,160
Phil.

499
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,580
Pete.

500
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,980
And Dave of the Firesign Theater.

501
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,560
And we're listening to

502
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,140
The Hour of Slack.

503
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,560
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

504
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,220
Because we're subgeniuses.

505
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,520
And we're slacking off.

506
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,500
The Hour of Slack.

507
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:25,520
The Hour of Slack.

508
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,480
The Hour of Slack.

509
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,640
The way it all works in the universe.

510
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,760
The way it's all put together

511
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,360
in a special mathematical way

512
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,880
by who knows what all.

513
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,300
And no one can decode it,

514
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,200
but we can sure make it work our way

515
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,900
if we just, if we just cleave to Bob,

516
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,140
cleave to the words of Bob

517
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,260
and the foundation that's trying to help Bob

518
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,080
and his ministers.

519
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,100
You cannot help Bob

520
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,060
without helping the ministers of Bob.

521
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,900
Oh, my God.

522
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,440
Woo-hoo!

523
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,140
Praise!

524
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, Lord!

525
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,800
It feels all right.

526
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,420
Oh, yes.

527
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,840
Put your hands up.

528
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,440
Praise the Lord.

529
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,120
And friends, we got special fancy drop box weave

530
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,340

We only have a couple of minutes

540
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,860
before we have a station break,

541
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,360
so we've got to get the fashion show in.

542
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:55,680
Here.

543
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,860

It's very pretty, don't you think?

547
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,000
I think it's really, really one of the most attractive

548
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,280
models this year.

549
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,260
Very, very nice.

Great.

Oh, she's really...

Very pretty.

Very pretty.

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,220
Very pretty.

558
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,400
You see, removable.

559
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,320
That's removable.

560
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,560
She's taking it off now.

561
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,580
Ah.

562
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,020
Wonderful.

563
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,300

Very nice.

Very good.

569
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,800
She's lifting her arms now.

570
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,880
And she's flexing them.

571
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,580
Very good.

572
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,180
That's wonderful.

573
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,660
Very good.

574
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
My wife knew it, but the kids didn't.

575
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,420
Now.

576
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,260
I don't know if she's masculine.

577
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:55,600
You know.

578
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,640
Fred here is wearing running boots.

579
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,440
Oh, there he goes.

580
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,000
Well, they were very nice.

581
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,880
Very nice.

582
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,760
Very nice.

583
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,200
Very nice.

584
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,880
Very good.

585
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,860
The showing of grass suits will be delayed until after this message.

586
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,360
Oh.

587
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:22,220
This part of the Firesign Theater Radio Hour Hour is brought to you by Andy Chrysler Motors.

588
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,980
The makers.

589
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,460
The makers.

590
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:25,460


591
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,040
The makers of The Prince of Darkness.

592
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,340
New for Andy Chrysler Motors.

593
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,280
For 1970.

594
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,620
The Prince of Darkness.

595
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,320
Something to believe in.

596
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,120
So, do this.

597
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,380
The next time you go to your drug store, get an extra package of drugs.

598
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,660
Buy two packages instead of one.

599
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,780
Drugs offers extra effectiveness because it can give quick relief from that sparkling

600
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,760
effervescent headache.

601
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,760
Bob Drugs.

602
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,540
Listen.

603
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,460
I'm not a drug addict.

604
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:55,460


605
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:55,780
I'm a drug addict.

606
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,420
Well, now, there ain't no use talking about it, Grandpap.

607
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,400
I know he is coming here.

608
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,080
Bob.

609
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,980
Yes, sir, Bob.

610
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,340
That crazy fellow on the radio.

611
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,160
That's the one.

612
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,480
He ain't coming here.

613
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,780
He is, darn it.

614
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,500
How many times do I have to tell you?

615
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,020
See, he's gonna fly here.

616
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,940
Grubbing it out.

617
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,700
Sassy fresh.

618
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,520
Well, he is.

619
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,940
Sassy fresh.

620
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,580
Paid him good money, too.

621
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:15,880
I hear.

622
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,120
Doggy, don't you ever listen to nothing?

623
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,580
Well, what's he coming here for?

624
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,140
Well, that's the thing we don't know.

625
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,880
That's just about what I figured.

626
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,440
All we know is that it's a drug.

627
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,440


628
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,440


629
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,440


630
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,700
And that's something terribly important.

631
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,680
Oh, yeah.

632
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,820
I just bet it is.

633
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,180
The whole thing sounds like a pigeon-toed pipe dream to me.

634
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,420
I don't even believe there was any Mr. Ham-Pat here yesterday.

635
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,500
Well, all right, Doggy.

636
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,180
Just a second.

637
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,640
I'll put...

638
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,220
Wait a minute.

639
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,980
Here comes Lom.

640
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,600
He'll tell you.

641
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,660
Why would I want to believe him any more than you?

642
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,800
He's got bigger pipe dreams than you.

643
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,280
Oh.

644
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,660
Hey, Lom.

645
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,880
Come in here and tell this Grandpap.

646
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,780
The fact is he called up long distance on the telephone here yesterday.

647
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
Abner talked to him.

648
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,820
Heard his voice.

649
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,380
Yes, sir.

650
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,920
I'll believe it when I see it.

651
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,420
Not before I know it.

652
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,120
No, sir.

653
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,520
Not before I know it.

654
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:56,520


655
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:56,520


656
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:56,520


657
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,840
Not Milford Avery Spears.

658
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,400
No, sir.

659
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,100
E. Bob, sir.

660
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,460
No, sir.

661
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,060
Stubborn-headed old goat.

662
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,560
Look at him.

663
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,280
Two-pound package?

664
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,120
Well, now, you surely don't need that much.

665
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,660
Well, you can have that much if your conscience will let you.

666
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,440
You know what you're doing, though, don't you?

667
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,060
You're just taking that right out of the mouths of some young'uns.

668
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,580
It's fuss.

669
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,260
It's got plenty.

670
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,360
Don't hurry up and do something about this situation.

671
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,260
We're going to have an awful lot of deaths laid at our doorstep.

672
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
Somebody else is dying for a won't of it.

673
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,220
You know, that's a funny thing, Abner.

674
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,720
You take the generality run of women folks around here, and they're all anxious to do

675
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,100
what they can to help out, but there's always some amongst us that's got to be greedy.

676
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,860
Oh, yeah.

677
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,700
Oh, sir.

678
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,560
Doesn't want to have any slip-ups, you know.

679
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,780
Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

680
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,520
What I'm doing, you see.

681
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,880
She's been bed-ridden for a couple of months.

682
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,980
She just ain't doing no good at all.

683
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,380
Got the rheumatism.

684
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,000
Oh, she's feeling something wonderful.

685
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,020
Yeah, she's been on a funeral list for, oh, two months, and I know of.

686
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,160
That's all very interesting.

687
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,200
Yeah, she just loves it.

688
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,200


689
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,200


690
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,200


691
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,200


692
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,940
She loves to have somebody drop in on her.

693
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,220
That's fine.

694
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,440
Especially if they can entertain.

695
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,520
She loves entertaining.

696
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,360
Well, she does, doesn't she?

697
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,560
Yeah.

698
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,020
What did you say?

699
00:26:59,540 --> 00:26:59,880
Nothing.

700
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,840
Nothing at all.

701
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,640
Oh, that's all, brother.

702
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,100
That's all.

703
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,620
Do you mind if I use your telephone?

704
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,620
No, help yourself.

705
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,040
At least if I've got anything.

706
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,100
Oh, hello?

707
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,260
Listen, Bob.

708
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,040
I'm sorry to bother you, but I think you're crazy.

709
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,280
Yeah, but, but, but, Bob, I tell you.

710
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,060
Well, if it means that much to you, Bob, sure.

711
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,440
Okay.

712
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,980
I'll see you later.

713
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,440
Goodbye.

714
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,840
Well, is he coming or ain't he?

715
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,100
Yes, he's coming, and from the way he talks, it looks like he intends to get here if he

716
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,140
has to crawl all the way on his hands and knees.

717
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,940
I'm sure he's coming.

718
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,280
I'm sure he's coming.

719
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,740
I'm sure he's coming.

720
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,600
Bye.

721
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,300
Bye.

722
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,120
Bye.

723
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,080
Bye.

724
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,260
Bye.

725
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,700
Bye.

726
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,380
Bye.

727
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:43,880
Bye.

728
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,000


729
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,000


730
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,000


731
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,000


732
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,000


733
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,000


734
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
By the way, Bob, I swear to God you woke me up.

735
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000


736
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000


737
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000


738
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000


739
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000


740
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000


741
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000


742
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000


743
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000


744
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,320
Thanks, Bob.

745
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,340
Bye.

746
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:51,500
Bye.

747
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:51,640
Bye.

748
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:51,840
Bye.

749
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,000
Bye.

750
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,040
Bye.

751
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,040


752
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,040


753
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,380
Thank you.

754
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,040
Thank you.

755
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,760
Thank you.

756
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,620
Thank you.

757
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:56,660
Thank you.

758
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,120
Thank you.

759
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,120
Thank you.

760
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,220
Thank you.

761
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
You've got to have a

762
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,500
plane that will

763
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,020
be able to

764
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,000
build it when you destroy it.

765
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,320
Arriba!

766
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,240
Arriba!

767
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,520
Up up and away!

768
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,380
Arriba!

769
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:32,620


770
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,740
Arriba!

771
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,440
El Monte!

772
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,560
Hey, they know how to do things down there in a big way.

773
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,840
I'm very glad that the

774
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,000
Irish intellectuals took over

775
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,980
this country and were able

776
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,880
to effect a permanent revolution.

777
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,040
And a permanent

778
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,000
wave! That's right, a permanent wave

779
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,540
of revolution.

780
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,940
Pondre la vache! Permanent wave of revolution.

781
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,160
I think they invented

782
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,340
the whale scarer too.

783
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,840
That was a big help.

784
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,900
All them whales were swimming up the Gulf of California

785
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,400
but they got them scared away now.

786
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,800
Hey man, did you see someone else?

787
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,900
They ain't gotta go swim up into the Colorado River

788
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,180
no more. Is that the oil that they used to

789
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,300
keep the whales away from you?

790
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,400
They were bad for the whales?

791
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,020
That was about two inches high.

792
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,880
Was it lowered? Yeah man, it was

793
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,820
lowered so much, man, there wasn't

794
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,340
hardly nothing there no more.

795
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,640
They cut the seat, man. Yeah man.

796
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,320
They got furry deck. Yeah man. Oh, far out, man.

797
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,080
You know what I'm doing now? You got the cubes

798
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,920
that always read seven?

799
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,720
Cubans always read seven.

800
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,980
Buy yourself one whale of a

801
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,840
car, buddy, read the giant

802
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,800
ads. From stem to stern,

803
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,020
she's a flat 100 feet, ladylike

804
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,780
lines on a he-man hunk of gar.

805
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,140
Performance figures were generally sidestepped

806
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,720
but a number of three-color billboards and

807
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,520
full-page ads were headed, performance?

808
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,820
Ask the fella behind the wheel!

809
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,460
And featured an apparently authentic

810
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,000
testimonial, one of the Indianapolis speed kings

811
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,800
behind the wheel of the mammoth convertible.

812
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,060
A larger than average man, he was incredibly

813
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,000
dwarfed by the immense dimensions of the

814
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
car. His tiny face, just

815
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,820
visible at the top of the wheel, was

816
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,280
split in a grin of insanity,

817
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,160
like a toothpaste ad, a madman's

818
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,900
laugh frozen at the nightmare peak

819
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,840
of hilarity, and it was captioned,

820
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,020
Getting the feel of this big

821
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,800
baby has been one real thrill,

822
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
believe you me. Despite

823
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,900
their roominess, power, and road-holding potential,

824
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
the big cars did prove impractical in the city

825
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,880
because their turning arc, for the

826
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,920
ordinary 90% change of direction, was

827
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,840
greater than the distance between the street-angle

828
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,980
buildings, so that by 5.30, all

829
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,780
four of the sleek red devils

830
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,940
and devil rockets were wedged at

831
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,880
angles across various intersections around

832
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Columbus Circle, each a barrier to

833
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,960
thoroughfare in four directions, and causing

834
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,940
quite a snarl indeed until cranes and

835
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,700
derricks could be brought from the East River.

836
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,600
Thanks to Firesign Theatre for that.

837
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,360
The instrumental before that was

838
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,140
The Psychoskeletons featuring

839
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,440
Reverend Basil Story. The old

840
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,020
Lum and Abner show with Bob was

841
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,340
found by Reverend Smelly Bacon.

842
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,160
Firesign did the fashion show

843
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,620
and the harpoon with the exploding

844
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,260
head, Faster Love from The Large.

845
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,760
I Had to Kill Bob was from

846
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,020
Le Mer, and the song Be Over

847
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,020


848
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,020


849
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,020


850
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,880
Be is by Uncle Reverend

851
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,120
Dr. Onan Canobite, and that's

852
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,900
just part one. Now

853
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,820
let's go back in time to an old

854
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,860
WCSB broadcast with me

855
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,100
reading What Is Dobstown

856
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,720
by Reverend New Monet

857
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,780
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

858
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,560
reading between the lines.

859
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,800
What is Dobstown?

860
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,120
What is, then,

861
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,860
Dobstown?

862
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,820
It is the stuff that

863
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,540
dreams are made of.

864
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,120
It's what makes Tinkerbell

865
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,060
and the Lost Boys fly.

866
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,960
It powers the

867
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,460
Starship Enterprise.

868
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,700
It's the hidden

869
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,900
code in Windows and Mac

870
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,980
OS, though not yet available in

871
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,800
Linux. It's the general

872
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,780
oblivion, crazy when the moon dance

873
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,660
strikes the cornea of your head.

874
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,760
Dobstown. It's the

875
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,940
cancer-causing, teeth-staining,

876
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,980
smelly, pukey habit.

877
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,020
It's the drug that helps you find

878
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,940
God. It's the lonely

879
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,120
night before that never, never ends.

880
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,880
Dobstown.

881
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,000
It is your brain

882
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,260
on drugs.

883
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,980
It's learning to work as a team and as

884
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,960
a slave. It's where there is a

885
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,660
lake in which resides the sword

886
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,520
Excalibur kept by

887
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,000
the Lady of the Lake, Connie Dobbs.

888
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,060
And if you think it's hard to pull

889
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,860
that stone from out of that sword

890
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,760
out of that lake, it's easy to pull a

891
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,300
fig from a donkey's anus.

892
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,820
Dobstown. It is where all

893
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,440
the flowers have gone.

894
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,740
It is the home of

895
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,780
John Dillinger's real penis.

896
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,740
Dobstown. It is a mystery, wrapped

897
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,700
in an enigma, smothered with

898
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,800
sautéed mushrooms and onions in a savory

899
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,020
gravy. Dobstown.

900
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,120
It is John Dillinger's

901
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,960
penis, savaged

902
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,840
in muscular gravy and surrounded

903
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,420
by mushroom people.

904
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,840
Dobstown.

905
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,980
The home of both Lemurians

906
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,340
and Cenobites.

907
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,740
My proper home. I'm going

908
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,880
back someday. I've got

909
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,520
to get back to my home.

910
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,920
Dobstown.

911
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,860
It's near the coast

912
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,540
of Hanalei and

913
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,400
the land of Fredonia.

914
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,420
Dobstown.

915
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,800
It's the world's largest producer

916
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,620
of manna, ambrosia,

917
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,440
frap, and the green stuff

918
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,240
that Dave injects into the brain

919
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,260
to reanimate dead tissue.

920
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,460
Spiritual bliss with open

921
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,320
lame burly every night from

922
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,400
midnight to dawn.

923
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,060
Dobstown.

924
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,860
It's the residence

925
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,420
of J.R. Bob Dobbs, part

926
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,300
of the year. It's creamy

927
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,440
and crunchy. It tastes great and

928
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,660
is less filling. It is margarine

929
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,120
and it is butter.

930
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,400
But if it were to fall into enemy

931
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,060
hands, it would mean the destruction

932
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,160
of us all.

933
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,760
Ah yes, dang, but

934
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,220
it is the downfall of us all.

935
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,380
And it tastes bad on bread

936
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,460
because man, those that

937
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,740
go don't come back.

938
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,980
They're losers. Losers.

939
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,320
No man, those who graduate from

940
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,240
Dobstown come back changed.

941
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,040
In a new form.

942
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,500
You can't see them like

943
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,360
you can see others. They don't move

944
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,120
or talk. Graduated like the chrysalis

945
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,660
to the elf, all the way up

946
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,720
to a higher being.

947
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,340
They grow and grow.

948
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,540
Their tiny skin's hardly large

949
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,420
enough to pop them as they begin

950
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,580
expanding into that

951
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,380
new form.

952
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,720
Dobstown!

953
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,540
It's where

954
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,700
UFOs are not just

955
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,360
a fact of life. They're the law.

956
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,700
Of course it's a law

957
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,400
here. Of course it's a law.

958
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,480
Everyone needs to

959
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,620
live by laws, by rules.

960
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,920
We need to have our

961
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,380
lives doubled by...

962
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,760
Dobstown!

963
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,440
It's where the bad little

964
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,160
girls and boys go.

965
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,240
It's where something is happening

966
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,880
all the time, and most of it

967
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,300
unsolved.

968
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,900
Some of it

969
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,040
is so hard to locate.

970
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,200
Many of the people from the

971
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,340
Saucer Ship Emblem itself have been

972
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,160
sucked out and left here.

973
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,540
Dobstown.

974
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,220
I didn't

975
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,800
want them to be oblique.

976
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,900
I was trapped there down in a chair

977
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,180
and started asking me questions about

978
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,920
Dobstown.

979
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,240
I gave them literally

980
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,380
the location of the

981
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,200
website.

982
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,600
Dobstown.

983
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,300
It's Nwatsbod spelled backwards.

984
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,340
It's Brigadoon without the haggis.

985
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,500
It is surrounded by the seven cities

986
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,780
of Cibola, which are its slums.

987
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,040
And it has a ferry

988
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,320
to Monster Island.

989
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,840
And what a delightful

990
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,340
view of individuals you'll never

991
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,260
find there.

992
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,040
The ferries of Monster Island.

993
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,160
Tiny little happy people

994
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,540
who do things for other people.

995
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,600
Who live for other people.

996
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,200
So big are their hearts

997
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,040
and so tiny is their stature.

998
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,220
They...

999
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,680
Dobstown!

1000
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,380
That's where Amelia Earhart

1001
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,180
crashed, friends. It's where the

1002
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,280
Tunguska meteorite came out

1003
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,400
after bouncing around inside the earth for a while.

1004
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,600
Yes, she

1005
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:47,820
said,

1006
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,140
Bob Dobbs,

1007
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,980
the young

1008
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,300
ten-year-old J.R. Bob Dobbs

1009
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:03,700
from his slingshot

1010
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,740
was once a

1011
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:12,920
sling shot

1012
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,220
by a

1013
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:13,680
young

1014
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,860
ten-year-old

1015
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,820
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1016
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,180
And that was

1017
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,180


1018
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,480
shot by

1019
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:17,600
the

1020
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,720
In a fit of rage?

1021
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,740
No, he didn't even know he was doing it.

1022
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,560
It was just, you know, I mean, he picked up a...

1023
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,460
Other kids might pick up a pebble or a cat skull for their slingshot.

1024
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,120
Yeah, a cat skull, that makes a lot more sense.

1025
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,000
A tiny black hole, a singularity.

1026
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,500
A singularity.

1027
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,540
A glowing essence of nothingness sucking in all that is not Bob.

1028
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,980
And that is what he shot into the Tunguska plains of Siberia.

1029
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,700
And then past the event horizon, the little thing itself went and then became like a bigger thing?

1030
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:59,200
And it went into the earth, Bob's tiny black hole did, and it bounced around like a cue ball on a pool table.

1031
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,960
Back and forth until finally it exited at the place we now know as Dogstown.

1032
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,360
Dogstown, friends.

1033
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,660
It is where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while.

1034
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,460
It's where you are better than you were in high school.

1035
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,580
It's where you get all the pets you ever wanted.

1036
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,680
It was never a colony of France.

1037
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,280
It is where science and magic are the same things.

1038
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,400
It is the unfolding of miscalculations.

1039
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,900
It is the dawning of the height, weight, hair, and eye color of Aquarius.

1040
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,580
It is the fizzling, crackling...

1041
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,340
It is the dissonant fifth vortex disrupting the harmonic...

1042
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,320
It is the divergence.

1043
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,280
It is where the early worm gets away.

1044
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,080
It is where the grave-dickers leave their shoes in the middle of the night.

1045
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:56,780
Dogstown!

1046
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,880
It is for when you're too lazy to kill yourself.

1047
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,220
Dogstown!

1048
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,180
Where there are no lawyers and where the government never tries to be helpful.

1049
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,120
Dogstown, friends.

1050
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,540
It is where you can make your imaginary friends fight to the death.

1051
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,880
Dogstown!

1052
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,940
It's between the dark and daylight.

1053
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,460
When the night is beginning to lower.

1054
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,080
It is where neither heredity nor environment matter.

1055
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:33,180
It is where the lamb and the lion lay down and have sex together, friends.

1056
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,540
Dogstown!

1057
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:43,660
It is proof that hell is full and the dead walked.

1058
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,940
It is where the earth is.

1059
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,160
The fabric is what created.

1060
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,840
Like yourself, what created backed you to thousands of other threads.

1061
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:11,080
That is our caustic solution for you as members of this solemn group gathered together, squandered and quashed and pushed under heavy stone so that you may not know the truth that we speak.

1062
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,260
And yet here we are, speaking it to you.

1063
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:27,000
Dogstown is not a place where a man or woman dwells, but a place in the heart as big as that mighty elephant yoke and twice as tasty as all the trees that you could imagine.

1064
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,120
Now, imagination is not a place you want to stay.

1065
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,980
It's not a place you want to bring the kids, grandma, ride the ferris wheel with.

1066
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,640
It's not the kind of place you want to leave for a better home.

1067
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,520
It's a place you visit over and over again.

1068
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:50,900
With your pants on, your pants off, and your heart ripped right out, hanging from your chest.

1069
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:54,940
Dogstown.

1070
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:01,540
Where Bob comes home after an easy day's work.

1071
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,480
And where you can come home too, friends.

1072
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,680
Where you'll be home!

1073
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,360
Where you'll finally realize why.

1074
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,080
Why.

1075
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,280
Why.

1076
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,100
And why.

1077
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,320
And why you can find out more about beautiful Dogstown when you join the Church of the Subgenius.

1078
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:28,400
The world's only first, true, last, final, one, true religion.

1079
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,980
Because it admits it is full of crap.

1080
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,140
It is the only one that's not full of crap!

1081
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,300
I can try to end age.

1082
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,960
I know it's coming each time.

1083
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,800
I can tell it.

1084
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,780
You tell it.

1085
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,820
Used customers say each time.

1086
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,280
You're complete garbage too!

1087
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,040
Now you are!

1088
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:00,820
Zero waste kunneЕ

1089
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,660
word-for-word to me.

1090
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


1091
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,140
Can you really get me any if you get negócio this much.

1092
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,360
But why it can she meet.

1093
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,380
I can't go on.

1094
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,780
Excuse me.

1095
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:17,860
creature stomps its feet and paws at the ground. Dobbs grins. He smokes. The creature charges.

1096
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:25,380
Dobbs whips out his pipe and gives it a little conk on the noggin as it runs by. And after that,

1097
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,540
it sits and pants like a little puppy dog.

1098
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,960
Oh, use me, Jesus. Use me. Before the antichrist, the mark of the beast takes over.

1099
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,260
Save that soul close to hell. Fail believers with the Holy Ghost and fire.

1100
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,460
That one is sick. I command that blindness, deafness, sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure,

1101
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,520
stroke, cancer, arthritis, hemorrhoids, every disease to come out, body, coat, the pits,

1102
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,000
whip, lung, jeez, and stain. I say in the name of Jesus Christ, rise up and walk.

1103
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:04,080
God put money in that empty purse. Don't ever let it be broke again. That one again,

1104
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,200
my ministry today, God, I'm going to command on Isaiah 45, 11, give it back to him.

1105
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,360
104, bless the home.

1106
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,040
The farms, the cattle, everything they're hanging, try to take the touch, let it be blessed.

1107
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,660
I felt the warmth of Jesus.

1108
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:22,100
Yes, I want to heal this old Lord. Yes, I'm healed. Oh, yes.

1109
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,060
You know you're healed.

1110
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,080
Oh, I better. It feels better. Yes, Jesus.

1111
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:34,240
Well, that's about it for another happy, friendly flumeroo here on the thin,

1112
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,060
thin, thinning.

1113
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,080
Sure has been wonderful just sitting around and scoring the old tunes.

1114
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,120
The tunes of the tunes at the top of the box.

1115
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,640
Limbing the flam and making a custard out of your mind.

1116
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,160
Yes, yes. The last stand of the last band.

1117
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,920
Yeah. Yeah, well, it's a fine time. It's a swell time for all that.

1118
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,220
But it's time to go.

1119
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,200
Is it time to go?

1120
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,000
Can I tell a band story before we go?

1121
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:57,280
Sure.

1122
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,860
A band, so wait a minute. Is a band on this radio station?

1123
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,100
No, no, a band, not a radio band, but a band that played in the 40s.

1124
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,380
Oh, I dig. I'm happy to hear John.

1125
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,500
Yeah.

1126
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,740
If you're not, I'll break a record over your head.

1127
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,240
All right.

1128
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:09,680
78.

1129
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:09,940
78.

1130
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,560
I'll break really good.

1131
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:10,960
Yeah.

1132
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,260
Okay.

1133
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,020
Okay.

1134
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,180
They used to take a lot of pills sometimes.

1135
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,840
And it kept them up late at night.

1136
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,640
Solid.

1137
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,720
You're talking about those mean little whites.

1138
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,660
Oh, right.

1139
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,320
Yeah.

1140
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,340
And the blacks were there, too, man.

1141
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,060
Everybody was there.

1142
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,980
It was a real show.

1143
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,900
It was together, man.

1144
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,500
Just little guys.

1145
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,400
Vicky had a very good time.

1146
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,480
Had a nice lunch on the beach with a nice can of Coors beer.

1147
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,420
Best time I ever had in 1960.

1148
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,340
Thanks a little.

1149
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,720
Stop that harmonica.

1150
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,740
September 6th.

1151
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,420
I went to the beach.

1152
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:40,860
It's a famous look.

1153
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,100
Yeah.

1154
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,440
Also available by the Fireside Theater Radio,

1155
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,980
Hour Hour, are two record albums that they made on Columbia Records.

1156
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,320
One of them produced by Cyrus, who's here today with us today.

1157
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,640
Brother Cyrus.

1158
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,040
And it's a pleasure to see them with his head back on.

1159
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:04,840
Yes, that's gold.

1160
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,520
His head was over to one side, but now it's back in place.

1161
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:08,640
It's well now.

1162
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,620
He gave us his watch.

1163
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,820
Thank you, Jesus, for giving us his watch.

1164
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,500
He can talk again.

1165
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,900
Listen to him.

1166
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,200
He can talk again.

1167
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,800
But you're losing your voice, brother.

1168
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,420
He can talk again.

1169
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,680
Kneel in front of the altar.

1170
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,260
Praise the Lord.

1171
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,420
Praise the Lord.

1172
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,500
My voice is going out, too.

1173
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,380
Thank you, Jesus, for giving me this sore throat.

1174
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,200
Thank you, Jesus, I know that I'll be able to carry on your radio ministry.

1175
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,860
Thank you, Jesus, for giving me this deep sleep.

1176
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,860
Thank you, Jesus, for all the affection you've given me.

1177
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:37,860
Thank you, Jesus.

1178
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,440
And that I know.

1179
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,020
Take it.

1180
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:39,460
There, there.

1181
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,140
Take it.

1182
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,460
Then it's going to be better some day.

1183
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,340
Thank you, Jesus.

1184
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,620
Thank you, Jesus.

1185
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,620
Why is everybody left in a chair?

1186
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,240
Here's Mishman.

1187
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,480
Oh, you're here, too?

1188
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:47,880
Here's Mishman.

1189
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:48,960
Oh, boy.

1190
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,000
I'll follow you anyway.

1191
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,660
Oh, I'm Jesus.

1192
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,200
Into the joys of heaven.

1193
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,020
This is the coming of Jesus.

1194
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,880
I'm coming, too.

1195
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:56,820
Are you really?

1196
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,060
I'm coming, too.

1197
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,840
I'm coming, too.

1198
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,680
We're coming together.

1199
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:01,580
Oh, boy.

1200
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,400
Oh, sweet Mishman.

1201
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,120
This is living.

1202
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,680
This is religion.

1203
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,360
Oh, Jesus.

1204
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,640
Thank you, Jesus.

1205
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,600
Oh, my boy.

1206
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:09,600


1207
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,420
Joyce is back now.

1208
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,560
What happens in those moments of religious ecstasy, folks?

1209
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,740
None of us knows here in the radio ministry.

1210
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:18,800
It passeth understanding.

1211
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,360
It passeth belief.

1212
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,520
Memory.

1213
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,320
Sure is nice.

1214
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,540
That's what I got to say.

1215
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,320
Thank you, Jesus.

1216
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,720
Going to be all right.

1217
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,400
Turkish peasants say the flu sweeping Europe and the Middle East is lunar flu brought from

1218
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,540
the moon by U.S. astronauts.

1219
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,040
Clock, clock, clock, clock, clock.

1220
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:38,620
News Radio.

1221
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,980
I'm torching nearly every county of the state.

1222
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:41,520
I'm vicious.

1223
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,280
Fox News.

1224
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,060
Detained.

1225
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,880
Bank burned down.

1226
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,960
All journalists, including Americans.

1227
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,580
Two photojournalists were killed covering Texas.

1228
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,040
We deeply regret the loss of all life.

1229
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:52,900
Fox News.

1230
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:53,480
You report.

1231
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,000
We decide.

1232
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,660
You can do incredible tricks automatically.

1233
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,940
Specially designed.

1234
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,460
Bob's wife, Connie, and the conspiracy.

1235
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,440
There's obviously a connection there.

1236
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,020
You seem to have penetrated a simple analog in the allegory.

1237
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,920
There's no doubt.

1238
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,140
There's no doubt.

1239
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:08,600
There's no doubt.

1240
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,600


1241
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,600


1242
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,600


1243
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,600


1244
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,600


1245
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,600


1246
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,600


1247
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:13,000
What you're saying is that the words Khan and Connie and the Khan and conspiracy all are

1248
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,200
composed of the very same letters of the alphabet.

1249
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,680
You see, it is necessary for the subgenius to embrace the conspiracy and even to have

1250
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:28,860
carnal relations with the conspiracies to a certain degree only in the interest of avoiding

1251
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,180
it eventually and finding slack.

1252
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,800
We hate to do it, but carnal relations are carnal relations.

1253
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,400
Somewhere slack has to be.

1254
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,700
where you find them.

1255
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,400
And what about the rest of the world?

1256
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,560
I don't care about them.

1257
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,860
We don't care about them.

1258
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,920
We want them to care about themselves.

1259
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,180
And then through caring about themselves,

1260
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,720
they can care about us.

1261
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,020
True subgeniuses.

1262
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,120
Well, they have plenty of things to care about.

1263
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,400
We know that everyone

1264
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,760
must love themselves

1265
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,040
before they can love another person.

1266
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,900
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1267
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,760
You know, the ones who

1268
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,340
buy lots of stuff.

1269
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,840
Well, you can do that, too.

1270
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,580
If they buy what they want, that's the important thing.

1271
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,380
You're talking about prosumers who are professional buyers.

1272
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,160
Just like Homer Simpson says,

1273
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,060
Donuts of the world beware,

1274
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,320
it's judgment day.

1275
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:20,900
Yeah.

1276
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,120
He didn't say that.

1277
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,460
Wait a minute, he didn't?

1278
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,420
Well, it says that right here in the script.

1279
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,280
Are you one to challenge the script writer?

1280
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:28,900
No.

1281
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,360
That's been done before, and those people aren't around anymore.

1282
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,700
If you know what I mean.

1283
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,080
Also,

1284
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:38,420
we,

1285
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,500
we had an anonymous message

1286
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,680
that some callers were going to come down,

1287
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,940
and I guess they're here now.

1288
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,620
We're going to interview these folks

1289
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,600
right here on the air.

1290
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,840
As soon as we get them to come in.

1291
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,400
Sure, when you're a big kid, you can drive,

1292
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,380
you can come down to the show.

1293
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,820
I've heard that if you have at least three shows

1294
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,280
on your hard drive, your computer will run faster.

1295
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,360
Now the ball gags are placed.

1296
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,700
If you've downloaded at least three shows

1297
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,160
from

1298
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,340
one server,

1299
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,300
you can get a free copy of the show.

1300
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,100
I like to just say

1301
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,920
quiveringbrain.com

1302
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,160
If you go to

in Isaiah 1, 17, 6.

1344
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,340

1346
