valores

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,660
Hey, come on. Welcome to slack, slack, slack, slack. Welcome to traditional slack.

18
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,480
You've tried almost everything and still no relief?

19
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,260
Try the self-genius power of swag.

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,420
It dissolves completely in beverages and is completely tasteless.

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,680
Welcome to slack, slack, slack, slack.

22
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,640
Welcome to slack, slack, slack, slack.

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,640
Everything that I can.

24
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,340
Actually, that wasn't George Bush. That was Mr. Sister.

25
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,160
Friends, this is a bad week for a funny show.

26
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,540
Although, you know, Bob's prophecy does ring true.

27
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,760
Back in the 60s, he said, and I quote, Bob said,

28
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,640
It's gonna be a bummer, man.

29
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,420
Now, is that prophetic truth?

30
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,940
Or what?

31
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm not much of a believer, friends.

32
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,840
I don't believe in invisible monsters.

33
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,760
Because they told me not to believe in them.

34
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,160
But this last weekend, I found myself praying, nonetheless.

35
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,940
The United States government presents...

36
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
This is our enemy.

37
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,420
Hello, Riley. Thanks for watching.

38
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,440
I knew it. I knew it.

39
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,480
Clowns.

40
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,560
Jesus might not be...

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
Down with Reverend Pat Robertson.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
I mean, it's just insane.

43
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,900
Off the wall.

44
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,660
I don't know anything.

45
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,620
Off the wall.

46
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,000
Crazy propaganda.

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,420
Off the wall.

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,080
The Joseph Goebbels Network.

49
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:33,860
Off the wall.

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,180
Someone who rejects facts.

51
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,580
Holds on to opinions no matter what.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,720
700 Club.

53
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,080
A neurosis.

54
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,940
The documentary out of the box tells the truth about this network.

55
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,940
Gays and abortionists cause God to allow 9-11.

56
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,460
Child sex offenders should not serve long prison terms.

57
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,080
Philosophy of the Third Reich is okay.

58
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,340
Are you okay with slaughtering civilians?

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight.

60
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,300
Are you okay with slaughtering civilians?

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,240
It's gonna be a bummer, man.

62
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,440
We're awaiting Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Princess Wee both to arrive.

63
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,900
But in the mean...

64
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,940
And I may have to run down there and let them in.

65
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,840
In the meantime, music.

66
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,280
You were all the rays of sunlight

67
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,800
Shining gold to me

68
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,020
Every color of a rainbow

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,600
I was blessed by her decree

70
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
You were every moment's magic

71
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,460
Joy beyond compare

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,860
You were all the rays of sunlight

73
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,560
You were all the rays of sunlight

74
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,400
I was lost without a care

75
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,340
Victims of the fury

76
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,180
Shadows in the dark

77
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
Victims of the fury

78
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,380
It was found among

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,180
So we lived our days in rapture

80
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,060
Like the sun in the sky

81
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,060


82
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,060


83
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,500
Like the world could never end

84
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,740
We went thinking about the future

85
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,300
We had time enough to spend

86
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,360
We were blessed as though in heaven

87
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,040
We were messengers of joy

88
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,740
There were angels all around us

89
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,760
There was none who dared destroy

90
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,800
Victims of the fury

91
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,040
Joy beyond compare

92
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,040


93
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,580
We've become all together

94
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,140
Unballed inness

95
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,420
I walked to glory

96
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,520
We were the red-and- pieced

97
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:08,700
While she had her wedding comb

98
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:08,700


99
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm dying as the sun

100
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,040
You will be as bright as ever

101
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,040


102
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,340
And when things get darker

103
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,340


104
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,340


105
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,360
We're noticed by love

106
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,600
But debates are all paid

107
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,660
uration

108
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:13,660


109
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,160
Will be like this

110
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,880
It's all part of the game

111
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,540
It's time to throw Since I massive prison

112
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,000
Into today's world

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,640
The world collapsed around us

114
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,020
And the archers found their mark

115
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,680
We were victims of the fury

116
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,580
We were shadows in the dark

117
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,300
Victims of the fury

118
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,540
Shadows in the dark

119
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,120
Victims of the fury

120
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,700
And was found their mark

121
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,740
guitar solo

122
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,480
Victims of the fury

123
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,460
Shadows in the dark

124
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,300
Victims of the fury

125
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,820
And was found their mark

126
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,180
guitar solo

127
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,680
Look at him now!

128
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,940
Here he comes!

guitar solo

130
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Mom, mom, the atomic bomb

131
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,780
Just went off

132
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,980
Out of my house!

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm the Haley Law

134
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,900
Paul wears Paul

135
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,400
Now what'll we do?

136
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,580
That ball, the root cellar

137
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm right behind you

138
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,200
And the wind took

139
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,680
The ground shook

140
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,260
And me and my baby

141
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,920
Trained in one last look

142
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,480
The heavens, the wall

143
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,060
Pushed, caused to shove

144
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,540
There ain't no escaping

145
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,960
The tornado of love

00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:23,000


148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,200
And we

149
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,200


150
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,200


151
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,200


152
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,200

You gotta thank for older men

156
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,980
Are you too good for your own kin?

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,620
Oh yeah

161
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,900
Well twist, twist, twist

Led Long John's for a cold, cold winter

170
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,600
Then we saw the outhouse littered out there

171
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,000
Said Paul with his overalls deep

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,160
His Sears catalog and his roller in the east

173
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,140
And the wind took the ground shook

174
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,400
And me and my baby traded one last look

175
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,500
The heavens, the walls were in constant dub

176
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,920
Ain't no state

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,440
But the tornado of love

178
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,640
The wind took the ground shook

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,900
Then we have a chance

195
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:46,900


196
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,400
Kisly

197
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,640
How much of a chance doctor?

198
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,280
Mixed voice

199
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,020
Kisly

200
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,440
Roundhouse

201
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,040
roundhouse

202
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,240
Cheese

203
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,420

205
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,300

206
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,300


207
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,460

208
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,980

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,460

213
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:04,880

215
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:09,600


216
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:09,600


217
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:09,600

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:09,600

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:09,600

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,100

221
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100


222
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100


223
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100


230
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100


231
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,320
live

232
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


233
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,880
hop

234
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,220
hop

235
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,940

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:11,700

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,020

238
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,260

239
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,960
Here at the gram

240
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,660
Early Shaw

241
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,660
They say, take Najaf, put a cordon around it, cut off the electricity, cut off the water.

242
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:26,880
The sweltering summer is coming, and you send leaflets to those people, say, give us, give us the mullah and his followers,

243
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,300
and you will have all your services restored.

244
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,440
And unless you do, it's going to be a long, hot summer.

245
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,940
And if we deal with it forcefully in terms of pollution, go in there and do Najaf with those ex-baptists.

246
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:47,720
They are terrorists who've got one thing in mind, to destroy the democracy of Iraq and to kill our soldiers.

247
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:54,360
That was, I just quoted to you, the words of the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ.

248
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,640
Mother, you are a fucking moron.

249
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,040
Do we retain our knowledge?

250
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,660
No, Dr. Zarkov.

251
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,840
There is an eraser ray that...

252
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,900
It follows the recorder ray as it passes over every inch of your brain.

253
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,180
Zadarin, listen, you can't do this.

254
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,380
Between us, we hold the knowledge upon which the safety of the entire galaxy depends.

255
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,020
Exactly the information I want, every morsel of it.

256
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,900
The galaxy, what do I care for its safety?

257
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,200
All I want is the power to make every living human bend to my will.

258
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,360
Start the ray flow.

259
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
I want the...

260
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,420
I want the...

261
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,120
I want the...

262
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,080
From PR News in Washington, I'm lit up and continue to deteriorate.

263
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,240
An immigration judge in El Paso, Texas, should be denied asylum in the United States.

264
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,380
Louisiana State Senator Walter Boasso says...

265
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,240
Rose, Rose, uh, Rose, Rose.

266
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,960
We know that.

267
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,540
Wall Street 7-7.

268
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,640
A white spokesman says President Bush is being kept informed about the damage from PR News in Washington.

269
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,160
And God...

270
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,360
We know that.

271
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:50,880
We know that.

272
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,900
And blood's thicker than water

273
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,740
The thin and cold in the flood

274
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,780
The mud and the gild and the gun get heavy

275
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,660
We do what we gotta

276
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,680
We want the living

277
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,400
Now I'm just a man protecting his home

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Why do I feel like a dog out killing his own?

279
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,580
Is he on the ticket?

280
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,420
Quick on the draw

281
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,540
Shine the flashlight in the face

282
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,280
Of a 12-year-old kid that started crying for his pa

283
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,020
I told him to get on with it

284
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,040
From PR News in Washington, I'm tired of PR News.

285
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,680
Osama bin Laden's sales plunged 13%.

286
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,340
His staff is going through the steps to take care of the dead bodies outside.

287
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,060
We're out all day today to come.

288
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,020
It's under control.

289
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,600
Human rights groups carried out the first execution since 2003

290
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,180
on Wall Street 210-491732.

291
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,660
President Bush...

292
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,520
President Bush will get a first-hand look at 1,400 National Guard troops per day.

293
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,640
Of particular concern is PR News, Washington.

294
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,280
How large the dreaded Gila monster grows, no man can say.

295
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,840
2,000 dead now.

296
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,640
As opposed to just wounded for a day or two.

297
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,260
Pull out.

298
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,040
The people have absolutely no hope.

299
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,580
The people have absolutely no hope.

300
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,260
President's failure to articulate.

301
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,100
President's failure to articulate.

302
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,080
Immediate pull out.

303
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,820
Immediate pull out.

304
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,140
Pull out.

305
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,040
So let me ask, so let me ask, so let me ask the pull-out experts.

306
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
The pull-out experts.

307
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,960
We're pulling out tomorrow.

308
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,900
We're pulling out tomorrow.

309
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,680
We begin to pull out next year, we begin to pull out in three or four years.

310
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,440
Pull out now.

311
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,380
Pull out now.

312
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,680
We're not achieving anything.

313
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,120
Wave that Vietnam flag again.

314
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,560
Wave that Vietnam flag again.

315
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,780
Beat on the Vietnam drum.

316
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,100
Pull out, pull out, pull out.

317
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,300
People getting killed. Our guys.

318
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,420
Us killing them.

319
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,600
People getting killed. Our guys.

320
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,660
Us killing them.

321
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,480
Enough already.

322
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,860
Sewage probably is some political coloration.

323
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,100
President is off the mark here.

324
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,660
Wrong.

325
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,000
Wrong.

326
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,860
It's just stupid and it's not working.

327
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,420
It's just stupid and it's not working.

328
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,600
Making more enemies than we're killing.

329
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Pulling out, pulling out now.

330
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,880
It's so screwed up.

331
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,620
It's so screwed up.

332
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,140
It's gonna be bad.

333
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,700
It's gonna be bad.

334
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,200
It's gonna be a bummer, man.

335
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,680
And I say it is possible for a giant lizard to have lived there for years without being seen.

336
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,060
Andy, did you hear that?

337
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,220
Come on, come on, Andy.

338
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,280
Did I hear what?

339
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,280
So white, so white, so white, so white, so white, so white, so white, so white.

340
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,200
I've got a hunch way up...

341
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,560
...to...

342
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,480
...here.

343
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,360
More dirt.

344
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,580
Get it all so white.

345
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,620
Well, well, well, well, gay romantic figure.

346
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:41,960
No.

347
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,640
Well, what's that in your hand?

348
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,740
So good sitting here listening to the radio after bending over...

349
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,020
Mmm, wouldn't I love to?

350
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,380
Well, maybe for my heavy pieces.

351
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,020
Bright and gay, so white.

352
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,640
So white, so white, so white, so white.

353
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
I don't feel so good in the head.

354
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,980
Somebody at the back door.

355
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,680
So white, dear friends.

356
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:23,820
As the Ape Associated Press was saying, white people find things and black people loot things in emergencies.

357
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,740
Where's my background music?

358
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,260
Is it just slow?

359
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,480
Like Dave?

360
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
Dave is slow.

361
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,180
I'm not slow.

362
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,220
Oh, there. Here we go.

363
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,040
Okay.

364
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,400
All right.

365
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,020
Everything's fine here.

366
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,700
Oh, yeah.

367
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,280
Here, everything's just fine.

368
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,160
Yeah, we got plenty of red beans over here.

369
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:55,040
You know, that Homeland Security guy, Chertsov, that Jackoff said he didn't even know all kinds of things.

370
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,480
He didn't know stuff that even I knew about the security of our homeland.

371
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:08,580
He thought the eye of the hurricane was so heavily smudged with mascara that there was no chance it would ever reach the reckoning of number five, which is...

372
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,500
You know, like 11 on an amplifier.

373
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,600
Well, as Mr. Sister was pointing out, this whole thing was totally botched.

374
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
I mean, such a slow response.

375
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,640
The price of gas waited two days after the storm to jump to over $3 a gallon.

376
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,500
Now, wait a minute, Stanger.

377
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,220
Now, that is a...

378
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,780
That's ridiculously slow.

379
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,220
What kind of a country is this?

380
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,200
Stanger, you're thinking very, very crudely.

381
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,320
You're not getting the finer points of this deal, what's going on here.

382
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,620
This major crime has been committed.

383
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,560
And if you look at all the different details of the crime...

384
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,280
Certain things start to fall into place.

385
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,900
You've got to be a detective.

386
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,740
No, you shouldn't be offended.

387
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,580
You should be enthused.

388
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,660
Not enthused, you should be amused.

389
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,200
Yes, that's...

390
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,860
Be amused and be mused and perhaps...

391
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,360
Yeah, very funny.

392
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,260
You're out of your national gourd.

393
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,960
Yeah, I'm out of my...

394
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,360
To quote Kinnick, peace.

395
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,500
I'm out of my national gourd.

396
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,920
We're all out of our national gourd.

397
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,220
Look at it, Stanger.

398
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,520
It's perfectly ideal.

399
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,340
You move in, you destroy, you displace.

400
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,120
Suddenly the developers arrive.

401
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,200
The insurance companies are all...

402
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,840
Well paid.

403
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,980
And then the next thing you know, the military's back all of a sudden.

404
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,640
They're rebuilding the things.

405
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,060
Oh, not just any old...

406
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,580
For the corporations.

407
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,860
Yeah, not just any old military.

408
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,900
Actually, it's the Halliburton company that's doing a lot of that.

409
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,820
Yeah, here it is.

410
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,700
Hallibur-tayne!

411
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Hallibur-tayne.

412
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,740
Get this.

413
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,020
The U.S. Navy asked Hallibur-tayne to repair naval facilities damaged by Hurricane Katrina,

414
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,380
the Houston Chronicle reported.

415
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,180
The work was a success.

416
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,280
Hallibur-tayne signed to Hallibur-tayne's KBR subsidiary under the Navy's $500 million

417
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,960
contract awarded, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

418
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,240
Stanger, you're frothing now.

419
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,200
You have to calm down.

420
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,000
You're shaking.

421
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,240
You know, lacquerty is...

422
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,500
Well, as Hell-Poe Pui pointed out about that, when the vice president of the U.S. has such

423
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:05,060
suspect ties to a company that gets that much gravy from something this bad, it just looks

424
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,800
bad, even if it is on the up and up.

425
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,660
And that's the problem with being in bed in sight and even if you didn't personally

426
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,920
foul the sheets, the reek of brimstone is still going to float over everything regardless.

427
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,760
That sulfur's smell...

428
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,220
Said Hell-Poe Pui.

429
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,440
That sulfur's smell is neither a fart nor the aftermath of the sewage in the hurricane.

430
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,400
It's a funeral pyre, Stang.

431
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,180
It's a bunch of bodies being burned because, well, and no place to bear them, Donda.

432
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:36,580
Well, what's in the sacks that they're dumping into the river to plug the levee break?

433
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,140
Well, some people say it was just bad fruit from down by the...

434
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,560
Yeah.

435
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,140
We're told all kinds of things, but where are...

436
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,920
I don't know.

437
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,040
No, maybe it's from Cafe Du Monde, you know, and they put some of the old bad beignets in

438
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,680
the thing there and float them down the river and say, get rid of this stuff.

439
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,580
It ain't no good no more.

440
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,040
Bad mufaletas, bad po' boys, bad jambalaya, you know, all kind of food they stuffed in

441
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,200
there.

442
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:04,380
Reverend Stan Williams suggested that the Edward Teller solution to clean up, where

443
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,780
you use a medium-sized thermonuclear device to quickly evaporate the water and ease the

444
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:10,780


445
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,460
Now, that's an American solution.

446
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,960
Bonafide red, white, and blue.

447
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,200
Nuke them until there's nothing there.

448
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,260
Sheesh.

449
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,420
Sheesh.

450
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:27,540
Well, in 2004, it says here, the Bush administration cut funding requested by the New Orleans District

451
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,120
of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for holding back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain by more

452
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,900
than 80%.

453
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:39,440
And it worked, as Polar Bear pointed out, because 80% of the water is still in the lake.

454
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,560
The rest is out there in Lake George, what they're calling Greater Metropolitan Orleans.

455
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,400
They call it Lake George now.

456
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,480
You see, God has destroyed a wicked city.

457
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,220
That's what some of the Chris Staines were, the really far gone, far righty and wrong

458
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,220


459
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,320
Yeah.

460
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,640
Sodom and Gomorrah is what they're calling it.

461
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,800
Well, that place was Sodom and Gomorrah anyway.

462
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,120
Who cares what happens to them?

463
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,880
That's the new thing.

464
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,480
This is, you know, people can't this daily.

465
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,860
We have to hear this going into our earwax.

466
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,680
We have to hear this seeping into our brains every day.

467
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,100
We're being left behind.

468
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,040
We're the subhumans, not the subgeni.

469
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,080
To these people, we're the subhumans.

470
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,800
Submen.

471
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,500
Submen.

472
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,400
Submit.

473
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,400
Submen.

474
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,960
The undermensch ist gefallen.

475
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,160
And subwomen, too.

476
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,120
Oh, the sub-babes.

477
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,820
Oh, yeah, the under...

478
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,620
Speaking of which...

479
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:39,800
It says here, Hurricane Huey destroys Dobstown days before Sister Decadence Day.

480
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,320
Just days before Sister Decadence Day, an annual subgenius celebration attracting tens

481
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,160
of thousands of people to the Malaysian Quarter section of Dobstown.

482
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,360
Hurricane Huey destroyed the city.

483
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,740
Although the loss of lives is deeply saddening, this act of God destroyed a wicked city, says

484
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,620
repent, slack off, America, Michael Markkavich.

485
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:09,740
From Girls Gone Wild to Sister Decadence Day, Dobstown was a city that has its doors wide

486
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,220
open to the public celebration of sin and frop.

487
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,160
From such devastation may a city full of righteousness emerge.

488
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,260
May this act of God cause us all to think about what we tolerate in our city limits

489
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,780
and bring us trembling before the throne of Almighty God.

490
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,580
So where's Mardi Gras going to be this next year?

491
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,000
The Flats?

492
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
In Dobstown?

493
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,180
No, not Dobstown, because we see what happens there.

494
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,500
But the Flats, maybe.

495
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,260
Well, see, that's what's the difference between...

496
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,080
Or somebody suggested the Las Vegas Beach.

497
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,300
Well, you know, if they're this ready...

498
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,640
I just think all that beach drifting out into the Gulf of Mexico don't, you know, kind of

499
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,340
bruises the ego, or bruises the spirit, excuse me.

500
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,220
Well, thanks to Reverend Ellis Dee, yes, for that news release there.

501
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,680
See, we used to go to Cafe Dumont.

502
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,980
I always have to go to Cafe Dumont.

503
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,540
I always have to go to Cafe Dumont and get that chicory coffee.

504
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,380
It's like espresso, but it's got chicory in it.

505
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,760
And then you get a muffalette across the street.

506
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,740
And you can spit to the river right from there.

507
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,200
I mean, it's right...

508
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,840
You can see it right over there.

509
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,380
You can walk up to it and you can urinate in it.

510
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,260
You know, a lot of people do.

511
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,520
But the main thing is you want to stay away from certain parts during the Gras because

512
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,180
people do act like animals.

513
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,440
I was.

514
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,020
I did.

515
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,800
It was great.

516
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,620
I've been to Mardi Gras.

517
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,360
Well, you still are an animal in a lot of ways.

518
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,520
Yeah.

519
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

520
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,300
The hirsutism hasn't subsided.

521
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,860
You're still hairy and have too many canines.

522
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,440
Teeth.

523
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,080
War of the Third Worlds, they called it.

524
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,620
Apocorleans now.

525
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,840
Oh, jeez.

526
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,280
Mad Max Beyond Superdome.

527
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,420
Yeah, well, you have to portray...

528
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,460
Gone with the Bling.

529
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,740
You must compartmentalize.

530
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,580
Katrina Does New Orleans.

531
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,680
Nightmare on Bourbon Street.

532
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,940
These were all things that...

533
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,460
Pirates of the Pontchartrain.

534
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,320
Piled up arms.

535
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,000
The kids on the IRC came up with this.

536
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,320
On the past day long.

537
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,260
And how green was my topical humor, said Nenslow.

538
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,180
And it is easy for us to...

539
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,200
My tropical hubris, I think, is what was wrong in this case.

540
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,320
Hey, FEMA is opening a restaurant chain.

541
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,420
FEMER.

542
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,140
Yeah, FEMER, that you drive up to the window and place your order and 72 hours later it's

543
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,240
ready.

544
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
It's another Mr. Cysterion.

545
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,120
Gag.

546
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,620
Thanks, Mr. Cyster.

547
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,920
There's a lot of gagging, horrible gag.

548
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:39,400
Mr. Cyster went to New Orleans last year and happened to get really sick and there

549
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,800
was a big parade going on, not Mardi Gras, or maybe it was.

550
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,300
But he was...

551
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,260
Halloween is a big parade.

552
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:52,360
There was an ambulance there on a street corner waiting for somebody to get sick in the parade.

553
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,180
So he just walked on up there.

554
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,660
And Mr. Cyster walked up and said, I'm really sick and I need to go to the hospital.

555
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,100
And they said, we're not allowed to go to the hospital.

556
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,840
We're not allowed to leave this spot.

557
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,420
So you'll have to walk down there and call somebody else.

558
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,100
That was New Orleans.

559
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:14,180
Now, you know, everybody is blaming President Bush for the storm.

560
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,220
And it's true that reportedly George Bush was seen at the height of the storm, prying

561
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,940
at the levees with a long iron bar, shrieking with insane glee.

562
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,740
Like Darius whipping the waters before the Greeks defect.

563
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:27,980
Reportedly.

564
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,320
From the Greek.

565
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,320
From the Greek.

566
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,480
From the Greek.

567
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,620
From Ninsla.

568
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:29,880
From Ninsla.

569
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,760
Intelligence analysts are calling him, quote, an insane murderer, worse than a million

570
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,320
Hitlers and a billion Stalins combined.

571
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,060
He may, in fact, be worse than that.

572
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,480
If present trends continue, he may eventually murder everyone and be the sole human survivor,

573
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,860
devouring the corpses of his billions of victims, or so we hear.

574
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,300
Well spoken, Jim.

575
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,940
I think that's perhaps the best speech you've ever given.

576
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Now in our state.

577
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,040
in our classes, what we usually like to

578
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,980
stress is making sure the pelvis is

579
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,800
thrust forward when singing

580
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,880
songs to the Archduke. Remember,

581
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,640
W is

582
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,560
our Royal Regatta.

583
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,920
He is our snake and sounding

584
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,080
board. He is our tired policeman.

585
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,700
As we back away

586
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,080
from this beautiful video display

587
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,020
behind us, me, you, that is

588
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,900
all of us here, we can see

589
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,920
what God in all

590
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,820
his splendor has wrought.

591
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,280
Something's

592
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,200
wrought in Godland.

593
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,480
However,

594
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,920
in Swaziland, things

595
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,080
are cool. They have a cool

596
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,160
president, or he's a king there, actually.

597
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,040
He's like one of the new enlightened

598
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,920
royalty. Well, actually,

599
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,060
some of his people

600
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,400
are trying to say that he's too

601
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,700
old-fashioned and he shouldn't be doing the

602
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,020
reed dance anymore. Did you read

603
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,260
about the reed dance?

604
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,100
No. I mean, did you read about

605
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,520
the reed dance?

606
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,120
I need your reed about...

607
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,720
In Swaziland, if you're king,

608
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,800
you get to pick an additional

609
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,160
wife every year. That's one of the

610
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,920
benefits of living there. And the way the king

611
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,800
gets to pick the new wife is, all

612
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,660
the virgins in the country

613
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,880
that want to, which is several

614
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,180
thousand, do the parade

615
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,980
past his throne, doing the

616
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,360
ceremonial reed dance

617
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,800
topless, basically, wearing the

618
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,580
traditional dress, as they put it.

619
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,960
I searched the internet for

620
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,800
movies or good pictures of the reed dance.

621
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:26,800


622
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:26,800


623
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,180
I did find

624
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,820
some, but they were very modest.

625
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,040
I'm going to say the king of

626
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,020
Swaziland's daughters are really

627
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,220
beautiful. Gorgeous. For some reason

628
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,760
they were prancing around out there, too.

629
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,840
Anyway, that's

630
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,020
the kind of leader we need, man!

631
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,080
You should see this

632
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,180
grin on that guy's face. He was smiling like

633
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,320
Bob. He's glowing!

634
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,080
Positively glowing! Now that is

635
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,280
the kind of leadership I'd like to see

636
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,900
more of in this country, as well as

637
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,800
live broadcasts of the series.

638
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Well, why can't we have Bush's

639
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,700
daughters, bare-chested,

640
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,940
doing the traditional

641
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,820
Bush dance, in front of the

642
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,900
White House, and we'll also

643
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,860
have George parade all the new

644
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,620
vials of the Beltway, like

645
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,600
what's-her-name, Karen

646
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,940
Colson, or whatever her name is. The one that

647
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,120
looks like a rat. Ann Coulter? Ann Coulter.

648
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,960
Yeah. Ann Coulter, you know,

649
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,680
going by and stuff, you know, showing her

650
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,400
stuff. She'd love it.

651
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,620
What's the lady on

652
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,920
MSNBC, then?

653
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,860
And then also

654
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,900
the one that's related to Alistair Crowley,

655
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,920
and you can tell, because she's got the wrong handshake.

656
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,440
Monica Crowley!

657
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,260
You watch a lot more television than I do.

658
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,860
No, I remember from the day

659
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,500
when I did. I have no more TV.

660
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,800
But I hear also now people

661
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,860
talk about how much they hate them, so I can remember

662
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,880
the names. You know, you

663
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,940
would have been flat out of luck if you

664
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,940
weren't one of those poor people in New Orleans.

665
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,060
Because,

666
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,860
now, here's one thing you can't

667
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,540
blame on Bush, because it

668
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,380
administration of the state

669
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,000
and the city are mostly Democrats.

670
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,420
But when they

671
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,360
knew that this terrible storm was

672
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,800
coming, okay,

673
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,660
they had lots of buses

674
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,460
and things around, and they knew

675
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,520
that there were a lot of people who were way

676
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,300
too broke, didn't have gas.

677
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,280
It wasn't quite up to

678
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,900
$5 a gallon then, but

679
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,500
you know what they did for the

680
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
what the city of New Orleans did

681
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,480
about a day or two before the hurricane?

682
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,300
They produced a DVD,

683
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,140
for the estimated

684
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,620
134,000 New Orleans

685
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,440
residents without vehicles, the city

686
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,320
produced a DVD that

687
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,380
was sent out to churches and community

688
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,460
groups, urging them to leave

689
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,660
town, but admitting the government

690
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,960
could not take them.

691
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,500
You're responsible for your safety

692
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,560
and you should be responsible for the person

693
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,620
next to you. So I guess if you

694
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,740
didn't have a DVD player or a car,

695
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,340
you weren't even

696
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,820
told to go

697
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,640
screw yourself.

698
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,360
You couldn't even get that much of a message.

699
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,460
To check the deal, I'd heard over

700
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,400
various internet sources that

701
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,440
the money that was supposed to be spent

702
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,520
and got funneled into a crooked scambologna

703
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,100
with Don Bush

704
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,540
was somehow ended up

705
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,520
into the hands of these people, and so they produced

706
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,420
a DVD instead of helping repair

707
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,540
a levee, or creating a kind of

708
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,520
consciousness awareness, which could be

709
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,460
understood by the average person who didn't have a

710
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,420
DVD player or didn't, you know.

711
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,560
Well, indeed, as

712
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,200
Katrina bore down on New Orleans,

713
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,360
last weekend, Mayor Ray Nagin

714
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,060
marshaled a fleet of

715
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,220
city buses, not to take

716
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,340
the city's poor out of town, but

717
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,340
to the large shelter at the Super

718
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,180
Dome, where civil order

719
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,440
would fall apart as the week progressed

720
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,580
and so forth.

721
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,260
Well, has civil order returned now that they've called

722
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,100
in the National Guard from Texas? Of course,

723
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,640
since not from

724
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,100
Louisiana, because they're in Iraq

725
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,240
and all their rescue equipment is

726
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,120
in Iraq, too, especially for, you know, the

727
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,300
watery parts of Iraq.

728
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,320
Gotta show off in the marshlands there, we can do

729
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
any kind of fighting. Oh, right, yeah,

730
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,160
we have all of our

731
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,120
necessary swamp rescue gear

732
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,920
is over there.

733
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,820
In the swamps of the

734
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,360
Middle East, well, well.

735
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,380
Well, oh, speaking of which, I have a perfect

736
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,840
cut to play, and we can relieve

737
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,280
the listeners of

738
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,520
this

739
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,500
us. Vile hubris.

740
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,120
This hatred of the world at large.

741
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,140
The meas of the melange

742
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,840
of poopoo and caga that we

743
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,960
are in. Okay, I have to do credits.

744
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,220
At the beginning of the,

745
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,020
of course, this show has been

746
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,240
filled with cut-ups and

747
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,440
collages by Fernand and Andy

748
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,300
Lemur and Norrell Preff.

749
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,300
You can get more at norrellpreff.com.

750
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,080
Also, our friend Reverend Jacques

751
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,220
Petty sent a lot of movie

752
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,480
clips, soundtrack clips, which

753
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,360
we're using, and someone

754
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,680
named Joe

755
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,540
has been posting cut-ups

756
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,480
and music to alt.binaries.site

757
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,280
and I think,

758
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,920
I think that Joe is a fun way

759
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,540
of a fellow from an atom

760
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,880
years ago, but we don't know. Anyway,

761
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,000
here's something he did. He might be the Hey Joe of the

762
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
show. Well, we have

763
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,680
that, too. Or Cotton Eye Joe.

764
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,980
Here's Old Man. Cotton Eye Joe? Oil Man.

765
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,140
He could well be Cotton Eye Joe. Oil Man

766
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,400
by Joe.

767
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,180
I'm 42 years old. I've lived a lot of my life

768
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,120
already. I feel very secure as to

769
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,360
who I am and where I've been

770
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,740
and don't feel a need to

771
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,120
be anything other than

772
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,080
kind of a half-broke oil man

773
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,840
from West Texas.

774
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,460
I will swear to not only

775
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,960
uphold the laws of our land,

776
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
I will swear to uphold the honor

777
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,520
and dignity of the office to which I have been

778
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,760
elected, so help me God.

779
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,820
And most of them believed in

780
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,680
freedom, peace,

781
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,800
equality of opportunity.

782
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,140
But I guess just like in our time,

783
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,680
there are those who, for power,

784
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,140
would make slaves of everybody else.

785
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Yes, I'm afraid so.

786
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,420
But they didn't have our tools

787
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,180
to fight them with.

788
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,140
Masters of insanity, our mission in Iraq

789
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,520
is a serious mistake.

790
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,560
Here's the man who proves it pays

791
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,580
to be ignorant. That bloomin' idiot,

792
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,580
Mr. George.

793
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,160
Capable of any atrocity.

794
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,940
Man. Tard. Mr. George.

795
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,680
Tard. Everything I do is wrong.

796
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,240
Kill innocent men, women, and children.

797
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,720
Kill innocent men, women, and children.

798
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,080
George. We have more work to do.

799
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,100
That bloomin' idiot, Mr. George.

800
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,040
Work and fight.

801
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,140
Work and fight. Someone hit me in the face

802
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,080
with a wet dish rag. Violence and

803
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,140
bloodshed. Fuck it. Fuck it. Violence and

804
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,880
instability. Fuck it. Fuck it. Wait

805
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,840
to be attacked again. Fuck it.

806
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,640
Urban combat.

807
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,920
Don't be ignorant just like

808
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,760
me. We intend to stay

809
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,340
forever.

810
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,540
To be ignorant.

811
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,040
No brain. No brain. The lesson of this

812
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,140
experience is he who gets up early

813
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,000
with the son shouldn't stay up late with

814
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,800
the daughter. The lesson of this experience

815
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,480
is fuck it.

816
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,000
And I want to show you

817
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,740
something that the words of the Lord

818
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,860
Jesus Christ in a parable that he

819
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,820
told is quoted in the book

820
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,440
of Matthew. Watch this.

821
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,880
And the rest seems

822
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,620
ridiculous.

823
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,020
And the rest seems ridiculous.

824
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,360
And the rest seems ridiculous.

825
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,780
And the rest seems ridiculous.

826
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,000
And the rest seems ridiculous.

827
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,000


828
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,700
But the king was in rage

829
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,480
and he sent his armies

830
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,100
and destroyed those murderers

831
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,120
and set their city on fire.

832
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:40,920
And the king was in rage

833
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,140
Now, that is from the gospel.

834
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,800
And that was Jesus saying this is

835
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,500
the normal reaction of a Middle

836
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,560
Eastern king when his servants

837
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,360
have been brutalized as our

838
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,760
servants have been. These brave

839
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,680
men and women under mortar fire.

840
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,060
And they're going to be killed.

841
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,420
under artillery fire, under rocket fire,

842
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:04,600
and civilian workers, their bodies being mutilated in the streets.

843
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,120
And then we're talking about a few prisoners.

844
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,960
God has a heart on for Marines,

845
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,660
because we kill everything we see.

846
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,840
Joe did that.

847
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,360
Someone named Joe.

848
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,420
Friends, those guys distracted me,

849
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,280
and I never did the credits that I needed to do.

850
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,620
At the beginning of the show, I played a couple of songs.

851
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,540
The wrenching one, the first one,

852
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,520
it was,

853
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,220
Robin Trower, Victims of the Fury,

854
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,040
from his album Victims of the Fury.

855
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,340
And after that, I played The Rainmakers,

856
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,780
Tornado, I think, from the album called Tornado.

857
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,100
That was The Rainmakers.

858
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,500
I love The Rainmakers.

859
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,520
There was also a little bit of them on We Walk the Levee.

860
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,540
We've been hearing massive amounts of,

861
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,100
well, that last piece, Marine Corps Jesus, was by Joe.

862
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,020
Before that, It Pays to Be Ignorant was by Norrell Preff.

863
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,920
And the next thing I'll play eventually is by Lee Murr,

864
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,320
and then Norrell Preff, and then Norrell Preff.

865
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,620
I understand your frustration,

866
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,420
and I'm doing all that I can.

867
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,400
And what is in those bags they're dropping from helicopters

868
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,480
to plug those holes?

869
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,020
I think it's really sand.

870
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,440
Oh, I'm sorry, you weren't on.

871
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,260
We were deaf.

872
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,560
It is sand.

873
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,880
And mute.

874
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,000
I didn't have your button.

875
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,300
I didn't push.

876
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,120
It's those who have been cremated.

877
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,000
They're ashes.

878
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,460
They're using sandbags made of human remains.

879
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,220
And, of course, they're using it as a dressing

880
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,620
for the po' boy sandwiches, which are delicious.

881
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,020
You can't quit thinking about those po' boy sandwiches.

882
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,200
I like the oyster po' boy sandwich,

883
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,420
but there ain't going to be very many oysters left either.

884
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,040
They're all dead now, too,

885
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,480
because of what happened to the ocean floor near there.

886
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,900
See, there's a lot of sediment coming off the river,

887
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,760
so let's put all that poop on up in there, too.

888
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,860
Well, and all the benzene and chlorine

889
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,980
and all the stuff coming out of the broken factory tanks.

890
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,100
The gas and oil.

891
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,640
Major oil refinery state, too, you know.

892
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,840
It's beginning to look a lot like X-Day.

893
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:42,060
Charleston was saying that he believes that the president

894
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,000
is partially to blame because he's brought bad luck

895
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,860
upon America.

896
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,280
He.

897
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:50,860
What?

898
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,380
Is wrong.

899
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,080
America.

900
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,580
You say it the Iraqi way.

901
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,060
It's cute.

902
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,340
Oh, is that how they say it?

903
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,660
I like the way your eyebrow goes up in the wings.

904
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,040
That's the way old West Virginia, Pete.

905
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,760
That's the way you say old West Virginia.

906
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,320
I'm at a key.

907
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,560
Virginia, America, heeny.

908
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,600
Anyway.

909
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,660
Well, it's true.

910
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, you can bring bad karma, bad doo-doo down on a nation

911
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,560
or a people.

912
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,300
As the leader, just think he's not only inept,

913
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,180
but he's a crook.

914
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,760
Well, actually, Dave.

915
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,680
He's a pizza front for who knows.

916
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,340
God knows.

917
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,040
Dobbs knows.

918
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,280
Well, and personally, I don't believe in karma or luck.

919
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,000
I think you have to.

920
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,000


921
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,000


922
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,580
You have to make your own personally.

923
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,140
That's just me.

924
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:23,860
But.

925
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,800
So you could do literally anything you choose to anyone else

926
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,560
and not suffer anything at any time in the future,

927
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,320
which doesn't even resemble that.

928
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,480
If I got caught.

929
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:33,800
Yes.

930
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,840
And in most cases, I would get caught so that I refrain

931
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,940
from doing evil for that reason.

932
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,500
Oh, it is hard.

933
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,620
As best I can tell.

934
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,040
Yeah.

935
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,240
So, yeah.

936
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,780
Well, I don't think he's going to refrain unless he's forced

937
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,980
to refrain with a leather hose and a wire strap and a pair of shoes.

938
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:50,980


939
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:50,980


940
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:50,980


941
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:50,980


942
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:50,980


943
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,160
And he's going to have a pair of booties that stretch all the way up to his longaments.

944
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,980
Now, the forbidden scientists on the Internet will.

945
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,580
Well, I've seen posts of people insisting that this could not possibly have been a mere ordinary storm.

946
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,580
This was engineered.

947
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,440
There's lots of water.

948
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,980
The harp research devices were used to create earthquakes.

949
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,580
Of course, the tsunami was just a test and blah, blah, blah.

950
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:20,680
Well, there is some science that they were doing something around that time that caused a lot of.

951
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,580
Weird activity in the ionosphere.

952
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,360
Some people are saying that's the thing that did it.

953
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,240
It was gone.

954
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:27,980
Yeah, right.

955
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,680
But well, we couldn't possibly just be a big hurricane.

956
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,800
Those never happened.

957
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,420
There's never been huge.

958
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:42,320
Never before has there ever been a San Francisco earthquake or a Chicago fire or a terrible ice storm

959
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:48,000
that will hit all of the cities of the Northeast in the middle of a blackout, which, of course,

960
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,400
you know, it could happen to us.

961
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,860
One of the subgenius.

962
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:59,300
Polar Bear, in fact, from Canada, was pointing out that, you know, there's all kinds of destructive things that can.

963
00:42:59,420 --> 00:42:59,520
Huh?

964
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,200
When we were young pups and puppets, they used to pass around the myth of the Lake Erie tidal wave,

965
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,900
which had an actual goofy Indian name and had actually happened sometime.

966
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,520
And and the lake, whatever made it happen, maybe it was an earthquake nearby or something.

967
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,260
The lake.

968
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,580
Probably an earthquake.

969
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,460
Big, big rock falling from the sky.

970
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,260
Yeah.

971
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,180
I mean, Tunguska experimental bomb.

972
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,700
Yeah.

973
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,820
Had slapped, you know, had slapped the shorelands quite severely.

974
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,600
Bad juju.

975
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,360
Bad chief.

976
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:26,840
Yeah.

977
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,840
The gods being angry at a bad chief.

978
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:37,420
Moses Cleveland was a bad chief and was infected with condom blay and the king of Swaziland was a good chief.

979
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:45,720
He's like he's one of my heroes now, like the Sultan of Brunei, who's the richest guy in the world.

980
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,520
He's the one we most want to save for Bob.

981
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,220
So it's the Sultan of Brunei.

982
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:50,800
Or is it now?

983
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,240
His son.

984
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,940
I think it might now be his son.

985
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,380
It's Saltino.

986
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,660
Well, whoever is the Sultan.

987
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,160
His son is really cool, too.

988
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:02,080
If any of the if anybody who knows the Sultan is listening or the Sultan himself, man, we think you are the coolest folks.

989
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,020
Now, don't start talking in the regal way.

990
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,840
You're not the king.

991
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,900
Yeah, you're not the Sultan.

992
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,120
Yeah.

993
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,200
I just want them to know, you know, if they ever want to, you know, have us over or something.

994
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,880
We'd love to come to Brunei and hang out.

995
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,700
Bob is an old friend, of course, of all these people.

996
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,020
Well, they dob you with oil.

997
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,740
In fact, on the pictures of the king.

998
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:26,760
The king of Swaziland judging the two thousand or thousands of topless girls of his country walking by.

999
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,480
He gets to touch each one?

1000
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,740
You could see Bob just out of the frame.

1001
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,380
I mean, it was just edges of him.

1002
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,660
But you could tell there was this this white guy in a business suit and with a pipe.

1003
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,960
Did you see a little frond?

1004
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,500
Yeah, you just saw the edge of his jaw.

1005
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,540
Just a little spittle frond there as he drooled at the Swaziland.

1006
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,720
Hands firmly placed in his pockets.

1007
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,480
You know.

1008
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,180
Well.

1009
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,560
Well, perhaps we all need our own Swazettes.

1010
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,000
You know what I mean?

1011
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,020
We need to be the Sultan of Brunei or the king of Swaziland in our own homeopathic way.

1012
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,940
In our own non-prescriptive nasal, navel jelly manufacturer.

1013
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:09,540
Well, now, you know, if you really want to do something about all the world's problems, you just go run for office.

1014
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,920
If you're really serious about it, you know.

1015
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:12,400
Yeah.

1016
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,220
You don't want to catch the runs from the border.

1017
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,640
You run for office.

1018
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,840
Another stupid phrase.

1019
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,980
Run for office.

1020
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,300
Democracy is dead.

1021
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:19,520
Dead.

1022
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,440
I mean, there's no such thing in America.

1023
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,200
It's like a sham.

1024
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:22,500
Pay for.

1025
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,840
Okay, pay for office.

1026
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,780
If you, you know.

1027
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,680
Oh, that's right.

1028
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,660
We don't have the money.

1029
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,960
Have you ever seen those?

1030
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,820
I knew there was some holdup to paying for office.

1031
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,380
Well, yeah.

1032
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,620
You have to pay to stay.

1033
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,680
You know, it's like when you buy your first shrimp poodle.

1034
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,420
You know what I mean?

1035
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,160
When they slip the check and they say it's not in the mail.

1036
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:40,760
Mm-hmm.

1037
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,160
And that's when you know, you know.

1038
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,940
And you know the secret handshakes and stuff like that.

1039
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,960
You give each other their secret winky sign.

1040
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:47,600
Right.

1041
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,640
And so that means.

1042
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:55,080
That say the little children's hospital for maimed, you know, eaters of underwear and stuff.

1043
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:55,620
Those kids.

1044
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,460
They have a lot of, you know, St. Hexabar.

1045
00:45:59,540 --> 00:45:59,880
Uh-huh.

1046
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,260
I think it is.

1047
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,680
And they take the money right out of the coffers and put it right in the coffins.

1048
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,980
Back in their own looted sandwiches.

1049
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:07,880
It's recycling.

1050
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,120
Yeah, it is a way of keeping the ducks and the geese happy.

1051
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,420
I mean, the rice flowing, let's say.

1052
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,480
That's the more Chinese way.

1053
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,520
Oh, the rice must flow.

1054
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,120
Okay, okay.

1055
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,520
The.

1056
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,560
Yeah.

1057
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,620
Rice must flow.

1058
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,440
Well, it just came right out, didn't it?

1059
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,040
Princess, we are dough.

1060
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,120
Are you talking about weird, like, maggots and things or anything weird like that that I, you know.

1061
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,320
And now this.

1062
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,220
George.

1063
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:40,680
W.

1064
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,320
Bush.

1065
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,000
Small skin molest.

1066
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,000
Yatka.

1067
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,560
Vichy.

1068
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:46,640
Yatchit.

1069
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,000
Vichy.

1070
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:47,840
Chit.

1071
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:47,960
Chit.

1072
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,340
Chit.

1073
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:48,500
Chit.

1074
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:48,760
Chit.

1075
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:48,940
Chit.

1076
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:49,520
Chit.

1077
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,640
Chit.

1078
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,260
Chit.

1079
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,820
Chit.

1080
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,400
Chit.

1081
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:52,820
Chit.

1082
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:52,900
Chit.

1083
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1084
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1085
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1086
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1087
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1088
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1089
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1090
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1091
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1092
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1093
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1094
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1095
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1096
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1097
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1098
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1099
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1100
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1101
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1102
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1103
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1104
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1105
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:52,900


1106
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,180
The world is corrupt.

1107
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,740
How can that be?

1108
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,640
Freedom isn't free.

1109
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,140
Oh, God, what are you?

1110
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,820
Like some redneck blogger pig?

1111
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,300
Oh, come on.

1112
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,060
Name one right, one civil liberty that doesn't have blood all over it that people haven't fought

1113
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,940
fought and died for.

1114
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,320
Uh, we didn't go to war to protect Iraqi civil liberties.

1115
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,680
That's just a lame justification.

1116
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,920
I didn't say it was just,

1117
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,180
but that's the way human beings make progress.

1118
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,220
We're violent. It's our nature.

1119
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,000
It's a little naive to expect anything different.

1120
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,420
Oh, don't give yourself a handjob!

1121
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,480
That's okay.

1122
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,820
I'm a Buddhist. We don't care about that shit.

1123
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,340
This is so fucking weird.

1124
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,800
We are so fucking lost.

1125
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,420
I'm gonna smoke some crack.

1126
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,400
We now present Bob, founder of Bob University,

1127
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,300
who during his earthly ministry was one of Bob's great warriors.

1128
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,000
Little half-baked man, intellectually.

1129
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,620
Some man that's really an ignoramus.

1130
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,880
Now, I constantly come...

1131
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,200
He was absolutely crazy.

1132
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,660
He had bats in his belfry.

1133
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,020
That's too far beyond me to understand.

1134
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,040
Big man.

1135
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,940
They know so little.

1136
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,620
You know, I've met so many fellas,

1137
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,520
and there's some little dark corners that he can get into,

1138
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,940
and he can set you.

1139
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,140
You can't even know your own self.

1140
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,140
Now, listen. Reveal things.

1141
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,000
Now, that's wonderful, isn't it?

1142
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,760
It's just beyond me.

1143
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,500
I can't get it, see.

1144
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,560
But wait a minute.

1145
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,540
I've known some fellas pretty high up.

1146
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,660
Many women.

1147
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,100
You have just heard Bob...

1148
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,840
The throne was here,

1149
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,700
in my hand,

1150
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,380
few years ago.

1151
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,580
Now do you know it knows what it needs,

1152
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:51,680
or comes back for you again,

1153
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,660
or whatever 1001 goes with this?

1154
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:52,660


1155
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:52,720
Mr.stanbul.

1156
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:52,720


1157
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:52,720


1158
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:52,780
I can't give you a run for your money.

1159
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,180
One è rock life.

1160
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,560
Because you know I'veuno,

1161
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:54,560


1162
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,100
Are you crazy?

1163
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,920
Well, not only I want to fight you,

1164
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,580
but what an asshole bee I am!

1165
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,600
Black eyed romp打

1166
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,320
I'm gonna get back to work!

1167
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,360
You have one second!

1168
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,200
Now!

1169
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,800
$50,000 for this!

1170
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,140
This way!

1171
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,120
This way!

1172
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,940
Now I can't cry over there!

1173
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,460
This way!

1174
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,260
This way!

1175
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,700
Now I can't cry over there!

1176
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,760
I want you to get up now.

1177
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,120
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.

1178
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,120
I want you to get up right now and go to the window.

1179
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,580
Open it and stick your head out and yell,

1180
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,780
I'm as mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!

1181
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:50,520
If you want, I can show you how to make a bomb out of a roll of toilet paper and a stick of dynamite.

1182
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,260
Evil, evil is a hell of a guy.

1183
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,700
He's cocky and he's handsome and different than most.

1184
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,460
Evil, evil, evil, a hell of a man.

1185
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:11,600
Everybody in Las Vegas thought evil was dead.

1186
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,960
Evil, evil is a hell of a guy.

1187
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:23,200
Right now the National Association of Evil informs us that this man has done damage around the clock.

1188
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,900
Mr. Robertson, you are an Osami bin Laden.

1189
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,080
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

1190
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,120
This is wrong.

1191
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,600
Christians need an Osami bin Laden.

1192
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,660
Laden leading the National Association of Evil right now.

1193
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,780
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now.

1194
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,300
From PR News in Washington, I'm PR's voice.

1195
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,320
Uh, PR's voice.

1196
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,540
Children's Latin Classical.

1197
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,900
President Bush sprayed the holdouts with a fire hose.

1198
00:50:55,060 --> 00:51:01,340
On Wall Street 4, New York's transit agency is installing a $200 million sport utility vehicle.

1199
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,640
The Bush administration should assassinate PR News in Washington.

1200
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,740
Hey, Stella!

1201
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,840
Shut up!

1202
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,740
You shut up!

1203
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,240
Hey, Stella!

1204
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:15,980
Shut up!

1205
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,360
Shut up!

1206
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,740
Four-letter words.

1207
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,500
Stupid.

1208
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,580
Ileducated.

1209
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,880
Staggeringly dumb.

1210
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,400
Well, well, well, bad.

1211
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,820
Bad, bad.

1212
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:35,960
Staggeringly dumb.

1213
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,100
All right.

1214
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,560
Staggeringly dumb.

1215
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,920
Staggeringly dumb.

1216
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,380
Altruistic and meaningless.

1217
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,160
Stultifyingly dumb.

1218
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,140
Penilely dysfunction.

1219
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,760
At least as long as all those huge calluses are kept there.

1220
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,540
We don't want them sprouting into anything bigger.

1221
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,860
That's another problem we've got.

1222
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,920
When that levy goes, the whole delta goes.

1223
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,200
When the delta goes, the Omicron goes, and all those other Greek letters go.

1224
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,280
And then we're in some deep, uh, we're standing here, right out in the middle of the field,

1225
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:06,600
and it looks like...

1226
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,020
It looks like everything's been totally blown away.

1227
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,020
There's nothing left.

1228
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,680
Where is there?

1229
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,160
Now, when the levy breaks, you've got no place to stay.

1230
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,300
Now we can get those Grigri women together to try and put a curse on the whole delta.

1231
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:29,960
Well, you know, it's, uh, speaking of Grigri, how come the prophets and prognosticators

1232
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,860
and crystal ball gazers, fortune tellers, never are able to pick up on stuff like this

1233
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,580
before it happens?

1234
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,540
There were some scientists who did.

1235
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,680
They've been saying this was going to happen for a long time.

1236
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Like 50 years.

1237
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,080
And engineers and stuff.

1238
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:53,280
But as Secretary of Homeland Security Chertoff said today, we didn't have any idea that any

1239
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,320
of this could have happened.

1240
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,800
Of course, this was never, never expected.

1241
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:02,220
Whereas, somehow, I expected it, because I'd read about it.

1242
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,120
I guess he doesn't...

1243
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,560
I guess the Secretary of Homeland Security doesn't...

1244
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,340
He doesn't read as much about Homeland Security in the newspapers as I did.

1245
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,800
No, that's not part of the QE or the job function of the greater pre-functorium.

1246
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,040
He doesn't have to do that unless it's one of the blue memos.

1247
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,400
The blue memos come right in and he's got to absorb every bit of it.

1248
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,860
The yellow memos can go in and out like psychobulb right out the poopy door.

1249
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,980
Now, here's some factation.

1250
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,220
Much worse.

1251
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,080
There's this...

1252
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:36,120
Michael, the head of FEMA has been on there making excuses like crazy.

1253
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,020
On television.

1254
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,380
Michael Brown.

1255
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,820
He's a human skeleton, right?

1256
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:43,000
This human named Michael Brown, who's the head.

1257
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:44,440
What a likely name.

1258
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,420
Anyway.

1259
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,520
Super deadpan.

1260
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,480
He's a lawyer and a GOP party activist.

1261
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:55,580
Before he came to FEMA in 2001, he had a full-time job overseeing horse shows.

1262
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:03,680
But he was eventually fired because of alleged supervision failures.

1263
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,020
But the stars were shining.

1264
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,040
And he was also standing on Brown because President Bush had just been elected

1265
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,760
and he appointed his chief political fixer, Joe Albaugh, as head of FEMA.

1266
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:21,480
That was a good break for the recently canned Brown because he and Albaugh were college roommates.

1267
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:28,640
He hired Brown as his general counsel at FEMA in February and then by the end of the year promoted him to deputy director

1268
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,240
and then went on to a consultancy to cash in on Iraqi contracts.

1269
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,560
And Brown became...

1270
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:34,780
Jesus.

1271
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,100
...director in charge of the...

1272
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,860
...director in charge of federal domestic emergency management in the United States.

1273
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,500
So, just to recap, Brown had no experience whatsoever in emergency management.

1274
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,680
He was fired from his last job for incompetence.

1275
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,260
He was hired because he's the new director's college roommate.

1276
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,600
And after the director, who himself got the job because he was a fixer for the president,

1277
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,000
after that guy left, he became top dog.

1278
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:05,460
And President Bush said yesterday that he thinks Brown is doing a hell of a job.

1279
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,080
Watch down.

1280
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,000
And you already said he was hired for his supervision, which means he's probably...

1281
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,520
Like Superman.

1282
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:10,960
Right.

1283
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,020
In x-ray vision.

1284
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,960
He's probably resisting the Kryptonite.

1285
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,440
And he probably has like, you know, a cape that he can fly over those tiny little houses down in the French Quarter,

1286
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:24,060
in the old, in the old quarter, you know, in Magazine Street, and they're called God and they're all down there.

1287
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,400
He can fly over it.

1288
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,500
I thought he was hired for his roommateism.

1289
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,260
Well, roommateism is a little harder to prove.

1290
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:36,080
You have to have an actual document showing you together at the Sigma Alpha party, you know, puking together with your arms around your neck.

1291
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,080


1292
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,080


1293
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,260
And you have to have a document showing you around each other in a fondant burst.

1294
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,760
The Skull and Bones party.

1295
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,280
Yeah, the Skull and Bones-mans.

1296
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,220
That's what they are.

1297
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:41,420
Yeah.

1298
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,940
Because they know the secret handshakes and signs.

1299
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:44,460
Oh, yeah.

1300
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,880
And all the winks and the blinks.

1301
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,140
Well, that's why we started our own secret society, friends, to catch up with the Skull and Bones Society.

1302
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,840
It's the Dobbshead and Dobbshead Society.

1303
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,180
The Church of the Subgenius.

1304
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:02,400
And we are here, friends, to bring you the truth and the rumors and the lies and the word of Bob.

1305
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,060
And, friends, you can get more information about the word of Bob from www.thebob.com.

1306
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:06,060


1307
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,340
www.subgenius.com.

1308
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,620
And you can learn everything else about that.

1309
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,380
Well, invisibility, that's the first thing you learn is invisibility.

1310
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,820
You also learn the high secrets of the natives of Brazil, going back to the antediluvian times.

1311
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,900
You also learn the secrets of the Lemurians.

1312
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,060
Ah, the minutia.

1313
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,260
Praise the Lemurians.

1314
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,880
Well, I thought they were like a furry little critter that liked to jump into the water.

1315
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,840
They're furry little critters that like to get high.

1316
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,340
Ah, henchmen.

1317
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:40,840
Lemurs do.

1318
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,320
They have the same problem as human beings.

1319
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,660
When the flood starts, they want to get drunk.

1320
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,360
You know, there were bars that were open throughout the whole thing in the middle of the French Quarter.

1321
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:51,820
I could imagine.

1322
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,480
And they're still open.

1323
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,560
They never closed.

1324
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,000
Give me another hurricane.

1325
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,340
They're going to chase them out eventually, you know.

1326
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:00,600
But there was still some old-timers sitting in those bars.

1327
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,100
Somehow, some dead guys drinking a lot of hurricanes.

1328
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,180
Well, I was, I was, oh God.

1329
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,200
All the dead guys are there.

1330
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,360
Give me another hurricane.

1331
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,420
And then, too late.

1332
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,800
Not funny.

1333
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:25,820
I could have read some of the things Mr. Sister posted to Alt.slack, but I decided that they were too tasteless for this tasteful program.

1334
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:32,340
Well, just think of all the people in the Coliseum, you know, down in the Crescent City, down there, sitting there, listening to this.

1335
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,460
You know, hoping against hope.

1336
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,960
You know, they got the computers out there.

1337
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,320
Of course.

1338
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,860
No.

1339
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:45,360
We haven't heard from any of the Louisiana or Mississippi or Alabama subgeni.

1340
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,580
And there are plenty of them out there.

1341
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:51,900
And I'd love it if they emailed stang at subgenius.com so I could put a little list up.

1342
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,060
Because your brethren and sistren are, you know, worrying about you.

1343
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,620
If they were really worried, they'd have joined the Peace Corps a long time ago.

1344
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,280
And they'd be down there helping dig you out.

1345
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,820
Let's do it like the real guys do it.

1346
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,120
Let's do it.

1347
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:09,120
To all of our brethren down in New Orleans, please, please contact.

1348
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,560
I don't think there's anybody left in New Orleans.

1349
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,540
We're thinking about you.

1350
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:18,540
If you're in the Gulfport area, Blexie, anywhere down there, please call us.

1351
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,620
We need to hear from you right now.

1352
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,700
No, don't call us.

1353
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,500
Just email us.

1354
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,280
Just email us.

1355
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,480
But see, that's the thing.

1356
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:24,820
Don't call us.

1357
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,180
Please don't.

1358
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,580
What do you do when the power's out?

1359
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,980
You watch the DVD that the state gave you about how you should leave town.

1360
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,100
You put your fingers against the Blackboard.

1361
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,360
We do know that our friends from the Voodoo Temple are okay.

1362
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,500
They just happened to not be there at the time.

1363
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,540
Okay.

1364
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,980
And it's staggeringly stupid and idiotic.

1365
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:43,820
Knowledge.

1366
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:44,900
Don't have any education.

1367
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,300
Don't have any education.

1368
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:46,880
No, nothing is right.

1369
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:47,460
Mental problems.

1370
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,260
Mental problems.

1371
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,240
And friends.

1372
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:49,540

00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:00,900


1397
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:00,900


1398
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:00,920

1434
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,540
I don't know

1435
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,580
you can realize

01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,740
Gosh, you know, I...

1443
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,000
Blacks are gagging on the donkey, but not yet ready to swallow the elephant.

1444
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:03,280
One of the many major problems with governing people is that of who you get to do it,

1445
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,840
or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them.

1446
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,400
To summarize, it is a well-known and much lamented fact

1447
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:17,260
that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.

1448
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:22,240
To summarize the summary, anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president

1449
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,740
should on no account be allowed to do the job.

1450
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,240
To summarize the summary of the summary, people are a problem.

1451
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,260
Sustain all objections, but face the truth.

1452
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,060
Yes.

1453
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,920
Behold this marvel, this living paradox, this missing link in an evolutionary chain.

1454
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,100
Silence her!

1455
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,320
Mass confusion.

1456
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,660
Jack off.

1457
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:08,980
Buy.

1458
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:09,820
But.

1459
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,000
I could be wrong.

1460
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:11,540
Jack off.

1461
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,060
But.

1462
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:12,760
I could be wrong.

1463
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,980
You couldn't use intelligence.

1464
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:16,740
But.

1465
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,100
But.

1466
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:17,500
But.

1467
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,860
You couldn't use intelligence.

1468
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,840
We're not telling you the truth.

1469
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,200
We're not telling you the truth.

1470
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,140
Jack off.

1471
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:24,960
Disagree.

1472
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,460
Disagree.

1473
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:25,900
Disagree.

1474
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,480
Bottom line.

1475
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,140
Mass confusion.

1476
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,320
Mass confusion.

1477
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,520
Mass confusion.

1478
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,880
Thank you.

1479
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,920
And thank you.

1480
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,920
And thank you.

1481
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,120
And thank you and don't bother us.

1482
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:40,880
It's hard to think, it's hard to think, it's hard to think, it's hard to think, it's hard to think of a man.

1483
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,100
Listen for yourself as evil reveals his creative side.

1484
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:51,260
I wrote this poem and I wrote it in a matter of an hour or two hours just before it got daylight it was done.

1485
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,520
And I think that it answers the question for every man and woman on the face of this earth.

1486
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,820
But why you do what you do and why I do what I do in life.

1487
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,920
They all ask why.

1488
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,280
Why? Well, I'm just like you.

1489
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,460
We all have a dream on some faraway star.

1490
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,080
To do what I do is not right.

1491
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,980
But for me, it's not wrong.

1492
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,540
I've got to be me.

1493
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:17,600
Thank you.

1494
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,680
Complications go on on it.

1495
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:44,980
Pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink.

1496
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:49,940
Pink.

1497
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:50,420
Pink.

1498
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,200
With osteoporosis.

1499
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,120
And fractures of both the hip and spine.

1500
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:18,160
Talk to your doctor about the disorders of the esophagus, kidney disease, low blood calcium, stomach or digestive problems, heartburn, difficult or painful swallowing, chest pain.

1501
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,300
I'm putting it off a minute longer.

1502
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,360
From PR news in Washington.

1503
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,260
I'm not taking PR news seriously.

1504
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:31,060
A spokesman for Southern California Edison has turned himself into police in Tampa, Florida.

1505
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,460
Until dead night.

1506
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,200
Mid the fourth line.

1507
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,360
In Switzerland, dangerously high.

1508
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,160
It wasn't reached.

1509
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,580
But then, their largest federation.

1510
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:39,820
It appeared Monday.

1511
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:40,940
More time.

1512
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:42,120
But there are points.

1513
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,920
One crime.

1514
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:43,840
P.I.P.R.

1515
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,340
P.I.P.R.

1516
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:44,900
P.I.P.R.

1517
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,120
P.I.P.R.

1518
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:45,240
News.

1519
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:45,900
Nick.

1520
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,180
5, 2, 3, 4!

1521
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,640
Take it in the sights from my window seat

1522
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,800
From the third world port to the land of the free

1523
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,640
Back at home, it's Tony night in Tinseltown, you know

1524
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,000
Don't mean nothing to the down and out

1525
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,580
From my window

1526
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,280
Window to the world

1527
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,500
Window to the world

1528
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,140
Window to the world

1529
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,880
From my window

1530
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,300
Window to the world

1531
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:50,280
Some people born with a Bible in their hand

1532
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,540
Spending life and money

1533
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,400
Looking for the promised land

1534
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,960
Some people only know what they see on TV

1535
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,300
Some people say it's just part of the plan

1536
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,800
From my window

1537
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,340
Window to the world

1538
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:14,040
From my window

1539
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,400
Window to the world

1540
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,740
Window to the world

1541
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:51,800
I'm looking out my window on a busy street

1542
01:06:51,800 --> 01:07:02,180
I'm looking out my window on a busy street

1543
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,100
We'll see you next time.

1544
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:38,040
From my window, window to the world.

1545
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:48,360
From my window, window to the world.

1546
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:31,920
From my window, window to the world.

1547
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:36,960
From my window, window to the world.

1548
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,500
That was the Rainmakers. I love the Rainmakers.
