No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century
that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space.
No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized
as some of the microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.
Few men even consider the possibility of life on other planets.
And yet, across the gulf of space,
minds immeasurably superior to ours
regard this earth with envious eyes.
And slowly and surely,
they drew their plans against us.
Quickly, one after the other,
four of the fighting machines appeared.
Monstrous.
Monstrous tripods higher than the tallest steeple,
striding over the pine trees and smashing them.
Walking engines of glittering metal,
each carried a huge funnel.
And I realized with horror that I'd seen this awful thing before.
Transformers!
Transformers!
Transformers!
Transformers!
Transformers!







Transformers
Robots in disguise
Long enough to break the brain of power
So we have to pull together
Though we can't stay worlds apart
To stand united we will storyboard
Until darkness comes
When the light will say us all

More than beasts in the eye

Robots in disguise

All of us wage their battle to destroy the evil forces of

It's gone for a day and now we've made our stand
And for now the powers of darkness
Have been driven from our land
The battle's over, but the war has just begun
And this wave will remain
Till the day we're not a war

Then the fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets and steam that turned the smoke into thick black dust
Those machines are just demons in another form
I shall burn them with my holy cross
They're just the stupidest living

It would be something worth trying for
Transformers
Even something that's dying to grow

Who is the man who's standing tall?

It would be a close fight, sir

Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man
We took Shaftler in a cottage
To back smoke, spread hemorrhaging
It's a sign
I've been given a sign
But now it's too late
Too late!
Oh, say can you see
During next day's long day
The face above doves
If you stare at the sunlight
Whose bright eyes and broad grin
Train mark pipe at his chin
Gives subgenie slack
As we fight off the North
Transformers








And the ray guns red glare
Melted skin, bone, and hair
When fired from high
Saucers floating in air
Oh, say does the pipe blow
From smoke this direction
So long
So long
So that we live free as birds
Not like peak human terms
Praise the Lord!
The problem is of course the humans
All's well then goeth away

Mars is incapable of sustaining life.
Our efforts to maintain the biosphere are exhausted.
The water tables and temperature decrease accurately, as does our population.
The only consequential cause of action is the conquest and occupation of Earth.
Our young sovereign neighbors.
The means and methods for this attack are already being realized.
A large-scale hydrogen accelerator will be constructed.
This will launch suspension pods carrying the assault forces.

From which we also heard a Max Mondo mix.




All taken from Jeff Wayne's old rock opera based on my hero H.G. Wells' original 1898 novel,
The War of the Worlds.
And more of that to come.
Things to come.
The subgenius star-spangled banner was, of course, our own Papa Joe Mama.
Live at the September 2001 Tampa, Florida, D. Vival.
And more of that will be released.
We'll be coming to.
But now, friends, turn off your radio unless you can take it.
Because I got a copy of Suzy the Floozy's war show.
The edition of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse by Reverend Suzy the Floozy in Atlanta on WREK.
And if you, friends, her collage editing is excellent.
And she's a great actress.

She's a very sensitive person.
And she's a sick weirdo.
And that combination makes some of this to come a bit hard to take.
Consider yourself warned.
And hail Connie.

Paranoia's like cheese
Into your life you can freeze
It's not when you're always afraid
That a life may come and take you away
We better stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Sounds like the doomsday whistle
It's been blown from nigh on to three years
Trouble abruin
Inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities
How are we supposed to do our big musical number
With so many problems in the world?
But we will not allow this enemy
To win the war by changing our way of life
Or restricting our freedoms
Yeah, maybe so, Mr. President
But, oh, this past week has been such a brutal kick
In the psychological head
That I feel compelled to warn some of our
More sensitive viewers
That maybe tonight isn't the show for them
Because, Seekers, oh, we got a whole lot to work out
It looks like they're trying to
Imminentize the Eschaton
As far as I know
Who knows?
This could be the last episode ever
Of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse
So let's just blow all this crap out of our pipes
Shall we?
And from going around making wild allegations
Obviously trying to exploit the situation
She's working for someone
And I don't think it's us
I'll deactivate her
The future is coming
Coming after you
Neutrously
Relentlessly
Engulfing you
Overwhelming you
Until it ultimately
Terminates you
And only one thing can save you
Let me bring Bob in on this
Then it's time to take a stand
To break out
Of your dog
Of your own life
And into
Brazil
So pleased
You could make it
Like this well
It's about whites of fantasy
And the nightmare of reality
We're all in this together
Terrorist bombing
I don't think it involves anything on safety

And reveal them

Where is he headed, Professor Prescott?
There's one place in Manhattan
That looks exactly like a certain part of his native habitat
Let him through to it
And you can trap him there
Let him climb to the top of the World Trade Center

In a lubricated world
And I want to marry an office girl
I've got my tie on
I've set my watch on
I've set my goal in bed
I ain't on
I want to be bad
I've got my tie on
It's a string around my finger
It's a piece around my neck
Although the rest is a proof
I'm not there yet
I've got my tie on
I'll be sure to hold my head high
I can't forget why I got out of bed
Even when the morning paper's red
I've got my tie on
I'm lying across the tile floor
I've got my name on the office door
I've got my tie on
It's a string around my finger
It's a piece around my neck
Although the rest is a proof
I'm not there yet
I've got my tie on
It's a piece around my neck

It's a costume around my neck

planes in the world? Okay, our main force will be split into two groups. One will circle around
this way to cut off the enemy's retreat. The other will drive in this way, closing the trap.
It's a classic pincer's movement. It can't fail against a 10-year-old. Happy flying and
congratulations once again on the loudest, the fastest, and the farthest flying air pressure
plane in the world. Now, I'll see a wild blue yonder. I would not be surprised if in about a
year from now, we didn't see some serious civil disruption. Whether there'll be bombings,
whether there'll be attacks of biological weapons, whether there'll be something about,
I don't know if anybody's going to carry a suitcase nuclear weapon over here, but it could
happen. But we will see America become the target. And we are so open and we are so vulnerable
to this kind of activity. And this could, as it keeps going on, it could be just a
little momentary thing that we could get under control, which is possible. I hope it is. Or
it could get seriously out of hand and a lot of people get killed. And something much worse
than this happened, if it's due, that America is now weak, that other nations would start
piling on because they would identify us with Israel. Now, that could easily be kicked off
in the year 2002. Well, it's the event that ends it all.
Exactly.
I know I've got a job to do.
I've got my tie on.
I've picked my side. I've made my choice. I've got to have a gamble for you. I've got my tie on.
This is a black eye on the part of Lowry, and I don't care how you gave what you went into records.
Infirmation retrieval is an executive branch. We are proud of our reputation and we protect it.
Damn it, Lowry! That convoy of personnel carriers is still not accounted for. I thought I told you
to deal with it. What the hell is this mess? An empty desk is an efficient desk.
Good God! Queries from security. Searches from central banking about a check. Clarification
notices from accounting concerning unreturned receipts.
Mr. Warren, I have to find out.
Shut up!
I don't know what's going on.
Air Hogs is now ready to fly the length of a football field. But remember, you must fly
it in a wide open space with lots of grass for soft landing.
Air Hogs!
My God, that maniac is heading straight for us!
I've got three of my big red tattoos throughout my head. I'll go as fast as I can. We're going
to do this.
I'm not an irrelant. I've got my title on this shirt and I'll strip like number five!
Luckily, the rat are in there. That man is not the one walking. Boom, man, there's a
fire in there. And it don't... that gun... that... everywhere, man. I don't know if so
many men run out of there. I don't know if he... they... they... they... they... they...

Check, man, you're only gonna be... coming down here...
Sir, you are going to have to speak more slowly. I cannot understand you.
Dang. Oh. Meg. Lo. Mark. And. Talk. Left. Down. Walk. That. Is. Boo!
Okay, folks. Show's over. Nothing to see here. Show's... Oh, my God! A horrible plane crash!
Hey, everybody! Get a load of this flaming wreckage! Come on, crowd around!
Crowd around. Don't be shy. Crowd around.
Well, Dad, now I'm going to get up and go to the airport. I'm going to go to my new home.
We have a new home.

Oh, I'm right.
Oh, now I'm right.
If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow.
Yes, gentlemen. They are on their way in and no one can bring them back. For the sake
of our country and our way of life, I suggest you get the rest of SAC in after them, otherwise
we will be totally destroyed by red retaliation. Uh, my boys will give you the best kind of
start. Fourteen hundred megatons worth, and you sure as hell won't stop them now.
So let's get going. There's no other choice. God willing, we will prevail in peace and freedom from fear and in true health through the purity and essence of our natural fluids.
Hasta la vista, baby.
No, I don't know.
I know you're afraid.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What's happening?
We'll come out of this in the United States of America.
It's going to come much quicker than I did believe.
What plan will you follow now?
Plan nine.
It's been absolutely impossible to work through these earth creatures.
Their soul is to control.
Our vehicle is illegally parked at One World Trade Plaza.
Oh.
Oh.
Operator, give me the number for 911.
No.
What is it?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say.
Blah, blah, blah.
Ladies and gentlemen of our TV satellite audience, I'm Dr. Michael Kiyosumi.
You are seeing this live around the world.
It's a remote.
Live is what is happening across the East River from New York City.
You are even better seats than these lucky Petrox King Kong contest winners invited here tonight.
And I got a special people.
They think you can be a hero.
Hey, when you're done with that, I got something up here.
You can.
Bye, Doc.
And why don't you beat me like a stinking puss bag?
Well, you got to call that number on a boot.
Sorry about that, guy.
They stick all that dirt in town alone.
That's it.
I'm coming over there.
Yeah.
You got to come over.
I got something for you.
I got something for you.
I got something for you.

Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.
Oh.

Only in New York.
And some of that out.
Bob, no fireworks.
Put that back.
You're the boss.
Sorry, Sparrow.
Get out this time.
What in the hell was that?
Man has always loved his buildings.
But what happens when the buildings say no more?
The best part was when the buildings fell down.
Yeah.
Maybe people got hurt.
Hey, yeah.
And now, a Channel 6 editorial reply.
Boring.
Oh, shoot.
Oh, my God.
Maybe it just collapsed on its own.
We can't take that chance.
You always say that.
I want to take a chance.
Collapsed on its own.
You...
This is all like a bad dream.
Citizens of Springfield,
I officially declare this...
What the hell is that?
Are you all right?
Well, you don't deserve to be.
You were a...
You bloody stupid things.
How could you look at these people?
My God.
It was a bomb.
It was a bomb.
I should have opened it.
It was a tragic strike.
Something that we knew was going to happen.
It comes strictly out of that struggle in the Middle East
that we have been warning about.
As we've shown you the nexus, if you will,
between the terrorism, the Hezbollah, the Hamas,
the Islamic Jihad, and the other.
Self-inflicted.
Self-inflicted agony.
We call the Cassandra complex.
Cassandra, a Greek legend, recalls him down to know the future,
but to be disbelieved when she controlled it.
Hence, the agony of foreknowledge combined with the impotence to do anything about it.
You know something about these terrorists.
This is my lunch house.
Science is more like a clubhouse.
Tony knows the bomb can explode any time of the year, day or night.
He's ready for it.
Duck and cover.
I ducked your head.
I ducked your head.
Under your hands.
Because that way, naturally, if there's a nuclear holocaust and the ceiling caves in,
if you have your hands here, you'll be all right.
You know, I guess hands ricochet concrete.
Duck and cover.
Okay, let's see you duck and cover.

The
Steward was a nickname which for some reason the pros applied to rocket bombs.
Winston promptly flung himself on his face.
The pros were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind.
They seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming,
although the rocket supposedly traveled faster than sound.
Winston clasped his forearms about his head.
There was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave.
A shower of light objects pattered onto his back.
When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window.
He walked on.
The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 meters up the street.
A black plume of smoke hung in the sky and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins.
There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak.
When he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist.
Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so completely covered in blood
that it was completely whitened as to resemble a plastered cat.
Can we have some more music please? I don't want to hear this stuff.
Can we hear more music?
Everything is beautiful in its own way.
That's good.
We will not allow this enemy to win the war by changing our way of life or restricting our freedoms.
Oh right, George, yeah.
Oh, like I can affect that.
Oh, jeez Louise, I can't believe how everything I touch is so unnaturally freighted with import.
Oh, it's a curse to be living in surreal time-seeker's land.
I am so glad we are all in this together, but...
Oh, it's unbelievable how I could be totally uninvolved in what's going on out there.
My material can be totally uninvolved.
The Simpsons are totally uninvolved.
WREK Atlanta.
We're all innocent bystanders in this drive-by shooting.
Oh my goodness, a curse it is to live in interesting times.
Oh, friends, to live in interesting times.
Yes, that was part one of Suzy the Floozy's First War Show.
Part two will come up next week.
All of it first broadcast on beautiful WREK, just as, back during the war, ESO Swamp Radio was broadcast on WCSB Cleveland.
See, he remembers the good war of the past.
When we fought, fought for freedom.
The freedom to pull down your pants and run through the streets screaming.
The freedom to criticize Mom's Thanksgiving turn.
And that lousy head wound that keeps festering.
Yeah, it's time to...
Yeah, it's time to get off.
Another girl, another planet.
It's time to leave this one behind.
See you around.
Yeah.
We are going to be having fun.
Do we really have to wait till July 5th?
I mean, will there be a... Brushwood might get hit. Yeah.
Oh, actually, we don't know when the end of the world might come.
It could come as Batman in the night.
Well...
It could come like the Joker or Batman, either one.
Riddler too?
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank.
It raised itself to full height, flourished the funnel high in the air,
and the ghostly, terrible heat ray struck the town.
As it struck, all five fighting machines exulted,
emitting deafening howls which roared like thunder.
Hula!
Hula!
Hula!
Hula!
Hula!
Hula!
The voice of the devil is heard in our land.
Somewhere, somewhere in spirit.
Listen, do you hear them drawing near in their search for the sinners?
Hula!
I'm beating on the power of our fear and the evil within us.
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread.
When the demons arrive, oh, so long, we'll be better off dead.
There must be something worth living for.
Oh...
There must be something worth trying for
Even something worth dying for
And if one man could stand tall
There must be some hope for a soul
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit
Once there was a time when I believed without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of work is love when it comes to the fight
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might
There must be something worth living for
No, there is nothing
There must be something worth trying for
I don't believe it's so
Even something worth dying for
And if one man could stand tall
There must be some hope for a soul
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man
Didn't I warn that this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth living for
Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs
To the slaughter of a lamb
When the demons arrive
The silver elbows will empty the dead
There must be something worth living for
There is a curse on mankind
There must be something worth trying for
We may as well be resigned
Even something worth dying for
And if one man could stand tall
There must be some hope for a soul
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of
Bob?

No.

Nostril
Dingus, whose name really means
Our Lady Man. I don't know if you thought of that
because it's a silly name anyway,
but she predicted all this.
Does slag
have any relation to slack?
Yeah, that's kind of
important to know right now in these toxic times.
Everything.
Everything has relation to slack,
depending on whether there's too much
or not enough of it.
Do you have your radio up?
Not me.
Where we are struggling
to fight a war against
things we cannot see.
Invisible birds.
Large, invisible parrots
that whisper strange commands
into our ears. It is time
for all Americans to stand
erect as monkeys can
and hold one genuflecting
fist into their own eye.
And scream at the top of its
lungs as well as it can.
I made a picture of a
red, white, and blue bob doing just that.
Oh, praise Bob.
Just tearing himself
up in a rage of war
lust. Praise Bob.
Killing himself in
an intense
fury of patriotic
fervor. So, Stang,
when I fly
my rocket
into

into
the hot
triple A,
and when I'm flying my rocket into the hot tub,
and if I scream out
praise Bob at the last minute,
do I get 70 virgins?
There are no virgins
in the church of the subgenius.
You can imagine they're virgins.
Yeah, you know.
There are even 75 seconds.
Oh, I forgot. There's not 70 virgins in the church.
No. There's not 70 females.
You could have
70 large eunuchs, I think.
And we're creating,
virgins all the time.
Oh, well, then why can't I have 70 of them?
Well, you can. You just may have to wait a while.
This process takes a while.
You have to totally
re-reconvert and totally retrofit
each individual virgin.
They've all got a past that has to be
forgotten, let's just say.
Retrofit.
I don't know why the Taliban
takes it out on the U.S. anyway.
They should be taking it out on the sun.
The sun makes life on Earth. If they hate life so much,
go fly a plane into the sun.
Go piss in the sun.
Well, they distinguish between life
and holy or approved life,
which they know is right,
according to, well,
that guy that said he read it in that book.
And they think they've got
fanaticism tied up.
We've got people who cut their nuts off
and killed themselves
trying to get on the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet.
That is true.
I mean, come on now.
Let's very seriously think
Americans got that Taliban stuff
beat out big time, man.
We cut our nuts off.
You can go chasing after UFOs.
Speak for yourself.
Chaz, I think that's the side America is showing to them
today and the rest of the world
as we sit here on our own onion paper
waiting for the squids to fly.
It's going to be a long and harduous journey
from here to wherever we're going.
It could take a matter of years or even minutes.
Yeah.
Are you prepared as an American?
Are you prepared as a Belgian Frenchman?
They're basically saying
you're going to have to put up with having your phone tapped
Yeah.
red for two years.
Yeah.
I got that.
I did get that.
Well, they are patrolling Lake Erie.
The orange boats are out on the lake.
Yeah, yeah.
They are looking for very good swimmers.
It is kind of cold this time of year,
but we keep on huffing and puffing away.
Well, you know, that's no joke.
There's terror on.
Well, Chaz and I used to run...
I was watching the news tonight
and you know what form terror takes?
Tiny animated light spots on a map on TV.
Yes.
You see this map of a country
and there's these little animated cartoon airplanes
and little bright spots that go,
oh, here's a munitions dump.
I don't know what else they could show
besides talking heads.
Then Major Slapwell sleeps well the rest of the night.
After dropping all his effusisms
and thinking hardly on his wife and doggie,
he passes into a deep slumber,
never remembering.
Never remembering or forgetting
those flashing green lights below him.
Well, you know, there's some brave soldiers
going over there
and there's some brave protesters over here.
Think about the brave hairdressers.
And I totally, totally support those brave soldiers
and those brave people who dare to question
the government and the media.
Can you believe somebody would question
our American media and our American government
Can you imagine?
Can you imagine?
I'm like this.
Well, I think that the part of what those soldiers
are so bravely fighting to defend
is the right of those protesters
to question authority.
Exactly.
And the only ones that I really want to kill
besides the terrorists who killed my countrymen
are the chicken shits that sit there
saying we're going to go kick some ass.
And what they mean is a bunch of young people
that they don't even know
are going to be forced to go risk
getting their asses kicked.
Yeah.
And it just makes me so mad
to hear these fat cats use the word we.
Yeah, they always do.
When they're the kind of people, you know them.
You know, they're the kind that wouldn't have been allowed
in the military even if they had wanted to join.
They're taking their Viagra shots
and passing more bills to kill more people.
Well, so am I, but...
Well, of course you, you know.
Yeah.
Well, I'm not called upon to have great cojones right now
because I'm a 4F civilian.
So, you know, you and me and Chaz were too old to be in that.
That picture.
And we aren't talking about how we're going to kick some ass.
The adventures of Trent Lott.
No.
In the foxhole.
There's some hard-working soldiers
that are going to have to do any ass kicking.
Right.
A lot of top gun boys.
And I hope that they don't have to do very much.
Trent!
I hope they don't have to hardly...
I hope they have to kick only a specific...
I'm over here.
I'm over here.
I heard they're whipping out the 5,000-pound bunker busters.
Two and a half tons of pure shot lead.
Yeah.
The much-vaunted...
Glory for...
Starbusters.
Jehovah.
I can't even imagine all of that stuff.
They drill down like 200 feet into the mountain
and blow up anything that's inside the mountain.
Tonight in the arena, it's Jehovah versus Allah.
What?
Two different names for the same great guy
beating the piss out of himself in front of us.
It's good.
Well, now we've got something to...
The towel.
...to stage at 5X Day, although...
Yeah.
Hopefully, that'll be old history by then.
Well, you know,
you might have got your wish.
Everything might be old history by then
if these fellows continue confabulating their arguments
with teeth and hair.
Because human beings should give each other a smooch,
maybe drop on the floor and pass out for a couple minutes,
wake up into, like, a world of flowers and dingles.
Well, Dave, I think that's unrealistic idealism,
and I'm not a pacifist,
but I will kill anyone who hassles my pacifist war protester buddies.
Those are the rules.
Those are the rules against the lightning.
They haven't seen the heat wave yet.
For my part, I would like to touch on the recent current events
to help explain how they fit in the grand scheme of things.
The recent tragedy in New York, of course,
is for long-time listeners,
no big surprise.
We predicted for years some sort of terrorist attack
that the conspiracy would muster, or allow to happen,
in order to clamp down and snatch away
those few remaining liberties at large.
Look how the lemmings beg for greater control,
greater security.
Oh, polls indicate that the average American
is willing to give up his privacy,
the civil rights, and the Bill of Rights,
if it will make them feel safer.
Even the infamous security cameras,
with face-recognizing technology,
surrounding us here in Ybor City.
They're no longer controversial.
Ho ho ho ho!
Their placement is a fait accompli!
These cameras will start appearing in every public place,
throughout the U.S.,
from the public library to the public bathroom.
Just you watch and see.

They'll be watching and seeing you a lot more from here on out.
The passwords to all the encryption technology
that the governments wanted for years
so that they could spy on your email.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, they couldn't get it before,
but now just you try to stop them!
And, of course, racial profiling.
It was political suicide in August,
but now in September, ha ha ha,
it's suddenly, oh, a sensible precaution.
A few more attacks, my friends,
and the pink public won't be satisfied
until we've recreated the motion picture of Brazil!
All this is necessary, my friends,
because the conspiracy knows that the end times are near.
They sense their time of terror is up,
and Bob's liberation forces,
to free a planet Earth, are fast approaching.
No corporation, no government,
and no Islamic fundamentalist can prevent it!
Give me an amen!
Amen!
If we didn't let the Christian fundamentalists,
with their TV networks,
their countless billions,
and their moral majority, stop Bob,
you think we're gonna allow some,
some glorified Persian rug dealer to stop him?
Hell no!
The only jihad that's going to conquer this planet
is the one led by Ayatollah Bob Dogg!
And that's going to occur, as planned,
on July 5th, 1998!
Do I hear a praise Bob?
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Now I know there are some infidels in the audience
who still don't believe...
Bobby!
Watch Bob!
We're too small, they say.
The conspiracy's too strong, they say.
1998 has come and gone, they say.
To them, I say this.
Have you ever heard of
Exis allies from outer space?
Or,
a certain subgenius phenomenon we call
time control?
You see,
size doesn't matter.
And dates don't matter.
Only Dobbs matters!
The more impossible his mission,
the more certain he will carry it out!
So let the conspiracy fortify itself
and prepare for war.
Let the West nuke the East,
and let the East retaliate in kind.
Go ahead!
Destroy our planet!
We don't care!
You, me, and the other subgeniuses,
we won't even be here!
We'll be watching the fireworks
from sub-space orbit,
while flapping our frap,
biffing our babes,
and praising Bob!
Amen!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!

Woo!
As I hasten through Cotton Garden,
Blackfriars, and Billingsgate,
more and more people join the painful exodus.
Sad, weary women,
their children stumbling and streeped with tears,
their men bitter and angry,
the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts.
Dogs snarled and whined,
the horses' bits were covered with foam,
and here and there were wounded soldiers,
as helpless as the rest.
The
We saw tripods wading up the Thames,
cutting through bridges as though they were paper.
Waterloo Bridge, Westminster Bridge.
One appeared above Big Ben.
Oh, the last!
Oh, no, no!
Never before in the history of the world
had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together.
This was no disciplined march,
it was a stampede.
without order and without a goal,
six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong.
It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,
of the massacre of mankind.
It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,
the massacre of mankind.
It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,
the massacre of mankind.
It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,

It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,
the massacre of mankind.
And I think that they should just give all that money to me.
I'll give it to Bob, and Bob will know what to do with it.
He'll make it grow.
He'll plant that seed.
It's a financial prosperity.
Let's keep things in perspective here, kids.
Let's keep things in perspective.
Bob's got that shovel.
He's got his entrenching tool and his helmet on,
and he's digging his way through that berm.
He's going to get.
Saddam Hussein, Adolf Hitler, Osama Bin Laden,
and Joe Stalin, and A.N.,
General George Armstrong, Custer,
all line up against the wall and blow their heads off.
Praise Bob.
Bob will.
And here come the monsters.
Human mutations growing from out of the earth
with concrete-like heads capable of smashing in your door
and having sex with your mom and dad.
These evil creatures.
They're not at all costs.
And speaking of costs, send me one dollar, please.
All you kids out there under the age of 45,
reach down deep into your pool cue
and snap up a turtle and land it right on my doorstep.
No.
What?
Well, I just had to let go of that.
I wish I could let go like you, Dave.
I wish I could be so uninhabited and just.
Well, Dave.
Dave's kind of like Mr. Ed.
Yeah, I'm like.
I just let one go.
He's a cross between Mr. Ed and Forrest Gump.
And Pan.
Pan, Forrest Gump, and Mr. Ed.
And also, and also your mean algebra teacher
who was always chewing on something
you could never figure out what it was
and he'd jump up and he'd slap you.
Think of it that way if you'd like.
I may have to teach you a valuable lesson
about your own brain, Stang.
Yes, sir.
A valuable lesson.
Yes, sir, I'm listening.
Your brain.
Your brain as an actual organ does not exist.
Oh.
Inside the vast columns of your head
is merely air, nitrogen,
and other subterfugeous gases.
Are you sure?
Shown here on the left,
lovely Miss Marjorie Turks
is taking her crew on a tour through your head.
She's got big knifes.
Oh, yes.
Now it's time for the Ferris wheel.
First, all the ferrets are being lined up
and their teeth are razor sharpened.
Yes.
I did it.
They're going to be ripping your flesh in a real...
Oh, and now it's time to watch the alligators roll by.
Yes, they've got toxic fluids on their fangs.
Look, they're evolving.
Yes, yes.
They're turning into dinosaurs.
Yes, yes.
I like this parade.
This is better than that war.
Yes, and now they're turning into
huge, huge instruments of destruction.
So just sit back and...
Oh, shoot.
It turned into one of those metaphorical sci-fi things.
Yeah.
We've got to be cutting out of here, kids.
We've got to be cutting out of here.
I'm going to go to the zoo.
We're going to uncut this tree.
Until next week,
that old wheel's going to roll around again.
That's right.
It's going to roll around once more.
Hey, keep your hat on tight.
You're back to the winning.
You're sacking the saddle.
Reverend Einstein.
Lonesome.
What are you going to say?
I'm going to go to the world tonight.
I'm just kidding.
Guido just kind of sitting there watching it all.
And Maria just sitting back there looking good.
When love is gone.
Wishing we were spracking deutsch.
We'll see y'all, kids.
Take care.
You're left alone to pay the price is high.
But somehow you'll survive.
Don't give in.
That old wheel will roll around again.
That old wheel is going to roll around once more.
When it does, it will even up the score.
Don't be weak.
As they sow, they will reap.
Burn the other cheek.
And don't give in.
That old wheel will roll around again.
Roll on.
Don't give in.
Don't give in.
Around the world is going to near me down.
I've shoot you in all the ways.






Help me workout.
And when it does
It's gonna even up the score
Don't be weak
As they sow they will reap
Turn the other cheek and don't give in
That old wheel will roll around again
That old wheel
Yeah, that old wheel
Is gonna roll around much more
When it does
When it does
It will even up the score
Don't be weak
Don't be weak
As they sow they will reap
Turn the other cheek and don't give in
Don't give in
That old wheel will roll around again
Roll around and around again
Again
