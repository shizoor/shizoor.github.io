1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
It's chaotic.

2
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,920
Yowl Slack.

3
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,180
I wonder if this works.

4
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,920
I wonder if this works.

5
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,940
All right.

6
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,120
Just tell me.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,680
Just tell me whenever I'm on.

8
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,340
There.

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,180
Is that better?

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,660
All right.

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,340
All right.

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,400
All right.

13
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,680
I see the second hand following, following, following.

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,320
All right.

15
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,100
Boom.

16
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,800
We're on.

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,040
Good hello.

18
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,380
This is Bud Good.

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,720
And I must inform you that Over the Edge will not be heard tonight.

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:44,720
Over the Edge has donated its time so that we can cover the subgenius executive retreat from direct from Sulfur Palms.

21
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,660
And that's where I am now, right near the gate to Sulfur Palms.

22
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,340
I see all the subgenius out there waiting to get in.

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,220
And my co-host tonight will be Puzzling Evidence, founder and co-operator of the subgenius church.

24
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,580
Hello.

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,500
Not the founder.

26
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,460
Is the founder here tonight?

27
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:01,760
Yeah.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,700
I'm the only one who claims that I was not the founder.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Is Mr. Stang here tonight?

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,100
Reverend Ivan Stang is here tonight.

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,860
And so is Philodromon the Overman.

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,820
Good.

33
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,400
Bishop Joy of the Church of St. Stephen.

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,360
Good.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
All the executives are present, it seems.

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,260
And of course, the theme for this year is the next hundred years.

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,380
What will the next hundred years hold the church?

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,780
That's just what I was going to ask you, Puzzling.

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,240
We have to find out from the people that are attending the conference.

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,860
Tonight, the super secret conference.

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,160
This one night retreat will be devoted entirely to the next hundred years.

42
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,120
The future.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,460
There will be food, music, panel discussion.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
The title of which will be the next hundred years.

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,920
Don't miss our awards dinner.

46
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,440
The next hundred years awards.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:46,780
Yeah.

48
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,220
This little mimeograph smudge.

49
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,440
I can't tell what's coming up next.

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Oh, I see the guard there is opening the gate now.

51
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,580
Let's bring them in.

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,340
Here they come.

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,300
It looks like Ivan Stang.

54
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,220
And the church.

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,020
And there's Bishop Joey.

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,180
Bishop Joey, our first executive.

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,900
I can't find my, I have my ticket reservation, but I don't think I have my, the code number.

58
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,500
But can I get my badge anyway?

59
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,300
Is it okay?

60
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,220
Yeah, here.

61
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,540
You're laminating.

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,600
Let's you get it backstage.

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,180
Thanks.

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,680
Okay.

65
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,220
Do you have to buy the lanyard, too?

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
Are you paying for the lanyard?

67
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,200
It's a highly technical evening here where we have all of these.

68
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, there we are.

69
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,220
I see.

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,120
I couldn't see where I was.

71
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,960
My space helmet was all fogged up.

72
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,540
I wonder if I have permission to hand out some flyers for my church.

73
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,920
It's going to be perhaps a little bit of a trying evening, folks.

74
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,800
We have to go through the entire process of imbibing the church, as you will.

75
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,820
We take it and drink the whole church.

76
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,160
We go through the business aspect.

77
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,340
I see Ivan Stang over there on the other side of the field and lies.

78
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,280
I thought they all were trying to get in here.

79
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,960
Where are all the subgenius?

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,440
There's a new bass player for the band.

81
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,940
The schedules weren't printed out.

82
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,720
They're out there at the table in the lobby.

83
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,760
Philo is wandering around confused about where to go.

84
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,560
We don't have some of their mics.

85
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,280
We have remote ambience mics located all over Sulphur Pound tonight.

86
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,100
There's Papa Joe Mama over there.

87
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,280
This has got to be the most amateuristic.

88
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,920
There's In-N-Out, which we can tune into and see what's going on wherever they happen to be.

89
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,300
I think Ivan Stang doesn't like the little umbrellas in his drink.

90
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,000
Could you tell me where the buffet is?

91
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,100
I'd like to start out with the buffet.

92
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,060
It's behind that big tent right there.

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,680
Thank you.

94
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,640
There's a buffet here.

95
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,880
What kind of a chimpanzee zoo?

96
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,260
I can't believe this is supposed to be running.

97
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,680
It's a business meeting.

98
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,240
Oh, there's Mr. Stang.

99
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,040
Yeah, they're hidden away over there.

100
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,360
What do you expect?

101
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,240
Get behind the front and figure out which little space helmet has a vibrator on it.

102
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,380
I'm scared.

103
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,800
Oh, look.

104
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,700
There's the little queen of UFOs.

105
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,380
She's buzzing around the outside of the ship.

106
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:47,920
They're going to see us.

107
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,880
I'd like to ask Mr. Stang a question.

108
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,740
As the founder of the subgenius church...

109
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:52,800
What?

110
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,840
Which network are you with?

111
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:54,960
No, he's not the founder.

112
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm with UMN.

113
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,440
Oh, okay.

114
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,780
Okay.

115
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,100
This is Bud Good.

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,840
I'm with UMN, Puzzling Evidence.

117
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,600
Oh, Bud Good.

118
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:01,900
Right.

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,580
Bud.

120
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,500
So, as the founder of the subgenius church...

121
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,700
That's very funny.

122
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,460
After all these years...

123
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:10,820
Praise Bob.

124
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,340
...trial and tribulation, murder, divorce, I don't know what's been going on, but how

125
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,080
do you feel?

126
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, that's rather a personal question.

127
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,340
How do I...

128
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,880
If I use my fingers, my fingers...

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,400
I reach out with my senses.

130
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,500
I let the sensory world wash over me.

131
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,780
That is how I feel.

132
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,520
In other words...

133
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,320
As a holy man.

134
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,300
In all these years, you've learned nothing.

135
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,060
I put my fingers out, I touch...

136
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,680
Nothing is what we strive for, Bud.

137
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,460
I understand.

138
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,260
That was a compliment.

139
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,740
Yes, we're...

140
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,320
Oh, thank you.

141
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,800
Thank you.

142
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,780
I, too, have learned nothing.

143
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,260
Whatever...

144
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,340
If I said...

145
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,540
Yeah.

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,540
Did I say that?

147
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,600
Then pick up on it.

148
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,100
Now, we're going to move right to the orange.

149
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,100


150
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,100


151
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,100


152
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,660
I'm going to do the organized part of the show right now.

153
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,120
All these subgenius executives are moving into the lodge where they will sit around a

154
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,240
long, oblong, square, oval table.

155
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,520
This place has to be vacuumed in years.

156
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,600
With a big hole in the middle.

157
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,720
And they will have the next hundred years panel discussion.

158
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,240
The subgenius church, the next hundred years, why?

159
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,780
Whence Dobbs and why?

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,940
Whence Dobbs?

161
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,180
That's his brother, Wencesla Dobbs, Polish Dobbs.

162
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,080
Good King James.

163
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,940
High-popped Wences.

164
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,560
It doesn't work at all.

165
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,240
We've already got an 8484435.

166
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,140
It might be Michael Pepe, who was invited to come with us, traipsing through this field

167
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,300
at midnight here.

168
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,620
We're out looking at the moon, the dew between our toes, waiting for the business report.

169
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,200
How many subgenius executives do we have here tonight?

170
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,200
Is it a full quorum?

171
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,120
It really is amazing.

172
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,000
Onan is here.

173
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,360
Papa Joe Mama is here.

174
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,880
Some of these people might not appear on mic, though.

175
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,460
Dr. Howell is here, but his microphone is turned all the way down, as always.

176
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,360
He is not here.

177
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,260
Dr. Howell is not here.

178
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,920
He's not?

179
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,020
No, he's not.

180
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,800
Wait a minute.

181
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,800
If that, then...

182
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,260
Are we now in the panel discussion?

183
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,480
If you're not Dr. Howell, and he's not Dr. Howell, then who's that guy?

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,600
He always votes against the majority, so we tricked him out of town for this weekend.

185
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
So if it does come to a vote tonight, it should be unanimous.

186
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,460
Okay, here's the Howell mask.

187
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,120
So you can...

188
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,360
Oh, no!

189
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,860
I thought that was...

190
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,980
Oh, no!

191
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,760
Little tiny...

192
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:38,580
Well, I wish you radio listeners could see this Howell-larious reproduction death mask

193
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,660
of Dr. Howell.

194
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,720
Too bad we don't have any tapes of him to go with that mask.

195
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,020
Oh, he'll appear later in the show, I'm sure.

196
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,160
There are hours and oodles and hours of show tonight, folks.

197
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,000
Here, puzzling.

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,980
Look, I have my own mic, so actually, you can use this one, and somebody else can use

199
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,340
that one.

200
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm a little worried about the next five minutes.

201
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,800
I have my special U.M.N. remote mic tonight.

202
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,940
As we wander around the grounds here in Sulphur Palm.

203
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,160
And they are...

204
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,720
I see...

205
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,560
The Christmas trees are lighting up like a phone.

206
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,680
Oh, I don't see anything.

207
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,940
Which one is that guy?

208
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,800
Are they going to turn on the lights or what?

209
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,160
Is that that guy?

210
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,240
Hello?

211
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,720
Hello?

212
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,120
So, typical college radio, uh-huh.

213
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,280
I see what's happening.

214
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,940
Sulphur Palm.

215
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,320
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and...

216
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,320


217
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,100
Can I be the first caller?

218
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,500
Yes, you can.

219
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:27,980
Go ahead.

220
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, I'd like to talk to Gary Gaborogfan.

221
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,660
I heard he's going to be on the radio this morning.

222
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,560
Yes, he is.

223
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,840
We're trying to keep this mic down.

224
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,960
Is he cool?

225
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,940
He's a cool man.

226
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,080
Well, I'm going to sleep.

227
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,840
This show is terrible.

228
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,860
What time does the band start?

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,560
No, he's here.

230
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,020
Go ahead.

231
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,680
Speak to him.

232
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,420
Yeah, the drums aren't even out of the box yet.

233
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,600
The drums aren't even out of the box yet.

234
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,440
Not you, caller.

235
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,840
But you know who we have?

236
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,660
Ivan Stang.

237
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,280
Oh, yes.

238
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,340
The queen of UFOs lies...

239
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,060
Hang on, hang on.

240
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,300
...to the U.M.N.

241
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,420
Hello, Mr. Roman.

242
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,200
Okay, I'm sorry.

243
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,660
Hello.

244
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,360
Oh, yes.

245
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,760
Good hello.

246
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,720
I just have one question.

247
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,240
You got one answer?

248
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,280
I want to send you some vinyl that I'm going to be getting, you know, records.

249
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,900
Oh, is this a personal message?

250
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,480
Yeah.

251
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,840
Oh, jeez.

252
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,520
We have to stop the show.

253
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:07,940
Is that the...

254
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,180
Yeah, we can't really deal with personal messages on the air.

255
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:11,720
All right.

256
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,600
This is full-time entertainment here.

257
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:13,800
All right.

258
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,100
I'm sorry.

259
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,360
Bye-bye.

260
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,400
No, that's okay.

261
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,400
What were you going to send me?

262
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,340
Oh, some vinyl, you know, because my grandfather had some records from World War II.

263
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,940
Is there any sound on this vinyl?

264
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,600
Oh, yes.

265
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,120
Oh, good.

266
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,320
My question was, should I send it to your address on your website?

267
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,080
No.

268
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,340
Well, what's that one?

269
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,620
I forget.

270
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,040
I don't know.

271
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,200
Well, I'll just email somebody, I guess, and I'll get the information.

272
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,260
Just had that prediction about Burning Man.

273
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,980
Yeah, email me through the website.

274
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,200
I'll tell you where to send it.

275
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,600
Okay.

276
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,420
Have a good show.

277
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,940
Thank you.

278
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,600
I appreciate all the contributions.

279
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,540
Yes, that was a disturbing prediction that Dobbs made about Burning Man disappearing

280
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,240
by the year 2036.

281
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,700
The church just takes everything and folds it inside themselves.

282
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,280
Now, caller, you're listening and talking to a man.

283
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,280


284
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,460
I'm talking to the amazing lowerarchy of the subgenius church started over two decades

285
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,560
ago in the spooky town of Dallas.

286
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,560
Executive lowerarchy.

287
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,200
Not to be confused with the real hierarchy, which started in 1953.

288
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,300
Right.

289
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,740
It is confusing.

290
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,340
It's a church.

291
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,100
It's a religion.

292
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,020
But that was just Dobbs and Alfred Hitchcock and Dennis Hopper and a few other select individuals.

293
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,460
I feel like I'm descending down the rabbit hole of business.

294
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,240
At some point, we really need the

295
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,260
The church is a church.

296
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


297
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


298
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


299
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


300
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


301
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


302
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


303
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


304
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


305
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


306
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


307
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,260


308
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,760
This is just like a James Bond set.

309
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,520
Where's the drummer?

310
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,280
It is.

311
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,780
Oh, the drummer's in for the spider.

312
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,700
Well, I can see we're going to have some problems getting to the panel.

313
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,800
People just don't want to be that organized here.

314
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,520
Okay.

315
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,000
Great.

316
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,460
So it's going to be so much fun.

317
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:41,940
Oh, yeah.

318
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,680
That's really good.

319
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,880
Plus, David Meyer's supposed to be calling in today.

320
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,360
Oh, great.

321
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,480
Because I was really hoping other doctors would happen like Byron Werner's here.

322
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,100
Who are these guys talking about?

323
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,880
I vaguely remember these names.

324
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,700
David Meyer, he's a skier.

325
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,780
Oh, is it?

326
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,160
Cowboy Dave is here.

327
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,040
But he's partying up here.

328
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,180
Famous long ago.

329
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,700
Dinosaurs of slack.

330
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,260
Digital insert here.

331
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,280
Back in the day, that is day one.

332
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,920
Was that the Permian or the Devonian or the Carbonaceous?

333
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,540
Carboniferin.

334
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,000
Or the Carbonated Age.

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,640
It was the Carbon Fiber Age.

336
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,780
The Carbonated Peanut Butter got all over the microphone and was not usable for the rest

337
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,180
of the show.

338
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,860
Yes.

339
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,160
Either was Hal, so.

340
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
And it tickled my nose.

341
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,100
That's your nose?

342
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:36,640
Yeah.

343
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,320
Uh-oh.

344
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,020
Where's the Frock Workshop, please?

345
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,340
Somebody gave her coffee.

346
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,060
Hey, I was wondering about that, too.

347
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,900
Where is the Frock Workshop?

348
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,080
The Frock Workshop.

349
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,100
The Frock Workshop.

350
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,280
Now I feel like the...

351
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,320
What was it we were doing?

352
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,880
The Frock Workshop.

353
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,520
We have to go to the Frock Workshop.

354
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,520


355
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,520


356
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,520


357
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,520


358
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,520


359
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,940
We have to start again.

360
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,180
We have to begin the show now.

361
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,600
It's the radio show.

362
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
Get everybody lined up.

363
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,060
First.

364
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,460
Everybody has to be lined up.

365
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, is this those shots again?

366
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,080
That's one of the inspections.

367
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,340
Line them up and shot.

368
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,860
Short arm inspection.

369
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,260
When does the horrible theme music begin?

370
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,740
When do we get to go to Malaysia adoption?

371
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,700
All right.

372
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,060
Who's hosting this panel?

373
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,680
I guess you should be, bud.

374
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,360
I think Mr. Stank should host the panel in the next hundred years.

375
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,860
Well, he's certainly the primary easement.

376
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,500
As we gather together to commence this augustion, we shall be the first to be in the world to

377
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,500


378
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,740
host the Flock.

379
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,000
First assembly...

380
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,080
What?

381
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,200
Who's here?

382
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,940
Now that sounds...

383
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,360
Is he drunk?

384
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,940
That sounds too definite.

385
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,940
It's not august.

386
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,760
I mean, actually it's a big question, the next hundred years.

387
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:33,920
He is drunk.

388
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,360
It is a huge question.

389
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,020
And we should...

390
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,300
And we really need Philo Drummond.

391
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,500
He can barely stand up.

392
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,120
He's who we need because he's the business manager, the closest to giving everybody the

393
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,000
business of all the doctors here today.

394
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,520
Actually, Jesus replaced Philo.

395
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:47,840
Oh yeah.

396
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,180
No.

397
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,280


398
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,380
Philo is here tonight.

399
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,040
Because Jesus is not here, unfortunately.

400
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
He's not with us.

401
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He's busy during the season.

402
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,620
Yeah.

403
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,260
This is his...

404
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,660
The season of turnover.

405
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,260
Yep.

406
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,880
And he couldn't be with us, which would be great.

407
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,260
So the closest we have to an old-fashioned businessman is Philo Drummond because Philo

408
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,320
Drummond works for the conspiracy.

409
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,960
Always has.

410
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,540
Always will.

411
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,040
Yep.

412
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,200
Well, you know...

413
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,820
Jesus or...

414
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,200
Or Jilo.

415
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,360
Jilo.

416
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,640
I've got a Philo like no Philo you've ever seen.

417
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,580
Jilo.

418
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,300
Jilo the Torturer.

419
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,760
Give me some sound.

420
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,160
He's the most tortured businessman.

421
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,740
He's gonna replace Bob.

422
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,520
Yeah, everybody's tired of Bob.

423
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,740
We got this new Jilo thing.

424
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,820
Now, the flash is gonna bounce off that little glass window.

425
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,620
We're gonna make a million bucks off Jilo.

426
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,540
He smokes a cigarette instead of a pipe.

427
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,280
Which guy?

428
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,300
The Eeyore of the church?

429
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,200
I think it was Jilo.

430
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,780
Jilo Dummond.

431
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,380
Jilo was held in great honor by the tribe.

432
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,180
I don't know why.

433
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,640
I don't wanna be on my radio show.

434
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,500
See, we just invented another church.

435
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,740
Bud Goods just gave him another church.

436
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:51,740


437
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:51,740


438
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:51,740


439
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:51,740


440
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:51,740


441
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:51,740


442
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:51,740


443
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,240
They never say, huh.

444
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,080
Well, that's that one.

445
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,580
He's the most talented cappuccino stand.

446
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,680
Nobody here knows how to say it.

447
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,460
Praise Jilo.

448
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,620
Huh.

449
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,120
Huh.

450
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,640
Huh.

451
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,020
Huh.

452
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,060


453
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,360


454
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,120
Huh.

455
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,280
Huh.

456
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,280


457
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,600
Huh.

458
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,300
Huh.

459
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,720
Now, see, even...

460
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,000
You can even trace the evolution of the...

461
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,380
Huh.

462
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,440
Ah.

463
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:18,480
All the way from that basic up to the now rather stylized...

464
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,080
Huh.

465
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,700
Huh.

466
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Huh.

467
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,860
And also, it's regional.

468
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,140
There is the California...

469
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,560
Huh.

470
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,540
Huh.

471
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,040
Huh.

472
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,380
Huh.

473
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,880
And what was the Texas one?

474
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,980
Well, the original Drumundian...

475
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,120
Huh.

476
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,680
Ah.

477
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,920
Which became messy very quickly.

478
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,420
Well, that's why it was truncated.

479
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,180
Way in the background.

480
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,100
You gotta get by a mic there.

481
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,780
Philo Drummond...

482
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,620
Into the politically correct...

483
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:40,880
Yeah, mic that...

484
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,040
He's over by the stage.

485
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,000
Um, no one...

486
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
Mic that Dr. Drummond.

487
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:44,920
Yes.

488
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
Mic that whole other room.

489
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,760
How about this mic?

490
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,300
Does it work?

491
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,600
But as we've asked for 20 years,

492
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,760
is this church to devolve into nothing but inside jokes squeals and funny sounds?

493
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,980
I second that.

494
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,840
I heard it.

495
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,700
And for 20 years it has done exactly that.

496
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,640
Bob!

497
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,060
Praise Bob!

498
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

499
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,500
Praise Jilo!

500
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,760
Oh yeah, that's right, Jilo!

501
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,260
Praise Jilo!

502
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,140
Praise Jilo!

503
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,500
Let's go back to the old church and...

504
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,740
Oh, check, check, check.

505
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,920
Yep, back, back, back in time.

506
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,780
Watch those calendar pages all the way.

507
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,840
Laurie's birthday party, that's an amazing one.

508
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,480
Am I on?

509
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,820
That's a pretty good one.

510
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,380
That was...

511
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,440
So we'll talk about that later, but right now, folks, it's the business.

512
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,620
Richard's not going to die and the band can get back together.

513
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,120
Dr. Esselstarek, are you dumping it into the tree?

514
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,560
All right, boys, the proceeds from the last Janer tape amounted to...

515
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,980
100 million, about 15769.

516
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,220
And of course, with the...

517
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,840
And the old church, Janer, and there was Sterno...

518
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,220
At 12% each, that means you all get here, six, seven, eight, dollars, nine...

519
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,660
Like Buck.

520
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,040
Yeah, that's it.

521
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,840
Buck naked.

522
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,060
You're not allowed to say Buck naked in the church no more.

523
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,220
Is that that new mail?

524
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,220
There are all these Texan churches, but we'll just turn off that sound effect.

525
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,780
If he was Dana's child, support we can say Buck naked.

526
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:11,880
You'll write to caller number 18.

527
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,960
You've been chosen from the Christmas tree of callers, and you now can address the show doctors.

528
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,900
Please ask questions.

529
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,500
848-442-38, 848-442-38.

530
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,640
That's a rather vague question.

531
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,200
Well, it's one of those Zen questions, apparently.

532
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,020
About five hours of building a church.

533
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,540
If you consider yourself a musician, in a sense...

534
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,200
No, no, no, I didn't say do your show on our show.

535
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,060
He does that on our show, too.

536
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,340
Oh, he does that on all the shows.

537
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,180
Oh, I have a question.

538
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,040
I got an answer?

539
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,880
Yes, I was wondering, is it all right if I knock my friend out with a shovel and bury

540
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:47,880


541
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,100
him in the backyard like they did in that one Beavis and Butt-Hitch show?

542
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,760
Good, hello.

543
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,780
If you mark the grave clearly.

544
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,720
Okay.

545
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,620
Only if you videotape it and send it to America's Funniest Home Videos.

546
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,780
Because if you don't tape it, it didn't happen.

547
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,660
Right, exactly.

548
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,740
And if it...

549
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,900
Not only that, nowadays, why everybody tapes everything, if it doesn't appear somehow on

550
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,680
TV, it didn't happen.

551
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,740
Well, I can always play it on the underground TV.

552
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,020
Well, that sort of happens.

553
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,400
America's Funniest Home Videos.

554
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,360
Funniest Home Internment.

555
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,160
But really, you should be asking a question of a doctor.

556
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,640
You have an amazing opportunity here to go back to the beginning.

557
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,860
I would like to know what's going to happen in the next hundred years if there's still

558
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,340
going to be LSD available.

559
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,840
Well, there hasn't been any available.

560
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,360
Of course.

561
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,200
But I don't know if it's ever going to be available again in the next hundred years.

562
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,260
I'd like to know what's going to happen in the Middle East.

563
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,740
I'd like to know if religion has...

564
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,240
Two months.

565
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,120
I've only waited two months and then the new little...

566
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,500
Well, why don't you just take that acid trip there and just relax there, buddy.

567
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,580
And then a hundred years from now, there'll be this skull with just these two metal teeth

568
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:41,740
around.

569
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,800
You talk about the Middle East, you talk about Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois...

570
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,120
Hey, there's nothing to trip about, man.

571
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,140
You know, the world is...

572
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,500
The world ends, the world ends, you know?

573
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,820
What about that LSD I sold you last night on Telegraph Avenue?

574
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,760
What about all that LSD we sent to the Middle East last year?

575
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,160
Yeah, okay.

576
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,280
What about all the LSD we just took just an hour ago?

577
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,900
Oh, that LSD!

578
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,660
That LSD!

579
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,740
I was wondering.

580
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,700
That explains a lot.

581
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,320
That explains a hell of a lot.

582
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,240
It does, though, huh?

583
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,860
What?

584
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,760
Hello?

585
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,760
I should have given him the bad acid again.

586
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,340
Are we going to get hit by a meeting?

587
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,700
We'll talk to my friend.

588
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,180
LSD trip.

589
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,140
Then he'll hook you up.

590
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,560
Yep, good.

591
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,000
You should know the one named Half Acid shows.

592
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,840
You're just going to drown in your own natural stupidity, don't worry about it.

593
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:23,780
Here, here.

594
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,880
Oh, no.

595
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,000
Good God.

596
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,400
Okay.

597
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,000
They're rocking out already.

598
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,820
Something we'd like to play for you out there in radio land is a little something that

599
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,160
kind of goes a little something like this.

600
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,740
A little something.

601
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,580
Well, that's a little something, all right.

602
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,980
Yeah, it's a nice song, though.

603
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,440
You know, really, the past, the present, and the future is just one big cycle, I believe.

604
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,700
Is that what you mean?

605
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,220
Right?

606
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,600
Huh?

607
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,140
Like a little something.

608
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,140


609
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,140


610
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,400
What's that?

611
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,020
Men I like to hear at the street.

612
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,400
You're like, there you go, Mal.

613
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:00,900
Loop clank, everything.

614
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:00,900


615
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:00,900


616
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:00,900


617
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,040
When I'm on the street, like a gooditet, gonna Franstopp sing our hit.

618
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,120
Now you already heard that?

619
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,120


620
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,700
You really like to hit the

621
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,700
性

622
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,820
and that's all you get right there.

623
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:17,120
Get the hang of it, son.

624
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,640
Yeah.

625
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,260
going to go i am not the fan of religion that uh i'm sure that the religious people would like to

626
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:30,040
hear on the air true church well that was was that was that gylo himself that just called it

627
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:40,300
notice he didn't use the pretty blue i find it to be dangerous prejudicial childish and and now i

628
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:47,720
think we need to realize that it's uncomfortable that could get you killed and facing 2009 death

629
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,240
of religion church of the subgenius was again left with the burning question

630
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:03,280
where does the church go for the next 91 years well according to the science of psyche history

631
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,200
uh the uh the stang plan calls for gylo to be retired fairly soon within the next five

632
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,280
weeks or so and then the church is going to be retired fairly soon within the next five years

633
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:18,260
or ten minutes and uh well then we have to move on to the next deity the merchant uh prince

634
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,660
you know who is apparently some kind of pop star let's trade the church for a winning lottery

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,980
It is pretty amazing.

669
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,600
That's what I'm saying.

670
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,660
If you get a 484-425, you'd see all of these amazing doctors in their amazing normal state here, naked on the air.

671
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,300
Well, I thought that was the press.

672
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,920
All those guys with the cameras, those are the other doctors?

673
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,560
No, those are the waiters and the chefs.

674
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,100
The new doctors?

675
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,840
I don't know who any of these guys are.

676
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,640
They're the waiters, the chefs.

677
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,440
I guess I've been holed up in that ivory tower in Dobstown for so long.

678
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,940
I don't know who any of these people are.

679
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,820
All living beings.

680
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,200
This is a test, test, test.

681
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,560
Is it butter?

682
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,440
Can I have a collar?

683
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,120
Can you pass the gravy?

684
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,320
Thanks.

685
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,580
Hey, does Acid Burnout Man ever call this show?

686
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,580
No.

687
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,580
He calls the Cleveland show a lot.

688
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,680
I can hear the doctors.

689
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,420
Some of the doctors are in there skinning their cats.

690
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,920
Is that what they call it?

691
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,160
That's what your kids call it now.

692
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,120
They're skinning the cats.

693
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,920
They're taking the bones out of them.

694
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,040
They're taking the bones out of them now.

695
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,840
It's a really horrible, horrible thing,

696
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,740
but that's the only way they can get their instruments tuned.

697
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,660
All living beings must eat.

698
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,020
It's not for food.

699
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,240
They don't even eat them.

700
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,300
They just use the cat gut to tune their instruments with.

701
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,540
Oh, look, Philo's giving a speech.

702
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,220
Cats use birds to tune their instruments with.

703
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,800
Well, what about the next hundred years?

704
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,040
What's going to happen?

705
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,860
I'm just concerned about this.

706
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,380
Where do I get the coffee in the next five minutes?

707
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,260
And where are the hookers?

708
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,520
They were supposed to be at this convention.

709
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,640
We got the coffee.

710
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,240
And what kind of way?

711
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,680
The hookers are down by the swimming pool.

712
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,820
I'm going to head down to the swimming pool myself.

713
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,780
What are you talking about, hookers?

714
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,000
General Hooker of the Union Army.

715
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:03,100
I'm going to be taking my bathing suit, heading down to the swimming pool.

716
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,460
I've got General Hooker's skull here.

717
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,860
Is that G. Gordon Gordon?

718
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,660
It sure is.

719
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,920
I'm going to take the skull.

720
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,120
I've got the skull down there with me.

721
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,840
It's David Meyer, actually.

722
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,720
I thought this was the Church of the Subgenius.

723
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,780
No, no, it's not.

724
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,820
The Church of the Subgenius.

725
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,420
That's right.

726
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,680
How did you get in here?

727
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,360
Do you have your pass?

728
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,480
No, no, this is the Church of the Duh Genius.

729
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,240
That's the trademark.

730
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,540
Do you have a pass?

731
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,720
How did you get in here?

732
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,280
Okay, so please ask your question.

733
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,440
Do you want to hear about the subgenius?

734
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,660
You're not wearing your pass.

735
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,140
You can ask any question about the subgenius and learn amazing things secretly.

736
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,180
Especially about the next hundred years.

737
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,960
Yeah.

738
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,560
What do you want to know about the next hundred years?

739
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:37,920
Yeah.

740
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,080
I know about slugs.

741
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:40,960
Slugs?

742
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,580
Yeah.

743
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,000
Okay, what will slugs be like in the next hundred years to the Church of the Subgenius members?

744
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,860
Just the same as they are today.

745
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,540
Oh, that's okay.

746
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,880
That's the good thing about slugs.

747
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,400
They just basically never change.

748
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:50,740
But what of progress?

749
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,900
What of evolution?

750
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,660
Something you can count on.

751
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,300
What of forward striving?

752
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,620
What of...

753
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,900
Slugs thumb their noses.

754
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,560
If a slug had a nose...

755
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,620
Can we not learn a slack from the slug?

756
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,400
...and a thumb, they would thumb their noses at the very thought of evolutionary progress.

757
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,920
I'll bet none of you have ever seen slugs.

758
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,880
Slugs screwing.

759
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,720
Yeah, but you know what?

760
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,560
Don't bet.

761
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,580
It's bad for you.

762
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,180
You've been using drugs.

763
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,400
It can lead to addiction.

764
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,480
Well, a long time ago.

765
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,640
No, and the effects are still with you now.

766
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,480
You must have used that frog stuff that never wears off.

767
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,340
I'm sorry.

768
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,880
You're having a flashback right now.

769
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,300
Would you please get off the ceiling?

770
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,160
Slugs screwing all in a circle.

771
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,180
Get off the ceiling.

772
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,120
Just take a deep breath.

773
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,980
You'll be okay.

774
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,480
You know what?

775
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,640
The other thing is you could be...

776
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,020
There he goes.

777
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,820
That's what slugs do.

778
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,080
Yeah.

779
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,900
When the slugs are having intercourse with each other, it's really something that's

780
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
very magic.

781
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,780
He's watching that one part in Microcosmos.

782
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,800
He just watches that one over and over and over again.

783
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,900
Slugs are hermaphroditic.

784
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,740
Isn't that correct?

785
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,720
I mean, some of them.

786
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,800
At least the last one that I was with was.

787
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,740
Did you chew its penis off, Dr. Drummond, in order to change its sex before you used

788
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:57,940
it?

789
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,280
Well, I didn't actually have to chew it.

790
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,420
I used a surgical instrument that I keep in my back pocket just for that purpose, alongside

791
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,520
the ketchup bottle I keep back there.

792
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:07,880
Okay.

793
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,600
That's right.

794
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:08,880
As well.

795
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,340
The ketchup bottle and the slug castrator.

796
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,100
The ketchup bottle's for special effects, right?

797
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,800
The ketchup bottle, the slug castrator, and my pocket knife.

798
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,100
What is the antenna go out and becomes male and then goes back to traction and then becomes

799
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,620
female because they do it with their antennas and...

800
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,040
They do it with their antennas.

801
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,980
They pull their antenna in and they're a female.

802
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,400
They push it out and they're a male.

803
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,200
I wish I could do that.

804
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,660
And when they're done, they stab each other with their lung daggers and they both get

805
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:33,980
pregnant.

806
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,400
Man, now that's advanced.

807
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:36,640
That's the quality.

808
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,880
That's the way it should be.

809
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:37,880


810
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:37,880


811
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:37,880


812
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:37,880


813
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:37,880


814
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:37,880


815
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:37,880


816
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,480
They've been doing it right for thousands and thousands of years.

817
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,320
Can I pass the peas, please?

818
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:41,760
Thank you.

819
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,160
Wait, now haven't you read my research paper in slug nanotechnology?

820
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,100
Chicken tastes like rubber.

821
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,660
Who's catering?

822
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,200
Did you say slug nanotechnology?

823
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,080
I thought the quote was this rubber tastes like chicken.

824
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,460
I'll admit.

825
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:51,980
Yes, it is nanotechnology.

826
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,400
Now that's what I'm talking about.

827
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:53,800
Yeah.

828
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,440
Well, bubbles.

829
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,020
Is that like the same as the bubble tech?

830
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,560
That's how I can have some cereal at 3 AM like I'm home.

831
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,060
Or is it, yeah, is it...

832
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,080
Is this mind deprogramming hurts?

833
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,040
No, no.

834
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,620
It's analog.

835
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,700
Analog.

836
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,040
Okay.

837
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:07,860
That's what I'm talking about.

838
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:07,860


839
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:07,860


840
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,820
It's in a log.

841
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,360
Okay.

842
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,360
You put it in the log and then you squeeze the log real hard and it comes out the back

843
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,700
end.

844
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,700
Millions of slugs emerge.

845
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:16,940
Yeah.

846
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,520
So slugs do merge slowly into the highway lanes and cause wrecks.

847
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,260
Aren't we getting ready for some kind of dinner or something we're supposed to go to

848
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,520
here?

849
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,300
I'm getting hungry.

850
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,300
You, Philo.

851
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,120
It's happening.

852
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,700
Oh, it's happening right now.

853
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:30,860
Yeah.

854
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,620
Everybody's eating and talking right now.

855
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:32,980
Okay.

856
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,660
Where's my food?

857
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
Where's my dinner?

858
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,560
I want my dinner.

859
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,140
We're a little short on help tonight.

860
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,660
I'm waiting for my sandwich.

861
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,740
Your free sandwich for being on the show?

862
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,240
I'm waiting for my hooker.

863
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,520
What about the business report?

864
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,480
Oh, the business report.

865
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,080
Investments, you know.

866
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,800
Oh, yeah, investments.

867
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,180
Yeah, we made some investments.

868
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,520
We made some good ones.

869
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,580
We made some bad ones.

870
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,740
We made some ones that were good in the long haul but short in the short haul.

871
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,300
My new slug hooker technology.

872
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,900
The good thing about our business investments is that they continue on and we use a special

873
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,860
secret technique.

874
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,900
We've derived from a little atom that we got out of Bob's brain years and years ago.

875
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,240
We put it inside of a triangle along with these crystal pyramids.

876
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,660
Pyramids.

877
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,940
This crystal pyramid.

878
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,600
Wow.

879
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,080
That's cool.

880
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,740
And that does two things for us.

881
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:31,740
It predicts the future infallibly and it helps us determine what our next week's menu will

882
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:31,980
be.

883
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,760
Well, it makes the banana peel stronger.

884
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,740
It makes the banana come off of the banana peel faster.

885
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,840
And it makes the banana peel more beautiful.

886
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:37,840


887
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,100
It makes the riser blade sharper.

888
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,360
Sharper but only while you're cutting.

889
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,600
And yet smoother and softer.

890
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:54,160
For the softest, smoothest shave you could expect from any slug.

891
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,140
A slug shave.

892
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,260
Crawling along a straight riser.

893
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,720
Leaving the trailing, leaving the little droppings behind.

894
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,720
The sludge trail.

895
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,440
Oh, it sounds like we're in a storm.

896
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,020
Is the prayer over?

897
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,620
I sure hope we, did we put a roof on this thing?

898
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,480
I think the fair.

899
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,060
Is the prayer over?

900
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,760
I predict that the entertainment personalities and nothing else will be in the future.

901
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,540
Okay, amen.

902
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,120
Now let's eat.

903
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,020
We'll be entertainment personalities and nothing else.

904
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,400
Sergeant Vredes, what were you just saying about the, uh.

905
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,020
Some prediction.

906
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,700
The future, if you want a picture of the future.

907
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


908
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


909
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


910
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


911
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


912
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


913
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


914
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


915
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


916
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:36,700


917
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,780
Of the next hundred years.

918
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,800
When someone pays admission to hear a singer or a comedian.

919
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
But really, what about the.

920
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,440
Radio isn't about pictures.

921
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,720
It's about images.

922
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,720
Wow, where'd you learn that, New York?

923
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:00,440
Yeah, I, I, I went to school for a lot of, you know, borrowed money, uh, all that.

924
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,980
And that's all I came out with.

925
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,500
So it wasn't pictures all along.

926
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,220
It was images.

927
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
That explains everything.

928
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,980
That's where we went wrong.

929
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,740
You mean, I always thought it was.

930
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,280
You mean JPEG?

931
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,040
Graphic, graphic portrayals of, of auditory devices.

932
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,960
I promise to do better.

933
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,220
Graven images.

934
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,140
That's all it is.

935
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,680
Graven images.

936
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,400
That's all it is.

937
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,340
Makes.

938
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,380
Let's get this next hundred years out on the table right now.

939
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,580
Let's, let's kind of roll it around and look at it and let's see if it's what we really want to do.

940
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,580
It will not tolerate protest messages.

941
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,200
Let's auto-tolerate protest messages.

942
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,780
Let's autopsy this hundred year plan and see what gas rises out of it.

943
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,680
Oh man, that stinks.

944
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,000
I've had some bad luck with gas recently.

945
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:54,220
And, uh, so I won't go there right now, but if you, yeah, if something, if you, if you have a bad smell later, then.

946
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:01,120
The next hundred years is a prairie squid crawling along a straight razor forever.

947
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,100
No, a straight edge.

948
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,940
Just the straight edge.

949
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,200
Yeah.

950
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,900
Okay, cue music.

951
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,500
No, we don't care.

952
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,600
Razor, blade, anything sharp.

953
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,520
It's gotta be sharp.

954
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,540
It's gotta be sharp.

955
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,480
It's gotta have a slug on it and it's gotta be in the future.

956
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:20,980
And, you know, with the snorting and the pig technology in the future.

957
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,440
There's no feedback what we make for now.

958
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,820
All right.

959
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,240
So where's that one guy who's got that, that one, the one thing that's supposed to make this show the best show?

960
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,000
Bob?

961
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,480
He's outside.

962
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,140
He's outside.

963
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,800
Oh, he has the slack and that is what we needed.

964
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,600
We haven't let him in, but he didn't show up again.

965
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,780
I think something was missing.

966
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,740
Where is he?

967
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,100
Where is that guy?

968
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,860
Where is that pipe guy?

969
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,140
Where's that what?

970
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,920
Where is that Bob Dobbs?

971
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,280
I think.

972
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,400
Where is that pipe guy?

973
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,900
I disagree with Chairman Bob.

974
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,100
Where are those ex-men?

975
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,380
Once again, we are exes-less.

976
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:57,780
There he'll be with the chairman, Bob.

977
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,020
This exes-lessness mess.

978
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,920
We once again get to stay upon the same.

979
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:03,920


980
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:03,920


981
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:03,920


982
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:03,920


983
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:03,920


984
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:03,920


985
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:03,920


986
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:03,920


987
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,300
We're going to the end of the earth.

988
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,720
It's chaotic.

989
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,640
It's chaotic.

990
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,780
Thanks to the non-rival of Bob's business partners, the men from Father Dex.

991
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,700
What a mission board.

992
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,340
Oh no.

993
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,800
Oh no, it's followed me here.

994
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,900
I was trying to escape this horrible show.

995
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,300
I've come all the way here to the left coast and the horrible, horrible other show has

996
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,420
pursued me.

997
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,680
Oh.

998
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,080
Oh.

999
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:31,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920


1005
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920

00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920


1007
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920


1008
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920


1009
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920


1010
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920


1011
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920


1012
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920


1013
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920

00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:33,920


1015
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,620
God, I'm sorry.

1016
00:33:38,340 --> 00:34:00,140

00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,140

100 years and what's in it in the church and I hope that you don't hold any of

1043
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:49,120
those those allegations of abuse and corporate fraud that we have they've been

1044
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:56,200
level I know I know I know but really it's it's it's all false when the truth

1045
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,800
comes out it's just there's there's nothing there I mean it's just our

1046
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,300
enemies

1047
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,780
they do that they've done that for years they've gotten into our books

1048
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,620
they've changed our Ledgers they've actually recorded things that didn't

1049
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,400
exist and and when the IRS came in we didn't have any choice but just to deny

1050
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,800
it we weren't there and we did not do that we didn't we didn't we really didn't

1051
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,400
I didn't have sex with that woman miss Lewinsky race ability I swear or any

1052
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:33,460
other woman but right in particular uh the the allegations of abuse of the state

1053
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,500
I mean it's just not true it's just not true you don't need to go into that much

1054
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:44,400
detail Dr Drummond so uh but say whatever your stocks are up uh expenses are down uh

1055
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,220
security are the uh we've funded our we've given our share to the funding of the Homeland

1056
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:58,240
security for the we want one of those those Star Wars uh satellites to hover over our

1057
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,040
headquarters building we think it's important that it be close to us

1058
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,220
so

1059
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,880
we will have our own private Star Wars defense shield

1060
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:17,100
I spent I know those are very dependable we had this sacrifice well you know it's

1061
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,640
we figured three out of three out of ten is better than none out of ten

1062
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,300
they work as well as computers and besides it's the government that's paying for it we

1063
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,560
don't have to pay for it it's the government that's paying for it

1064
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,780
we

1065
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,060
we don't have to pay for it I thought that in visibility hand Guy we're gonna

1066
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,720
tax The Land this time we're not going to tax people anymore we're going to tax The Land

1067
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,620
and and once The Land pays up their taxes the people will be really happy oh he tried this

1068
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:55,020
a hundred years ago and it only got us this far well we have to go we could only go a hundred

1069
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:01,020
years at a time that was the last hundred years the smallest agreement we could afford stay focus

1070
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:06,500
time and now maybe for the next hundred years we might break it up into like 50 year units

1071
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:14,920
you know like two big two and a quarter 50 year units a 50 year plan instead of a hundred year

1072
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,700
plan that's radical well you know the change you're moving too fast the pace of change has

1073
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:26,100
gotten to be such that we can't we can no longer rely on the the far that the the outer reaches of

1074
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:30,500
our hundred year plan we've got to we've got to have a more tactical approach to things we have

1075
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,740
to know what's going to happen like say 20 minutes from now it doesn't help us to know what's going

1076
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:42,520
to happen 20 years from now right now i mean we got to know like should i should i put my hand in

1077
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:51,300
my pocket and or should i you know resist the urge to to urinate on dr drummond dr drummond

1078
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:57,240
dobbs gave us a rule book of life but it's not a hard and fast thing that dictates every whether

1079
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,080
you should put your hand in your pocket every five minutes

1080
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:10,360
what what something somebody's there's some uh another another feed that's feeding in here

1081
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,920
some guy is playing cymbals it's a hari krishna guy over there and i think what are we selling

1082
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,480
we didn't we weren't other cults well actually we weren't allowing any other cults in here this

1083
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,400
is an exclusive cult we we are we're completely we only want member our members in here the people

1084
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:37,880
we can't have these freeloaders you know freeloading off our cult you know this is a cult of the people

1085
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,040
a cult for the people and by the people the rich people we've got a well the richest of the poor

1086
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,160
people and the poorest of the rich people are all together here uh in one cult one i'm beginning to

1087
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,400
understand why we let dr control the business end of things yeah it's an amalgam amalgam a deposit

1088
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,360
it's a complete deposit he learned that at bob bob talked to drummond every

1089
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:06,420
thing he knows piled up in big piles and you know the graphics the graphics behind that

1090
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:15,180
will go into the the median uh expenditures and on on the side there we can see how if we track

1091
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:22,900
this particular uh extrapolate that out to its uh ultimate um nth degree then you can see that

1092
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:30,320
we're going to make about 15 cents off of every third unit on the 12th of each uh month and

1093
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,780
uh the deposits will be coming in they're going to be rolling in

1094
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,140
hey put those bolt cutters down put those bolt cutters down

1095
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,900
no you can't have the those are my bolt cutters now hey uh guard would you take this uh gentleman

1096
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:58,820
out of here please and take his harmonica with him please yeah that's horrible don't

1097
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,360
don't let the guard play the harmonica

1098
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:07,180
what about all these allegations about corruption corruption uh well you know people have talked

1099
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:11,620
about how bad we are for years but few people talk about how good we are i mean that's the one

1100
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:18,520
thing that we take a lot of heat for being like the world's worst cult the world's most hated cult

1101
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:25,840
stingiest cult corruption the world's most corrupt but people don't talk about how really good we are

1102
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,240
you know how great we are and the greatness of well and the purity of the

1103
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:30,800
world itself are pretty divine i mean who does it you know we have to start with

1104
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,740
corruption you see if you start out from a base of absolute and total corruption you

1105
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:42,700
can't be bought out well that's true i mean we started the lowest common denominator큰

1106
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,740
nobodywe can only go up from here folks so i mean it's gonna it's like smooth sailing

1107
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:53,260
for the next six or eight years then at the eight-year point we're going to meet a slight

1108
00:41:53,260 --> 00:42:00,420
blip in this chart that will illustrate such we're going to hammer it down on this big

1109
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:00,480
soup telefonics bass drum ate this little incredible thing don't make your celebration

1110
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,480


1111
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,480


1112
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,480


1113
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,280
hammer here and then smooth things out. We're going to extrapolate the linear

1114
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,600
regression over this way. See over there? Oh it's smoothing! Yeah it's smoothing.

1115
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,760
That's a great... We're using a smoothing formula there. That computer simulation is gorgeous.

1116
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:24,260
You can see all the sharp edges are now dull. How much of the church's budget did we

1117
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:29,560
spend on that computerized pie graph, that animated pie graph, Dr. Drummond?

1118
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:34,740
Well I'm sure it'll all come out in the bill, in the billing at the end when we get the bill

1119
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:39,460
from this wonderful resort here that we're staying at. Yeah well I'm just a little concerned.

1120
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:46,040
What is this? Maybe the business meeting is costing more than the company's profits this

1121
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,120
particular year. We're just going to, well you know, we're going to take it out of the,

1122
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,920
we'll take it out, well Bob will provide. That's the thing we have to remember here.

1123
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,320
You know? And that we will

1124
00:42:59,320 --> 00:42:59,540
survive. We will survive. We will survive. We will survive. We will survive. We will survive.

1125
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:07,380
And we don't have to worry about costs overrunning our wonderful, wonderful revenue streams because

1126
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:14,940
you know we've got the flow now. We've got the actual, the momentum.

1127
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,480
Dr. Drummond, those are pretty fuzzy figures that you're projecting up on the screen there.

1128
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,940
Those aren't even numbers. Those are some kind of alien alphabet. What are we supposed to...

1129
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:29,180
Well you can read it though. If you can't read it then you didn't study your materials before the,

1130
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,400
the, the, the meeting here. I can read that.

1131
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,120
We had those materials that you were supposed to read and memorize, those tapes you were supposed to listen to and be able to regurgitate.

1132
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,820
I think Drummond's taken all the money and he squandered it.

1133
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:47,240
Well we bought tapes. We had to buy tapes. We needed new tape decks. We needed, our 8-track machine had broken down.

1134
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,780
We had our beta, our beta, our beta machines broken down.

1135
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,960
Mr. Drummond, we're talking about three or four billion dollars here.

1136
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,740
Yeah, what are, what are these, these vaults full of receipts from this?

1137
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,160
Billion here, a billion there. I mean to us it's all just money. The Korean massage parlor?

1138
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,360
Money. And that's the important thing to remember, that it's money.

1139
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,020
That money. Miss...

1140
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,460
And when we keep the money flowing, we keep it going...

1141
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,260
Pink Pussycat Club? What are these, what are these vaults full of receipts from...

1142
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,620
These are, these are investments we had to make. We go in to test the, test the culture, test the air, test the...

1143
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:18,500
We're doing personality bypass transplant treatments in those places.

1144
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:29,140
And we, even in Enron, we had to go to Enron and do some investigatory work long before the, the, the, the government auditors got in.

1145
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,540
Can you take that out?

1146
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,920
I don't know, he's, he's trying to, to, to...

1147
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:39,880
I'm not doing, don't look over here. There's no, pay no attention to the, to the hand behind the, the cloth there.

1148
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,400
It's like a giant invisible hand has been...

1149
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,960
Some people might call it a cloth, other people call it a cloth, but to us it's just a shroud.

1150
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,820
And we put the shroud on and wear it when we need to.

1151
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,500
Invisible hand that he's got.

1152
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:55,860
So I take it that there is no embarrassment among the subgenius...

1153
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,900
We invite...

1154
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,140
...that they, that they all arrived in limousines here.

1155
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,220
It's all for Poms tonight.

1156
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,660
Well, you don't want a stupid preacher, as the great...

1157
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,900
What about that limousine you, you wrote in?

1158
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,160
...brother Gene Scott said.

1159
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:06,860
Uh-huh.

1160
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:13,240
You know, when, when a person turns on their television and sees their preacher, he wants to see them in a limousine with these lovely...

1161
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,920
He wants to see them with...

1162
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,080
...choir girls on either arm and...

1163
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,720
...this beautiful Armani, this $600 Armani suit.

1164
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,080
Right. He don't want a stupid preacher.

1165
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,640
All the other preachers do this.

1166
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,280
Uh-huh. Amen.

1167
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,460
And, and we're...

1168
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:25,880
Uh-huh.

1169
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:26,880
Uh-huh.

1170
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,080
We're not doing anything different from...

1171
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,860
...from what any other religious leaders do.

1172
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,700
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1173
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:40,920
And, uh, in fact, uh, when, when, uh, when we had, we suffered those arrests for methamphetamine manufacture, that's a...

1174
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,900
...that's a, that's, that's the kind of thing that we get a special award for.

1175
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,180
In fact, we have a, a several boxes of awards for...

1176
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,240
...the various doctors here tonight.

1177
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,160
And don't forget, uh, without those Hummer limos, you couldn't have got here, cause there's no roads to sulfur Poms.

1178
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,640
There's no...

1179
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,140
Okay, I've just, uh, got an information.

1180
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,100
I've got an important message I have to take, uh...

1181
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,920
...the sulfur Poms.

1182
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:06,760
Uh, Reverend Stang, would you like to finish, or take over this business meeting at this point?

1183
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:06,940
No.

1184
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,900
I have to go out.

1185
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,180
Yeah, yeah, take up where he left off with the...

1186
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:10,900
There's a special, uh...

1187
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,340
...the corruption...

1188
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,340
...special tool I have to get. I'll, uh...

1189
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:13,840
...with some of these issues...

1190
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,160
I'm sorry for this interruption, but I'll be back shortly.

1191
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:16,800
...some of these stories...

1192
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,160
Yeah, he was dealing with the corruption...

1193
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,000
...some of these stories...

1194
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,580
...and the, uh, embezzlement at the top...

1195
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:21,840
...and the, uh, embezzlement at the top...

1196
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,460
...in the church.

1197
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:29,140
...in the church.

1198
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:37,900
Uh, we're up 370 percent, and that's mostly within the, uh, 18 to 25 group.

1199
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:38,280
Wow.

1200
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:38,720
That's good.

1201
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:38,980
That's good.

1202
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,220
Gonorrhea, syphilis, venerial herpes are up...

1203
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:42,240
The church level.

1204
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,740
...the venerous venereal herpes.

1205
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,360
...again, that's almost 400 percent, just in the last year.

1206
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:47,440
That means...

1207
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,040
That means the workshops were a success.

1208
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,300
...that those...

1209
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,340
That part of the outreach has been a tremendous success.

1210
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:59,120
The computer viruses and the organic viruses both, in every case, the syphilis is a success.

1211
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1212
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1213
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1214
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1215
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1216
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1217
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1218
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1219
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1220
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1221
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,120


1222
00:46:59,140 --> 00:46:59,420
...and you could say the syphilis was, ah, the thing that has been attainably effective

1223
00:46:59,420 --> 00:46:59,420


1224
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,040
who are sexually and, uh, DSL transmitted diseases.

1225

That was an understatement.

1240
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,720
That has gotta be the understatement of the year, what Dr. Creswell just said.

would be entertainment. I never thought I'd live to see the day. And you haven't.

1243
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:46,480
Um, depression or blue moods are up and um the manic phases are down. I've got a question. Oddly enough.

1244
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:57,400
I've got a question. Pardon me? Doctor staying? Yes, Senator. Yes. The little girl in the front row.

1245
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:07,040
Uh, yeah, uh, when your local church leaders are subject to accusations,

1246
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,560
what is your stance on how to handle that within your organization? When the collection plate

1247
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:22,960
comes around, double what you were going to put in otherwise, my friend. Good idea. There you go.

1248
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,560
That collection plate is the bottom line. That is what this business is about.

1249
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:33,260
This, you know when it comes down to it, that'll fix it. We can talk about our product placement

1250
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:42,200
and producing these movies that uh, uh, uh, uh, battle torn earth and so forth. But when it comes

1251
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:49,680
down to it, it's the collection plate passed from hand to hand or from from paw to paw as

1252
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,920
it may from hoof to hoof among the sub the the believers. And that that will fix up those problems

1253
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:06,120
that they have. Belief is the coin of the realm in this realm. What about the uh, emotions of the

1254
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,960
get along little bobbies. What about the uh, personalities and the emotions affected and

1255
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:18,700
involved in such incidences? Well, those are being stored uh, in in the finest blue canisters

1256
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:26,800
in the Dobstown basement as always. So uh, you would uh, disagree with the uh, Catholic stance

1257
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:33,540
of the realm. You would say that uh, people are expendable. People, yeah people sure, but this uh,

1258
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:41,880
people yeah sure people sure, but expendable. Yeah, people yeah people sure yeah people yeah.

1259
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:50,940
Expendable people. People yeah. Expendable emotions. Well, like we say the coin of the realm is belief.

1260
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:57,360
Spend your belief all over the floor, all over the office trash can.

1261
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:07,220
Just spend it, baby. Just let loose. Let her, let her rip. Bob don't care. Bob loves you anyway. Bob loves you!

1262
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,260
You are on the right track. Getting warmer.

1263
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,520
Hello? Pastor Dick? Is he there today? Tonight?

1264
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:23,480
No, Pastor Dick is not here tonight. This is the subgenius executive retreat.

1265
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,420
Oh no, heaven's not at hand.

1266
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,560
Oh no, heaven's not at hand.

1267
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:27,560


1268
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:27,560


1269
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:32,040
it's a completely different denomination okay my mind's all mixed up all right

1270
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:39,380

students

1277
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:33,040
studios allowed that and there are four more hours of that the over the edge show merged with

1278
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:39,880
the show that's more than an hour less than a show and in fact altogether it was five hours of show

1279
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,260
and now being strewn about the hour of slack

1280
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:49,680

1281
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,980

Microsoft do business

1283
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,240
instincts

1284
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,100
walters

1285
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,740
in haiti

1286
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,980
bangladesh

1287
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,100
Ted Silver Palms was, you might say, the 20-year reunion of the old-timey doctors.

1288
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,340
Dr. Philo Drummond, whose band Swingin' Love Corpses is heard in the background here.

1289
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,420
Lies.

1290
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,480
Gary Gabrog, Fran, Puzzling Evidence.

1291
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,720
And also Michael Pepe and Ed Holmes.

1292
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,920
All their sorry that Dr. Howling Glass Madness couldn't be there.

1293
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,260
And Jay Kinney.

1294
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:56,200
But anyway, here's a tape of that very gang of wacky Zenos down at the Gazebo from before the show in 1983.

1295
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:00,920
When it was just a band that dare not speak its name.

1296
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:05,800
Working on the book of the subgenius.

1297
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,580
The book? You want to know about the book?

1298
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,200
The book was a flop.

1299
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,240
The book?

1300
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,100
Nobody bought that book.

1301
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,820
They just sacked her.

1302
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,280
And when they did buy it, they tried to get their money back.

1303
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,380
A terminal disaster.

1304
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,860
Nobody made a single penny.

1305
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,360
Nobody.

1306
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,620
What did he say?

1307
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,140
The book?

1308
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:54,940
The book was a flop.

1309
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,440
The book was a flop.

1310
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,580
What's he talking about?

1311
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,780
The book?

1312
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,840
What about the song?

1313
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,840
The book was a flop.

1314
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,880
The book was a flop.

1315
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,840
It made the church stop.

1316
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,560
The book.

1317
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,980
Oh, the loud song, yeah.

1318
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,880
A thousand copies of posters of trash.

1319
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,960
30,000 copies and no one got cash.

1320
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,420
Warehouse.

1321
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,360
A warehouse full of books.

1322
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,840
Yeah, but the book.

1323
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,180
A warehouse full of books.

1324
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,740
A warehouse full of unwanted books.

1325
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,480
And that.

1326
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,560
The book.

1327
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,520
The book was a flop.

1328
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,560
Made the song stop.

1329
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,620
It made the song stop.

1330
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,660
Well, maybe not.

1331
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,440
.

1332
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,140
.

1333
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,600
Yes, even the book couldn't make the song stop.

1334
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,760
Well, it sure made the church stop.

1335
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,980
It made the distributor stop.

1336
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,640
Made the church stop.

1337
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,520
It made the post office and the secret service stop.

1338
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:39,940
.

1339
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,600
.

1340
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:42,600


1341
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,600
Make the song stop.

1342
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,560
Slow it down.

1343
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,760
Mess it up a little.

1344
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:15,020
The band that dare not speak its name from the old ancient 1983 subgenius type.

1345
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,900
Bad Doctors.

1346
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,720
Oh, bad, bad, bad.

1347
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:27,400
And there's so much more bad to be had at www.subgenius.com.

1348
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,000
That website will tell you about the living church.

1349
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:39,740
If it's money you want, we'll send that to post office box 2.

1350
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,280
Well, this is where you can write to the business office.

1351
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:52,640
Post office box 204206, Austin, Texas, 78720.

1352
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,200
I just got back from a trip to visit.

1353
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:07,060
The beautiful new Austin facilities, which are run by Jesus and his wife, his beautiful wife, Mary Magdalene.

1354
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,740
It was so great to see that busy operation down there.

1355
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:20,520
And friends, if you have tapes you want us to hear in subgenius land or CDs or whatever, send them to me.

1356
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:27,180
Yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang at box 181418.

1357
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:34,460
That's post office box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1358
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,460
44118.

1359
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:43,740
And I do have a cold, if you were wondering.

1360
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,620
The subgenius virus.

1361
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,220
I got it from my computer.

1362
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,300
Hey, friends, happy new last year.

1363
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,580
That's when I'm doing this show.

1364
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,580
And praise Bob.

1365
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,440
Oh, and now more of this.

1366
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:08,860
This broadcast is silly, tape-delayed stuff.

1367
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,460
I've been in the women's shoe business since 1875.

1368
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,180
In all those years of servicing customers, I found your feet.

1369
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,560
Unfortunately, we want to service you.

1370
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,140
That's very good.

1371
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,740
It's now out of control.

1372
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:23,860
We have a school bus.

1373
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,140
The trap is completely out of control.

1374
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,520
Out of control.

1375
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,580
And we have nothing.

1376
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,740
They're beginning to run into one another and over one another.

1377
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,500
How much Librax are you taking?

1378
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:37,820
67.

1379
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,440
I was wondering because it seems to me like some animals are after me.

1380
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,240
Do you look at that?

1381
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,360
Oh.

1382
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,540
I think you have to tell your doctors I'm a psychiatrist.

1383
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,360
It's likely that's why you're having the nightmares.

1384
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,360
And that's when the gem shepherds tripped over the curb.

1385
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,060
Every year, thousands of letter carriers.

1386
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,140
Are attacked by dogs.

1387
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,780
It's like that.

1388
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,060
Public service dogs.

1389
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,800
I want a mechanical man.

1390
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,300
No, they're just.

1391
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,500
Oh, mechanical man.

1392
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:04,780
That's it.

1393
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,360
Would you take the call?

1394
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:05,580
Yes.

1395
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:05,960
Thank you.

1396
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,420
I'm sorry, but you can't hear anymore.

1397
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,000
Perfect.

1398
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,080
I must see what this is.

1399
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:09,800
What's that?

1400
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,540
That doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever.
